            "abstract": "Oceanic lithosphere is altered and oxidized as it spreads, until it subducts and fluids and melts from the subducting plate contribute to the composition of arc and back-arc basalts. The oxidized nature of Mariana arc magmas is likely acquired through the transfer of oxidized species from the slab to the mantle wedge via aqueous fluids [1]. Despite its critical role in the relationship between material recycling at subduction zones and oxidation, it is unclear what percentage of the oxidized material is transported into the mantle wedge and output during volcanism and what percentage is transported past subduction zones, into the deep mantle. We present Fe3+/ΣFe ratios determined on bulk sediments and altered oceanic crust recovered from ODP Site 801 in the western Pacific in order to constrain the bulk oxidation state of the Pacific plate prior to subduction. We performed micro-colorimetric determinations of the Fe2+O contents of 9 sediment samples, 8 variably altered MORBs, 5 alteration products, and 8 mixed composite powders from the sediment and upper 500 m of altered oceanic crust at ODP Site 801. Site 801 sediments have Fe3+/ΣFe ratios >0.69 and the altered oceanic crust (801 Super Composite) has Fe3+/ΣFe=0.51. Bulk Fe3+/ΣFe ratios of altered oceanic crust at Site 801 increase from 0.16 (pristine MORB glass measured by XANES, [2]) to 0.78 with increasing extent of alteration. Using bulk Fe3+/ΣFe ratios determined here, and Fe redox information from [1] and [2], we calculated a mass balance of Fe3+ and O2 equivalent through the Mariana subduction zone. We subtracted the Fe3+ of pristine oceanic crust from that of altered oceanic crust to estimate the amount of Fe3+ taken up by oceanic crust during alteration on the seafloor. Comparing this value to the output of Fe3+ from Mariana arc and back-arc lavas, we find that 50-70% of the O2 equivalent added to the oceanic crust by alteration on the seafloor is not output by arc or back-arc magmas. If this oxygen is retained in the slab that subducts into the deep mantle, it may contribute to mantle redox heterogeneity.\n[1] Brounce, M.N., Kelley, K.A., and Cottrell, E. in revision.

            "abstract": "The utility of geologic frameworks for extrapolating hydraulic conductivities to length scales that are commensurate with hydraulic data has been assessed at the Nevada National Security Site in highly-faulted volcanic rocks. Observed drawdowns from eight, large-scale, aquifer tests on Pahute Mesa provided the necessary constraints to test assumed relations between hydraulic conductivity and interpretations of the geology. The investigated volume of rock encompassed about 40 cubic miles where drawdowns were detected more than 2 mi from pumping wells and traversed major fault structures.\nFive sets of hydraulic conductivities at about 500 pilot points were estimated by simultaneously interpreting all aquifer tests with a different geologic framework for each set. Each geologic framework was incorporated as prior information that assumed homogeneous hydraulic conductivities within each geologic unit. Complexity of the geologic frameworks ranged from an undifferentiated mass of rock with a single unit to 14 unique geologic units. Analysis of the model calibrations showed that a maximum of four geologic units could be differentiated where each was hydraulically unique as defined by the mean and standard deviation of log-hydraulic conductivity.\nConsistency of hydraulic property estimates within extents of investigation and effects of geologic frameworks on extrapolation were evaluated qualitatively with maps of transmissivity. Distributions of transmissivity were similar within the investigated extents regardless of geologic framework except for a transmissive streak along a fault in the Fault-Structure framework. Extrapolation was affected by underlying geologic frameworks where the variability of transmissivity increased as the number of units increased.",

            "abstract": "The eastern margin of Laurentia was deformed by the late-Proterozoic Grenville orogeny, which metamorphosed the original Archean-age cratonic crust and added extensive intrusive rocks. The Laurentian crust clearly extends as far east as the Laurentian Highlands, just north of the St. Laurence River, where Grenville-deformed rocks outcrop. Small outliers of Grenville-deformed rocks amongst west-thrust Paleozoic sediments, 20-50 km east of the Appalachian Front in southern Quebec, suggest that the Laurentian crust extends beneath the shallow thrust sheets of this region, too. On the other hand, Laurentia does not extend east of the Norumbega fault in coastal Maine, for the crust there is derived from the Avalon micro-continent. We search for the eastern edge of Laurentia within this ~250 km wide interval using relative arrival times of teleseismic P waves which ascend sub-vertically through the lithosphere beneath the region. These times are expected to be most sensitive to upper mantle compressional velocity and so to be able to discriminate the cratonic lithosphere on the basis of its faster than average speed. We use signal-correlation techniques to measured delay times for all broadband seismic stations in the region, including the QMIII array, which is especially designed to have high station density near the Appalachian Front. As expected, we observe central Quebec to have anomalously early times and coastal Maine to have anomalously late times, by as much as ±1s, when compared to the predictions of the global AK135 traveltime model. The boundary between the two arrival time regimes is sharp and is collinear with the Appalachian Front, to within the ± 25 km spatial resolution of our study. We hypothesize that it represents the eastern edge of the Laurentian cratonic lithosphere. Tomographic inversion of the data indicates a 0.2 km/s (2.4%) drop in compressional velocity of the shallow (90 km deep) mantle from west to east across the boundary. This is a strong jump in mantle properties, as either a 400 deg C increase in temperature or a 11 decrease in Mg# (or some other as yet unidentified source of heterogeneity) is needed to explain it. Future work will use teleseismic shear waves to further characterize the lithosphere across this boundary.",

It consists of 5 levels of danger displayed with a given number and colour and for each of them, behavioural advices are provided. Even though this is standardized in most of the countries affected by this natural hazard, the tools (usually websites or smartphone applications) with which the information is disseminated to the general pubic differs, particularly in terms of target audience and level of details. This study aims at gathering the perspectives of several communicators that are responsible for these communication practices. The survey was created to assess how and why choices were made in the design process of the communication tools and to determine how their effectiveness is evaluated. Along with a review of existing avalanche risk communication tools, this study provides guidelines for communication and the evaluation of its effectiveness.",

            "abstract": "The region around the Korean Peninsula appertains to an intraplate zone, where is under the compressional tectonic regime due to the compressional stress field induced from the collisions of the Eurasian plates with surrounding plates. In such an intraplate zone, the strike-slip faulting earthquakes are typically expected. However, unusual thrust faulting earthquakes occurred in the marginal zones of the East Sea (Sea of Japan) and normal faulting earthquakes occurred within the narrow zone around the central Yellow Sea. High seismicity of reverse faulting events is observed in the marginal zones of the East Sea, the southeast offshore zone of the Korean Peninsula and west offshore zone of the Japanese Islands. Such observation in the East Sea is interpreted to be the reverse activation of paleo-normal faults that were developed during the opening of the East Sea. On the other hand, the ENE-WSW directional normal faulting earthquakes are observed in an ENE-WSW directional narrow zone between the Shandong Peninsula and central Korean Peninsula across the Yellow Sea. The normal faulting zone is interpreted to be the northern margin of the collision belt in the Yellow Sea, which may be extended to the Korean Peninsula across the Yellow Sea.",

            "abstract": "Lithospheres of different age have distinctly different characteristics regarding their composition, thermal and density structure. Major differences exist between cratons and the Phanerozoic domains and mobile belts. We here investigate how the lateral transition from one lithospheric domain to another is reflected in the geophysical signatures, the seismic velocities, gravity, topography and geoid. We combine geophysical-petrological forward modeling with a comparison to worldwide occurrences of adjoining lithospheric domains.\nThree distinctly different mantle types (Archean, Proterozoic, Phanerozoic) are used to calculate the geophysical signatures of a range of possible lateral transition zones. The mantle types are characterized by their different elemental composition, from which stable mineral phases and bulk physical properties are derived. Usually, older SCLM (sub-lithospheric mantle) is more depleted in heavier minerals and thereby lighter, but this effect is mainly counterbalanced by the increased density caused by long-term thermal cooling. At the edges of cratons, changes in the thermal structure affect this balance. A range of models is tested for the effects of lateral variations in the crustal and SCLM structure (thickness, smoothness of thickness changes) and mantle compositions. Abrupt changes in composition and lithosphere thickness generally cause distinct topographic lows or ridges. In the real world, these may be offset by respective adjustments in Moho depth, crustal structure or sediment infill. Gradual variations in lithosphere thickness, however, only show minor geophysical signatures. A possible expression of adjoining lithospheric domains is the Scandinavian Mountain Belt in Norway at the edge of Proterozoic Baltica.\nAlthough many of the present-day topographic features are unlikely to have existed since the Precambrian, the evolution of the cratons (rejuvenation of the craton edges) may have assisted in shaping the present-day sedimentary basins and regional elevations.",

            "abstract": "Along the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta Burma Arc collision zone, the Indian plate is converging obliquely with the Burma arc with a shortening GPS rate of 14 mm/yr. In this region tectonics, huge sediment supply from the erosion of the Himalayas (>1 GT/yr) and relative sea level changes interact. The extremely thick sediments of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta and Fan (~20 km) are being gradually accreted into a very wide thrust-fold belt along this subduction/collision zone. This interaction has led to the formation of a fold-and-thrust belt and wide accretionary prism that is exposed on land and on the shelf of the Burma forearc. Sedimentary sequence and structure document the seismo-tectonic and sedimentary evolution of St Martin’s Island, which is an expression of an anticline in the outer part of the accretion forearc. During late Pleistocene sea-level low stands, the anticline and most of the rest of the shelf were exposed. The anticline ridge could then grow, receiving little erosion by local drainages. At some point during sea level rise, the coast advanced over the ridge and bevelled it. Then sea-level continued to rise and new sediment deposited forming an angular unconformity. A low-relief unconformity, in fact, separates the folded strata below from overlying strata of Holocene age. Where now exposed on the island above sea level, the unconformity is ~8000 y old. At that time, sea level was 30 m below the current level and thus rapid tectonic uplift is necessary to account for its current elevation. Dead coral heads of the species Porities that populate the coast were dated with U-Th (Mondal et al., 2013). They document a megathurst rupture and ~ 2m uplift that occurred during the Great Arakan earthquake in 1762 and further earthquakes are likely at ~ 1100 and 800 AD.\nStudies of the 1762 rupture suggest that the anticline rises during megathrust earthquakes (~2m) and subsides in the interseismic period (a few mm/yr; Steckler and Mondal 2014). Radiocarbon ages that are being obtained from marine fossils recovered from trenches in the southern and northern parts of the island will be coupled to coral uplift studies. They will permit us to better constrain the relation between erosion and sedimentation of the anticline, as well as its growth and subsidence during coseismic and interseismic periods.",

These excess pore pressures in turn can affect plate boundary fault location and strength, rates of sediment accretion or subduction, the taper angle of material on the overriding plate, and may also play a role in the generation of earthquakes and propagation of seismic slip. Offshore southern Alaska, rapid sedimentation and glacial loading are interpreted to have influenced the location of thrust faulting by rapid transport of sediment offshore, where previously active faults were deactivated by increased normal stresses as a result of sediment loading. The response of the wedge to external forcing is linked to permeability of the wedge sediments, as well as those in the underriding plate. We determined permeability of sediments from the glacial sediment dominated accretionary wedge, sampled at Sites U1420 and U1421 on the Yakutat Block, and sediments from the Surveyor Fan that overlies the Pacific Plate and are inputs to the Aleutian Trench, sampled at Sites U1417 and U1418. We found that the Surveyor Fan sediments have porosity-permeability relationships that are comparable to sediments from other reference sites worldwide. However, the sediments in the wedge have somewhat higher permeability, much larger grain sizes, and are much less compressible compared with other wedge sediments. This suggests that the physical properties that control overpressure generation and dissipation in the input sediments to the Aleutian Trench are comparable to other subduction zones, but that the accretionary wedge on the Yakutat Block is uniquely strong and well-drained due to the predominance of glacigenic sediments.",

            "abstract": "The influence of rainfall on the occurrence of landslides depends on many factors such as landslide dimensions, kinematics or material involved. It is widely recognized that shallow landslides are usually triggered by short intense storms. Nuevo Leon state located in northeast Mexico is highly prone to the occurrence of this kind of slope failures due to its geologic, geomorphologic, climatic attributes and location, being targeted by tropical cyclones during the Atlantic hurricane season. A database of rainfall events that have resulted in shallow landslides on the region was compiled; the data indicated that there is a coincidence between the occurrence of shallow landslides and extreme rainfall events. A threshold curve in the form of I= αD-β was established to describe the threshold in where I is the rainfall intensity by rainfall event in mm/day and D is the duration of rainfall event in days. Duration of the rainfall events that triggered shallow landslides ranged from 2 to 5 days, with maximum intensity of 236 mm/day and a minimum intensity of 57.7 mm/day. From the data analyzed we could obtain a regression value of I = 109.77D-1.76 and established a new minimum rainfall intensity-duration threshold for the initiation of rainfall-induced shallow landslides that can be used for the development of a early warning system in Nuevo Leon, Mexico",

            "abstract": "Reactive zero-valent iron is currently being used for remediation of contaminated groundwater. Permeable reactive barriers are the current state-of-the-practice method for using zero-valent iron. Instead of an excavated trench filled with granular zero-valent iron, a relatively new and promising method is the injection of a nano-scale zero-valent iron colloid suspension (nZVI) into the subsurface using injection wells. One goal of nZVI injection can be to deposit zero valent iron in the aquifer and form a reactive permeable zone which is no longer bound to limited depths and plume treatment, but can also be used directly at the source. It is very important to have a good understanding of the transport behavior of nZVI during injection as well as the fate of nZVI after injection due to changes in the flow regime or water chemistry changes.\nSo far transport was mainly tested using commercially available nZVI, however these studies suggest that further work is required as commercial nZVI was prone to aggregation, resulting in low physical stability of the suspension and very short travel distances in the subsurface. In the presented work, nZVI is stabilized during synthesis to significantly increase the physical suspension stability. To improve our understanding of nZVI transport, the feasibility for injection into various porous media materials and controlled deposition, a suite of column experiments are conducted. The column experiments are performed using a long 1.5m column and a novel nZVI measuring technique. The measuring technique was developed to non-destructively determine the concentration of nano-scale iron during the injection. It records the magnetic susceptibility, which makes it possible to get transient nZVI retention profiles along the column. These transient nZVI retention profiles of long columns provide unique insights in the transport behavior of nZVI which cannot be obtained using short columns or effluent breakthrough curves.",

            "abstract": "In eddy resolving simulations we test a mixed layer mesoscale parameterization, developed recently by Canuto and Dubovikov (2011). The parameterization yields the horizontal and vertical mesoscale fluxes in terms of coarse-resolution fields and eddy kinetic energy. An expression for the later in terms of mean fields has been found too to get a closed parameterization in terms of the mean fields only. In 40 numerical experiments we simulated the two types of flows: idealized flows driven by baroclinic instabilities only, and more realistic flows, driven by wind and surface fluxes as well as by inflow-outflow in shallow and narrow straits. The diagnosed quasi-instantaneous horizontal and vertical mesoscale buoyancy fluxes (averaged over 1o - 2o and 10 days) demonstrate a strong scatter typical for turbulent flows, however, the fluxes are highly correlated with the parameterization. After averaged over 3-4 months, diffusivities diagnosed from the eddy resolving simulations, are quite consistent with the parameterization for a broad range of parameters. Diagnosed vertical mesoscale fluxes restratify mixed layer and are in a good agreement with the parameterization unless vertical turbulent mixing in the upper layer becomes strong enough to compare with mesoscale advection. In the later case, numerical simulations demonstrate that the deviation of the fluxes from the parameterization is controlled by the dimensionless parameter γ, estimating the ratio of vertical diffusion term to a mesoscale advection. The empirical dependence of vertical flux on γ is found. An analysis using a modified omega-equation reveals that the effects of the vertical mixing of vorticity is responsible for the two-three fold amplification of vertical mesoscale flux. Possible physical mechanisms, responsible for the amplification of vertical mesoscale flux are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Observations show that CMEs can deflect from a purely radial trajectory yet no consensus exists as to the cause of these deflections. The majority of the deflection motion occurs in the corona at distances where the magnetic energy dominates. Accordingly, many theories attribute the CME deflection to magnetic forces. In Kay et al. (2013) we presented ForeCAT, a model for CME deflections based on the magnetic forces (magnetic tension and magnetic pressure gradients). Kay et al. (2014) introduced an improved three-dimensional version of ForeCAT. Here we study the 2008 December 12 CME which occurred during solar minimum of Solar Cycle 24 (Byrne et al 2010, Gui et al. 2011, Liu et al 2010a,b). This CME erupted from high latitudes, and, despite the weak background magnetic field, deflected to the ecliptic, impacting Earth. From the observations, we are able to constrain all of the ForeCAT input parameters except for the CME mass and the drag coefficient that affects the CME motion. The reduced chi-square best fit to the observations constrains the CME mass range to 3e14 to 7e14 g and the drag coefficient range to 1.9 to 2.4. We explore the effects of a different magnetic background which decreases less rapidly than our standard Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model, as type II radio bursts suggest that the PFSS magnetic field decays too rapidly above active regions. For the case of the filament eruption of 2008 December 12 we find that the quiet sun coronal magnetic field should behave similar to the PFSS model. Finally, we present our current work exploring the case of the 2008 April 9 CME.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes the algorithm to retrieve Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from data acquired by the Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation Cloud and Aerosol Imager (TANSO-CAI), onboard Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT). TANSO-CAI has four spectral bands, namely, 0.380μm (Band 1), 0.674μm (Band 2), 0.870μm (Band 3), and 1.60μm (Band 4). Its measurements at the near-ultraviolet band (0.380μm) at 0.5 km resolution make it ideal for retrieving AOD and monitoring surface PM air quality over urban regions because surface reflectance generally is much lower in UV than in the visible.\nThe AOD retrieval algorithm is based on a look up table method in which the reflectance at the top of atmosphere is computed from UNL-VRTM (UNified Linearized Vector Radiative Transfer Model) as a function of surface reflectance, aerosol scattering properties, and Sun-Satellite-Earth geometries. Surface reflectance at 380 nm with high spatial resolution is derived from the climatology based on the MODIS 16 days of BRDF parameters dataset (MCD43A1) and extrapolation. The retrieval is evaluated with MODIS and AERONET AOD. Comparison of our retrieved AOD and surface PM2.5 indicate the high potential of using TANSO-CAI for air quality applications.",

            "abstract": "Reflecting the recent globalization trend in world commodity market, several major production countries are producing large amount of staple crops, especially, maize and soybean. Thus, simultaneous crop failure (abrupt reduction in crop yield, lean year) due to extreme weather and/or climate change could lead to unstable food supply. This study try to examine the synchronicity in yield variations of staple crops at global scale.\nWe use a gridded crop yields database, which includes the historical year-to-year changes in staple crop yields with a spatial resolution of 1.125 degree in latitude/longitude during a period of 1982-2006 (Iizumi et al. 2013). It has been constructed based on the agriculture statistics issued by local administrative bureaus in each country. For the regions being lack of data, an interpolation was conducted to obtain the values referring to the NPP estimates from satellite data as well as FAO country yield.\nFor each time series of the target crop yield, we firstly applied a local kernel regression to represent the long-term trend component. Next, the deviations of yearly yield from the long-term trend component were defined as ΔY(i, y) in year y at grid i. Then, the correlation of deviation between grids i and j in year y is defined as Cij(y) = ΔY(i, y) ΔY(j, y). In addition, Pij = <ΔY(i, y) ΔY(j, y)> represents the time-averaged correlation of deviation between grids i and j. Bracket <...> means the time average operation over 25 years (1982-2006).\nAs the results, figures show the time changes in the number of grid pairs, in which both the deviation are negative. It represent the time changes in ratio of the grid pairs where both crop yields synchronically decreased to the total grid pairs. The years denoted by arrows in the figures indicate the case that all the ratios of three country pairs (i.e. China-USA, USA-Brazil and Brazil-China) are relatively larger (>0.6 for soybean and >0.5 for maize). This suggests that the reductions in crop yield occurred synchronically in three countries in these years, which are the simultaneous lean years (as of lower yield compared to that of long-term trend).",

            "abstract": "The determination of precise gravity field parameters is of great importance in a period in which earth sciences are achieving the necessary accuracy to monitor and document global change processes. This is the reason why experts from geodesy and metrology joined in a successful cooperation to make absolute gravity observations traceable to SI quantities, to improve the metrological kilogram definition and to monitor mass movements and smallest height changes for geodetic and geophysical applications.\nHow can we determine such a gravity reference system and secure it over multiple decades? Precise knowledge of the gravity acceleration and definition of standards, models and corrections are an important prerequisite to the definition of the gravity system. Over more than three decades, the absolute gravity community cooperated successfully to obtain the gravity reference in comparisons at intervals of 4 years and to certify metrological equivalence between National Metrology Institutes.\nWith increasing resolution of the absolute gravimeter sensors and new measurement principles it becomes obvious that such comparisons are not sufficient for all applications. Mainly for geodetic purposes it is necessary to sub-divide comparison intervals and maintain a connected network of gravity reference sites where compared absolute gravimeters operate together with superconducting gravimeters to derive a continuous gravity reference function.\nBy means of this distributed monitoring of the gravity reference it will also be possible to relate observations of earlier absolute gravimeters to the present-day and to future instruments. It will be possible to include new sensors like atom interferometers and in future to relate the results of precise optical clocks. With co-located space geodetic sensors like GNSS, SLR and VLBI, these reference sites fulfill the conditions of a geodetic fundamental station as a component of IAG’s Global Geodetic Observing System.",

In 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency characterized water-quality stressors—contaminants, nutrients, and sediment—and ecological conditions in 100 streams across the Midwestern U.S. Water samples were collected weekly from May through July and sediment and ecology were sampled once near the end of the water-sampling period. Water samples were analyzed for about 240 pesticides and pesticide degradates and sediment samples were analyzed for about 120 pesticides and degradates. The spatial and temporal distribution of detected compounds and the pesticide toxicity index (PTI) of compound mixtures indicate important differences in pesticide occurrence between agricultural and urban settings.

Yet despite its importance for regional and global climate, the Holocene history of the AMOC is poorly constrained. Improving our knowledge of past AMOC variability will contribute to our general understanding of the dynamics of ocean circulation and the role it may play in causing or amplifying climate variability on millennial timescales.\nWe present Holocene grain-size records in depth transects from Blake Outer Ridge and Cape Hatteras, sampling the full-depth range of the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC), the lower limb of the AMOC. These records will complement a depth-transect of grain-size records sampling the Iceland-Scotland (I-S) overflow, showing Holocene variations that reflect deglacial meltwater forcing in the early Holocene and insolation-forced trends from the middle-to-late Holocene (Thornalley et al., 2013, Climate of the Past). We will also present detailed grain-size records for the last 2,000 years, both in a depth transect of cores off Cape Hatteras, and from cores in the Iceland Basin, sampling the I-S overflow. Our extensive datasets enable us to provide a coherent synthesis of changes in the flow strength of key components of the AMOC on centennial-millennial and orbital timescales, which we can use to develop our understanding of past millennial-scale climate variability.\nSpecific questions to be addressed include: How well coupled are Holocene trends in Iceland-Scotland overflow and the DWBC? How did I-S overflow and the AMOC vary during the last millennia, including the last ~150 years since the end of the Little Ice Age? Initial results suggest a long-term anti-phasing of the Nordic overflows, wherein mid-late Holocene weakening of the I-S overflow has been compensated for by a strengthening of Denmark Strait overflow. We will also report on pronounced centennial-millennial scale reductions in the inferred flow strength at sites bathed by Labrador Sea Water (LSW) which coincide with well-known climate events such as the Little Ice Age, suggesting an important role for LSW in Holocene centennial-millennial climate variability.",

A recent activity is the ‘Cropland Capture’ game which can be played in a browser or mobile device. It can be downloaded or played online at http://www.geo-wiki.org/games/croplandcapture/. In the game, players see an image (from a satellite or ground-based camera) and are asked if they see any cropland in it. They can answer “yes”, “no” or “maybe” if they are unsure. The game had over 3,000 players who made about 4,500,000 classifications on 190,000 unique images.\nThe benefits delivered by crowdsourcing relative to conventional data acquisition depends critically on the quality of the data received. Players’ rating quality was compared by assessing their agreement with the crowd, consistency on images rated more than once, and agreement with expert validators. These metrics were compared with one another and with potential predictors of user quality: the total number of images rated by a player, and their professional background in land-cover science.\nIndividual users’ agreement with the crowd and self-agreement were highly positively correlated. The frequency of admitting uncertainty about an image was a good measure of user caution, showing a negative relationship with self-contradiction rate. Many users were more reliable in either identifying cropland or non-cropland, and these two skills were uncorrelated. Overall, user reliability increased with number of images rated, although among the top decile of users, this trend was reversed. Surprisingly, professional background had little influence on quality of ratings. We explore implications of these results for assessing potential benefits of user contributed data in the context of differential user quality and compare this with conventional data collection methods.",

            "abstract": "Coupling C-Band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to a multilayer snow model is a step in better understanding the temporal evolution of the radar backscattering coefficient during snowmelt. The watershed used for this study is the Nechako River Basin, located in the Rocky Mountains of British-Columbia (Canada). This basin has a snowpack of several meters in depth and part of its water is diverted to the Kemano hydropower system, managed by Rio-Tinto Alcan. Eighteen RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR Wide archive images were acquired in VV/VH polarization for the winter of 2011-2012, under different snow conditions. They are interpreted along with CROCUS, a multilayer physically-based snow model developed by Météo-France. This model discretizes the snowpack into 50 layers, which makes it possible to monitor various characteristics, such as liquid water content (LWC), throughout the season. CROCUS is used to model three specific locations of the Nechako River Basin. Results vary from one site to another, but in general there is a good agreement between the modeled LWC of the first layer of the snowpack and the backscattering coefficient of the RADARSAT-2 images, with a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.80 and more. The radar images themselves were processed using an updated version of Nagler’s methodology, which consists of subtracting an image in wet snow conditions to one in dry snow conditions, as wet snow can then be identified using a soft threshold centered around -3 dB. A second filter was used in order to differentiate dry snow and bare soil. That filter combines a VH/VV ratio threshold and an altitude criterion. The ensuing maps show a good agreement with the MODIS snow-covered area, which is already obtained daily over the Nechako River Basin, but with additional information on the location of wet snow and without sensibility to cloud cover. As a next step, the outputs of CROCUS will be used in Mätzler’s Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) to simulate the backscattering coefficient at different locations in the basin.",

            "abstract": "Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of upwelling to downwelling radiative flux. It’s important for understanding the global energy budget. Remote sensing albedo products provide global time continuous coverage to help capture global energy variability and change. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi-NPP satellite, launched on October 28, 2011, is aiming to provide continues data record with the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which has been providing Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/Albedo product since 2000. By utilizing the same approach that was used for the most recently V006 daily MODIS BRDF/Albedo product, VIIRS has the ability to keep providing products for research and operational users. Validating albedo product of VIIRS using in situmeasured albedo can assure the quality for land surface climate and biosphere models, and comparing with MODIS product can assure time continues of BRDF/albedo product.\nThe daily BRDF/Albedo product still uses 16-day period multispectral, cloud-cleared, atmospherically-corrected surface reflectances to fit the Ross-Thick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal semi-empirical BRDF model. But the multiday observations are also weighted based on proximity to the production date in order to emphasis on that individual day.\nSurface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) was established in 1993 through the support of NOAA's Office of Global Programs. In situ albedo was driven from downwelling and upwelling radiative flux measured from the towers. Fraction of diffuse sky light was calculated using the direct and diffuse solar recorded in the data. It was further used to translate VIIRS, MODIS black sky and white sky albedos into actual albedo at local solar noon.\nResults show that VIIRS, MODIS and in situ albedo agree well at SURFARD spatially representative sites. While the VIIRS surface reflectance, snow, and cloud algorithms are still undergoing revision, the result shows that VIIRS can provide comparable albedo products with MODIS. The accuracy of both products can meet the requirement for climate and biosphere models. In situ albedo also can be gained from Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), FLUXNET and Long Term Ecological Research network (LTER) etc., which will be used in future validation work.",

            "abstract": "During the early evolution of terrestrial bodies, a large amount of mantle melting is expected to affect significantly the energy budget of the interior through heat transport by volcanism. Partial melt, generated when the mantle temperature exceeds the solidus, can propagate to the surface through dikes, thereby advecting upwards a large amount of heat. This so-called heat-pipe mechanism is an effective way to transport thermal energy from the melt-region to the planetary surface. Indeed, recent studies suggest that this mechanism may have shaped the Earth’s earliest evolution by controlling interior heat loss until the onset of plate tectonics [1]. Furthermore, heat-piping is likely the primary mechanism through which Jupiter’s moon Io loses its tidally generated heat, leading to massive volcanism able to cause a present-day heat-flux about 40 times higher than the Earth's average heat-flux. However, despite its obvious importance, heat-piping is often neglected in mantle convection models of terrestrial planets because of its additional complexity and vaguely defined parameterization.\nIn this study, adopting the approach of [1] we model mantle convection in a generic stagnant lid planet and study heat-piping effects in a systematic way. Assuming that melt is instantaneously extracted to the surface and melting regions are refilled by downward advection of cold mantle material in order to ensure mass conservation, we investigate the influence of heat-pipes on the mantle temperature and stagnant lid thickness using the numerical code Gaia [2]. To this end, we run a large set of simulations in 2D Cartesian geometry spanning a wide parameter space. Our results are consistent with [1] and show that in systems with strongly temperature-dependent viscosity the heat-pipe mechanism sets in at a Rayleigh number Ra ~ 2x107. Upon increasing Ra up to ~6x107, we observe a systematic decrease of the average mantle temperature accompanied by an increase of the lid thickness compared to cases where heat piping effects are neglected (Fig. 1). By increasing further the Rayleigh number, the effect levels off, eventually leading to an average mantle temperature ~10% smaller and a stagnant lid almost twice as thick.\n[1] Moore & Webb, Nature, 2013; [2] Hüttig et al., PEPI, 2013\nFig.1 Non-dimensional lid thickness as function of Ra",

In particular, the Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) instrument onboard AIM obtains large-field PMC images enabling a unique investigation of the mesospheric gravity waves, as the satellite traverses over the summer polar regions. The high quality of CIPS data has provided an exceptional capability to investigate the gravity wave signatures in the summer polar mesosphere where previous measurements have been sparse. We have utilized 12 consecutive seasons of AIM/CIPS PMC albedo data to derive the statistical properties of a broad spectrum of gravity waves present in the PMC data. Over 60,000 waves with horizontal scale sizes ranging from ~50 to >2000 km were identified and measured, revealing a well-developed, consistent distribution for their horizontal wavelengths with a peak in occurrence frequency centered around 400 km. The same result was found from season to season and in both hemispheres. Throughout this study, the wave activity in the southern hemisphere was found to be 10-15% higher than in the northern hemisphere and both northern and southern wave activity was found to decrease systematically (average ~15%) during the course of each summer season. We present new results of the intra-seasonal, inter-annual and hemispheric variability of these waves observed over the whole summer polar cap regions. The systematic decrease in wave activity is consistent with background wind filtering in the northern hemisphere but is not apparently associated with the critical level filtering in the southern hemisphere.",

B.USOC is the Facility Responsible Centre (FRC) for the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) payload and also manages the Scientific Mission Centre of the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) PICARD satellite that monitors solar activity, among various other space missions. In this respect, B.USOC is ideally positioned to manage possible synergies between ASIM, the satellite TARANIS (Tool for the Analysis of RAdiation from lightNIng and Sprites), other space missions and ground-based networks.\nThe ASIM mission (Neubert, 2009) consists of a package of two nadir instruments: one for the visible spectrum and another for X-ray and gamma-ray frequencies. In the normal operating mode “trigger mode” both instruments continuously measure, but, do not record data below certain thresholds. Another mode is a “timed mode”, where, during a certain time the observations are recorded even in the absence of triggers.\nThe “timed mode” demands a lot of flexibility from both scientific teams and B.USOC, as, ASIM’s main targets of investigation (sprites and elves) are related to intense thunderstorms and thus, require reliable meteorological forecasts in the entire range of ISS latitudes. Moreover, ASIM is sensitive to a large number of phenomena of which most have a direct relationship with solar activity and therefore would probably need support from the ESA SSA (Space Situational Awareness) Space Weather Coordination Centre (SSCC) that shares the same campus with B.USOC. Local cooperation between the two centres, together with other space payloads such as TARANIS and ground-based networks will greatly optimize ASIM payload operations as well as scientific return.\nNeubert, T., and the ASIM Team, ASIM – an Instrument Suite for the International Space Station, Corte Workshop 2008, Coupling of Thunderstorms and Lightning Discharges to Near-Earth, Corsica, 2008, edited by N.

Oceanographic conditions related to water temperature and nutrient distribution strongly influence natural concentration of fish stocks and can be identified as oceanic upwelling fronts using information about Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll Concentration (CHL) obtained from satellite data.\nIn this context, the present work illustrates a satellite-based near-real time fishery forecasting system tuned for the Adriatic Sea in order to help fishermen in saving fuel and ship time. More specifically, we developed an innovative multi-mission, multi-sensor and multi-temporal data fusion technique for the automatic identification of the upwelling fronts from the geometry of the distribution of the SST and CHL and of their gradients, using observations from the ocean color MODIS sensors of Terra and Aqua NASA satellites in conjunction with appropriate data from the VIIRS sensor on the Suomi/NPP satellite.\nTo this aim, precision geo-referencing and masking procedures were used to allow automatic selection of good quality pixels. A time stack of the final maps has been obtained as three-day running average with one-day step, taking into account the average local duration of the upwelling fronts. Finally, a gradient-based edge detection algorithm using the Canny filter has been applied to each of the three-day composite maps, based on the distribution of the SST and CHL and of their gradients, for the determination of the fronts as potential fishing zones.\nThe procedure is being validated using the geographic information of categorized fish Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) of the 2013 fishing campaigns of the FEDERPESCA fleet, as part of the project \"Sustainable Fishery\", funded by Apulia Region, in Southern Italy (FEP 2007-2013 – Measure 3.1 ), for the development of a satellite-based near-real time fishery forecasting system to be used in the Adriatic Sea.\nThe results of this study will be presented and commented.

            "abstract": "Active extension in the central Apennines is accommodated on numerous 20-30km long normal faults. Over multiple earthquake cycles fault slip is controlled by viscous flow in narrow shear zones, which are below the brittle seismogenic crust and are driven by upwelling mantle beneath the central Apennines. However, on short timescales, there is evidence for clustering along strike on the north eastern set of faults in the region, with the south western faults comparatively quiet during the period of reliable historical earthquake records (since 1349 AD). In contrast, 15±3ka strain rates show no evidence of skewness towards the north eastern faults. This suggests that on short timescales, elastic loading and fault interaction may be controlling the location of earthquakes and the seismic hazard, as opposed to the view that fault activity has permanently migrated from the south west flank of the central Apennines to the north east flank. We used Coulomb stress modelling to test whether the sequence of historical earthquakes can be explained by stress triggering and elastic loading.\nPalaeoseismic and historical records were used to reconstruct the co-seismic static Coulomb stress changes for 27 earthquakes in central Italy from 1349-2009. 15±3ka throws measured across faults in the area were used as an analogue for the slip distributions, with the slip direction constrained by field measurements of frictional wear striae on exposed bedrock fault scarps. Interseismic loading was modelled using a shear zone rheology below the seismogenic zone of each fault; slip rates measured at the surface were used to control the rate of loading. The sensitivity of the model was explored by iterating varying slip distributions, fault kinematics and earthquake locations.\nWe show that for sequences of clustered earthquakes that occurred on timescales of days to weeks, co-seismic static Coulomb stress transfer can explain the pattern of faulting with stress changes of 0.001-0.1 MPa transferred onto faults preceding rupture. Over hundreds of years, the relationship between long-term stress loading and earthquake occurrence is less clear and highlights the need for a greater understanding of the time elapsed since the last earthquake on active faults in the central Apennines, so as to constrain the earthquake cycle on all faults in the area.",

            "abstract": "During the last decades, several rifting events on land have been observed along divergent plate boundaries, separating plates up to several meters in a few weeks. These events are typically accompanied by short-term seismic swarms (<15 days) and normal faulting, and are in some cases followed by eruptions as well. These on land rifting events represent, however, a very limited portion (< 2%) of global intrusions that take place in most cases along mid-ocean ridge systems. Here we focus on the southern Red Sea area, which is a part of the triple junction separating the Nubian, Somalian and Arabian plates where several earthquake swarms were recorded from 2000 to 2014. In three cases, these swarms were followed by eruptions within a year, at Jebel at Tair (2007) and in the Zubair Archipelago (40 km south) were two new volcanic islands developed in 2011 and 2013. Without the surface eruptions, these intrusive events may have remained unnoticed. Together the surface evidence of volcanic activity and recorded seismic swarms during the past two decades allow for a better definition of the overall magmatic activity in the southern Red Sea. We further discuss the possibility that Zubair, which is an emerged portion of a shallow 20 km-long by 5 km-wide NNW-SSE oriented platform, may be the surface expression of an active spreading center, comparable in size with other on land spreading centers. The recent concentration of activity at Zubair developed in a context of high regional magmatic and tectonic activity, including the rifting episode at Dabbahu (2005-2011), the rifting event in the Gulf of Aden (2010-2011) and the 2011 Nabro volcano eruption. Preliminary analysis of regional structural features and volcano lineaments suggest distinct intrusion paths and faulting running parallel to the three main active rift zone axes, and also along a dominant NE-SW oriented preexisting regional fault zones affecting the entire triple junction area.",

            "abstract": "The drainage pattern in Amazonia was expressively modified during the mountain building of central and northern Andes. In Early Miocene, the fluvial systems in western Amazonia flowed to the foreland basins and northward to the Caribbean. By Late Miocene the drainage reversal occurred and formed the transcontinental Amazon River, connecting the Andes and the equatorial Atlantic margin. This event is recorded in the stratigraphic evolution of the Foz do Amazonas Basin by the onset of Andean-derived sedimentation. Additionally, an abrupt increase in sedimentation rate after the reversal occurred in the Foz do Amazonas Basin. Based on three-dimensional numerical models that couple surface processes, flexural isostasy and crustal thickening due to orogeny, I concluded that the Miocene drainage reversal can be explained by the flexural and surface processes response to the Andes formation with no need to invoke dynamic topography induced by mantle convection, as previously proposed. I observed that the instant of drainage reversal is directly linked to the rate of crustal thickening in the orogeny, the rate of erosion and, mainly, the efficiency of sediment transport. Moreover, the numerical experiments were able to predict the increase in sedimentation rate in the Amazon fan after the drainage reversal of the Amazon River as observed in the Late Miocene-Pliocene sedimentary record. However, the present numerical model fails to fully reproduce the evolution of the Pebas system, a megawetland in western Amazonia that preceded the drainage reversal. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to evaluate the mechanisms that generated and sustained the Pebas system.",

            "abstract": "A three-dimensional coupled physical-biogeochemical model was used to simulate and examine temporal and spatial variability of surface pCO2 in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). The model is driven by realistic atmospheric forcing, open boundary conditions from a data-assimilative global ocean circulation model, and observed freshwater and terrestrial nutrient and carbon input from major rivers. A seven-year model hindcast (2004–2010) was performed and was validated against in situ measurements. The model revealed clear seasonality in surface pCO2. Based on the multi-year mean of the model results, the GoM is an overall CO2 sink with a flux of 1.34 × 1012 mol C yr-1, which, together with the enormous fluvial carbon input, is balanced by the carbon export through the Loop Current. A sensitivity experiment was performed where all biological sources and sinks of carbon were disabled. In this simulation surface pCO2 was elevated by ~70 ppm, providing the evidence that biological uptake is a primary driver for the observed CO2 sink. The model also provided insights about factors influencing the spatial distribution of surface pCO2 and sources of uncertainty in the carbon budget. ",

Current geodetic technologies, such as GPS, InSAR, borehole and laser strainmeters, are costly and limited in their temporal or spatial resolution. Here we present a new type of strainmeter based on coaxial cable Bragg grating (CCBG) sensing technology that provides high-precision, distributed strain measurements at a moderate cost. The coaxial-cable-based strainmeter is designed to cover a long distance (~ km) under harsh environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures. To minimize the environmental noises, two CCBGs are introduced into the geodetic strainmeter: one is used to measure the strain applied on it, and the other acts as a reference only to detect the environmental noises. The environmental noises are removed using the inputs from the strained CCBG and the reference CCBG in a frequency mixer. The test results show that the geodetic strainmeter with dual CCBGs has micron-strain accuracy in the lab.",

            "abstract": "New hydrologists should not only develop a well-defined knowledgebase of basic hydrological concepts, but also synthesize this factual learning with more authentic ‘real-world’ knowledge gained from the interpretation and analysis of data from hydrological models (Merwade and Ruddell, 2012, Wagener et al., 2007). However, hydrological instruction is often implemented using a traditional teacher-centered approach (e.g., lectures) (Wagener, 2007). The emergence of rich and dynamic computer simulation techniques which allow students the opportunity for more authentic application of knowledge (Merwade & Ruddell, 2012). This study evaluates the efficacy of using such data-driven simulations to increase the understanding of the field of hydrology in the lower-division undergraduate geoscience classroom.\nIn this study, 88 students at a local community college who were enrolled in an Introductory Earth Science class were evaluated on their learning performance in a unit on applying the Rational Method to estimate hydrographs and flooding for urban areas. Students were either presented with a data and visualization rich computer module (n=52), or with paper and pencil calculation activities (n=36). All conceptual material presented in lecture was consistent across these two conditions. Students were evaluated for not only changes in their knowledge and application of the concepts within the unit (e.g., effects of urbanization and impervious cover, discharge rates), but also for their broad “T-shaped” profile of professional knowledge and skills. While results showed significant (p<.05) increases from pre to post assessments in all learning areas for both groups, there is a significantly larger benefit for the data module group when it came to (1) understanding the effects of urbanization and impervious cover on flooding, (2) applying consistent vocabulary appropriately within context, and (3) explaining the roles and responsibilities of hydrologists and flood managers.",

            "abstract": "The distribution of monsoon rainfall has a large variability and therefore it is always a challenging task for the Himalayan region. The Central Himalayan region which covers Uttarakhand state is a hot spot in the global climate system in terms of its unique geographical features. Thus the study of spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall in the central Himalaya has great relevance for the planning of policy formulation especially in the context of global warming. However, very little is known about the details of weather and climatic variability over this region. At the same time, conclusions derived over other locations may not be applicable over the Himalayan region. Thus information about the long term climate is important to understand the nature of different climatic systems over any region.\nIn the present study, spatial trend of rainfall over Uttarakhand region is analysed using the multi-source data . Firstly from NCEP reanalysis, it is found that the region receives rain of 4 mm/day over the Uttarakhand region during annual and monsoon season. In order to see the rainfall variability at small scale, the very high resolution data from APHRODITE and IMD data are being used, and this analysis shows a clear variation at spatial scale with in the region. It is observed that highest rainfall with value up to 14mm/day in east part of Uttarakhand. If we analyse the spatial pattern of linear trend (expressed as % of respective SD) of annual and monsoon rainfall from 1951 to 2003, there is increasing trend in annual rainfall in east and north part of the Uttarakhand. Middle part is showing decreasing trend in annual and monsoon rainfall.\nComparison of 24-year (1980-2003) daily climatology of the seasonal (June-September) cycles of monsoon rainfall averaged over whole Uttarakhand from ensemble of two observations (i.e. IMD gridded and APHRODITE) and ensemble of simulation using a variable resolution GCM has been carried out. The analysis shows that the daily rainfall climatology is well captured by the ensemble simulation throughout the monsoon season. But in last 15 days of monsoon season the simulated rainfall is higher than the observed rainfall climatology. Over the season as whole the observed and simulated rainfall over the Uttarakhand region are strongly correlated (CC=0.43) at 99% confidence level.",

            "abstract": "As the largest rocky layer in the Earth, the lower mantle plays a critical role in controlling convective patterns in our planet. Current mineralogical mantle models suggest that the lower mantle is dominated by (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite (SiPv; about 70 – 90% in volume fraction) and (Mg,Fe)O ferropericlase (Fp). Knowledge of rheological properties of the major constituent minerals and stress/strain partitioning among these phases during deformation is critical in understanding dynamic processes of the deep Earth.\nFor the lower mantle, the strength contrast between SiPv and Fp has been estimated [1], the former being much stronger than the latter. However fundamental issues of stress-strain interactions among the major phases still remain to be properly addressed. Here we examine rheological properties of a two-phase polycrystal consisting of CaGeO3 perovskite (GePv) and MgO, deformed in the D-DIA at controlled speed ~1 – 3×10-5 s-1 at high pressures and temperatures (between 3 to 10 GPa and 300 to 1200 K), with bulk axial strains up to ~20% [2]. We use Elasto-ViscoPlastic Self-Consistent modeling (EVPSC) [3] to reproduce lattice strains and textures measured in-situ with synchrotron X-ray diffraction. We compare the results to those on an identical deformation experiment with a single phase (GePv) polycrystal. We will discuss stress distributions between the two phases in the composite, textural developments, relationships with active slip systems, and finally the potential implications for rheological properties of the lower mantle.\n[1] Yamazaki, D., and S.

            "abstract": "We have developed a new altimeter proxy based on the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of surficial accumulations of salts in hyperarid settings. Under hyperarid conditions like in the Andean forearc in northern Chile at altitudes below ~3000 m.a.s.l., gypsum and other soluble salts form saline soils. The altimeter is based on the first-order topographic control on the extent of inland incursion of fog-transported marine aerosols derived from the Pacific Ocean. Once this fog is evaporated it deposits calcium sulfates with a marine 87Sr/86Sr signal. At positions in the landscape not reached by marine aerosols, calcium sulfates have no marine source, except by eolian reworking, and have a lower 87Sr/86Sr. 87Sr/86Sr values for Holocene accumulations of salts show a bimodal distribution: high values between 225–1075 m.a.s.l. (0.70807 ± 0.00004) and low values below and above those altitude thresholds (0.70746 ± 0.00010). We sampled dated gypsic relict soils and Gypsisols to study post-5 Ma surface height evolution using this method, after correcting for changes in the altitudinal structure of the paleo-fog zone with time.\nLocations spanning ~250 km strike-parallel distance within the forearc and at elevations between 450–1650 m.a.s.l. display moderate amounts of altitudinal change during the Pliocene, Pleistocene and Quaternary. Site results include two in the northern zone (19.5ºS and 19.65ºS) that experienced maximum net surface uplifts of ~350 m and ~600 m since 2.5 ± 0.5 Ma and ~2.6 Ma, respectively. Locations at ~21.4°S display an estimated minimum net decline in altitude of ~250 m since 3.4 ± 1.1 Ma and ~200 m since 1.1 ± 0.4 Ma.\nThese constraints will shed light on the geodynamic processes responsible for surface elevation change, by acting as boundary conditions to numerical models of the Andean forearc.",

(2010) Contrib Mineral Petrol 160, 743-759). One of the greatest limitations to analyzing Ti in metamorphic quartz by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is the lack of a suitable matrix-matched reference material. Typically LA-ICP-MS analyses of Ti in minerals use 49Ti as a normalizing mass because of an isobaric interference from 48Ca, which is present in most well characterized reference glasses, on 48Ti. The benefit of using a matrix-matched reference material to analyze Ti in quartz is the opportunity to use 48Ti (73.8 % abundance) as a normalizing mass, which results in an order of magnitude increase in signal strength compared to the less abundant isotope 49Ti (5.5 % abundance), thereby increasing the analytical precision. Here we characterize Ti-bearing SiO2 glasses from Heraeus Quarzglas and natural quartz grains from the Bishop Tuff by cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and LA-ICP-MS, in order to determine their viability as reference materials for Ti in quartz. Titanium contents in low-CL rims in the Bishop Tuff quartz grains were determined to be homogenous by EPMA (41 ± 2 µg/g Ti, 2σ), and are a potential natural reference material.\nWe present a new method for determining 48Ti concentrations in quartz by LA-ICP-MS at the 1 µg/g level, relevant to quartz in HP-LT terranes. We suggest that natural quartz such as the homogeneous low-CL rims of the Bishop Tuff quartz are more suitable than NIST reference glasses as an in-house reference material for low Ti concentrations because matrix effects are limited and Ca isobaric interferences are avoided, thus allowing for the use of 48Ti as a normalizing mass. Titanium concentration from 33 analyses of low-temperature quartz from the Czech Erzgebirge is 0.9 ± 0.2 µg/g (2σ) using 48Ti as a normalizing mass and the Bishop Tuff quartz rims as a reference material. The 2σ average analytical uncertainty for analyses of 48Ti is 8 % for 50 µm spots and 7 % for 100 µm spots, which offers much greater precision than the 35 % uncertainty (2σ) incurred from using 49Ti as a normalizing mass.",

            "abstract": "Climate change will affect global forest C dynamics. This study was conducted to predict the changes in C stocks and annual C sequestration rates of South Korean forests using the Korean Forest Soil Carbon (KFSC) model under the Constant Temperature (CT) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenarios (2012–2100). The simulation unit was each permanent sampling plots of the 5th Korean National Forest Inventory. The C pools were initialized at 2012, and disturbance was not considered during the simulation period. The annual mean temperature and precipitation were established based on the RCP 8.5 data. Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the forest C stocks were 3–7% less than those stocks under the CT scenario. For broadleaf species, the forest C stocks increased from 599.6 Tg C in 2012 to 1058.0 (CT scenario) or 986.7 Tg C (RCP 8.5 scenario) in 2100. For needleleaf species, the forest C stocks increased from 385.4 Tg C in 2012 to 585.0 (CT scenario) or 568.6 Tg C (RCP 8.5 scenario) in 2100. Accordingly, the annual C sequestration rates of those forest types in South Korea over the simulation period under the RCP 8.5 scenario (57.4 and 144.5 g C m-2 yr-1 for broadleaf and needleleaf species, respectively) were lower than those values under the CT scenario (62.5 and 171.2 g C m-2 yr-1 for broadleaf and needleleaf species, respectively). Those differences between the climate scenarios were attributed to changes in decay rates of the dead organic matter due to temperature increase. We concluded that the C sequestration potential of South Korean forests could be decreased by climate change.",

Present-day analogues were also studied. Broken (corroded included) and juvenile tests (Image 2) were counted and density (NF/cm3) (Image 3), species richness (S) (Image 4) and diversity (H(s)) (Image 5), calculated.\nThe preliminary results indicate 3 zones:\nA - base of the deposit - dominance of a marine assemblage, the acme in broken tests content, highest S/H(s) and lowest NF/cm3;\nB - a significant rise of estuarine group, as well as a drop of broken tests and S/H(s);\nC - marine species and broken tests increase, estuarine group still relevant;\nIn the overlying unit it was observed: a drop in the marine group and slight increase in estuarine species and S/H(s); sharp rise in NF/cm3, marginal marine group and juveniles; the proportion of broken tests drops to a minimum.\nMarginal-marine species dominate both the mud capping the deposit and the underlying unit.\nThe vertical variation in broken tests correlates with the marine taxa (R=0.97) throughout the deposit.\nThe zones were interpreted as the signal of multiple run-in and backwash during one event. A might represent the first incoming wave, carrying marine and diverse broken faunas eroded from the inner shelf; B might reflect tsunami reworking of the middle estuary, the backwash adding brackish species to the assemblage; C suggest another run-in episode, adding new marine species to a mixed assemblage.\nThese preliminary results stress the potential of foraminifera as a proxy in studies of inundation vs backwash tsunami sedimentation in coastal lowlands.",

            "abstract": "A M4.8 earthquake with dominant strike-slip near Timpson, east Texas, the largest documented earthquake to date in that region, has received extensive attention due to the possible linkage to waste water injection. The reliably located aftershocks align along a previously mapped fault striking about N42°W. Two active injection wells are located within 3 km of the aftershocks. One injection well became operational in August 2006 with an average injection rate of 42,750 m3/mo at an average pumping pressure of 12.4 MPa at depths between 1853 and 1868 m. Six months later, the second well started injection at 15,600 m3/mo. To investigate the causative relationship between fluid injection and possibly induced seismic fault slip, we integrated geologic and geophysical data into a poroelastic finite element model to simulate the spatial and temporal evolution of pore pressure and stress fields and analyze the stability of fault by applying the Coulomb failure criterion. Parametric studies were performed to analyze the sensitivity of Coulomb failure stress to the variability of input parameters including permeability of injection layer, fault orientation and permeability, and orientation and magnitude of stress state prior to injection. Assuming a Byerlee friction coefficient of 0.6, and using best available estimates of layer permeability, fault orientation, and stress tensor orientation and magnitude, we calculated fault slip occurs 55 months after the start of injection in the model, close to the observed delay of 69 months between injection and the M4.8 event. However, even with principal stress directions and fault orientation being reasonably well constrained, Coulomb failure stress is highly sensitive to input parameters resulting in large uncertainties in correlating injection rate and volume with the onset of induced seismic events. In addition, injection layer and fault zone permeability has a profound effect on the pore pressure evolution. These results demonstrate the benefit of detailed geomechanical site characterization for assessing and managing induced earthquake risk.",

            "abstract": "Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are unique bacterial lipids that commonly occur in soil and peat bog. The methylation and cyclization degrees of brGDGTs, expressed as MBT and CBT, respectively, are mainly controlled by mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and soil pH. However, the brGDGT-derived temperatures scatter widely compared to actual MAATs in both regional and global calibrations. In this study, we collected 297 soil samples from diverse regions of China (Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Yunnan, Dongying and Tibetan Plateau) in order to identify environmental variables that control the distribution of brGDGTs locally. The results show that MBT correlated positively with MAAT under the global calibration framework; however, large variation in MBT occurred for a given MAAT for individual regions. When confined within a specific region, MBT index positively correlated with conductivity in Dongying soils and negatively with pH in Yunnan and Guangzhou soils. Removing GDGT-II from CBT calculation resulted in a revised CBT index that provides more accurate estimation of pH (R2=0.79 vs 0.67), especially in alkaline soils. In addition, the combination of MBT and revised CBT also improves the estimation of soil pH (R2 =0.79) than the original CBT index alone (R2=0.67). Our results demonstrate that brGDGTs-derived proxies may be more reliable for estimating paleo-soil pH than paleo-continental temperature.",

            "abstract": "The complicated energy transfer and plasma motion in the transition region, between the photosphere and the corona, may play a significant role in the formation and acceleration of the solar wind. New observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) have revealed unprecedented levels of detail in this less-studied region. Coronal holes in particular are a likely source of solar wind material, though the formation and acceleration mechanisms of the fast solar wind are still largely unknown. In our previous work, we have reported the prevalence of small-scale high-speed (~80-250 km/s) jets with transition region temperatures from the network structures of coronal holes. Here we undertake a comparative study of these short-lived episodic network jets in a coronal hole region and a quiet sun region using IRIS sit-and-stare slit-jaw imaging in the 1330 Angstrom (C II) passband. The pointing coordinates, exposure time, observing cadence, and field of view of both observations are all identical. Our preliminary study suggests that the speeds and lengths of the network jets may differ between quiet sun and coronal hole regions. The quiet sun region exhibits many compact bright regions with sizes of 5-10 arcseconds which produce very few jets. The jets that do exist tend to propagate at much slower speeds over smaller distances than their coronal hole counterparts. Comparatively, in the coronal hole, such compact regions are almost absent and all network patches are permeated by the intermittent high-reaching jets. Such a difference suggests that magnetic loops are much smaller in the coronal hole and the network jets are produced at low heights. The recurrence frequency seems to be higher in the coronal hole region, with many of the isolated quiet sun region jets demonstrating curved trajectories.\nThis work is supported under contract 8100002705 from Lockheed-Martin to SAO and by the NSF-REU solar physics program at SAO, grant number AGS-1263241.",

Analyses use Version 3 CALIOP Level 2 5-km cloud layer products and the corresponding Version 3 IIR Level 2 track products. Uncertainties are assessed by comparing IIR absorption optical depths retrieved at 12.05 microns to CALIOP visible optical depths for single-layered clouds over ocean when the latter can be derived using the so-called constrained retrieval technique. A bias in the optical depths used in CALIOP constrained retrievals is evidenced for optical depths smaller than about 0.6. This bias can be largely eliminated by relaxing the criteria applied in the current version 3 of the CALIOP algorithm to select the qualifying clouds. Ratios of CALIOP visible to IIR absorption optical depths are found to increase quasi-linearly by about 50% as the temperature at the layer centroid altitude decreases from 250 K to 200 K, whereas they are expected between 1.9 and 2 according to simulations and ice crystal effective diameters retrieved from the IIR. The analysis of simultaneously derived CALIOP lidar ratios of moderately deep clouds (1-4 km) strongly suggests that these observations can be explained by variations of the multiple scattering correction factor, which is taken to be constant and equal to 0.6 in the CALIOP algorithm. Multiple scattering factors derived by reconciling observed and expected ratios of visible to infrared absorption optical extend from 0.68 +/- 0.05 at 200 K to 0.46 +/- 0.03 at 250 K.",

The special climatic situation in the region with sharp climate gradients introduced by the blocking of the westerlies by the high peaks of the Icefield are reproduced by downscaled climatic data. The mass balance simulations were validated and interpreted using geodetic mass balances, measured point balances and a complete velocity field of the Southern Patagonia Icefield (SPI) from spring 2004. The high measured accumulation of snow as well as the high measured ablation values are reproduced by the model. Subtracting the modeled surface mass balance from the geodetic balances, calving fluxes of major outlet glaciers were inferred. Good agreement with calving fluxes estimated from velocity data was obtained in many cases however on several glaciers the inferred calving fluxes seem to overestimate the measured calving fluxes. The measured calving fluxes exhibit large uncertainties due to mostly unknown ice thickness data and evolution of glacier velocities through time. The accumulation of snow and its redistribution due to wind drift present the mayor uncertainties in the modeled surface mass balance. Assuming no substantial changes in ice flow, the surface mass balance model driven by ECHAM5 data in the A1B scenario predicts a contribution of the Patagonian Icefields to sea-level rise in the 21st century of 7.3 mm.",

Discharge and P transport in overland flow and subsurface (tile) drainage were monitored at three reduced-till fields in southern Ontario, Canada for 18 months to (1) quantify runoff and P loads from fields; (2) characterize seasonality in the relative contributions of tile drainage and overland flow to runoff and P loads, and (3) demonstrate variable responses among different event types. Transport pathways were active throughout the non-growing season (NGS) and this period accounted for the majority of annual P loads over the study period. Drainage tiles were the dominant hydrologic pathway from fields throughout the study period, but were a small source of P when compared to P loss in overland flow. Overland flow was predominantly observed during winter thaws when ground frost was present. However, the magnitude and speciation of P losses during individual winter events were variable, and, were governed by a combination of antecedent conditions and precipitation characteristics. Given the importance of the NGS to annual P losses, we suggest that management steps should be taken to minimize the risk of losses during this period.",

            "abstract": "The northern circumpolar region is estimated to contain 50 % of the global belowground carbon pool and is experiencing climate change at rates higher than anywhere else globally. Surface organic horizons associated with these immense carbon pools are important to ecosystem functioning in terms of soil moisture and temperature regulations, permafrost degradation, successional trajectories, and soil respiration levels. However, fire-induced changes to surface organics and their distribution are poorly understood, especially on landscape scales. These ambiguities make future predictions uncertain for these significant carbon pools, which have the potential for significant feedbacks to global warming. Moreover, given the significant impacts and increasing severity and amount of fires in boreal systems, the spatial quantification of post-fire surface organic thickness is important for ecosystem model calibrations and comparisons, and can improve future projections of vegetation types and albedo, carbon stocks and fluxes, and future thaw depths. Here we present the results of pioneering studies that quantified the distribution and controls of peatlands and soil organic layer thickness in Alaska through the use of statistical models, field data, spatial analyses, and remote sensing (Landsat). Our empirical modeling approach enabled us to produce medium-resolution (30-m pixels) maps of peatlands and organic layer thickness throughout Alaska, which is important for land management practices and enhances the understanding of the risk and feedbacks associated with fires and climate feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "Starting in Peru, the Amazon River flows through Colombia and Brazil; additionally, tributaries from Bolivia, Venezuela, and Ecuador contribute to the massive river and its unique geomorphic features. Accordingly, the Amazon Basin has become an important aspect of South America; it is an area of extraordinary biodiversity, rich resources, and unique cultures. However, due to the sheer magnitude and exceptionality of the Amazon River, research regarding the morphodynamic processes that shape and define the river has been difficult. Consequently, current research has not completely understood the planform dynamics of some portions of this river that present a main channel and secondary channels known as “anabranching structures”.\nThe purpose of this research was to gain an understanding of the geomorphology of the upper Amazon, the Peruvian section, by obtaining migration rates and planform metrics, including channel count, length, width, and sinuosity, as well as island count, area, and shape. With this data, the morphodynamics of the Peruvian Amazon, especially the relationship between the main channel and its secondary channels in each “anabranching structure” along the river, could be analyzed according to correlations found between various metrics. This analysis was carried out for 5-year time spans over a period of 25 years. Preliminary results showed that the average migration rate versus channel bend radius envelope peak is lower for the secondary channels than for the main channel. However, the maximum migration rate was not always found in the main channel; for several structures, the most dynamic channels were the secondary ones. This implies a certain periodicity to the river’s migratory patterns that could be related to the valley boundaries, the local channel sinuosity or geological formations in the study area.",

            "abstract": "Recent developments in our understanding of lower mantle mineralogy motivate an updated view of mantle circulation that may explain the absence of a correlation between topography on the 410 km and 660 km discontinuities. A common feature in both P and S wave tomography models is the lack of a definitive slab seismic signal in the lower mantle from 1500-2500 km depth, even though this depth range is well constrained by the data. Ab initio calculations of Wu and Wentzcovitch (PNAS, 2014) predict that (Mg,Fe)O will be seismically insensitive to temperature below 1500 km due to weakening of the bulk modulus during the high-spin to low-spin transition in iron. Yamazaki and Karato (AM, 2001) demonstrated that (Mg,Fe)O has a much lower viscosity than perovskite and could support strain weakening which would facilitate transport of slabs through the lower mantle. Since subducting oceanic lithosphere is dominantly harzburgite, it has a higher (Mg,Fe)O component than a pyrolitic or perovskitic lower mantle. When the mantle began solidification after the last giant impacts, the first solids to crystalize at depth were pure perovskite (the liquidus phase above ~35 GPa). When subduction initiated, the first slabs needed to work through this highly viscous, perovskitic lower mantle and form channels to the core mantle boundary. Tomography models show a column of seemingly warm, low P and S velocity material rising from the top of Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces and collecting in the upper 1000 km of the mantle. The dominant signature of the lower mantle is that it is seismically boring with little discernible tectonic structure. We conclude that the majority of the lower mantle is the sluggishly mixed remnant of its initial perovskitic crystallization. Although less viscous, the (Mg,Fe)O rich slabs have carved channels into the lowermost mantle and comprise the dominant material in the return flow to the upper mantle. This model implies slabs stagnate in the MTZ due to trench migration above silica rich domains. The behavior of upwelling harzburgitic material will be complicated by the high temperature perovskite and (Mg,Fe)O transition to majorite garnet. Thus, the lack of correlated patterns in the 410 and 660 km discontinuity topography outside of subduction zones could be due to partial chemical layering of the mantle.",

An accurate representation of paleovegetation can, therefore, provide better insight into a representation of late Eocene paleoclimate. We collect approximately 70 paleobotanical/fossil locations from the literature to anchor our paleovegetation distribution. The available data are separated into 11 biome possibilities, distinguished by plant coverage and surface type. These biomes provide an accurate and reasonably detailed description of vegetation in a flexible, climatically interpretable framework. Where data are available, biomes are linked to paleobotanical interpretations. In locations where data do not exist, we impose a vegetation interpretation consistent with biomes in locations with similar elevation, latitude, and geography. In all cases, interpretations are based on growth patterns and habits of modern plants of species similar to those identified in the fossil record. We present our final interpretation of late Eocene paleovegetation as a biome map with respect to the geography of the late Eocene and welcome additional data and interpretations prior to inclusion of these boundary conditions in climate simulations of the late Eocene.",

            "abstract": "The disintegration of the northern and central parts of the Larsen B Ice Shelf in 2002 demonstrated the strong interaction between ice shelves and their tributary glaciers. The surviving southern part of the ice shelf and its glaciers have hitherto received less attention, based on the assumption that the remnant ice shelf continued to provide the glaciers with sufficient buttressing. Our findings here contradict this view, revealing significant changes since 2002 or earlier from IceBridge altimetry measurements and InSAR-derived flow speeds. The surfaces of Leppard and Flask glaciers directly upstream of their grounding lines lowered persistently by 15 to 20 m in the period 2002-2011. The thinning appears to be dynamic as the flow of both glaciers and the remnant ice shelf accelerated in the same period. Flask in particular started accelerating as early as 2000 almost doubling its flow speed by 2012. These changes are associated with a reduction in the buttressing afforded by the remnant ice shelf and an increase in its fracture as shown by our numerical modeling. One large rift in particular, only 12 km downstream of the grounding line, is revealed by the observations and modeling to be rapidly extending across the ice shelf, defining the likely front of the next large calving event. The increased fracture and continued flow acceleration of the remnant Larsen B Ice Shelf presage its approaching demise.",

Some of the causes of the sprawl include - population growth, economy, patterns of infrastructure initiatives like the construction of roads and the provision of infrastructure using public money encouraging development. The direct implication of such urban sprawl is the change in land use and land cover of the region. In this study the long term climate data from multiple sources like NCEP reanalysis, IMD observations and various satellite derived products from MAIRS, IMD, ERSL and TRMM are considered and analyzed using the developed algorithms for the better understanding of the variability in the climate parameters over Bangalore.\nThese products are further mathematically analyzed to arrive at desired results by extracting land surface temperature (LST), Potential evapo-transmission (PET), Rainfall, Humidity etc. Various satellites products are derived from NASA (National Aeronautics Space Agency), Indian meteorological satellites and global satellites are helpful in massive study of urban issues at global and regional scale. Climate change analysis is well studied by using either single source data such as Temperature or Rainfall from IMD (Indian Meteorological Department) or combined data products available as in case of MAIRS (Monsoon Asia Integrated Regional Scale) program to get rainfall at regional scale. Finally all the above said parameters are normalized and analyzed with the help of various open source available software’s for pre and post processing our requirements to obtain desired results. A sample of analysis i.e. the Inter annual variability of annual averaged Temperature over Bangalore is presented in figure 1, which clearly shows the rising trend of the temperature (0.06oC/year). Also the Land use and land cover (LULC) analysis over Bangalore, Day light hours from satellite derived products are analyzed and the correlation of climate parameters with LULC are presented.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring the natural (and enhanced) degradation of organic contaminants is essential for managing groundwater quality in many parts of the world. Contaminated sites often have limited access, hence non-intrusive methods for studying redox processes, which drive the degradation of organic compounds, are required. One example is the degradation of de-icing chemicals (glycols and organic salts) released to the soil near airport runways during winter. This issue has been broadly studied at Oslo airport, Gardermoen, Norway using intrusive and non-intrusive methods. Here, we report on laboratory experiments that aim to study the potential of using a self-potential, DCresistivity, and time-domain induced polarization for geochemical characterization of the degradation of Propylene Glycol (PG). PG is completely miscible in water, does not adsorb to soil particles and does not contribute to the electrical conductivity of the soil water. When the contaminant is in the unsaturated zone near the water table, the oxygen is quickly consumed and the gas exchange with the surface is insufficient to ensure aerobic degradation, which is faster than anaerobic degradation. Since biodegradation of PG is highly oxygen demanding, anaerobic pockets can exist causing iron and manganese reduction. It is hypothesised that nitrate would boost the degradation rate under such conditions. In our experiment, we study PG degradation in a sand tank. We provide the system with an electron highway to bridge zones with different redox potential. This geo-battery system is characterized by self-potential, resistivity and induced polarization anomalies. An example of preliminary results with self-potential at two different times of the experiment can be seen in the illustration. These will be supplemented with more direct information on the redox chemistry: in-situ water sampling, pH, redox potential and electrical conductivity measurements. In parallel, a series of batch experiments have been performed to study anoxic microbial degradation using gas and resistivity measurements.",

Some of environmental studies of the rivers in this region (e.g. Kawano et al., 1998, Ohsawa et al., 2008) show that hot spring drainage flows into a river and then flow into the coastal are, and it strongly affects the river water quality. On the other hands, several kinds of tropical fish lives in those rivers (Hiramatu et al., 1995). We can easily have watched those fish there. Although the relationship between hot spring drainage and the fish community had not been investigated in the past in this area, it is easily assumed that thermal energy and materials derived from the hot spring drainage strongly affect the ecosystem. However, the impact of the hot spring drainage on the ecosystem in river and coastal area is not clear. We investigated the river water quality and physical property of six rivers in this region. Additionally, we investigated the fish community near the estuary at two rivers which are strongly affected by the hot spring drainage and not the influence of the hot spring at all. We tried an evaluation about the influence of thermal energy and materials derived from the hot spring drainage on the fish community near the estuary.\nThe results of chemical and physical data in these rivers are as follows. The size of influence of hot spring drainage on river is different every river. In this region, Hirata River is most strongly affected by the hot spring drainage. The water temperature of Hirata River maintains 25 degrees Celsius or more through the year and the concentrations of dissolved component is very high. On the other hand, the water temperature and the concentrations of dissolved component of Hiya Rive is low. These data are similar to data of the upper side of Hirata River. The results of investigating the fish community indicate that Oreochromis niloticus and Rhinogobius giurinus is the dominant species at Hirata River and Hiya River respectively. In addition, there is more the number of species of Hiya River than that of Hirata River. In this presentation, we will report and discuss the impact of the hot spring drainage on the fish community near the estuary.",

            "abstract": "Deformation in a small volume of earth interior is expressed by a symmetric moment tensor located on a point source. The tensor contains information of characteristic directions, source amplitude, and source types such as isotropic, double-couple, or compensated-linear-vector-dipole (CLVD). Although we often assume a double couple as the source type of an earthquake, significant non-double-couple component including isotropic component is often reported for induced earthquakes and volcanic earthquakes.\nFor discussions on source types including double-couple and non-double-couple components, it is helpful to display them using some visual diagrams. Since the information of source type has two degrees of freedom, it can be displayed onto a two-dimensional flat plane. Although the diagram developed by Hudson et al. [1989] is popular, the trace corresponding to the mechanism combined by two mechanisms is not always a smooth line.\nTo overcome this problem, Chapman and Leaney [2012] developed a new diagram. This diagram has an advantage that a straight line passing through the center corresponds to the mechanism obtained by a combination of an arbitrary mechanism and a double-couple [Tape and Tape, 2012], but this diagram has some difficulties in use. First, it is slightly difficult to produce the diagram because of its curved shape. Second, it is also difficult to read out the ratios among isotropic, double-couple, and CLVD components, which we want to obtain from the estimated moment tensors, because they do not appear directly on the horizontal or vertical axes.\nIn the present study, we developed another new square diagram that overcomes the difficulties of previous diagrams. This diagram is an orthogonal system of isotropic and deviatoric axes, so it is easy to get the ratios among isotropic, double-couple, and CLVD components. Our diagram has another advantage that the probability density is obtained simply from the area within the diagram if the probability density function of moment tensor’s eigenvalues P(λ1, λ2, λ3) depends only on the scalar moment [(λ12+λ22+λ32)/2]0.5. Even if this is not the real case, the easiness of calculating the areal density is useful when we compare the results of analyzing real data with that of analyzing background noise.",

            "abstract": "Since mud volcanoes spew out pressurized material, such as natural gas, oil, mud including water from a deeper ground, the activities of the mud volcanoes are good indicators of the stress conditions/orientations as well as the tectonic controls. The Murono mud volcano area located in Tokamachi City, Niigata prefecture, Japan, is one of the active ground deforming areas associated with mud, natural gas, oil and water eruptions. This area is famous because rapid ground deformation events were recorded corresponding to neighboring large earthquakes. For instance, associated with Naganoken-Hokubu Earthquake (Mw. 6.7) which occurred in 2011, the area recorded a sudden large uplift of about 50 cm.\nIn order to reveal the source mechanism of the mud volcano, Toyama University has been conducting successive leveling surveys at 61 benchmarks. They revealed that the same area of the rapid uplift of 2011 has been still uplifting, even the amount of the uplift is much smaller (20 mm/yr). However, the source of the uplift could not be well identified due to the low spatial resolutions. Therefore, in order to obtain a high resolution land deformation pattern, we have conducted laser scanning surveys two times in June and October 2013, using TOPCON Imaging Station IS-301, which can obtain 3D point cloud data by the automatic laser scanning mode without reflector.\nThe surface deformations obtained by comparing the June and October datasets indicate clear uplifts where the sudden uplift occurred. Since the uplift area show a clear concentric pattern, we estimated the source of the uplift assuming a Mogi source model. The obtained source parameters are, depth=14[m], Volume=14[m3], assuming the Poisson's ratio of 0.25. Then the calculated uplift at the nearest benchmark also shows good agreement with the uplift obtained by the leveling survey.\nThe current uplift is much smaller than the 2011 uplift. Nevertheless both sources could be the same, because the areas of the uplifts are substantially coincident.",

These map information have been distributed in accordance with Web services standards such as Web Map Service (WMS) and Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) recently. In this study, a partial cutting tool of geological map images distributed by geological WMTS was implemented with Free and Open Source Software. The tool mainly consists of two functions: display function and cutting function. The former function was implemented using OpenLayers. The latter function was implemented using Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL). All other small functions were implemented by PHP and Python. As a result, this tool allows not only displaying WMTS layer on web browser but also generating a geological map image of intended area and zoom level. At this moment, available WTMS layers are limited to the ones distributed by WMTS for the Seamless Digital Geological Map of Japan. The geological map image can be saved as GeoTIFF format and WebGL format. GeoTIFF is one of the georeferenced raster formats that is available in many kinds of Geographical Information System. WebGL is useful for confirming a relationship between geology and geography in 3D. In conclusion, the partial cutting tool developed in this study would contribute to create better conditions for promoting utilization of geological information. Future work is to increase the number of available WMTS layers and the types of output file format.",

            "abstract": "Urban air pollution and its effects on human health remain to be a challenge in spite of substantial reductions in the emissions of air pollutants (e.g. sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides) over the past decades in Europe. While primary pollutants play a vital role in urban air pollution, recent model studies highlight and quantify the relevance of long-range transport of secondary pollution (e.g. secondary inorganic aerosols such as ammonium sulphates and nitrates, or ground level ozone) for the exceedance of local air quality limit values in urban areas across Europe. This contribution can be seen in recurring episodes, for instance in spring 2014, with very high levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Paris, London and other European cities, as well as in elevated background levels throughout the year. While we will focus on the contribution to exceedances of PM2.5 limit values here, this transboundary transport has wider implications for the deposition of reactive nitrogen far from the source as well.\nAs local authorities are tasked with ensuring the attainment of air quality limit values, exceedances caused by long-range transport, with emissions originating from sources outside of their jurisdiction present substantial challenges. Furthermore, while policy measures have successfully addressed emissions from large point sources in the past, and made progress towards reducing pollution from road vehicles, emissions of ammonia from agricultural sources - a key component for the long-range transport of secondary inorganic aerosols - have remained relatively stable in Europe.\nUsing the example of Europe and the UK, we demonstrate in our presentation how atmospheric chemistry transport modelling across different scales (from regional to local) can provide vital insight in the mechanisms of and relative contributions to the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols. In addition, we illustrate how this modelling capability can inform the design of efficient control strategies by quantifying the effect of different policy measures targeted at specific source sectors, and highlight the role of transboundary air pollution to local air pollution challenges.",

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice responds to atmospheric forcing in primarily a top-down manner, whereby near-surface air circulation and temperature govern motion, formation, melting, and accretion. As a result, concentrations of sea ice and snow cover extent vary with phases of many of the major modes of atmospheric variability, including the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation, and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. However, variability of sea ice and snow cover extent by phase of the leading mode of atmospheric intraseasonal variability, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), which has been found to modify Arctic circulation and temperature, remained largely unstudied.\nIn this study, anomalies in daily change in sea ice concentration and snow cover extent were isolated for all phases of the Real-time Multivariate MJO index during both summer (May-July) and winter (November-January) months. Principal findings of the relationship between sea ice concentration and the MJO included the following: 1) The MJO projects onto the Arctic atmosphere, as evidenced by statistically significant wavy patterns and consistent anomaly sign changes in composites of surface and mid-tropospheric atmospheric fields. 2) The MJO modulates Arctic sea ice in both summer and winter seasons, with the region of greatest variability shifting with the migration of the ice margin poleward (equatorward) during the summer (winter) period. This variability is supported by corresponding anomalies in surface wind and temperature. 3) The MJO modulates Arctic sea ice regionally, often resulting in dipole-shaped patterns of variability between anomaly centers.\nThe seasonality of the MJO-snow extent relationship is also explored using snow fields from multiple data records. Use of multiple snow variables within cutting-edge reanalysis datasets was necessary due to the nature of snow “memory”, in that snow that falls and accumulates during one MJO phase may remain for several subsequent MJO phases. These results provide an important first look at intraseasonal variability of snow cover extent in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Drylands comprise ≈40% of the terrestrial Earth surface and observations suggest they can respond markedly to climate change. A vital component of dryland ecosystems are biological soil crusts (biocrusts) - a network of surface soil lichens, mosses, and cyanobacteria – that perform critical ecosystem functions, such as stabilizing soil and fixing carbon and nitrogen. Yet, our understanding of the role biocrusts play in dryland energy balance remains poor. Changes in climate can rapidly affect biocrust communities and we have long known that biocrusts respond dramatically to physical disturbance, such as human trampling and grazing animals. Associated changes in biocrust cover often result in increased bare soil; creating higher surface reflectance. We used spectral solar reflectance measurements in two manipulative experiments to compare the effects of climate and physical disturbance on biocrusts of the Colorado Plateau We measured reflectance at two heights: at crust surface and 1 m above. The climate disturbance site has four treatments: control, warming (4°C), altered precipitation, and warming plus altered precipitation. The physical disturbance site was trampled by foot annually since 1998. At the climate experiment, the largest change in reflectance was in the altered precipitation treatment (35% increase) at the surface-level, and the smallest difference was in the warmed (17% increase) at the meter-level. Physical disturbance differences were 10% at meter-level and 25% at surface-level. Unexpectedly, these results suggest that, via effects on biocrust communities, climate change could have a larger effect on dryland energy balance relative to physical disturbance, and result in more radiation from drylands returned to the atmosphere. Biocrusts cover large portions of the Earth’s surface and, to our knowledge, these are the first data showing climate-induced changes to biocrust reflectance, with negative feedback in the global energy balance.",

            "abstract": "Arid and semi-arid regions are generally susceptible to land degeneration due to limited precipitation and high potential evapotranspiration (ET). Afforestation has been assumed to be a feasible strategy to conserve water and to improve ecological environment. For example, the Northern China, as a typical arid and semi-arid region has experienced large-scale and long-term afforestation practices since the early 1980s. The land cover has been altered to some degree as tree planting with increasing greenness. However, the effectiveness of afforestation might not be as expected due to the interference of climate change.\nIn this study, we attempted to quantify the contribution of afforestation practices to the hydrological system in the Northern China. A macro-scale hydrological model, i.e., the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC), was employed to simulate ET, soil moisture and runoff for the period 1959 – 2009. Fractional simulation scenarios were designed regarding different conditions of land cover and climate changes. The results indicate that the land cover has minor impact on the variability of hydrological variables at regional scale, comparing with the climate change. Particularly, the decreasing precipitation plays a dominant role in shaping the trends of ET, soil moisture and runoff. The findings have significant implications for the implementation of the afforestation practices and for the management of water resources in arid and semi-arid regions.",

            "abstract": "The outlet glaciers of the Greenland Ice Sheet are the source of observable seismic phenomena over a broad range of frequencies. We have found the globally observable, long-period events known as glacial earthquakes to have a close link to calving-front behaviour, occurring during calving-front retreat at glaciers with grounded or near-grounded termini. While glaciers in other areas are known to be an abundant source of high-frequency seismicity, much less is known about the nature of high-frequency seismicity emanating from outlet glaciers in Greenland. We consider the high-frequency seismicity of Helheim Glacier, a major outlet glacier on the East Coast of Greenland, by analyzing data recorded on a temporary network of six 3-component seismometers sampling at 100 sps. This network was deployed at bedrock sites surrounding Helheim Glacier for approximately seven weeks during the summer of 2009. We observe the seismograms from this network to be rich in high-frequency signals, and we identify thousands of seismic events by analysis of the envelope functions of the seismograms. We find that the occurrence of these events is tidally modulated, and we examine the relationship between this tidal modulation and previous geodetic observations of tidal forcing at outlet glaciers in Greenland. We infer that the high-frequency signals we observe are the result of brittle processes occurring in a localized source region near the glacier calving front. Continuing analysis of such high-frequency seismicity will lead to a better understanding of the full-range of glaciogenic seismicity and to understanding of calving process and glacier dynamics, including the link between the calving process and external forcings.",

            "abstract": "Normal faulting, uplift and low convergent rates are observed in the Western Alps. Until recently, occurrence of normal faulting in weakly convergent mountain ranges has been attributed to the conversion of potential energy of the topography into seismic motion in the upper crust and viscous flow in the lower crust. However, recent insights indicate that gravitational mountain collapse may not be the only process responsible for extension in the core of mountain belts: -1. Leveling and vertical GPS measurements show that the elevated topography of the western and central Alps is currently uplifted at rates of 1-2 mm/yr while gravitational collapse would lead to a downward motion; -2. There is no correlation between mountain core extension and average mountain topography. Champagnac et al. (2009) have proposed an elastic plate model in which present-day uplift in the Alps occurs in response to mountain scale unloading by denudation. Following this first approach, we have developed a numerical model that demonstrates a causal link between topography denudation, crustal uplift and extensional strain in an alpine-type mountain belt (Vernant et al. 2013). A key aspect of the seismotectonic field observations in the Alps is that seismic strain and geodetic uplift are occurring in relatively narrow areas, while our mechanical model predicts a broader uplift. Also, geodetic uplift rates appear to be larger than the maximum value associated to Holocene denudation rates. Using a 2D Finite Element Modeling, we explore the possibility that localized uplift may be associated to re-activation of pre-existing tectonic structures. These weak zones are accounted for using low frictional faults and/or low viscosity zones. We also investigate the possibility that large uplift rates may partly contain a rebound associated to Holocene deglaciations cycle.",

Although regional social indicators have also slightly improved, society remains unequal and violent, both in urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the combined results of the fall of deforestation and the increased economic importance of the agribusiness sector have led to the political weakening of the so-called socio-environmental model. Thus, the current situation indicates a future of low (clear-cut) carbon emissions and low social conditions. On the other hand, other threats remain, including forest degradation derived from illegal logging and forest fires. There is also considerable uncertainty about the fate of the remaining forest areas as multiple forces can contribute to the return of high deforestation, including the rapidly expanding global markets for agricultural commodities, large-scale transportation and energy infrastructure projects, and weak institutions. We present the results of a participatory scenario process, in which we discussed the future of the region until 2050 combining normative and exploratory approaches. We include an ideal “Sustainability” scenario (Scenario A) in which we envision major socioeconomic, institutional and environmental achievements. Scenario B stays in the “Middle of the road”, in which the society maintains some of the positive environmental trends of the last decade, but not reversing the structural situation of social inequities. Scenario C is a pessimistic vision, named “Fragmentation” with high deforestation rates and low social development. The goal of the work was twofold: (a) to propose a method to enrich the discussion among different private and governmental stakeholders on how to build a trajectory towards sustainability; (b) to support the parameterization of spatially-explicit LUCC models in the scope of the AMAZALERT project.",

            "abstract": "Recent numerical modelling demonstrates that when sandy coastlines are affected predominantly by waves approaching from “high” angles (> ~45° between the coastline and wave crests at the offshore limit of shore-parallel contours), large-scale (kms to 100 kms) morphodynamic instabilities and finite-amplitude interactions can lead to the emergence of striking coastline features, including sand waves, capes and spits. The type of feature that emerges depends on the wave climate, defined as the angular distribution of wave influences on alongshore sediment transport. Under a constant wave climate, coastline morphology reaches a dynamical steady state; the cross-shore/alongshore aspect ratio and the general appearance of the features remains constant. In previous modelling involving wave-climate change, as well as comparisons between observed coastline morphologies and wave climates, it has been implicitly assumed that the morphology adjusts in a quasi-equilibrium fashion, so that at any time the coastline shape reflects the current forcing.\nHowever, here we present new model results showing pronounced path dependence in coastline morphodynamics. In experiments with a period of constant wave climate followed by a period of transition to a new wave climate and then a run-on phase, the features that exist during the run-on phase can be qualitatively and quantitatively different from those that would develop initially under the final wave climate. Although the features inherited from the past wave-climate history may in some case be true alternate stable states, in other cases the inherited features gradually decay toward the morphology that would be expected given the final wave climate. A suite of such experiments allows us to characterize how the e-folding timescale of this decay depends on 1) the initial wave climate, 2) the path through wave-climate space, and 3) the rate of transition. When the initial features are flying spits with cross-shore amplitudes of 6 – 8 km, e-folding times can be on the order of millennia or longer. These results could provide a new perspective when interpreting current and past coastline features. In addition, the complex paleo-coastline structure that develops in the coastal hinterlands in these experiments could be relevant to the structures observed in some coastal environments.",

Coral reefs, for example, are subject to stress by anomalous sediment loads. The island of Puerto Rico has a diverse topography, with steep mountain slopes, episodic high-intensity rainfall events, and weathered soils that lead to episodes of high sediment volumes being delivered to the coastal zone by rivers. We developed a time series of turbidity observations based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery for use in the coastal areas of Puerto Rico. The product uses remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) of Band 1 (645 nm) at a spatial resolution of 250 m. These estimates were compared to in-situ turbidity measurements collected in San Juan Bay. Sediment plumes from the major rivers of Puerto Rico were assessed quantitatively and compared with time-series of meteorological and other parameters, including precipitation, river discharge, and wind velocity. The spatial extent of plumes, the timing and duration of plume events, and their potential impact on coral reefs are examined. Results show that plume events are episodic and short-lived, but that they may affect coral reefs located several kilometers offshore.",

            "abstract": "It is widely believed that the Sahara desert is no more than ~2–3 million years (Myr) old, with geological evidence showing a remarkable aridification of north Africa at the onset of the Quaternary ice ages. Before that time, north African aridity was mainly controlled by the African summer monsoon (ASM), which oscillated with Earth’s orbital precession cycles. Afterwards, the Northern Hemisphere glaciation added an ice volume forcing on the ASM, which additionally oscillated with glacial–interglacial cycles. These findings led to the idea that the Sahara desert came into existence when the Northern Hemisphere glaciated ~2–3 Myr ago. The later discovery, however, of aeolian dune deposits ~7 Myr old suggested a much older age, although this interpretation is hotly challenged and there is no clear mechanism for aridification around this time. Here we use climate model simulations to identify the Tortonian stage (~7–11 Myr ago) of the Late Miocene epoch as the pivotal period for triggering north African aridity and creating the Sahara desert. Through a set of experiments with the Norwegian Earth System Model and the Community Atmosphere Model, we demonstrate that the African summer monsoon was drastically weakened by the Tethys Sea shrinkage during the Tortonian, allowing arid, desert conditions to expand across north Africa. Not only did the Tethys shrinkage alter the mean climate of the region, it also enhanced the sensitivity of the African monsoon to orbital forcing, which subsequently became the major driver of Sahara extent fluctuations. These important climatic changes probably caused the shifts in Asian and African flora and fauna observed during the same period, with possible links to the emergence of early hominins in north Africa.",

These unique observations reveal that Titan’s interaction with the solar wind is in many ways similar to unmagnetized planets Mars and Venus in spite of the differences in the properties of the solar plasma in the outer solar system. In particular, Cassini detected a collisionless, supercritical bow shock under ongoing reformation and a well-defined induced magnetosphere filled with mass-loaded interplanetary magnetic field lines, which drape around Titan’s ionosphere. A study of pressure balance across different plasma regions suggest the presence of fossil fields similar to those detected during T32. Because of the upstream conditions, these observations are relevant for other unmagnetized bodies in the outer solar system such as Pluto, where kinetic processes are expected to dominate.",

It has collected a unique altimetry dataset with higher spatial resolution and a better coverage of Arctic sea ice than any previous radar altimeter mission. The along-track sharpened footprint allows resolving fine-scale features of the ice pack and the examination of retrievable information from the SAR waveforms is a field of ongoing research. Different methods can be applied to CryoSat-2 data: threshold retrackers that use the leading edge; or fitted forward models, which are applied to full waveforms. The uncertainty of these methods propagates into the uncertainty of the final sea-ice thickness estimate via the freeboard to thickness conversion. Theoretical considerations show that the magnitude of uncertainties in the radar retracking may be a major if not dominating contribution to the uncertainty budget of sea-ice thickness retrieval from CryoSat-2.\nWe present a break-down of the uncertainty budget of CryoSat-2 Arctic sea-ice thickness of the threshold retracker based sea-ice thickness data product of the Alfred Wegener Institute. We discuss the differences in the radar waveform properties and the identification of leads in first-year and multi-year ice covered areas with the aim to mitigate ice type dependent biases. Though threshold retrackers are prone to a simplistic interpretation of the SAR waveforms we investigate the potential of this fast and robust method to retrieve additional physical properties at the sea ice surface.",

            "abstract": "Decadal prediction of global mean surface air temperature (GMT) change requires that Global Climate Models (GCMs) accurately simulate the spatial signature and magnitude of unforced (internal) modes of climate variability. In this work, we document the geographic regions that are most associated with unforced GMT variability in CMIP5 GCMs at both the subdecadal and interdecadal timescales. For this purpose we define Regions of Significant Influence (ROSIs) on GMT, which are locations that have a statistically significant correlation between local surface air temperature (SAT) and GMT (with a regression slope greater than 1), and where local SAT variation leads GMT variation in time. It is found that subdecadal timescale GMT variability is most associated with SAT variation over the eastern equatorial Pacific and is consistent across GCMs and between GCMs and observations. At the Interdecadal timescale, GMT variability also tends to be associated with SAT variation over the tropical eastern Pacific in most GCMs, but the precise pattern is far less consistent from GCM to GCM and several GCMs have a much stronger GMT association with SAT variability over the Southern Ocean.\nWe also compare the magnitude of GCM GMT variability to that seen in observations at both the subdecadal and interdecadal timescale and we investigate the relationship between the magnitude of this GMT variability and the underlying modes associated with the GMT variability. Results show that individual GCMs have large biases in the magnitude of subdecadal timescale GMT variability but there is no systematic bias. On the other hand, GCMs appear to underestimate the magnitude of interdecadal timescale GMT variability on average. GCMs with a stronger subdecadal relationship between SAT and GMT over the tropical Pacific tend to have more variable subdecadal GMT while GCMs with a stronger interdecadal relationship between SAT and GMT over the Southern Ocean tend to have more variable interdecadal GMT.",

            "abstract": "Land is a critical resource for human habitat and for the vast majority of human activities. Many natural resources are derived from terrestrial ecosystems or otherwise extracted from the landscape. Terrestrial biodiversity depends on land attributes as do people’s perceptions of the value of land, including its value for recreation or tourism. Furthermore, land surface properties and processes affect weather and climate, and land cover change and land management affect emissions of greenhouse gases. Thus, land cover with its close association with climate is so pervasive that a land cover indicator is of fundamental importance to U.S. national climate assessments and related research. Moderate resolution remote sensing products (MODIS) were used to provide systematic data on annual distributions of land cover over the period 2001–2012. Selected Landsat observations and data products further characterize land cover at higher resolution. Here we will present the prototype for a suite of land cover indicators including land cover maps as well as charts depicting attributes such as composition by land cover class, statistical indicators of landscape characteristics, and tabular data summaries indispensable for communicating the status and trends of U.S. land cover at national, regional and state levels.",

The biogenic isoprene signature appears in the third principal component and anthropogenic signals in the following two. Evaluations of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulations of isoprene with airborne measurements are more accurate for suburban areas than for industrial areas. This study also compares model outputs to eight surface automated gas chromatograph (Auto-GC) measurements near the Houston ship channel industrial area during the nighttime and shows that modeled anthropogenic isoprene is underestimated by a factor of 10.60. This study employs a new simulation with a modified anthropogenic emissions inventory (constraining using the ratios of observed values versus simulated ones) that yields closer isoprene predictions at night with a reduction in the mean bias by 56.93%, implying that model-estimated isoprene emissions from the 2008 National Emission Inventory are underestimated in the city of Houston and that other climate models or chemistry and transport models using the same emissions inventory might also be underestimated in other Houston-like areas in the United States.",

            "abstract": "Rivers pose one of the most challenging environments to characterize. Their geometric complexity and continually changing position and character are difficult to measure under optimal circumstances. Further compounding the problem is the often inaccessibility of these areas around the globe. Yet details of the river bank position and bed elevation are essential elements in the construction of accurate predictive river models. To meet this challenge, remote sensing imagery is first used to initialize the construction of advanced high resolution river circulation models. In turn, such models are applied to dynamically interpret remotely-sensed surface features.\nA method has been developed to automatically extract water and shoreline locations from arbitrarily sourced high resolution (~1m gsd) visual spectrum imagery without recourse to the spectral or color information. The approach relies on quantifying the difference in image texture between the relatively smooth water surface and the comparatively rough surface of surrounding land. Processing the segmented land/water interface results in ordered, continuous shoreline coordinates that bound river model construction. In the absence of observed bed elevations, one of several available analytic bathymetry cross-sectional relations are applied to complete the river model configuration. Successful application of this approach to the Snohomish River, WA and the Pearl River, MS are demonstrated.\nOnce constructed, a hydrodynamic model of the river model can also be applied to unravel the dynamics responsible for observed surface features in the imagery. At a creek-river confluence in the Potomac River, MD, an ebb tide front observed in the imagery is analyzed using the model. The result is knowledge that an ebb shoal located just outside of the creek must be present and is essential for front formation. Furthermore, the front is found to be persistent throughout the tidal cycle, although it changes sign between ebb and flood phases. The presence of the creek only minimally modifies the underlying currents.",

            "abstract": "The formation and cycling of reactive nitrogen in the atmosphere has important implications for air quality and the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere. Snowpack NO3- photolysis provides a source of oxidants (e.g. OH, O3) and oxidant precursors (e.g. NOx) to the overlying boundary layer in remote, snow-covered regions. We have developed a parameterization for calculating the depth dependence of actinic flux in snowpack, and have incorporated it into a global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem. We use the model to estimate the flux and redistribution of nitrogen in Antarctic and Greenland snowpacks due to snow NO3- photolysis, and examine the implications for ice core NO3- concentration and isotope observations. The modeled potential flux of NOx from Antarctic snow (3-8x108 molec cm-2 s-1) and e-folding depths of ultraviolet actinic flux (26-80 cm) are comparable to observations. Antarctic boundary layer total nitrate (HNO3+NO3-), NOx, and OH concentrations are increased by an order of magnitude and boundary layer O3 concentrations are roughly doubled when snowpack photodenitrification is included in GEOS-Chem. The model-calculated nitrogen recycling factor (NRF) suggests that NO3- is recycled multiple times per year over the majority of the Antarctic continent. NO3- remains in the snow photolytic zone for at least 0.65 to 24 years, and depends on the snow accumulation rate. GEOS-Chem is also used to compare primary deposition of NO3- to the snow surface originating from long-range transport (FPRI), the re-deposition of photo-produced NOx to the snow surface (FPD), and the upward flux of NOx from the snow (FNOx) to examine nitrogen recycling and redistribution across Antarctica. FPD is larger than FPRI across much of Antarctica, suggesting large-scale redistribution of nitrogen across the entire continent. The utility of nitrogen isotopes measurements in Antarctic ice cores in assessing the degree of post-depositional processing across the Antarctic continent is also investigated.\nPreliminary results of the flux and redistribution of nitrogen in Greenland snowpacks due to snow NO3- photolysis and the implications for ice core NO3- concentration and isotope records in Greenland will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "Peatlands cover only 3% of the Earth’s surface, yet store a third of soil carbon. Increasing global temperatures have the potential to change peatlands from a net sink to a net source of atmospheric carbon. N is a limiting nutrient in oligotrophic Sphagnum-dominated peatlands and biological N2 fixation likely supplies a significant but unknown fraction of N inputs. Moreover, environmental controls on diazotrophic community composition in N-limited peatlands are poorly constrained. Thus, improved understanding of feedbacks between the CH4 and N cycles is critical for predicting future changes to CH4 flux from peat bogs. We coupled measurements of N2 fixation activity measured by the acetylene (C2H2) reduction assay (ARA) with molecular analyses of expression and diversity of nifH genes encoding the molybdenum (Mo)-containing nitrogenase from two peat bogs in the Marcell Experimental Forest, Minnesota, USA. The top 10 cm of peat was sampled from the high CH4 flux S1 bog and the low CH4 flux Zim bog in April and June 2014. Despite similar N concentrations in the top 10 cm of both bogs (0.5-1.0 µM NO2-+NO3- and 2-3 µM NH4+), the S1 bog displayed variable ARA activity (1-100 nmol C2H4 h-1 g-1) whereas the Zim bog had consistently low ARA activity (<1 nmol C2H4 h-1 g-1). Highest ARA activity was measured in June from S1 bog hollows with higher moisture content incubated without O2 in the light (20-100 nmol C2H4 h-1 g-1). Dissolved Fe (1-25 µM) was higher in hollow vs. hummock samples, and at S1 vs. Zim bog, while dissolved V (4-14 nM) was consistently higher than Mo (1-4 nM), suggesting that alternative V or Fe-containing nitrogenases might be present in these bogs. In contrast, Cu, an essential micronutrient for aerobic methanotrophs, was higher in hummocks (25-48 nM) than hollows (6-17 nM). The facultative methanotroph Methylocella was the dominant diazotroph in the S1 bog based on high throughput next generation sequencing of nifH cDNA amplicons. Given previous reports of C2H2 inhibition of methanotrophy, we measured CH4 consumption in the presence or absence of 1% C2H2. Preliminary results suggest minimal effect of C2H2 on CH4 oxidation. Future measurements of 15N2 incorporation coupled to molecular analysis will elucidate whether methanotroph diazotrophy was suppressed by C2H2 in ARA incubations.",

            "abstract": "Streaming potentials (SP) are generated when polar fluids such as groundwater flow through porous media that have charged mineral surfaces. This is due to the flow-shearing of the diffuse layer of the electric double layer (EDL), which is known to form in the fluid phase at the fluid-rock interface. Previous works have suggested that the EDL vanishes at high pore-fluid ionic strengths resulting in vanishing SP signals. However, recent observations in sea-water intrusion applications by Jackson and coworkers indicate that measurable SP signals are obtainable in flows of fluids with high ionic strengths through silica sand. We demonstrate the repeatability of these observations through a series of laboratory flow experiments performed on 98% silica sand in a falling-head permeameter with brines of concentrations ranging from 0.001M to about 5 M NaCl. The results of the experiments, which clearly show measurable SP signals even at the highest concentration of 5 M NaCl, are reported. They are also used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity and electrokinetic coupling coefficient. The linearity assumption for the relation between pressure and SP differentials is evaluated for high pore-water NaCl concentrations. Additionally, displacement of one brine by another of different NaCl concentration yields dramatic transient SP responses that may be harnessed in the development of early-detection/warning technologies for sea-water intrusion applications.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

            "abstract": "Remotely triggered seismicity is the process by which an earthquake at one location initiates others after a time delay ranging from seconds to days, over distances up to thousands of kilometers. Candidate mechanisms have been proposed, but none specifically address the role of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas bubble growth in groundwater as a driver of remote seismic triggering in active volcanic and geothermal regions, where shallow crustal CO2 gas is abundant. In the present study, we hypothesize that a seismic wave from a distant source can initiate rapid gas bubble growth in CO2-rich groundwater, resulting in a persistent increase in pore fluid pressure and a reduction of effective stress, which can trigger failure on a critically loaded geologic fault. Under conditions representative of a confined aquifer, a Berea sandstone core flooded with an aqueous CO2 solution was subjected to a six-period burst of 0.05–0.3 Hz, 0.1–0.4 MPa confining stress oscillations. After the oscillations were terminated, the pore fluid pressure exceeded its initial value by 13–60 cm equivalent freshwater head, scaling with the amplitude and frequency – a surplus that is consistent with borehole water level changes [Roeloffs et al. (1995) USGS Open File Report, 95-42] observed in response to the June 28 1992 MW 7.3 Landers, California earthquake Rayleigh wave in Parkfield and Long Valley caldera, California, where remotely triggered earthquakes occurred [Hill et al. (1993) Science, 260(5114); Hill et al. (1995) Journal of Geophysical Research, 100(B7)]. Our experimental results indicate that seismically initiated gas bubble growth in groundwater is a physically plausible mechanism for remote seismic triggering in active volcanic and geothermal regions, suggesting that the aqueous CO2 saturation state in a confined aquifer may be used to assess susceptibility to remote seismic triggering.",

The spring phenology of deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) is predicted using the cumulative thermal summation with chilling requirements, and the autumn phenology is jointly regulated by temperature and photoperiod. The phenology of shrubland and grassland is sensitive to temperature, except for sites with climatological soil temperature > 12 °C, where plant phenology is controlled by water availability. The model represents frost hardening in evergreen needleleaf forest. An off-line version of the model is evaluated against carbon flux measurements at 145 FLUXNET sites across a wide range of ecosystem types. The simulated seasonality of the gross primary productivity (GPP) has high correlations R > 0.95 with observations at 15 out 20 deciduous broadleaf sites.

            "abstract": "The role of surface-water flooding in controlling fluxes of water and carbon between the land and the atmosphere is increasingly recognized in studies of the Earth system. Simultaneous advances in remote earth observation and large-scale land-surface and hydrological modeling promise improvements in our ability to understand these linkages, and suggest that improvements in prediction of river flow and inundation extents may result. Here we present an analysis of newly-available observational estimates of surface water inundation obtained through satellite Earth observation with results from simulations produced by using the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land-surface model operating at 0.5 degree resolution over the African continent. The model was forced with meteorological input from the WATCH Forcing Data for the period 1981-2001 and sensitivity to various model configurations and parameter settings were tested. Both the PDM and TOPMODEL sub-grid scale runoff generation schemes were tested for parameter sensitivities, with the evaluation focussing on simulated river discharge in sub-catchments of the Congo, Nile, Niger, Orange, Okavango and Zambezi rivers. It was found that whilst the water balance in each of the catchments can be simulated with acceptable accuracy, the individual responses of each river vary between model configurations so that there is no single runoff parameterization scheme or parameter values that yields optimal results across all catchments. We trace these differences to the model’s representation of sub-surface flow and make some suggestions to improve the performance of large-scale land-surface models for use in similar applications. Our findings also demonstrate links between episodes of extensive surface water flooding and large-scale climatic indices, although the pattern of correlations contains a level of spatial and temporal detail that warrants careful attention to the climatology of individual situations. These findings suggest that the use of Earth observation data together with improved models of large-scale hydrology have the potential to improve our ability to predict surface-water flooding and to develop our understanding of the role of flooding in driving components of the water and carbon cycles.",

Decreases in permafrost and changes in hydrological connectivity have changed the movement of ions and nutrients across the landscape. The combined effects of increased temperature and altered terrestrial inputs can lead to changes in lake productivity as well. Although all of the Arctic is warming, Greenland has demonstrated the greatest average rate of temperature increase over the past few decades relative to other areas. Therefore, we assessed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) within 26 lakes in southwestern Greenland from the ice sheet towards the coast during the summers of 2013 and 2014. In these lakes, DOC concentrations ranged from 4-40 ppm and were fairly consistent across the Arctic growing season. However, these results indicate widespread changes in DOC over the last decade, ranging from no change to a 60% reduction of in-lake concentrations. We hypothesize that rapid climate change in the region has led to these changes in carbon availability and processing across the landscape and within lake basins. While the exact mechanisms are still being explored, such changes within a short time scale can have implications for carbon cycling in the Arctic and globally in the near future.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic has emerged as an important focal point for the study of climate change. Arctic vegetation is particularly sensitive to warming conditions and likely to exhibit shifts in species composition, phenology and productivity under changing climate. Modeling of Arctic tundra vegetation requires representation of the heterogeneous tundra landscape, which includes representation of individual plant functional types (PFT). Vegetation exhibits unique spectral characteristics that can be harnessed to discriminate plant types and develop quantitative vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. We have combined high resolution multi-spectral remote sensing from the WorldView-2 satellite with LiDAR-derived digital elevation models to characterize the tundra landscape in four 100m X 100m sites within the Barrow Environmental Observatory, a 3021 hectare research reserve located at the northern most location on the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain. Classification of landscape PFT's using spectral and topographic characteristics yields spatial regions with expectedly similar vegetation characteristics. A field campaign was conducted during peak growing season (June - August) to collect vegetation surveys from a number of 1m x 1m plots in the study region, which were then analyzed for distribution of vegetation types in the plots. Statistical relationships were developed between spectral and topographic characteristics and vegetation type distributions at the vegetation plots. These derived relationships were employed to statistically upscale the vegetation distributions for the landscape based on spectral characteristics. We will describe two versions of PFT upscaling from WorldView-2 imagery: 1) a version computed from multiple imagery through the growing season and 2) a version computed from a single image in the middle of the growing season. This approach allowed us to test the degree to which including phenology helps predict PFT distribution. Ground-truthing was performed using both sets of PFT estimates to characterize uncertainty. Early results show uncertainty exists in wet and inundated areas where bryophyte moss are overestimated. Further investigation will be done for areas of uncertainty and improving our upscaling algorithms.",

            "abstract": "The El Arraiche area is situated in the southern part of the Gulf of Cádiz, roughly between 35° and 35°45’ north and 6°30’ and 7°15’ west. This area contains mud volcanoes, cold-water coral (CWC) mounds, contourite drifts and tectonic ridges (Fig. 1). CWC mounds are present both on top and at the foot of the Pen Duick Escarpment (Van Rooij et al., 2011; Vandorpe et al., 2014), but recent multibeam and seismic data indicate the ubiquitous presence of small mounds both buried and on the seafloor (Fig.1). Information regarding the environmental conditions in which these ecosystems thrived can be derived from the nearby contourite systems, as they contain an oceanographic as well as a climatic imprint. In this area, all of the topographic features interfere with the contourite deposits. The Quaternary Pen Duick drift for example displays pinch-out due to the uplifting Pen Duick Escarpment (Fig. 1), a Christmas-tree structure due to the outflow of mud from the nearby Gemini Mud Volcano and CWC mounds are present in certain parts of the moat (Vandorpe et al., 2014). Increased bottom currents are observed at the foot of the Pen Duick Escarpment, Renard ridge and Vernadsky ridge (up to 10 cm/s). As mounded drift deposits start occurring after the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution in the Pen Duick drift, enhanced bottom currents may be present from then onwards. The presence of (modified) Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) is inferred (Vandorpe et al. (2014) and references therein) and likely contributes to the formation of the Pen Duick drift, while Mediterranean Outflow Water is only present at greater water depths (from 900 meter onwards). The formation of the other drift systems is the subject of ongoing research.\nVan Rooij, D., Blamart, D., De Mol, L., Mienis, F., Pirlet, H., Wehrmann, L.M., Barbieri, R., Maignien, L., Templer, S.P., de Haas, H., Hebbeln, D., Frank, N., Larmagnat, S., Stadnitskaia, A., Stivaletta, N., van Weering, T., Zhang, Y., Hamoumi, N., Cnudde, V., Duyck, P., Henriet, J.P., 2011.

            "abstract": "A planet's thermosphere affects the electrodynamics of its magnetosphere through plasma-neutral collisions in the ionosphere, which tend to make ionospheric plasma move with the thermosphere while magnetic forces tend to make it move with the magnetosphere. The resulting deformations of the magnetic field as well as modifications of plasma flow in magnetospheres of different planets can be compared in terms of dimensionless parameters. One of the parameters (not often considered) is the ratio of electron-neutral collision frequency to electron gyrofrequency at the bottom of the ionosphere: if its value is >>1, thermospheric flow could be directly transmitted to the magnetosphere, and the fundamental decoupling of magnetosphere motions from planet/atmosphere motions first proposed by Gold (1959) would no longer apply. The increasingly popular interpretation of Saturn's puzzling magnetospheric periodicities as the result of some type of neutral-wind dynamo raises the question: is it a phenomenon unique to Saturn, or could something similar be occurring (albeit masked by a much more obvious rotational modulation of a tilted dipole) also at other planets? A first look at the relevant dimensionless parameters suggests that, for the three planets considered, neutral-wind dynamo effects in the magnetosphere should be most significant at Earth, less so at Saturn, and least of all at Jupiter.",

            "abstract": "The aim of the CO2QUEST project (Impact of the Quality of CO2 on Storage and Transport) is to investigate the effect of typical impurities in the CO2 stream captured from fossil fuel power plants on its safe and economic transportation and deep geologic storage. An important part of this EU funded project is to enhance the understanding of typical impurity effects in a CO2 stream regarding the performance of the storage. Based on the experimental site Heletz in Israel, where injection tests of water as well as of super-critical pure and impure CO2 will be conducted, numerical simulations are performed. These studies illustrate flow and transport of CO2 and brine as well as impurities induced chemical reactions in relation to changes in the reservoir, e.g. porosity, permeability, pH-value, and mineral composition. Using different THC codes (TOUGH2-ECO2N, TOUGHREACT, PFLOTRAN), the spatial distribution of CO2 and impurities, both in the supercritical and aqueous phases, are calculated. The equation of state (EOS) of above numerical codes are properly modified to deal with binary/tertiary gas mixtures (e.g. CO2-N2 or CO2-SO2). In addition, simulations for a push-pull test of about 10 days duration are performed, which will be validated against experimental field data.\nPreliminary results are as follows: (a) As expected, the injection of SO2 leads to a strong decrease in pH-value, hence, the total dissolution of carbonate minerals could be observed. (b) Due to the acidic attack on clay minerals , which is enhanced compared to a pure CO2 dissolution, a higher amount of metal ions are released, in particular Fe2+ and Mg2+ by a factor of 25 and 10, respectively. Whereas secondary precipitation occurs only for sulphur minerals, namely anhydrite and pyrite. (c) The co-injection of CO2 with N2 changes physical properties of the gas mixture. Increasing N2 contents induces density decrease of the gas mixture, resulting in faster and wider plume migration compared to the pure CO2 injection case.",

            "abstract": "Since 2010 several papers have been published that reveal a pattern of discrepancies between stratospheric aerosol data from the OSIRIS instrument, and other measurements and model simulations of volcanic plumes from Kasatochi, Sarychev Peak, and Nabro volcanoes. OSIRIS measurements show two discrepancies, a post-eruption lag in aerosol onset/increase, and a low bias in maximum stratospheric aerosol optical depth. Assumed robustness of the OSIRIS data drove various conclusions, some controversial, such as the contention that the June 2011 Nabro plume was strictly tropospheric, and entered the stratosphere indirectly via the Asian monsoon. Those conclusions were driven by OSIRIS data and a Smithsonian Institution report of strictly tropospheric injection heights. We address the issue of Nabro’s eruption chronology and injection height, and the reasons for the OSIRIS aerosol discrepancies.\nWe lay out the time line of Nabro injection height with geostationary image data, and stratospheric plume evolution after eruption onset using retrievals of sulfur dioxide and sulfate aerosol. The observations show that Nabro injected sulfur directly into the stratosphere upon the initial eruption on 12/13 June, and again on 16 June 2011. Next, OSIRIS data are examined for non-volcanic and volcanically perturbed conditions. In non-volcanic conditions OSIRIS profiles systematically terminate 1-4 km above the tropopause. Additionally, OSIRIS profiles terminate when 750 nm aerosol extinction exceeds ~0.0025 km-1, a level that is commonly exceeded after volcanic injections.\nOur findings largely resolve the discrepancies in published works involving OSIRIS aerosol data and offer a correction to the Nabro injection-height and eruption chronology.",

            "abstract": "About half of the terrestrial biosphere is under direct human influence through land management (i.e., agricultural areas and managed forests). Changing management practices is therefore a promising avenue for climate change mitigation. The mitigation potential arising from changes in land management practices has been mainly evaluated in terms of carbon storage and GHG emissions [2]. On the other hand, these practices can also influence climate by altering the physical properties of the land surface, but these effects have received less attention so far.\nHere we show that peak temperatures during heat heaves can be attenuated through cropland albedo management [2]. We first present observational evidence that a substantial summer albedo increase can be obtained by switching from conventional to no-till agriculture. Then, using a regional climate model, we investigate the biogeophysical effect of a full conversion to no-till management over Europe. The cooling effect owing to albedo increase under no-till farming appears to be strongly amplified during warm events. This is due to the low cloud cover during these events, thus leading to a more efficient radiative cooling from albedo change. This implies a strong potential of no-till farming to mitigate heat wave impacts. The reduced evaporation associated with the crop residue cover tends to counteract the albedo-induced cooling, but during hot days the albedo effect remains the dominating factor. For heatwave summer days the local cooling effect gained from no-till practice is of the order of 2 degrees. These findings strongly suggest that the biogeophysical effect of management practices should be considered in the design of climate mitigation policies involving land management.\n",

Southern Ocean sediments from ODP Site 1094 reveal a spike in authigenic uranium 127,000 years ago, within the last interglacial, reflecting decreased oxygenation of deep water by Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). Increased deep storage of respired carbon due to this circulation event may explain an observed decline in atmospheric CO2 at this time. Unlike ice age reductions in AABW, the interglacial stagnation event appears decoupled from open ocean conditions and may have resulted from coastal freshening due to mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet. AABW reduction coincided with increased North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation, and the subsequent reinvigoration in AABW coincided with reduced NADW formation. Alternation of deep water formation between the Antarctic and the North Atlantic, believed to characterize ice ages, apparently also occurs in warm climates.",

            "abstract": "There has been a recent increase in the number of earthquakes reported in proximity of active oil and gas fields. In particular, the occurrence of a sequence of damaging earthquakes in May 2012 near the Cavone oil field, in Northern Italy, raised the question of whether these earthquakes might have been triggered, or, if not, if future activities might trigger other damaging events. Production and injection of fluids in the underground reservoirs are known to be capable of triggering seismicity by inducing slip on seismogenic faults. However, the effects of injection and production on fault stability in real fields are not always intuitively obvious, and require the development of new-generation coupled flow-geomechanical models that capture the effect of multiphase poromechanics on faults. We study, by way of numerical modeling and simulation, the potential for induced seismicity at the Cavone field. Using a coupled flow and geomechanics model of the field that honors reservoir geology and historical well schedule, we simulate oil production and water injection in the field for a period of three decades leading up to the earthquake sequence. We calculate the change in Coulomb stress on the bounding Mirandola fault, which sourced the May 29, 2012 M 5.8 earthquake. This quantity varies in space and evolves in time with changing pore pressure and total stress in the reservoir. A novel and important aspect of our work is the identification of a potential instability mechanism for a bounding fault at the edge of a reservoir experiencing pressure depletion. The discontinuity in pore pressure across the fault means that there is a discontinuity in effective normal stress and that, therefore, the Coulomb failure criterion must be evaluated locally on both sides of the fault. We track the evolution of the Coulomb stress at the earthquake hypocenter and compare it with the regional tectonic stressing rate to conclude in favor of tectonic origin of the earthquake. In addition, analysis of the locations of aftershocks of the May 2012 sequence shows a lack of seismicity in the area where the stressing rates from contraction of the reservoir are largest. This observed lack of seismic activity within 1–2 km from the reservoir suggests that fluid production and injection from the Cavone field was not an important driver for the observed seismicity.",

These structures have been implicated in crevasse propagation and ice shelf collapse; the Larsen B ice shelf was observed to have a large amount of melt lakes present on its surface just before its collapse in 2002.\nThrough modelling the transport of heat through the surface of the Larsen C ice shelf, where melt lakes have also been observed, this work aims to provide new insights into the ways in which melt lakes are forming and the effect that meltwater filling crevasses on the ice shelf will have. This will enable an assessment of the role of meltwater in triggering ice shelf collapse.\nThe Antarctic Peninsula, where Larsen C is situated, has warmed several times the global average over the last century and this ice shelf has been suggested as a candidate for becoming fully saturated with meltwater by the end of the current century.\nHere we present preliminary results of a mathematical model of heat transfer through an idealised ice shelf. When forced with automatic weather station data from Larsen C, surface melting and the subsequent meltwater accumulation and melt lake development are demonstrated through the modelled results.\nInvestigating the role of meltwater in ice shelf stability is key as collapse can affect ocean circulation and temperature, and cause a loss of habitat. Additionally, it can cause a loss of the buttressing effect that ice shelves can have on their tributary glaciers, thus allowing the glaciers to accelerate, contributing to sea level rise.",

            "abstract": "Reservoir engineering has becomes more complex to deal with current challenges, so core analysts must understand and model pore geometries and fluid behaviors at pores scales more rapidly and realistically. We introduce an industry-unique direct hydrodynamic pore flow simulator that operates on pore geometries from digital rock models obtained using microCT or 3D scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. The PVT and rheological models used in the simulator represent real reservoir fluids. Fluid-solid interactions are introduced using distributed micro-scale wetting properties. The simulator uses density functional approach applied for hydrodynamics of complex systems.\nThis talk covers selected applications of the simulator. We performed microCT scanning of six different carbonate rock samples from homogeneous limestones to vuggy carbonates. From these, we constructed digital rock models representing pore geometries for the simulator. We simulated nonreactive tracer flow in all six digital models using a digital fluid description that included a passive tracer solution. During the simulation, we evaluated the composition of the effluent. Results of tracer flow simulations corresponded well with experimental data of nonreactive tracer floods for the same carbonate rock types. This simulation data of the non-reactive tracer flow can be used to calculate the volume of the rock accessible by the fluid, which can be further used to predict response of a porous medium to a reactive fluid. The described digital core analysis workflow provides a basis for a wide variety of activities, including input to design acidizing jobs and evaluating treatment efficiency and EOR economics.\nDigital rock multiphase flow simulations of a scanned carbonate rock evaluated the effect of wettability on flow properties. Various wetting properties were tested: slightly oil wet, slightly water wet, and water wet. Steady-state relative permeability simulations yielded curves for all three ranges of wetting properties. The wetting variation affected phase mobility and residual phase saturations for primary oil flood and floods with varying ratios of oil and water.",

We present the application of DES toward two case studies – basal crevasses and calving blocks – to illustrate the potential of the model to aid in understanding calving processes. Among the advantages of using DES are: its unstructured meshes which adaptively resolve zones of high interest; its use of multiple rheologies to simulate different types of dynamic behavior; and its explicit and parallel numerical core which both make the implementation of different boundary conditions easy and the model highly scalable.\nWe examine the initiation and development of both basal crevasses and calving blocks through time using visco-elasto-plastic rheology. Employing a brittle-to-ductile transition zone (BDTZ) based on local strain rate shows that the style and development of brittle features like crevasses differs markedly on the rheological parameters. Brittle and ductile behavior are captured by Mohr-Coulomb elastoplasticity and Maxwell viscoelasticity, respectively. We explore the parameter spaces which define these rheologies (including temperature) as well as the BDTZ threshold (shown in the literature as 10-7 Pa s), using time-to-failure as a metric for accuracy within the model. As the time it takes for a block of ice to fail can determine an iceberg’s size, this work has implications for calving laws.",

We investigate this by using a parcel model with different configurations of salt spray size distribution to assess the approximate power required to generate an albedo increase sufficient to approximately offset a doubling of carbon dioxide. Our findings show that this question depends on the spray generation method employed. We find that for all three methods of spray generation investigated (supercritical fluid, Taylor cone, and Rayleigh jet), distributions of salt particles with median dry diameters in the range Dm = 30 to 100 nm are the are the most effective in terms of brightening per power consumed in generating the particles. Size distributions that resemble the present day emitted sea-spray distribution are not particularly efficient for brightening clouds. The Rayleigh jet method is found to be the most energy efficient method when compared to the supercritical fluid and Taylor cone-jet method. We also find that care needs to be taken when using droplet activation parameterizations: for the concentrations considered Aitken particles do not result in a decrease in the total albedo, as was found in a recent study, and such findings are likely a result of the parameterization's inability to simulate the effect of swollen aerosol.",

            "abstract": "In 2010, NASA’s Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project implemented a process for registering Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for data products distributed by Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). For the first 3 years, ESDIS evolved the process involving the data provider community in the development of processes for creating and assigning DOIs, and guidelines for the landing page. To accomplish this, ESDIS established two DOI User Working Groups: one for reviewing the DOI process whose recommendations were submitted to ESDIS in February 2014; and the other recently tasked to review and further develop DOI landing page guidelines for ESDIS approval by end of 2014.\nESDIS has recently upgraded the DOI system from a manually-driven system to one that largely automates the DOI process. The new automated feature include: a) reviewing the DOI metadata, b) assigning of opaque DOI name if data provider chooses, and c) reserving, registering, and updating the DOIs. The flexibility of reserving the DOI allows data providers to embed and test the DOI in the data product metadata before formally registering with EZID. The DOI update process allows the changing of any DOI metadata except the DOI name unless the name has not been registered. Currently, ESDIS has processed a total of 557 DOIs of which 379 DOIs are registered with EZID and 178 are reserved with ESDIS.\nThe DOI incorporates several metadata elements that effectively identify the data product and the source of availability. Of these elements, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) attribute has the very important function of identifying the landing page which describes the data product. ESDIS in consultation with data providers in the Earth Science community is currently developing landing page guidelines that specify the key data product descriptive elements to be included on each data product’s landing page.\nThis poster will describe in detail the unique automated process and underlying system implemented by ESDIS for registering DOIs, as well as some of the lessons learned from the development of the process. In addition, this paper will summarize the recommendations made by the DOI Process and DOI Landing Page User Working Groups, and the procedures developed for implementing those recommendations.",

The tunnel-packer system controls inflow from the MI shear zone to an IAEA radioprotection controlled zone in the AU tunnel at GTS [1]. After detailed characterisation of the shear zone including colloid/radionuclide migration tests [2] over scales from 0.1-6m, a solid bentonite source was installed in a borehole intersecting the shear zone in May 2014.\nThe source was installed on a purpose-built packer system that can be overcored at the end of the experiment. The bentonite source includes labelled synthetic clays, radionuclide and dye tracers to better characterise colloid generation and near-field solute/colloid-associated radionuclide transport. Three near-field boreholes intersect the shear zone within 10cm of the bentonite source to allow sampling of the groundwater around the bentonite.

In this paper, a methodology to assess the impact of land use change on energy demand and Green House Gas emissions using remote sensing data is presented. The methodology development was carried out using region of Stuttgart, Germany as the case study for the time period of 1990 to 2006. The first step involved using Corine land cover corresponding to the years 1990, 2000 and 2006 in conjunction with the administrative boundary map of the region of Stuttgart to assess the land use change from 1990 to 2006. The second step of the methodology involved using ATKIS building data of 2004 in conjunction with the land use data of 1990, and 2000 to identify the buildings in 1990 and 2000 and assess the land use conversion to built areas due to urbanization. Also the building types were identified, and the energy usage for heating and cooling was modeled using local guidelines. As the final step, the GHG emissions associated with heating and energy demand was estimated for the years 1990, 2000 and 2004 using the empirical relation set by Öko-Institute (2011). The results of the study indicate that there has been a significant increase in urban residential built surfaces (17%) and decrease in urban greenery, forest and agricultural areas during the time period of 1990 to 2004. The increase in residential built surfaces has resulted in an increase of electricity and heating demand and a subsequent increase in GHG emissions(14%). The methodology presented in this paper brings forth the use of remote sensing to estimate and predict GHG emissions resulting from land use changes.",

            "abstract": "Transport by fluid flow is a very complex problem. Any type of velocity gradient introduces distortion of the original air masses which, over time, can become extraordinarily severe. In Earth’s thermosphere, it is however widely presumed that viscosity hinders both horizontal and vertical wind shears, and hence rapidly attenuates any gradients that might occur over distances shorter than synoptic scales. As a result, particle trajectories predicted by current models are often relatively simple, so that transport effects only slowly disperse and mix air masses. This means that regions of perturbed chemical composition, formed for example by intense aurora, would be expected to remain intact for many hours or even days. However, our observations show that this simple picture does not hold in practice; wind fields in the thermosphere have much more local-scale structure than predicated by models, at least in the auroral zone. These local small scale structures complicate air parcel trajectories enormously, relative to typical expectations. In Alaska, three Scanning Doppler Imaging Fabry-Perot interferometers are currently in operation. A single SDI instrument can simultaneously observe the thermospheric wind’s line-of-sight component in 115 (typically) independent look directions. From these data it is possible to reconstruct time-resolved two-dimensional maps of the horizontal vector wind field, and use these to infer forward and backward air parcel trajectories over time. Tracing parcel trajectories through a given geographic location maps where they will go from there (forward tracing in time) and where they come from previously (history of parcels or tracing back in time). Results show that transport of thermospheric neutral species in the presence of the local scale wind gradients that are actually observed is far more complicated than what current models typically predict.",

To investigate productivity conditions at those upwelling systems at any time and at the global level would be of great use for C export estimations and climate modeling, since primary production and C export in those systems is of major importance in controlling Earth's climate.\nTo assess the value of the diatom sediment record at the global level, total abundance of marine diatoms was determined for 730 sites distributed by the five most important coastal upwelling systems of the modern ocean, and compared to several meaningful ecological parameters.\nInvestigations of the satellite estimated primary productivity; upwelling index; water column physical properties and nutrient content, reveal a clear relation between sediment diatom abundance and primary production - although different between areas. Furthermore, upwelled waters [Si] appear as a determinant factor of the observed global diatom distribution.",

            "abstract": "The plate boundary megathrust at the Japan Trench is remarkable due to its capability for a wide range of fault slip styles. In addition to the extraordinarily large amount of coseismic slip (several 10’s of meters) that reached the seafloor during the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, the the Japan Trench is also known host slow earthquakes. The location of these slow earthquakes coincide with the rupture area of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake; one was observed to occur in the month before the 2011 earthquake and was likely ongoing during the earthquake. This shows that the frictional behavior of the Japan Trench megathrust is complex and thus failure can occur in a variety of styles.\nSamples of the plate boundary fault zone in the Tohoku region were recovered ~7 km from the Japan Trench axis, within the region of largest coseismic slip during the Tohoku earthquakes, during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 343, the Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project (JFAST). We used these samples in laboratory friction experiments in order to examine the slip behavior of the shallow Tohoku megathrust. In our tests, we sheared the samples at 10 µm/s to establish a steady shear geometry and friction level and subsequently decrease the slip velocity to 2.7 nm/s, equal to the convergence rate between the Pacific and North American plates (85 mm/yr) and thus simulating realistically slow fault slip rates. Regular stick-slip behavior was observed soon after the velocity decrease but ceases as friction evolves to a new residual level. Shearing then mostly proceeds as stable creep, however infrequent friction perturbations are observed which occur two to three times over several mm. Unlike normal stick-slip behavior, we observe stress increases before the stress drop so that the friction level before and after the event are similar. The stress drop is ~0.015 in friction (~100 kPa) and occurs over several hours; therefore we interpret these events to be laboratory-generated slow earthquakes. No slip instabilities were observed in friction experiments conducted at higher slip rates using the same sample, suggesting that such behavior is a consequence of plate-rate slip velocities. Our results demonstrate that the shallow Tohoku megathrust is capable of generating slow slip instabilities as well as creep at tectonic convergence rates.",

In this fluid-solid system the fluid (magma) is confined by an elastic unbounded medium that represents the surrounding rock. Our aim is to associate wave behavior with mechanical and geometrical conduit characteristics. The source is assumed to be at a point along the conduit centered axis medium are constructed in both cases as linear combinations of particular solutions.\nWithin the fluid such solutions are spherical standing waves that are smooth at the origins. In the elastic solid region the field is constructed with monopoles and dipoles for the P waves and spheroidal dipoles for SV waves. The particular solutions satisfy the elastodynamic equations that govern the wave motion at those media and are associated to origins (selected points) distributed along the conduit axis. For the surrounding rock the solutions are sources that satisfy Sommerfeld’s radiation condition. These sets of solutions are assumed to be complete. This conjecture is exact in 2D acoustic problems. The conduit can be closed or open at the ends and the surrounding elastic domain is unbounded. In order to find the coefficients of Trefftz’s wave expansions, boundary conditions at the fluid-solid interface (null shear and continuity of pressures and normal velocities) are satisfied in the least squares sense. The solution is obtained in the frequency domain and the source time function can be introduced using Fourier analysis.\nRegardless the low order of the formulation our results display a rich variety of behaviors. For a uniform infinite cylinder we reproduced the exact analytical solution. In addition, this approach allows identifying some important effects of the conduit geometry, including changes of sections. Lateral and longitudinal resonances of irregular axi-symmetric conduits are well resolved. The stiffness of the solid domain with respect to the fluid compressibility is explored regarding the effects of changing fluid and solid properties. Our analytical approach can be useful to understand volcanic conduit dynamics from the interpretation of the observed seismic wave field.",

            "abstract": "The inter-annual variability of the Mars atmosphere is dominated by the occasional occurrence of global-scale dust storms (GDS) in the southern summer season. The intermittent occurrence of such storms represents a major unsolved problem of atmospheric physics. To aid in studying these events, we have compiled a catalog of Mars years including such storms (n=9) and Mars years without global-scale storms (n=11) through the year 2013. We use these samples to explore the question of a possible relationship linking GDS occurrence with the variability of the orbital angular momentum of Mars with respect to the solar system barycenter (LMars). We find that a remarkably simple and direct relationship links the occurrence and non-occurrence of GDS on Mars with the variability of this dynamical quantity. All of the GDS became planet encircling during periods when LMars was increasing or near maxima. Statistical significance is obtained for the clustering tendencies of LMars waveform phases for key subsets of the catalog, including the mid-season storms (as defined below) and the years without storms. A systematic progression is found in the phasing of the LMars waveforms with respect to the annual cycle of solar irradiance for the following three GDS categories: The early season GDS (1977 and 2001, initiating near Ls=204° and Ls=185° respectively), the mid-season storms (1956, 1971, 1982, 1994, and 2007; Ls=208° through Ls=262°), and the late season GDS (1924 and 1973, Ls=310° and Ls=300°).  Rising values of LMars immediately prior to and during the Mars dust storm season appear to be a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the initiation of GDS events. Factors internal to the Mars climate system, including the spatial redistribution of dust from year to year, also appear to play an important role in determining whether a GDS may occur in any particular Mars year. A testable physical hypothesis has recently been formulated, and an effort is now underway to more fully quantify and characterize the response of the Mars atmosphere to this aspect of solar system dynamical variability [Mischna et al., this meeting].

            "abstract": "The quantification of carbon dioxide concentrations and fluxes leaking from the subsurface into the atmosphere is highly relevant in several research fields such as climate change, CCS, volcanic activity, or earthquake monitoring. Many of the areas with elevated carbon dioxide degassing pose the problem that under the given situation a systematic investigation of the relevant processes is only possible to a limited extent (e.g. in terms of spatial extent, accessibility, hazardous conditions).\nThe upper Neckar valley in Southwest Germany is a region of enhanced natural subsurface CO2 concentrations and mass fluxes of Tertiary volcanic origin. At the beginning of the twentieth century several companies started industrial mining of CO2. The decreasing productivity of the CO2 springs led to the complete shutdown of the industry in 1995 and the existing boreholes were sealed. However, there are evidences that the reservoir, located in the deposits of the Lower Triassic, started to refill during the last 20 years. The CO2 springs replenished and a variety of different phenomena (e.g. mofettes and perished flora and fauna) indicate the active process of large scale CO2 exhalation. This easy-to-access site serves as a perfect example for a natural analog to a leaky CCS site, including abandoned boreholes and a suitable porous rock reservoir in the subsurface.\nDuring extensive field campaigns we applied several monitoring techniques like measurements of soil gas concentrations, mass fluxes, electrical resistivity, as well as soil and atmospheric parameters. The aim was to investigate and quantify mass fluxes and the effect of variations in e.g. temperature, soil moisture on the mass flux intensity. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of the vicinity to a mofette on soil parameters like electrical conductivity and soil CO2 concentrations.\nIn times of a changing climate due to greenhouse gases, regions featuring natural CO2 springs demand to be intensively investigated. Our results serve as a contribution to the development of site-specific monitoring networks at CCS sites, as well as a step forward to unravel the share of natural CO2 springs in the global carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution ocean models, which are eddy permitting and resolving, require large computing resources to produce centuries worth of data. Also, some previous studies have suggested that increasing resolution does not necessarily solve the problem of unresolved scales, because it simply introduces a new set of unresolved scales. Applying stochastic parameterisations to ocean models is one solution that is expected to improve the representation of small-scale (eddy) effects without increasing run-time. Stochastic parameterisation has been shown to have an impact in atmosphere-only models and idealised ocean models, but has not previously been studied in ocean general circulation models.\nHere we apply simple stochastic perturbations to the ocean temperature and salinity tendencies in the low-resolution coupled climate model, FAMOUS. The stochastic perturbations are implemented according to T(t) = T(t-1) + (∆T(t) + ξ(t)), where T is temperature or salinity, ΔT is the corresponding deterministic increment in one time step, and ξ(t) is Gaussian noise. We use high-resolution HiGEM data coarse-grained to the FAMOUS grid to provide information about the magnitude and spatio-temporal correlation structure of the noise to be added to the lower resolution model. Here we present results of adding white and red noise, showing the impacts of an additive stochastic perturbation on mean climate state and variability in an AOGCM.",

These trends have been inferred to record changes in coastal upwelling strength and source depth, due to shifts in the magnitude or position of upwelling-favorable surface wind stress and wind stress curl or due to change in global ocean stratification and thermocline depth. Modern studies of ocean fronts and near-coastal regions demonstrate that inclusion of submesoscale mixed-layer re-stratification is essential to characterization of upwelling and other near-surface processes. Using submesoscale-eddy-permitting ocean GCM experiments, we examine the adjustment of an idealized eastern boundary upwelling front to gradual changes in upwelling-favorable winds and large- (basin-) scale ocean stratification by considering variables such as frontal position, near-coastal stratification and upwelling source depth. We compare the stability of a warm (Pliocene-like) climate state in response to slow cooling to that of a cool (modern-like) climate state to slow warming. Further, we develop a simplified nonlinear layer model, with and without explicit parameterization of submesoscale eddy mixing, and evaluate its ability to capture the essential steady-state behavior of a coastal upwelling front.",

Recent data obtained on the environment research observatory (ERO) of Kervidy-Naizin, a 5 km² agricultural catchment located in France, revealed the role of water table fluctuations in wetlands and slopes on the variations in DOM composition and fluxes. Based on a detailed analysis of the variations of the seasonal patterns of stream DOM from 2001 to 2013, this study aims (i) to identify the main hydrological and climatic variables controlling DOM production and export (ii) to discuss the underlying mechanisms of these controls.\nThe time series of 12 years of daily DOM concentrations was divided into successive seasons based on hydrological functioning: i) continuous days of low water table levels in the riparian wetland soils (dry season), ii) progressive rewetting of the uppermost soil layers of the riparian wetland soils (season A), iii) hillslope water table rising and holding high (season B), iv) drawdown of the hillslope water-table, with less and less connection between topsoils and the stream (season C). Base flow and storm flow samples were also distinguished. Climate and hydrological variables and indices were included in partial least square regressions (PLSR) to explain variations of DOC concentrations and fluxes at annual and seasonal scales.\nMean annual concentrations (Cy) are much less variable than the annual fluxes (Fy) (from 4.9 to 7.5 mg DOC.L-1 and 5.4 to 39.7 kg DOC.ha-1.y-1). PLSR suggests that Cy variations are affected by antecedent drought conditions, while Fy variations are controlled by winter wetness.\nSeasons A, B and C export respectively between 0.3 and 17.2%, 64.3 and 95.7%, 3.5 and 23% of the annual DOM. Within each season, mean DOC concentrations decrease with time, especially when water fluxes increase. However, it remains above 2.1 mg.L-1 even during exceptionally wet winters. These results support the hypotheses of different sources located in the riparian zone and upslope zone, some of them subjected to quick exhaustion by flowing water, the others more stable, and both reconstituted during dryer periods.",

While on-board personnel constantly review instrument parameters and time series plots, there are an overwhelming number of items. Furthermore, directing the aircraft flight takes up much of the flight scientist time. Typically, a flight engineer is given the responsibility of reviewing the status of on-board instruments. While major issues like not receiving data are quickly identified during a flight, subtle issues like low but believable concentration measurements may go unnoticed. Therefore, it is critical to review data after a flight in near real time. The Airborne Data Processing and Analysis (ADPAA) software package used by the University of North Dakota automates the post-processing of aircraft flight data. Utilizing scripts to process the measurements recorded by data acquisition systems enables the generation of data files within an hour of flight completion. The ADPAA Cplot visualization program enables plots to be quickly generated that enable timely review of all recorded and processed parameters. Near real time review of aircraft flight data enables instrument problems to be identified, investigated and fixed before conducting another flight. On one flight, near real time data review resulted in the identification of unusually low measurements of cloud condensation nuclei, and rapid data visualization enabled the timely investigation of the cause. As a result, a leak was found and fixed before the next flight. Hence, with the high cost of aircraft flights, it is critical to find and fix instrument problems in a timely matter. The use of a automated processing scripts and quick visualization software enables scientists to review aircraft flight data in near real time to identify potential problems.",

AOD1B shall avoid aliasing of these high frequency signals into monthly gravity models derived from modern gravity missions (CHAMP, GRACE or GRACE-FO) and shall help to consistently reprocess altimetry and SLR satellites for later combination of gravimetric and geometric results. Therefore, AOD1B RL06 will be provided for an extended time-range (from 1976 till present). Some results on the use of the new and previous releases of the AOD1B product for precise orbit determination (POD) of these satellites are presented as well.\nFor AOD1B RL06 the ocean part is the same as in RL05, while the atmospheric one includes an improved algorithm for the vertical integration of the atmospheric columns as well as a correction strategy for errors (jumps) present in the atmospheric input data. These errors are estimated by comparing the standard atmospheric coefficients based on the ECMWF operational analysis with independently generated coefficients based on the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis. With this, we are able to correct the 6-hourly AOD1B data sets applied during GRACE POD. The derived gravity solutions, as well as the monthly averages 'GAA' (atmosphere only) and 'GAC' (atmosphere combined with ocean), are then free from errors present in the atmospheric input data. Furthermore, we are checking routinely processing changes at ECMWF, since they are strictly associated with the above mentioned errors, and will estimate new correction coefficients, if necessary.",

In one model, we use a stochastic trigger that initiates strong convection at a random time after the water vapor has reached a critical value. In the other, the trigger is deterministic and occurs immediately when a fixed threshold is reached. Also, the triggers are considered with either a single threshold for regime transitions or two distinct thresholds (allowing for hysteresis). These four cases are investigated in stochastic models of column water vapor dynamics. Two types of results are presented here. First, exact statistics are presented for all four models, and a comparison indicates how the trigger choice influences rainfall statistics. For example, it is shown that the average rainfall is identical for all four triggers, whereas extreme rainfall events are more likely with the stochastic trigger. Second, the stochastic triggers are shown to converge to the deterministic triggers in the limit of fast transition rates.",

            "abstract": "It has recently been demonstrated that when considering timescales of up to 50 years, natural variability may play an equal role to anthropogenic forcing on subcontinental trends for a variety of climate indicators. Thus, for many questions assessing climate impacts on such time and spatial scales, it has become clear that a significant number of ensemble members may be required to produce robust statistics (and especially so for extreme events). However, large ensemble experiments to date have considered the role of variability in a single scenario, leaving uncertain the relationship between the forced climate trajectory and the variability about that path.\nTo address this issue, we present a new, publicly available, 15 member initial condition ensemble of 21st century climate projections for the RCP 4.5 scenario using the CESM1.1 Earth System Model, which we propose as a companion project to the existing 40 member CESM large ensemble which uses the higher greenhouse gas emission future of RCP8.5. This provides a valuable data set for assessing what societal and ecological impacts might be avoided through a moderate mitigation strategy in contrast to a fossil fuel intensive future.\nWe present some early analyses of these combined ensembles to assess to what degree the climate variability can be considered to combine linearly with the underlying forced response. In regions where there is no detectable relationship between the mean state and the variability about the mean trajectory, then linear assumptions can be trivially exploited to utilize a single ensemble or control simulation to characterize the variability in any scenario of interest. We highlight regions where there is a detectable nonlinearity in extreme event frequency, how far in the future they will be manifested and propose mechanisms to account for these effects.",

Fundamental understanding and appropriate characterization of non-Fickian transport through fractures is critical for understanding and prediction of the fate of solutes and other scalars. We use both analytical and numerical modeling, including direct numerical simulation and particle tracking random walk, to investigate the origin of non-Fickian transport through both homogeneous and heterogeneous fractures.\nFor the simple homogenous fracture case, i.e., parallel plates, we theoretically derived a formula for dynamic longitudinal dispersion (D) within Poiseuille flow. Using the closed-form expression for the theoretical D, we quantified the time (T) and length (L) scales separating preasymptotic and asymptotic dispersive transport, with T and L proportional to aperture (b) of parallel plates to second and fourth orders, respectively.\nAs for heterogeneous fractures, the fracture roughness and correlation length are closely associated with the T and L, and thus indicate the origin for non-Fickian transport. Modeling solute transport through 2D rough-walled fractures with continuous time random walk with truncated power shows that the degree of deviation from Fickian transport is proportional to fracture roughness. The estimated L for 2D rough-walled fractures is significantly longer than that derived from the formula within Poiseuille flow with equivalent b. Moreover, we artificially generated normally distributed 3D fractures with fixed correlation length but different fracture dimensions. Solute transport through 3D fractures was modeled with a particle tracking random walk algorithm. We found that transport transitions from non-Fickian to Fickian with increasing fracture dimensions, where the estimated L for the studied 3D fractures is related to the correlation length.",

Marine aerosol particles are of particular interest because of their continual impact on cloud formation, precipitation, atmospheric chemical processes, and thus global climate. Here we report on the physical/chemical characteristics of sub-surface waters, aerosolized sea spray particles, and particles/organic species present in surface microlayer (SML) samples collected during oceanic field campaigns and generated during laboratory experiments, revealing a biogenic primary source of the organic fraction of airborne particles. We also report on ice nucleation experiments with aerosolized particles collected during the May 2014 WACS II North Atlantic cruise and with laboratory generated exudate material from diatom cultures with the potential to impact cirrus and mixed phase clouds. Physicochemical analyses using a multi-modal approach which includes Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy coupled with Near-Edge Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy (STXM/NEXAFS) and Raman spectroscopy confirm the presence and chemical similarity of polysaccharide-rich transparent exopolymer (TEP) material and proteins in both SML sea spray aerosol and ice forming aerosol particles, regardless of the extent of biological activity in surface waters.

Future estimates of mass loss and sea-level contribution from this sector of Antarctica depend on accurate estimates and predictions of basal properties, basal melt, and direct ice discharge through calving. Although significant progress has been made in inferring and predicting basal-melt rates through using satellite data as input to models, lack of understanding of calving processes remains a significant impediment to accurate predictions of ice discharge. Here we determine the impact of a range of calving laws, based on spatiotemporal observations within Pine Island Bay, on the dynamics of Thwaites Glacier (TG) as well as ice-ocean interactions beneath its ice tongue. Oceanic forcing of (once) buttressing ice shelves has been implicated as the driver of the ongoing changes in this region of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and may have important ramifications for calving rate. Building on a suite of ice-ocean coupled model runs as well as similarly determined calving laws for a variety of representative ice shelves/tongues from Antarctica and Greenland, we include calving parameterizations for TG that range from simple freeboard limitations to regionally refined laws relating calving flux to spreading rate. Our results highlight the importance of including and constraining numerical representations of the calving process within prognostic ice-sheet models.",

            "abstract": "The presence of ice cliffs has been identified as one possible reason for relatively high overall ablation rates on debris covered glaciers. Few measurements exist for such cliffs and their formation and evolution processes are still poorly understood. On Lirung Glacier, in the Nepalese Himalayas, numerous cliffs were monitored for two consecutive years in the pre- and post-monsoon season. Slope varied between 30° and full vertical faces. Backwasting rates were highly variable depending on slope and aspect of the location on the cliff. Only a physically based energy balance model can reproduce this heterogeneity and provide insights into the importance of atmospheric forcing and cliff characteristics on their melt.\nBuilding on two previous studies such a model was developed. It was improved with measurements of radiative fluxes perpendicular to the cliff and by applying a high resolution DEM of the surrounding topography to estimate shading and radiative fluxes incident to the cliff including longwave radiation emitted by surrounding debris. We obtain a considerable reduction in incoming shortwave radiation for north-oriented cliffs compared to horizontal measurements, and significant incident longwave component that varies with height on the cliffs. Melt rates are highly variable in time and space for the cliff. While maximum values of up to 8 cm/day are reached during monsoon, melt rates in the post-monsoon season are considerably lower than in the pre-monsoon season. Nighttime refreezing processes during this period also played an important role. Apart from topography, cliff backwasting is extremely sensitive to albedo of the ice surface, reaching values as low as 0.05. Measurements of surface temperature and wind on the cliff further improved the understanding of outgoing radiation and turbulent fluxes.\nOnce validated against stakes readings, the model was used to explain the presence and persistence of cliffs over Lirung glacier. We show that only North facing cliffs persist over a monsoon season, with very high backwasting rates between May and October. Long wave radiation is more important at the bottom of cliffs and highly variable from cliff to cliff, while shortwave radiation is very high for South facing cliffs, the upper portion of which recedes quickly leading to the disappearance of those features.",

            "abstract": "Detecting trend changes and outliers are common needs in applied time series analysis. Here we propose a tool combining various robust methods to perform simultaneously these two tasks. Such a unified tool is well adapted to the analysis of extensive databases. We use it to analyze ground deformations associated to volcanic activity in the Virunga Volcanic Province. Trend changes are estimated using weighted moving average filter, locally weighted scatterplot smoothers and smoothing splines. Significance of detected trend changes is estimated using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests such as Mann-Kendall, Spearmans Rho and Pearson correlation methods. Outliers are detected using both standardized residuals from best-fit model and Chebyshev’s inequality. On one side observations that have a studentized residual outside the ± 2 range are considered statistically significant at the 95% a level and potential outliers. On the other hand Chebyshev’s inequality gives a bound of what percentage of the data falls outside of k standard deviations from the mean calculating upper and lower outlier detection limits. When multiple components of displacements are available (such as vertical, North-South and East-West GPS time series), the outliers detection is performed on each component separately, then jointly. The effectiveness of the tool is demonstrated by analyzing 5 years of data recorded by the permanent GNSS volcano monitoring network in Goma as well as the extensive amount of MSBAS Multidimensional InSAR time series (Samsonov and dOreye, 2012) recorded in the Virunga during 2003-2013 time period.",

            "abstract": "Quasi 2-day oscillation is a convectively coupled equatorial wave with the period of about 2 days. Previous observational studies have shown that its dry dynamics is presumably explained by n=1 westward inertia gravity wave (WIG1), while detailed mechanisms involved in the moist processes for the quasi 2-day wave is less understood. This study is aimed to reveal the mechanism by analyzing the moist static energy (MSE) budget and gross moist stability (GMS) based on satellite and reanalysis data. Since WIG fluctuates in a time scale from a few hours to one day, it is difficult to track WIG variability by a coarse temporal sampling of these data sets. In this study, the difficulty is overcome by compositing reanalysis data with respect to the convective peaks in band-pass filtered OLR data. By this technique, we can achieve a high temporal resolution in a statistical sense to show the rapid variation of convection and environmental fields associated with WIG. It is found that positive zonal advection increases between the lower and middle tropospheres mainly owing to background easterly preceding deep convection. An MSE impost due to the zonal advection is speculated to raise an unstable area with a low GMS on the west of the precipitation active area and originates new convection. On the east of precipitation active area, it is suggested that a stable area with a high GMS arises. Meanwhile, both meridional and vertical advection terms are less important for regulating thermodynamic stability. This could provide a possible scenario about why inertia gravity wave prefers to move westward rather than eastward.",

            "abstract": "A high-fidelity lidar simulation tool is used to generate synthetic lidar backscatter data that closely matches the expected performance of various lidars, including the noise characteristics inherent to analog detection and uncertainties related to the measurement environment. This tool supports performance trade studies and scientific investigations for both the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), which flies aboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), and the NASA Langley Research Center airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL). CALIOP measures profiles of attenuated backscatter coefficients (532 and 1064 nm) and volume depolarization ratios at 532 nm. HSRL measures the same profiles plus volume depolarization at 1064 nm and a molecular-only profile which allows for the direct retrieval of aerosol extinction and backscatter profiles at 532 nm. The simulation tool models both the fundamental physics of the lidar instruments and the signals generated from aerosols, clouds, and the ocean surface and subsurface. This work presents the results of a study conducted to verify the accuracy of the simulated data using data from both HSRL and CALIOP. The tool was tuned to CALIOP instrument settings and the model atmosphere was defined using profiles of attenuated backscatter and depolarization obtained by HSRL during underflights of CALIPSO. The validated HSRL data provide highly accurate measurements of the particulate intensive and extensive optical properties and thus were considered as the truth atmosphere. The resulting simulated data were processed through the CALIPSO data analysis system. Comparisons showed good agreement between the simulated and CALIOP data. This verifies the accuracy of the tool to support studies involving the characterization of instrument components and advanced data analysis techniques. The capability of the tool to simulate ocean surface scattering and subsurface profiling has been used to guide the design of future airborne and satellite ocean-profiling lidars. Initial comparisons of simulated signals with ocean lidar profiles acquired on the Ship-Aircraft Bio-Optical Research (SABOR) experiment are being used to validate this new ocean-profiling measurement capability.",

The difference (Lagrangian mean minus Eulerian mean) in the velocity is called the Stokes drift (velocity), of which theoretically precise definition was given by Andrews and McIntyre (JFM;1978). Here we give simple and intuitive graphic illustrations explaining the relationship between the wave-induced diffusion tensor and the Stokes drift. The symmetric part of the diffusion tensor is related to the temporal and spatial change of wave amplitude, while the antisymmetric part is related to the spatial change of the amplitude of gyrating motion of fluid particles. The divergence of the diffusion tensor induces an additional transport velocity in the Eulerian mean transport equation. However, the direction of the additional velocity is opposite (identical) to the Stokes drift velocity for the symmetric (antisymmetric) part. This relationship is exemplified for the theoretical Eady wave and for atmospheric eddies simulated by a GCM.",

            "abstract": "The northern sub-Saharan African (NSSA) region, bounded on the north and south by the Sahara and the Equator, respectively, and stretching East-West across Africa, is very vulnerable because of the highly active environmental and meteorological processes associated with its unique location and human activities. Over the years, this region has suffered frequent severe droughts that have caused tremendous hardship and loss of life to millions of its inhabitants due to the rapid depletion of the regional water resources. On the other hand, the NSSA region shows one of the highest biomass-burning rates per unit land area among all regions of the world. Because of the high concentration and frequency of fires in this region, with the associated abundance of heat release and gaseous and particulate smoke emissions, biomass-burning activity is believed to be one of the drivers of the regional carbon and energy cycles, with serious implications for the water cycle and climate. An interdisciplinary research effort sponsored by NASA is presently being focused on the NSSA region, to better understand possible connections between the intense biomass burning observed from satellite year after year across the region and the water cycle, through associated changes in certain essential climate variables (ECVs) including land-cover, albedo, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and atmospheric composition, which can drive changes in additional ECVs such as atmospheric water vapor and wind patterns, precipitation, surface runoff, and groundwater recharge. A combination of remote sensing and modeling approaches is being utilized to investigate these multiple processes to clarify possible links between them. We are finding significant relationships between biomass burning and many of the above-listed ECVs. In this presentation, we will discuss interesting results as well as the path toward improved understanding of the interrelationships and feedbacks between the water cycle components and the environmental change dynamics due to biomass burning and related processes in the NSSA region.",

            "abstract": "Community college students account for over 40% of all undergraduates in the United States as well as the majority of minority and non-traditional students attending undergraduate courses. Implementing innovative, cost effective, and formative pedagogies to the diverse backgrounds of students that typically enroll at a community is often a challenge. Interactive pedagogies in geology pose a unique challenge considering that students gain the most long-term knowledge when topics covered in a course are exposed to them in outdoor settings where they are allowed to explore and make connections. The ability to expose students to real world examples is challenging to many community college faculty considering that that many; lack funds or means for transportation of students, do not have administrative support on such endeavors, teach evening or night classes, or have a high percentage of students who are physically limited or have obligations to work and family. A joint collaborative between El Paso Community College (EPCC) and Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) has explored the usage of GigaPan technology to create multi-layered online material to minimize these issues faced by many community college faculty and students. The primary layer of the online material is GigaPans of local geological sites that highlight large-scale structures in the El Paso, Texas region that are commonly used in local field trips and lab book material. The second layer is of Macro-GigaPans of hand samples of key outcrops from the primarily GigaPans which facilitate student learning, exploration, and ability to make connections by exploring smaller scale features of the primary layer. A third layer of online material, GigaPans of thin sections of hand samples (from secondary layers), and curriculum based on the GigaPans was then created to assist students in evaluating proposed hypotheses on the primary layers' geological origin. GigaPan cirriculum was utilized in introductory geology courses as well as a capstone Geological Field Methods course at El Paso Community College.",

            "abstract": "Relationship between the sea surface salinity (SSS) and the oceanic fresh water flux (E-P) is examined using the SSS retrievals derived from the passive microwave (PMW) observations aboard the SMOS and Aquarius satellites, the CMORPH integrated satellite precipitation estimates (P) and the evaporation data (E) produced by the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFS) reanalysis. Preprocessing is performed to construct gridded fields of SSS, P, and E on a 1o lat/lon grid over the global oceans and at a 30-min time resolution for a 54-month period from January 2010 to June 2014. Relationships between the SSS observed at a point in time and the P, E, and P-E at the same grid box accumulated over various time periods ending at the SSS observation time are examined.\nAs a first step, we focused our investigation on an oceanic area over the central equatorial Pacific (10oS-10oN; 180o-160oW) where SSS is not influenced by the river runoffs. Our preliminary results show clear linear relationship between the satellite-observed skin SSS and the fresh water flux over the region. The Aquarius observed instantaneous SSS presents a correlation of ~0.4 with the E-P accumulated over the 30-min period of the SSS observations. The correlation between the instantaneous SSS and the E-P drops with the accumulation period for E-P, down to 0.36 for 6-hourly accumulated E-P. The Correlation, however, bounces back and improves with the E-P accumulation period longer than 6 hours, reaching to ~0.7 for an accumulation time period of 30 days. The existence of the minimum correlation between the instantaneous SSS and the E-P accumulation over a 6-hour period suggests the involvement of air-sea interaction and oceanic processes on multiple time scales in the manner E-P influences to the SSS variations. Among the two primary components of the fresh water flux, precipitation dominates the influences on the SSS. Further analysis is under way to repeat the examination for different regions to examine the regional dependence and seasonal changes of the SSS – fresh water flux over the global ocean and to examine the underlying physical processes. Detailed results will be reported at the AGU meetings.",

            "abstract": "Idealised explicit convection simulations of the Met Office Unified Model are shown to exhibit spontaneous self-aggregation in radiative-convective equilibrium, as seen previously in other models in several recent studies. This self-aggregation is linked to feedbacks between radiation, surface fluxes, and convection, and the organization is intimately related to the evolution of the column water vapor (CWV) field. To investigate the relevance of this behavior to the real world, these idealized simulations are compared with five 15-day cases of real organized convection in the tropics, including multiple simulations of each case testing sensitivities of the convective organization and mean states to interactive radiation, interactive surface fluxes, and evaporation of rain. Despite similar large-scale forcing via lateral boundary conditions, systematic differences in mean CWV, CWV distribution shape, and the length scale of CWV features are found between the different sensitivity runs, showing that there are at least some similarities in sensitivities to these feedbacks in both idealized and realistic simulations.",

It is well known that EMIC waves play an important role in particle acceleration and loss via wave-particle interaction. It is critical to know the ion composition in the plasma with which EMIC waves interact in order to understand wave generation and propagation because it controls ion cyclotron resonance frequencies of EMIC waves. The presence of heavy ions (He+ and O+) causes the wave modes to be more complex with two additional resonance (ion-ion hybrid and Buchsbaum resonances) and polarization changes, making it challenging to analyze wave generation and propagation. In this study, we show wave polarization and Poynting flux using data from the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) and Van Allen Probes (VAP) satellites and their ground conjunctions and compare them with the heavy ion density estimated by a wave model.",

            "abstract": "The subarctic North Pacific and its marginal seas constitute a key area in which rapid environmental changes over the past decades have been observed in instrumental records, like sea ice decreases, or alterations of nutrient inventories and oxygenation of mid-depth water masses. However, knowledge about the past climatic and oceanographic variability beyond instrumental time series in the subarctic North Pacific and its marginal seas is limited. Few temporally and spatially well-resolved high-resolution and spatially well datasets exist, with spatial and temporal coverage being insufficient to gain a detailed picture of past variations.\nOur proxydata-based study focuses on a collection of sediment records from the Okhotsk Sea as major source area for well ventilated North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) that cover the last ca. 12,000 years with high temporal and adequate spatial resolution. We decipher rapid changes in NPIW ventilation patterns on centennial to millennial time scales and show that the current ventilation of the mid-depth North Pacific has likely only been prevalent for the last 2 ka. We further provide evidence for a Mid-Holocene shift in mid-depth NPIW ventilation characteristics. Additionally, changes in North Atlantic Deep Water flow speed and patterns are reflected in our records of North Pacific mid-depth water mass dynamics, thus indicating a hemispheric-wide connection between the Atlantic and Pacific regions during the Holocene. Planktic oxygen isotope data suggest a high variability in the stratification of local surface water masses and the formation of sea ice, influencing the formation of new, well ventilated water masses near to our core sites. We compare the main Holocene baseline changes evidenced in our proxy reconstructions to Early Holocene and Pre-Industrial time slice results from the fully-coupled MPI-ESM (COSMOS) Earth System Model, with a focus on the Pacific Ocean to better understand NPIW and upper ocean dynamic changes.",

It can reduce future well yields, cause interruptions in pumping, and shorten the useful lifespan of wells. Steep hydraulic head declines in many confined sedimentary aquifers worldwide is not only causing land subsidence, it is also causing permanent reductions in aquifer-system compressibility and specific storage as the result of non-recoverable compaction of aquitards and clay inclusions. Initial results are presented from a study of risks to water supply wells from additional drawdown resulting from nonrecoverable compaction, which is quantified and placed in context of regional hydraulic head declines in an unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer system containing multiple aquifers and multiple silt and clay aquitards. While the average drawdowns in this system are expected to increase by no more than 30%, in some cases this additional drawdown will prevent pumping at sustained rates when seasonal irrigation needs are the greatest. This often overlooked aspect of hydraulic head declines should be included in analysis and modeling of regional groundwater-level declines associated with groundwater pumping.",

During this stage, magnetic fabric of the gouge material might preserve valuable information about the faulting process. In this study, we will present the results of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) from the Chelungpu fault gouge, FZB1136, which hosts the slip zone of the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake (Mw 7.6) using Taiwan Chelungpu fault Drilling Project (TCDP) hole-B core sample. AMS results from two Chelungpu fault surface outcrops at Ta-Keng near TCDP drilling site will also be discussed.\nPrevious magnetic mineral study of the FZB1136 pointed out the appearance inconsistency of the maximum remanence and the maximum magnetic susceptibility, which were recognized as the abundance of neo-formed goethite (post-seismic) and principle slip zone (PSZ), respectively. The AMS result indicated that lowest value of magnetic foliation and degree of anisotropy were found at the PSZ, but highest values of the two parameters appear at the location of the maximum remanence. During faulting, high temperature and least fluid found at the PSZ might be the reason of least AMS. However, arrangement of neo-formed post-seismic magnetic mineral, goethite, appeared at the maximum remanence under thermal fluid effect might be the reason to form highest foliation and degree of anisotropy here. In addition, magnetic lineation within the fault gouge is generally very low.\nThe AMS results of two surface outcrops, named as TK-1 and TK-2, show that the magnetic lineation drops from the wall rock to the fault gouge, but the magnetic foliation and the degree of anisotropy increased first then decreased. Compare the AMS pattern within the fault gouge, the results of TK-1 seems to be similar to FZB1136, but those of TK-2 are not. The outcrop TK-1 seems to be possible the slip zone of the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. Undoubted it needs to be further proved.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a two-dimensional, finite element code that solves the electromagnetic full wave equations in global magnetospheric geometry. The code produces the three-dimensional wave structure, including mode conversion effects, for plasma waves launched in a two-dimensional axisymmetric background plasma with general magnetic field topology. Using this code, we have examined how EMIC waves are generated and propagated along the magnetic field line. While left-handed polarized EMIC waves are known to be excited by the cyclotron instability associated with hot and anisotropic ion distributions in the equatorial region of the magnetosphere, the generation mechanism of linear and right-handed polarized EMIC waves, which are often observed near the magnetic equator, remains as one of the unsolved scientific questions. In this presentation, we show the linear polarization of the EMIC waves can be explained by mode conversion at the ion-ion hybrid (IIH) resonance (an analogue of the field-line resonance when the resonance frequency is on the order of the heavy ion cyclotron frequency) when externally driven compressional waves propagate into an increasing/decreasing heavy ion concentration or inhomogeneous magnetic field. Since these mode-converted waves depend sensitively on the heavy ion concentration, it possible to estimate the heavy ion concentration ratio from the wave propagation characteristics. We also evaluated the absorption coefficients at the IIH resonance at Earth’s geosynchronous orbit for variable concentrations of He+ and wave frequencies and have found that the resonance only occurs for a limited range of wave frequencies, defined such that the IIH resonance frequency is close to, but not exactly the same as the crossover frequency. Using the wave absorption and observed EMIC waves from the GOES-12 satellite, we demonstrate how this technique can be used to estimate that the He+ concentration is around 4% near L = 6.6.",

            "abstract": "The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Cryosat mission was launched to improve our knowledge of the trends in the thickness of sea ice and glaciers. The new Synthetic Aperture processing method allows for significantly enhanced along-track resolution compared to traditional pulse-limited radar altimeters. Satellite observations have revealed rapid changes in the duration of the seasonal snow and ice cover of subarctic lakes. The often smooth, homogeneous ice cover of lakes is an excellent target for detailed studies of radar altimeter and imaging radar backscatter behavior. Furthermore, there is only limited information available regarding the changes in ice thickness of these lakes. Here we present and validate a method to retrieve the thickness of lake ice using CryoSat L1B data. In contrast to sea ice measurements where ice thickness is derived from isostatic freeboard retrievals, we obtain ice thickness from radar returns from both the ice surface and bottom, assuming that CryoSat’s Ku-band radar pulses can penetrate through freshwater ice. The seasonal evolution of ice thickness of Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake, two large lakes in northern Canada, thus observed is compared to in-situ measurements, SAR imagery, scatterometer data, the results of a freezing-degree-day model, and previous studies. These confirm that the Ku-band signal often penetrates through the low-loss freshwater ice and is scattered from both the snow/ice and the ice/water interfaces. We examine the data for scattering from within the snow pack and the ice as this introduces uncertainty in the retrieval of ice thickness by masking the signal from snow/ice or ice/water interfaces. Although not designed for freshwater lake ice studies, CryoSat-2 and future SAR/SARIN mode satellite altimeter missions offer new possibilities to monitor Arctic and sub-Arctic lakes.",

            "abstract": "Magmatic hydrothermal systems are the superficial manifestation of high heat flux in groundwater systems and their dynamics can be intermittently perturbed by those of the magmatic system. The complex interplay between heat and fluid flow in hydrothermal systems must be understood in order to discriminate geophysical signals of magmatic unrest from purely hydrothermal ones. Starting from the Campi Flegrei model of Todesco et al. (2010), we investigate the impact of major geological discontinuities in permeability on: advective flow within the hydrothermal reservoir, subsurface pressure and temperature distributions and the relative contribution of volcanic and surface derived fluids to surficial discharge. In the baseline scenario (no faults), a steady state convective flow system develops within 4 ky in which the injection of hot fluids feeds a narrow plume (fumarole), which entrains water from the surrounding aquifer and depresses isotherms by up to 500 m in the zone 400-1500 m from fumarole.\nThe addition of two steep faults 4 and 7 km from the fumarole (faults A and B) two orders of magnitude higher vertical permeability than the matrix, divides the flow field into three separate advective cells (fumarole, fault A and fault B). Faults focus recharge of shallow groundwater to the deeper reservoir, with the concomitant upwelling of hot water around faults leading to local thermal anomalies (+50 0C) at 500 m depth. Increasing fault permeability by an order of magnitude enhances this effect around fault B, but reverses the flow pattern at fault A which now serves as a conduit discharging fluids at up to 90 0C. Increasing matrix permeability results in interaction between the previously separate advective cells. The juxtaposition of low permeability rock at the faulted caldera margin focusses discharge of hot waters, fed by recharge via faults within the caldera. Simulations also evaluate the effect of unrest, highlighting the impact of fluid flow on subsurface pressure and temperature distribution. For instance, a rapid increase of basal heat flux of two orders of magnitude, to simulate replenishment of a deep magmatic reservoir, induces liquid-gas phase transition at depth, which leads to a maximum pressure of 1.25 MPa at 150 m depth in 150 years. Overpressure is then quickly released by discharge of fluids at the surface.",

Starting in August 2014 Rosetta will be able to carry out a close study of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) is one of the core payloads on board of the Rosetta spacecraft [Balsiger et al, 2007]. ROSINA’s main objective is to determine the major atmospheric and ionospheric composition in the coma and to investigate the gas dynamics around the comet.\nROSINA consists of two mass spectrometers and a pressure sensor. The Comet Pressure Sensor (COPS) includes two gauges: the “nude gauge” measures total neutral density in the coma and the “ram gauge” measures the dynamic pressure of the cometary gas flux to obtain the bulk velocity of the neutral gas. The combination of these two gauges makes COPS capable to derive the gas dynamics at the location of the spacecraft.\nWe performed laboratory gas dynamic measurements with the identical flight-spare instrument of COPS. Using the Calibration System for The Mass Spectrometer Instrument ROSINA (CASYMIR) we produce neutral gas beams to model cometary gas jets with velocities from thermal up to 2 km/s.\nWe expect that COPS will be able to detect the faint and expanding atmosphere of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as early as August 2014 when the comet is still farther than 3 AU from the Sun. We will present the first ROSINA COPS observations of the gas dynamics around the comet together with the corresponding laboratory measurements required for the interpretation of these data.\n",

            "abstract": "Seasonal to decadal variability of heat and fresh water content, strength and depth of winter convection, and water mass characteristics in the Labrador Sea are analysed using shipboard, profiling float and moored measurements.\nEpisodes of strong basin-wide near-surface freshening occurred in 2008-2009 and 2011-2012, starting off the Greenland coast, and then progressing into the western and central Labrador Sea. Possible causes of these salinity decreases include accelerated reductions in the Greenland and Arctic ice covers which increased the amount of melt water transported by the boundary current and diffused into the Sea’s interior by lateral exchanges. The surface freshening observed in the Labrador Sea in 2012 is in agreement with the extreme Greenland ice sheet melt in the same year.\nDespite the Labrador Sea’s recent warming and freshening, it continues to show signs of notable winter convection that reaches 1500 m and possibly even deeper. The two winters of the past decade and a half in which the Labrador Sea overturned to 1600 m were 2008 and 2014. Comparison of the heat losses to the atmosphere with internal ocean heat content changes for individual cooling seasons demonstrates a good agreement, suggesting that fall and winter atmospheric forcing was the primary factor in the variability of the depth and strength of convection in recent years.\nDownstream hydrographic variability in the Deep Western Boundary Current over the Scotian Slope and Rise is described from surveys and moored measurements during the past decade (in conjunction with the UK RAPID Climate Change program). Some anomalous water mass properties can be traced back to the Labrador Sea, but there are indications of multiple and complex pathways.",

            "abstract": "This study is to develop a conceptual socio-hydrology model for the Kissimmee River Basin. The Kissimmee River located in Florida was channelized in mid-20 century for flood protection. However, the environmental issues caused by channelization led Floridians to conduct a restoration project recently, focusing on wetland recovery. As a complex coupled human-water system, Kissimmee River Basin shows the typical socio-hydrology interactions. Hypothetically, the major reason to drive the system from channelization to restoration is that the community sensitivity towards the environment has changed from controlling to restoring.\nThe model developed in this study includes 5 components: water balance, flood risk, wetland area, crop land area, and community sensitivity. Furthermore, urban population and rural population in the basin have different community sensitivities towards the hydrologic system. The urban population, who live further away from the river are more sensitive to wetland restoration; while the rural population, who live closer to the river are more sensitive to flood protection. The power dynamics between the two groups and its impact on management decision making is described in the model.\nThe model is calibrated based on the observed watershed outflow, wetland area and crop land area. The results show that the overall focus of community sensitivity has changed from flood protection to wetland restoration in the past 60 years in Kissimmee River Basin, which confirms the study hypothesis. There are two main reasons for the community sensitivity change. Firstly, people’s flood memory is fading because of the effective flood protection, while the continuously shrinking wetland and the decreasing bird and fish population draw more and more attention. Secondly, in the last 60 years, the urban population in Florida drastically increased compared with a much slower increase of rural population. As a result, the community sensitivity of urban population towards wetland restoration has more weight than the rural population’s towards flood protection.",

Their role is dependent on their distributions of size, number, phase and composition, which vary significantly in space and time. There remain large uncertainties in simulated aerosol distributions due to uncertainties in emission estimates and in chemical and physical processes associated with their formation and removal. These uncertainties lead to large uncertainties in weather and air quality predictions and in estimates of health and climate change impacts. Despite these uncertainties and challenges regional-scale coupled chemistry-meteorological models such as WRF-Chem have significant capabilities in predicting aerosol distributions and explaining aerosol-weather interactions. In this talk we explore the hypothesis that new advances in on-line, coupled atmospheric chemistry/meteorological models, and new emission inversion and data assimilation techniques applicable to such coupled models, can be applied in innovative ways using current and evolving observation systems to predictions of aerosol distributions at regional scales. We present results that show that the addition of geostationary data to other data sources, improves air quality predictions, and reduce uncertainties in health assessments and climate studies.",

An ensemble of historical period simulations and an ensemble of end-of-the-century simulations under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario for global warming quantify some of the implications of parameter uncertainty for simulation of precipitation processes in current climate and in projections of climate change. Regional precipitation patterns prove highly sensitive to the parameter perturbations, especially in the tropics. In the historical period, nonlinear parameter response with local changes exceeding 3 mm/day is noted. Over the full range of parameters, the error with respect to observations is within the range typical of different climate models used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). For parameter perturbations within this range, differences in the end of century projections for global warming precipitation change also regionally exceed 3 mm/day, also comparable to differences in global warming predictions among the CMIP5 models. These results suggest that improving constraints within moist convective parameterized processes based on better assessment against observations in the historical period will be required to reduce the range of uncertainty in regional projections of precipitation change.",

            "abstract": "Many tidal channels display bifurcations of the main channel near the ocean. The combination of river and tidal flow distributes sediment over the different branches. Knowledge on the distribution of sediment is important to assess the stability of the branches, as is well known from river bifurcations. However, due to the bi-directional tidal flow, it is not clear how the net sediment discharge is divided, and thus whether a branch will be stable.\nModeling morphodynamics on long timescales to assess channel stability is mostly done by idealized models, as complex numerical models often demand too much computational time. One idealized model type for estuarine networks is the 1D network model. However, these models require a formulation of the distribution of sediment at a bifurcation. These have not been established for tidal environments. The aim of this study is to make the first steps towards such a formulation by investigating the division of net sediment discharge over a single bifurcation. This is done for a range of parameter settings (e.g. varying depth, settling velocity, sediment availability etc.) using the numerical model Delft3D.\nThe left panel of Fig. 1 shows a top view of the bifurcation. The right panel shows the results of one such scenario where the depth of branch 2 has been changed. Discharge division asymmetry is defined as\nΨ = (Q2 - Q3) / Q1\nwhere Qi (i=1,2,3) is the net discharge (of either water or sediment) through a cross-section at the bifurcation in channel i. Results for water (red dashed line) show a favouring of the deeper channel. However, the partitioning of sediment (black solid line) responds stronger and more complicated to changes in depth.",

By combining a stationary Eulerian and a quasi-Lagrangian sensor platform, we investigated the timing of nitrate flushing and identified locations of elevated biogeochemical cycling along a stream-lake network in Northern Wisconsin, USA. Two years of continuous oxygen, carbon dioxide, and discharge measurements were used to compute gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) downstream of a wetland reach of Allequash Creek. Metabolic rates and flow patterns were compared with nitrate concentrations measured every 30 minutes using an optical sensor. Additionally, we floated a sensor array from the headwater spring ponds through a heterogeneous stream reach consisting of wetlands, beaver ponds, forested segments, and two lakes. Two distinct temporal patterns of stream nitrate concentrations were observed. During high flow events such as spring snowmelt and summer rain events, nitrate concentrations increased from ~5 µM (baseflow) to 12 µM, suggesting flushing from catchment sources. During baseflow conditions, nitrate followed a diel cycle with a 0.3-1.0 µM daytime draw down. Daily nitrate reduction was positively correlated with GPP calculated from oxygen and carbon dioxide records. Lastly, spatial analyses revealed lowest nitrate concentrations in the wetland reach, approximately 2-3 µM lower than the upstream spring ponds, and downstream lakes and forested reaches. This snapshot implies greater nitrate removal potential in the wetland reach likely driven by denitrification in organic rich sediments and macrophyte uptake in the open canopy stream segment. Taken together the temporal and spatial results show the dynamics of hydrology, geomorphology, and biology to influence nitrate delivery and variability in ecosystem processing through a stream-lake system. Future ecosystem studies could benefit by including multiple reference frameworks to better assess processes not captured by a single station approach.",

The magnetic energy efficiently converts into kinetic energy of nonthermal relativistic particles in a power-law spectrum. For large closed systems, the power law slope approaches “-1”. The dominant acceleration mechanism is a first-order Fermi process accomplished through the curvature drift motion in magnetic flux tubes along the electric field induced by reconnection outflows. We have developed an analytical theory to describe the power‐law spectrum. We demonstrate that both continuous inflow and Fermi-type acceleration lead to the power-law distributions. A general condition for the formation of power-law distributions in magnetic reconnection is derived. The role of anisotropic pitch-angle distribution is evaluated. For a system that allows particle escape from the acceleration region, the spectra get softer. The work shows that power-law distributions are a common feature in magnetic reconnection region with low plasma beta, which may be important to explain fast and efficient nonthermal particle acceleration in solar flares, Earth’s magnetotail, and other astrophysical reconnection sites.\n",

            "abstract": "As the second-largest river globally, the Congo is a critical part of large-scale water, energy, and carbon cycles, and thus has a significant influence on regional climate. The runoff ratio is a coefficient relating runoff to precipitation; it is a parameter that integrates and summarizes upstream hydrologic processes. The Budyko equation depicts the expected partitioning of precipitation (P) into evapotranspiration (E) and runoff (R): P=R+E. It is hypothesized that radiation and precipitation are primary controls of the partitioning process; the effects of the surface control (e.g. soil and slope) are implicitly assumed to be minor. In this study, we explored thirty years of data in the Congo River basin. We will correlate the runoff ratio to a variety of factors, including precipitation, radiation and surface controls (e.g. soil, slope). Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) by pentad precipitation was used as primary precipitation data, and Climatic Research Unit (CRU) by data was used for comparison. For discharge and drainage area were derived from Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC), and net radiation is from NASA Earth Observatory. Congo sub basins are analyzed as well.\nInterannual variability in the runoff ratio for the Congo basin ranged from 0.2 to 0.3, but was generally uncorrelated with precipitation. Runoff is generally uncorrelated with precipitation, whereas evapotranspiration calculated as residual (P-R) is highly correlated with precipitation, with E ranging from 1000 to 1300 mm per year, and P explaining 85% of the variance. Spatial variability was explored by analysis of long-term mean runoff ratio for 10 sub-basins. Spatially, both R and runoff ratio are highly correlated with P, with P explaining 59% of the variance in the runoff ratio. Physical mechanisms to explain these results are explored, and the implications for the Congo’s role in partitioning rainfall over sub-Saharan Africa are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Edward (Ted) Irving (1927 – 2014) was one of the most deeply and widely respected paleomagnetists, making significant contributions to the field throughout his career which spanned six decades. Restricting attention to the first decade of his career, the 1950s, he discovered from work on the Torridonian (1951-1953) that fine-grained red sandstones were generally suitable for paleomagnetic work (1951-1952). He rediscovered (1951) that paleomagnetism could be used to test continental drift, and initiated (1951) the first paleomagnetic test of whether India had drifted northward relative to Asia and argued (1954) that it had. He also made significant contributions to the first APW path for Great Britain (Creer, Irving, and Runcorn, 1954). He was the first to draw two APW paths to explain results from Great Britain and North America (1956) and to use paleomagnetism and paleoclimatology together to argue for continental drift (1954, 1956). With Ron Green, his first student, he first APW path for Australia (1958). He was the first to invoke axial rotations to explain away an apparent anomaly with an APW path (1959). His work on the Torridonian led to the first description of stratigraphically sequential reversals in sedimentary rocks. Moreover, his 1959 superb review of the paleomagnetic support for continental drift was instrumental in Hess’s becoming a continental drifter before he came up with the idea of seafloor spreading.

            "abstract": "Cities generate a large fraction of anthropogenic methane emissions that are increasing with urbanization and greater reliance on natural gas as fuel. New measurements of methane in cities suggest an as-yet unrealized potential for city-scale methane mitigation. We present high-resolution methane observations from four cities in North America to demonstrate the utility of methane surveys for identifying urban methane sources. We used portable, continuous on-road measurements to determine the spatial distribution of methane in Fairbanks, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, and San Diego. Across cities, methane tended to be highly concentrated in space, suggesting discrete, point emission sources. Elevated methane levels were found near known emission sources, such as landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, and natural gas-fueled power plants, and revealed the location of fugitive leaks in natural gas infrastructure. The mix of sources and sizes of methane leaks varied among cities, highlighting a need for locally adaptive emissions regulation. Urban methane observations can inform anthropogenic processes in development of methane mitigation strategies. We discuss specific examples of how continuous atmospheric measurements can enhance the design of mitigation strategies in these cities, and potential contributions of these approaches to cross-sectoral efforts to reduce methane emissions at the city level.",

            "abstract": "During the Anthropocene, humans have had a substantial impact on fluvial systems throughout the world. Perhaps nowhere is the human imprint on stream systems more pronounced than in the intensively managed agriculture landscapes of the midwestern United States. This study examines changes in the structure of the stream network and in the planform dynamics of stream channels within the upper Sangamon River basin in Illinois – a watershed that is part of a new Critical Zone Observatory focusing on intensively managed landscapes (IML-CZO). The research explores changes in network structure as the landscape changed from prairie and forest into drained farmland dominated by row crop agriculture. It also documents the planform dynamics of stream and river channels over the past 80 to 100 years. Results show that the spatial extent of channels within the stream network expanded greatly as land was cleared and drained for agriculture. Expansion of the network into headwater portions of the watershed occurred through the construction of drainage ditches that serve as outlets for tile drainage systems underlying relatively flat, poorly drained farmland. Analysis of planform dynamics reveals that most of these drainage ditches have not changed alignment since initial construction. Although drainage ditches are maintained by local drainage districts, these human-created channels also are remarkably resistant to change in planform over time. The major type of planform change in headwater streams involves artificial straightening of meandering channels to expand the extent of drainage channels. Many sections of the meandering Sangamon River are heavily forested and exhibit little or no planform change over the past 80-100 years. Sections that are most active tend to occur where forest cover is less prevalent due to clearing of trees for pasture or cropland. Overall, the results demonstrate the pronounced imprint of humans on the structure and planform dynamics of a fluvial system in an intensively managed watershed. Undoubtedly this imprint has an important influence on downstream fluxes of water, nutrients, and sediment, which are a primary focus of ongoing process-based research in the IML-CZO.",

Site U1357 is located in the Adélie Trough, a glacially scoured valley on the continental shelf ~50km off the coast of East Antarctica. Sediment samples were taken at 10cm intervals resulting in an approximate time step for each sample of 7yr resolution based on extensive C14 dating and visible band counting exercises. As part of a collaborative effort between Queens College and Stanford University, samples from the upper part of the core were used in this study, which spanned from near Recent to 6kyr BP. Neogloboquadrina pachyderma make up nearly 50% of all foraminifers counted and was used to construct pelagic stable isotope records. From nearly 10,000 foraminifers counted, ~34 foraminiferal species were identified.\nThe highest δ18O values occur from ~3.0 to ~6.1kyr and ~1kyr to Recent, with the lowest occurring from ~1.4 to ~3.8kyr. The highest δ13C values occur when δ18O are low. Total benthic foraminiferal abundances are highest during two intervals: Recent to ~1.4kyr and ~3.6 to ~6.1kyr. For ~2 to ~3.6kyr, the agglutinated species are the most dominant with calcareous benthic foraminifers being mainly absent.\nThe higher δ18O values observed are consistent with lower surface water temperatures and decreased melt water from icebergs, with lower δ18O values ascribed to increased melt waters and possibly higher surface water temperatures. Previous studies indicate that cooler waters occurred when we observe lower foraminiferal δ18O values. This suggests that the N. pachyderma δ18O record was influenced primarily by the δ18O of seawater (e.g., iceberg melt waters), with temperature being a minor control. Higher δ13C values are associated with lower δ18O, which implies increased water column stratification coupled with high productivity possibly owing to less sea ice. This increase in stratification is associated with the absence of calcareous benthic forms, which is interpreted to be due to decreased bottom-water ventilation.",

            "abstract": "There is currently a strong interest in stochastic approaches to seismic modeling – versus deterministic methods such as gradient methods - due to the ability of these methods to better deal with highly non-linear problems. Another advantage of stochastic methods is that they allow the estimation of the a posteriori probability distribution of the derived parameters, meaning the envisioned Bayesian inversion of Tarantola allowing the quantification of the solution error.\nThe cost to pay of stochastic methods is that they require testing thousands of variations of each unknown parameter and their associated weights to ensure reliable probabilistic inferences. Even with the best High-Performance Computing resources available, 3D stochastic full waveform modeling at the regional scale still remains out-of-reach. We are exploring regionalization as one way to reduce the dimension of the parameter space, allowing the identification of areas in the models that can be treated as one block in a subsequent stochastic inversion. Regionalization is classically performed through the identification of tectonic or structural elements. Lekic & Romanowicz (2011) proposed a new approach with a cluster analysis of the tomographic velocity models instead. Here we present the results of a clustering analysis on the P-wave receiver-functions used in the subsequent inversion. Different clustering algorithms and quality of clustering are tested for different datasets of North America and China. Preliminary results with the kmean clustering algorithm show that an interpolated receiver function wavefield (Chai et al., GRL, in review) improve the agreement with the geological and tectonic regions of North America compared to the traditional approach of stacked receiver functions.\nAfter regionalization, 1D profile for each region is stochastically inferred using a parallelized code based on Monte-Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC), and modeling surfacewave-dispersion and receiver-functions observations. The parameters of the inversion are the elastic properties, the thickness and the number of isotropic layers. We will present preliminary results and compare them to results obtained from a different regionalizationbased on a tomographic model (Calo et al., 2013).",

These generic products serve numerous applications such as agriculture and food security monitoring, weather forecast, climate change impact studies, water, forest and natural resources management.\nThe portfolio contains Essential Climate Variables like Leaf Area Index (LAI), the Fraction of PAR absorbed by the vegetation (FAPAR), surface albedo, Land Surface Temperature, soil moisture, burnt areas, areas of water bodies, and additional vegetation indices. They are generated daily on a reliable and automatic basis from Earth Observation satellite data. Beside this timely production, the available historical archives, up to 16 years for SPOT-VEGETATION, have been processed using the same innovative algorithms. For a number of ECVs, the algorithms are adapted to work with NOAA-AVHRR as input to extend the time series up to 1982. The service continuity is provided in two parallel paths. On one hand, the existing retrieval methodologies are adapted to use the new PROBA-V sensor, fully consistent with SPOT-VEGETATION, and as such extends the time-series at 1km spatial resolution. On the other hand, the operation is moving to the finer resolution of PROBA-V (300m), while maintaining consistency with the 1km series. The data records are documented in terms of the physical methodologies, the technical properties, and the results of validation exercises. The service performs a continuous quality monitoring on three levels: technical, scientific and cross-cutting, following where possible the rules of CEOS/LPV and comparing with both in-situ and other datasets, e.g. MODIS. The service is improved through feedback from an independent expert team performing regular independent reviews and providing user feedback. All products are accessible, free of charge after registration through FTP/HTTP and through the GEONETCast satellite distribution system.\nAfter an overview of the Copernicus Global Land service, the paper shows how methods and algorithms and processing lines are designed, characterized and validated across sensors and across spatial resolutions.",

            "abstract": "Extensional back-arc basins form in the hinterland of orogens by collapsing the upper plate during the rapid roll-back of subduction systems. During convergence of major tectonic plates, a number of rather local roll-back systems may develop on a spatially restricted area, inferring the possibility of back-arc extension driven by different slabs taking place in the same area. This is the case of the many instances of rapid roll-back subductions that dominated the recent evolution of the Mediterranean and SE Asia orogenic systems. The extension may take place far at the interior of the upper plate, as is the case in various segments of the Carpathians or in the core of the SE Asian domain, but in most cases of the Dinarides, Apennines, Rif-Betic or Hellenides it take place superposed or far into the foreland when compared with the position of oceanic suture zones. Such observations are often difficult to reconciliate with the classical position of a back-arc basin relative to the location of volcanic arcs. The geometry of such back-arc basins is asymmetric, deposition of sediments being associated with rapid exhumation of detachments footwalls, often reactivating nappe contacts or suture zones, as observed in the Aegean, Pannonian or Alboran domain. In all these orogenic systems, the partly coeval shortening has gradually duplicated crustal blocks from the lower plate and shifted the subduction zone far towards the foreland without any significant formation of retro-wedges. The moments of interaction between the roll-back of different slabs in the same back-arc basin can be detected by deviations from the general asymmetry, observed in the regional geometry of the sedimentary fill. Quantifying the extension driven by the interaction between these different roll-back systems relies on coupling of kinematics of the back-arc basin with the evolution of the driving subduction systems. Such observations infer the need of understanding the coupling between orogenic and back-arc processes at various spatial scales in order to understand the driving mechanisms and associated sedimentary basins dynamics.",

            "abstract": "How effective is visual communication to increase awareness of natural hazards and risks? To answer this research question, we developed a research design that was at the same time an experimental setting and an actual communication effort. This contribution will address the scientists-stakeholders interaction that was involved, the resulting exhibition, the lessons learned and the value it had for the researchers and for the other stakeholders.\nThroughout the full length of the 2-years project held in the Ubaye valley (southeastern France) we collaborated with local and regional stakeholders (politicians and technicians). Informal meetings with local stakeholders were organized to determine what they perceived as the needs in term of risk communication and to investigate the potential to develop activities that would benefit both them and us.\nWe were offered the opportunity to design an exhibition for the local public library. We proposed the content and this was adjusted in interaction with the stakeholders. Later local technicians and inhabitants contributed to the content of the exhibition and regional stakeholders helped with the funding of the exhibition. Finally, employees of the public library took the lead in advertising the activity, gathering participants and they helped designing the scientific survey.\nThis survey was the key activity from a scientific point of view as it allowed us to measure the impact of this communication activity on risk awareness. Moreover, the principal scientist was present during all opening hours of the exhibition. This allowed direct and indirect contact with the visitors.\nThe benefits of this exhibition for the community included triggering memories, encouraging exchanges, especially inter-generational, reinforcing stakeholders-to-stakeholders relationships and promote further communication on the topic. The scientific benefits are that we have an experiment that allows us to measure the impact of a communication effort, not in a laboratory situation but in real life.",

            "abstract": "Drought has wide spread influence over the continental US. Climate predictions suggest increasing frequencies and intensity in droughts, particularly over the southern and western US. In this study, we first present a quantitative assessment of the impacts of the 2011 Southern US drought on the distribution and budget of surface PM2.5 in the summertime using observations and the GEOS-Chem model. Through quantifying the complex dependence of PM2.5 species to meteorology parameters, we find different responses of OC and sulfate to drought conditions. There is an average enhancement of 26% (p < 10-4) in total PM2.5 over the southern US region during the drought, which is largely attributed to OC enhancements driven by increased emissions from wildfires and trans-boundary inflow from Mexico. By contrast, over central and eastern Texas, surface PM2.5 shows a mean decrease of 11% driven by a 26% (p < 0.03) reduction in sulfate due to decreased aqueous-phase oxidation. On the basis of our PM2.5 budget analysis of this drought event, a statistical approach is developed to estimate the impacts of similar droughts on PM2.5 air quality in the past decades and validated. Finally, we will apply the statistical relationship to discuss the implications on PM air quality of future changes in drought projected by climate models.",

            "abstract": "Time dependent deformation describes the process whereby brittle materials deform at a stress level below their short-term material strength (Ss), but over an extended time frame. Although generally well understood in engineering (where it is known as static fatigue or “creep”), knowledge of how rocks creep and fail has wide ramifications in areas as diverse as mine tunnel supports and the long term stability of critically loaded rock slopes. A particular hazard relates to the instability of volcano flanks. A large number of flank collapses are known such as Stromboli (Aeolian islands), Teide, and El Hierro (Canary Islands). Collapses on volcanic islands are especially complex as they necessarily involve the combination of active tectonics, heat, and fluids. Not only does the volcanic system generate stresses that reach close to the failure strength of the rocks involved, but when combined with active pore fluid the process of stress corrosion allows the rock mass to deform and creep at stresses far lower than Ss. Despite the obvious geological hazard that edifice failure poses, the phenomenon of creep in volcanic rocks at elevated temperatures has yet to be thoroughly investigated in a well controlled laboratory setting.\nWe present new data using rocks taken from Stromboli, El Heirro and Teide volcanoes in order to better understand the interplay between the fundamental rock mechanics of these basalts and the effects of elevated temperature fluids (activating stress corrosion mechanisms). Experiments were conducted over short (30-60 minute) and long (8-10 hour) time scales. For this, we use the method of Heap et al., (2011) to impose a constant stress (creep) domain deformation monitored via non-contact axial displacement transducers. This is achieved via a conventional triaxial cell to impose shallow conditions of pressure (<25 MPa) and temperature (<200 °C), and equipped with a 3D laboratory seismicity array (known as acoustic emission, AE) to monitor the micro cracking due to the imposed deformation. By measuring the AE generated during deformation we are then able to apply fracture forecast models to predict, retrospectively, the time of failure. We find that higher temperatures increase the strain rate during creep for the same %Ss, and that the accuracy of the forecast does not change with increasing temperature.",

            "abstract": "Climate, energy, and water are fundamentally linked such that shifts in one sector have cascading impacts on the others. Consideration of the integrated system is necessary to fully understand the individual risk profile of each sector. In defining vulnerabilities and potential adaptations, the policy and regulatory environment must be considered alongside the biological and physical systems. Take, for example, the Southwestern U.S., a naturally arid system, where water availability is declining as a consequence of climate change and population growth. Adaptations by the water sector to convey, store, and develop new water sources (e.g. desalination, groundwater pumping, water-reuse) are strategies designed to enhance sustainability of the sector. But, the energy requirements embedded in these management techniques pose challenges to electric utilities. West wide, approximately 20% of total electricity generation goes toward supplying and heating water. If future investments made by the water sector to deal with changing supply and demand regimes continue to follow current trends, the dependence of water on energy availability will grow, meaning that the water supply will be increasingly reliant on the electricity system. Here, we use the example of long-term aridity and the recent drought in the Western US to illustrate the tradeoffs and challenges inherent at the nexus between energy and water. We present long-term trends in the energy intensity of water supplies in the Southwestern US, with a specific focus on groundwater systems. Projected energy requirements for proposed and future conveyance systems are discussed. The potential impacts of reduced flows on the Colorado River on the energy demands for groundwater pumping in the Lower Colorado River Basin are highlighted.",

By means of collinearity diagnosis, we assess the current capability of SLR to sense geocentre motion via the network shift approach using real ground networks and LAGEOS-1 and 2 observations. We show that the combined processing of LAGEOS and LEO satellite data reduces the collinearity issues of the Z geocentre coordinate under certain solution parameterisations.

            "abstract": "Past seismic imaging studies of the Isabella anomaly in Southern California lacked resolution to distinguish between the two dominating hypotheses for its origin: a fossil slab origin or a foundering lithospheric root of the Sierra Nevada volcanic arc. To definitively distinguish the origin of the anomaly as one, or neither, of these possibilities is important in the understanding of the evolution of continental arcs and the process of subduction termination. To do this, we deployed an array of 44 broadband seismometers from the Isabella anomaly to the coast at latitude 36°N, starting in December 2013. The array has a station spacing of ~7 km spacing filling a gap between the southern and northern California permanent seismic networks (NCSN and SCSN). The array will continue to collect data until summer 2015. We will present preliminary surface wave tomography results using empirical interstation green's functions derived from ambient seismic noise recorded by more than 500 stations that currently or previously surround our array. Initial Ps receiver function images from common conversion point stacking will also be presented. We also use local earthquakes to model the shape and velocity of the Central Valley, as this will be important in correcting the tomography and receiver function images.We also deployed a dense array of short period stations in Peachtree Valley, where the broadband array crossed the San Andreas Fault (SAF). This network will be used to determine the location and level of seismicity on a segment of the SAF where it is creeping.This first batch of results from our broadband seismic experiment should provide new insight into how far the basaltic crust of the Monterey microplate extends inland beneath California and whether the Isabella anomaly is connected to North America or Pacific lithosphere.",

Coupling spatially-distributed physically-based hydrologic models with biogeochemical models may yield significant improvements in the representation of topographic influence on belowground C processes.\nWe will couple the Flux-PIHM model to the Biome-BGC (BBGC) model. Flux-PIHM is a coupled physically-based land surface hydrologic model, which incorporates a land-surface scheme into the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM). The land surface scheme is adapted from the Noah land surface model. Because PIHM is capable of simulating lateral water flow and deep groundwater, Flux-PIHM is able to represent the link between groundwater and the surface energy balance, as well as the land surface heterogeneities caused by topography.\nThe coupled Flux-PIHM-BBGC model will be tested at the Susquehanna/Shale Hills critical zone observatory (SSHCZO). The abundant observations, including eddy covariance fluxes, soil moisture, groundwater level, sap flux, stream discharge, litterfall, leaf area index, above ground carbon stock, and soil carbon efflux, make SSHCZO an ideal test bed for the coupled model. In the coupled model, each Flux-PIHM model grid will couple a BBGC cell. Flux-PIHM will provide BBGC with soil moisture and soil temperature information, while BBGC provides Flux-PIHM with leaf area index. Preliminary results show that when Biome- BGC is driven by PIHM simulated soil moisture pattern, the simulated soil carbon is clearly impacted by topography.",

Existing estimates of its slip-rate vary, however, which has led to suggestions that it may exhibit temporal changes in activity. Using high-resolution optical satellite imagery we make reconstructions of displacement across four alluvial fans that cross the Doruneh fault, and determine the ages of these fans using luminescence dating, combined with U-series dating of pedogenic carbonates in one case. The four fans, which vary in age from 10-100 kyr, yield estimates of slip rate of ~2-3 mm/yr. We compare the average slip-rate measurements to the rate of accumulation of strain across the Doruneh fault using GPS and InSAR measurements, and find that the slip-rate is likely to have remained constant - within the uncertainty of our measurements - over the last ~100 ka. The slip-rate that we measure is consistent with the E-W left-lateral Doruneh fault accommodating N-S right-lateral faulting by 'bookshelf' faulting, with clockwise rotation about a vertical axis, in a similar manner to the Eastern California Shear Zone.",

            "abstract": "Steadily increasing rates of urbanization have raised concerns about the negative impacts of urban runoff on receiving surface water quality. These concerns have been further amplified by landscaping paradigms that encourage high-input, intensively-managed and mono-culture turf and lawn landscapes. We conducted a watershed-scale assessment of turf management practices on water quality vis-à-vis less-intensive management practices that preserve and enhance more diverse and native vegetation. The study treatments with existing/established vegetation and landscaping practices included turf, urban, forest, meadow, and a mixed site with a professional golf course. Stream water sampling was performed during baseflow and storm events. Highest nutrient (nitrate and total nitrogen) concentrations in runoff were observed for the mixed watershed draining the golf course. In contrast, nutrient concentrations in baseflow from the turf watershed were lower than expected and were comparable to those measured in the surrounding meadow and forest sites. Runoff losses from the turf site may have been minimal due to the optimal quality of management implemented. Total nitrogen concentrations from the turf site increased sharply during the first storms following fertilization, suggesting that despite optimal management there exists a risk for nutrient runoff following fertilization. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations from the turf site were elevated and aromatic in content while the mixed watershed site yielded more labile DOM. Overall, this study suggests that turf lawns, when managed properly, pose minimal environmental risk to surrounding surface waters. Based on the results of this study, providing homeowners with increased information regarding best management practices for lawn maintenance may serve as a cost-efficient method for reducing suburban runoff pollution.",

            "abstract": "Retrogressive thaw slumps are one of the most dramatic thermokarst features in ice-rich permafrost landscapes and their growth may pose significant terrestrial and aquatic impacts. In the Richardson Mountains and Lower Peel River watersheds (northwestern Canada), thaw slumps are abundant along hillslopes. Runoff from active slumps is characterized by conductivity and solute concentration nearly 1 order of magnitude higher than in pristine streams. As such, the objective of this study is to evaluate the potential cumulative impacts of thaw slumps to aquatic ecosystems and determine the watershed scale at which the impacts of slumps can be detected. This is accomplished by: i) compiling the distribution of active and stable thaw slumps in the Richardson Mountains and Peel Plateau; ii) determining the hydrogeochemistry (major ions, total dissolved solids) of pristine and slump impacted streams in this region; and iii) representing this information on watershed platforms (4th to 6th order scale). The results indicate a positive relation between slump density, cumulative surface area of slumps and average ionic concentrations within the various sub-watershed scales. Solute concentrations along streams reveal that ionic content increases immediately downstream of a slump and that for slumps with surface area greater than 5ha, the solute concentrations remain significantly higher in impacted streams, even at the 4th-order watershed scale. The broad scale impacts of thaw slumps are indicated by a significant increase in solute concentrations in the Peel River (70,000 km2 watershed scale). These observations illustrate the nature and magnitude of hydrogeochemical changes that can be expected as ice-rich landscapes adjust to a rapidly changing climate.",

This study attempts to quantify exactly how much CO2 can be stored through dissolution trapping assuming the free CO2 will be dissolved continuously on the top of perturbed brine phase. To our knowledge, most former investigations focused on physical explanations of density-driven free convection instability. Our aim is to compute the amount of CO2 (by mass) captured by dissolution trapping until the model reservoir reaches steady state. The numerical experimentation is done using dimensionless mass and momentum conservation laws. Reservoir is impervious from both sides and bottom, only open to CO2 at the top. The major problem parameter here is the solutal Rayleigh number of which we carry out an extensive survey to find out low and high ends based on real field data. Because density difference is the main driving force, we also investigate the effects of possible impurities retained in CO2 stream and the resulting effect on density contrast. We study results of both homogeneous and heterogeneous permeable reservoirs. Also, computations of zero gradient and zero flow boundary conditions are compared to understand the boundary effects. In all cases we set to run simulations for extended period of times (> 20,000 years) to achieve conclusive results.",

During its almost ten years of existence and continual growth, GLEON has inspired innovative science, new modeling approaches, and accumulated extensive experience in the management of streaming, high resolution, and large volume data. However, a recent ‘data task force’ identified inhibiting data infrastructure issues, including providing access to data, discovering distributed data, and integrating data into useful data products for scientific research and management. Accordingly, in support of the complete data lifecycle, tools are being developed by the GLEON community and integrated with innovative technology from other groups to improve environmental observations data management in the broader community. Specifically we will discuss raw data handling with tools developed by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences (CUAHSI, Observation Data Model and DataLoader), quality control practices using a newly developed R package (sensorQC), data access with HydroDesktop, or webservices delivering WaterML, data analysis with the R package rLakeAnalyzer, and final storage of the quality controlled, harmonized and value added data product in a DataONE member node. Such data product is then discoverable, accessible for new analyses and citable in subsequent publications. Leveraging GLEON’s organizational structure, community trust, extensive experience, and technological talent the goal is to develop a design and implementation plan for a data publishing and sharing system that will address not only GLEON’s needs, but also those of other environmental research communities.",

SWAT’s improved version (UN-SWAT) explicitly represents infiltration, soil evaporation, unsaturated water flow, root water update, and lateral drainage. Water-exchanges across the surface-subsurface and unsaturated-saturated zone interfaces are defined as the system’s dependent top and bottom boundaries of the soil profile, respectively. In the continuum from the land surface to the aquifer, the top boundary of the soil profile accounts for non-ponding or ponding infiltration, as well as atmosphere-controlled or soil-controlled evaporation. Vegetation’s root water update and lateral drainage are represented as sink terms in each soil layer. The soil profile is discretized by a variable number of computational nodes of the soil profile, whose bottom position is determined based on the groundwater table. UN-SWAT validation is performed by a single-HRU and a multi-HRU simulations in the Little Washita River Experimental Watershed in Oklahoma. Results prove that UN-SWAT’s performance simulating the soil water movement in both space and time under complex conditions agree observed soil moisture and stream discharge data. UN-SWAT represents an improvement over other hydrologic models by providing a more accurate solution to the soil-water-vegetation model and accounting for the dynamics of climate and groundwater conditions.",

            "abstract": "The scope of this work is stochastic emulation of surrogate sea-level pressure (SLP) for the use in error estimation and statistical prediction studies. The input SLP data set whose statistics is to be emulated was taken from the 1979–2013 ERA Interim Reanalysis at full 6-hourly temporal and 0.75º spatial resolutions over the Northern Hemisphere. Upon subtracting seasonal climatology, the SLP anomalies (SLPA) were projected onto the subspace of 1000 leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of the daily-mean SLPA, which account for the vast majority (>99%) of the full 6-hourly fields’ variance for each season. The main step of our methodology is the estimation of a linear autoregressive moving average (ARMA) empirical model for the daily SLPA principal components (PCs) via regularized multiple linear regression (MLR); this model was driven, at the stage of simulation, by state-dependent (multiplicative) noise. Finally, we have also developed and implemented a diagnostic statistical scheme for accurate interpolation of simulated daily SLPA anomalies to 6-hourly temporal resolution. Upon transforming the simulated 6-hourly SLPA PCs into the physical space and adding seasonal climatology, the resulting SLP variability was compared to the actual variability in the ERA Interim Reanalysis. We show that our empirical model produces independent realizations of SLP variability, which are nearly indistinguishable from the observed variability over a wide range of statistical measures; these measures include, among other things, spatial patterns of band-pass and low-pass filtered variability, as well as diverse characteristics of mid-latitude cyclone tracks.",

            "abstract": "In Lake Chad basin, the Quaternary phreatic Aquifer (named hereafter QPA) presents large piezometric anomalies referred as domes and depressions. Depths of these piezometric anomalies are ~15 m and ~60 m, respectively [1]. Leblanc et al., (2003) discovered that brightness temperatures from METEOSAT infrared images of the Lake Chad basin show a correlation with the QPA piezometry. Indeed, during wet seasons, domes are associated with warm brightness temperatures, at the contrary of the depressions, which appear cold in METEOSAT images. Through this observation, these authors [2] proposed that this thermal behaviour results from an excess of evapotranspiration that can also explain the formation of the piezometric anomalies. However, data provided by temperature logs in oil wells lead us to propose another hypothesis.\nTemperature logs obtained in oil wells [3] illustrate that in the ancient Lake Chad and in the Bornou depression, at the SW of the Lake, heat transport is made by convection in the ~3 km deep confined aquifers. Moreover, we have estimated that the heat fluxes at the surface of the ancient Lake Chad can reach 138 mW m-2 and in the Bornou depression, ~63 mW m-2. Others oil wells show that, at the exterior of the depression, the heat transport is conductive and the heat fluxes at the surface are ~50 mW m-2. These new observations permit us to propose that beneath the depressions, a cold and salty descending convective current suck the QPA. Beneath the dome, a warm and less salty ascending current creates an overpressure in the QPA. Now, to explain the link observed with the thermal behaviour, we propose that over the domes, as the QPA is warm, water can rises by capillarity. The piezometric depressions regions are associated with a presence of clay-rich soils at the surface, which makes difficult the exchange between the QPA and the atmosphere. However, we have discovered some giant dessication cracks that can facilitate the exchanges by increasing the vertical permeability of the clay cap horizon. These facts eventually explain the correlation between the observed brightness temperatures and the piezometric anomalies.\n[1] Schneider (1966), Carte hydrogéologique au 1/500 000, B.R.G.M.

            "abstract": "The Barberton Greenstone Belt (BGB, South Africa) is one of the few Archean remnants where the tectonic evolution of the Early Earth can be studied. The first formation of the crust is a controversially discussed topic among geoscientists. Tectonics on the Early Earth might have been similar to the plate movement and their driving forces that we observe today. However, regarding that some fundamental conditions like the thermal setting were considerably different at this time other processes like vertical mass transport might have played the governing role in tectonics.\nTherefore contrasting evolutionary models of the BGB exist, mainly based on a number of geological and petrological studies. However, there is only little information on its deeper architecture. For a better understanding of past processes and the character of the tectonic regime which led to the formation of the BGB, magnetotelluric (MT) surveys were carried out as a part of the German-South African Inkaba yeAfrica research initiative. At approximately 200 MT sites aligned along six profiles (approx. 80 to 110 km length) data was collected during two field experiments in 2009 and 2010.\nThe MT method images the electrical conductivity of rocks and is particularly sensitive to imprints of tectonic processes resulting in persistent mineralization e.g. along shear planes.\nAgainst the surrounding of significantly conductive geological units like the Phanerozoic Transvaal cover, the rocks of the BGB are generally characterized by high electrical resistivities. Particularly plutons such as the Dalmein Pluton can be traced deeply into the crust. Contrary, faults of the BGB appear as zones of high conductivity down to a depth of 5 to 10 km. We will present 3D inversion results indicating an extension of the plutons of the western BGB beneath the Transvaal cover and a sharp conductivity contrast of the BGB compared to the eastern batholiths. We will discuss existing models of the evolution of the BGB in view of our 3D electrical conductivity images.",

            "abstract": "The quantity and distribution of water inside the deep Earth has major consequences for tectonic and geodynamic processes, yet remains essentially unconstrained. Laboratory experiments on nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) of the mantle transition zone have indicated that these minerals in particular are capable of storing significant amounts of water. We pose the question of whether seismology can be used to distinguish a hydrous from an anhydrous transition zone. We perform an extensive literature search of the experimentally-determined elastic properties and phase equilibria of hydrous NAMs, and use thermodynamic modelling to predict the seismic properties (Vp, Vs and density) of these minerals at transition zone pressures and temperatures. We compare these models with their anhydrous counterparts, taking into account the (often large) uncertainties in the mineralogical data. We find that much experimental work remains to be done for completely defining the elastic parameters and phase equilibria of the hydrous minerals, and large uncertainties produce a wide range of possible seismic structures. This uncertainty makes it difficult to use metrics such as the depths of the 410 and 660 discontinuities for mapping transition zone water content. At the same time, average P and S wave velocities inside the transition zone are not helpful, since there is a near-perfect trade-off between changes in water content, changes in temperature and changes in iron content. Average velocity gradients, density and density gradients appear to be both sensitive to, and diagnostic of, the presence of water. However these parameters are difficult to resolve seismically. Potentially the impedance contrast at 410 may also be useful, depending on the partitioning of water between olivine and wadsleyite. From a seismological perspective, it would be most helpful for future experimental studies to focus on better constraining the phase boundaries in hydrous (Mg,Fe)2SiO4, since these control the depths of the 410 and 660 discontinuities, which themselves are readily imaged by a number of seismic probes. Phase equilibria at the high temperatures appropriate to mantle transition zone conditions (c. 1700-2000 K) would be especially useful.",

A major advance for our knowledge about the later Pliocene has been the coordination of modelling efforts through the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP). Here the changes in interannual modes of sea surface temperature variability will be presented across PlioMIP. Previously model ensembles have shown little consensus in the response of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to imposed forcings - either for the past or future. The PlioMIP ensemble, however, shows surprising agreement with eight models simulating reduced variability and only one model indicating no change. The Pliocene's robustly weaker ENSO also saw a shift to lower frequencies. Model ensembles focussed at a wide variety of forcing scenarios have not yet shown this level of coherency. Nonetheless the PlioMIP ensemble does not show a robust response of either ENSO flavour or sea surface temperature variability in the Tropical Indian and North Pacific Oceans. Existing suggestions of ENSO properties linked to changes in zonal temperature gradient, seasonal cycle and the elevation of the Andes Mountains are investigated, yet prove insufficient to explain the coherent response.",

            "abstract": "A case study was performed at a former industrial site in the Santa Susana Mountains in Canoga Park, California in order to observe discontinuities such as faults and fractures that potentially affect groundwater flow and contaminant transport within the study area. The active multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW) was performed using a landstreamer and weight drop source along a service road spanning approximately 1.4 miles. From previous geologic investigations, it is assumed that at least two faults cross the seismic profile and that one end of the profile is within a shear zone. The subsurface is composed of brittle to competent sandstone with intermittent shale beds that make up the Chatsworth Formation. Collected data were used to construct 2-D shear-wave velocity profiles and for backscatter analyses. Noise tests from an additional reflection survey along the same road was used as passive MASW to supplement the active data where low frequency data was absent. The goal of this case study is to observe the presence and orientation faults and fractures that could not be determined from surface mapping or downhole geophysical logging.\nHigher mode surface waves contaminated much of the data providing evidence of the complex geologic structure potentially caused by an abundance of faults, fractures, and changing topography throughout the profile. The passive MASW provided low frequency dispersion information which helped dispersion curve picking where the active data was not sufficient. The backscatter analyses observed several events that coincided with geologic features seen in the MASW results as well as in areas where the higher mode contamination was too great for MASW analysis.\nAs a result, the combination of active MASW, passive MASW, and backscatter analyses provided velocity information at depths to 30 m. Several discontinuities were observed in the velocity profiles and backscatter analyses. These low velocity features may provide information regarding the presence and orientation of faults and fractures after further investigation. Only 51% of the stations were used for characterizing the subsurface before the signal-to-noise ratio and the risk of artifacts and aliasing in the data became too great for extracting reliable results.",

            "abstract": "Recently, nitrate contaminated groundwater problem is a growing concern for scholars both at home and abroad. This study developed a new type of environment-friendly material which has the ability to remove nitrate from contaminated groundwater. The material has a certain degree of mechanical strength and uniform sphericity, with waste wood and straw as raw material, to achieve the purpose of using waste treat waste. In this study, the material and fine sand are mixed and filled in glass column, which is wrapped by black tape in order to avoid light, to test the removal ability toward nitrate nitrogen with influent nitrate nitrogen concentration of 50 mg N/L. The material surface is porous, which could facilitate the reaction between the active sites in the material and nitrate in polluted groundwater, and facilitate microbes implanting on the surface. After running for two months, the nitrate nitrogen removal rate is greater than 90%, and the nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen of effluent are lower than the EPA prescribed maximum limit concentration of nitrate in drinking water（N03--N<10mg N/L, NO2--N<1mg N/L）, while the ammonia nitrogen in the effluent is less than 1 mg N/L, lower than the maximum limit concentration of ammonia nitrogen in drinking water made by WHO(NH4+-N<1.5mg N/L), indicating its effective removal rate for nitrate and the absence of serious nitrite and ammonia accumulation. The developed material will have a good prospect in removing nitrate from polluted groundwater.",

            "abstract": "Various records across the Paleocene – Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) have established approximately 5 °C of additional surface and deep ocean warming, superimposed on the already warm latest Paleocene. The PETM is further characterized by a global negative stable carbon isotope excursion (CIE), poleward migration of thermophilic biota, ocean acidification, increased weathering, photic zone euxinia and intensified hydrological cycle. Reconstructed temperatures for the PETM in mid and high-latitudes regularly exceed modern open marine tropical temperatures. Constraints on absolute tropical temperatures are, however, limited.\nWe studied the PETM in a sediment section from the Nigerian sector of the Dahomey Basin, deposited on the shelf near the equator. We estimate sea surface temperatures by paired analyses of TEX86, and Mg/Ca and δ18O of foraminifera from the Shagamu Quarry. These show Palaeocene temperatures of ~33 °C and SSTs rose by 4 °C during the PETM based on TEX86. During the PETM, intermittent photic zone euxinia developed based on the presence of the biomarker isorenieratane. Interestingly, during peak warmth, dinoflagellate cyst abundances and diversity are remarkably low.\nFrom our new data and evidence from modern dinoflagellate experiments, we conclude that thermal stress was the main driver for this observation. We derive that endothermal and most ectothermal nektonic and planktonic marine eukaryotic organisms could not have lived in the surface waters in this part of the tropics during the PETM.",

            "abstract": "It is one of the great challenges in seismology to resolve spatially varying crustal anisotropy, and body waves that undergo P-to-S conversion at the crust-mantle boundary provide the best sampling. Since such phases arrive within the P wave coda, they are identified using receiver functions. Sophisticated techniques have been developed to migrate or to invert receiver functions for crustal structure, however, crustal anisotropic properties are hardly investigated. Most of the receiver function studies targeting crustal anisotropy use forward modeling approaches that demand examination of several tens of thousand of models, which becomes daunting.\nWe have developed a technique to explore detailed anisotropic nature of the crust from splitting analysis of teleseismic receiver functions. Unlike the conventional methods, we consider crust as a transversely isotropic medium with tilted (not horizontal) symmetry axis and modify the cross-convolution method accordingly. For each station, our approach seeks the optimal set of fast polarization azimuth, tilt of the symmetry axis, dip of the Moho discontinuity, and measure of anisotropic strength by analyzing data from multiple sources simultaneously.\nWe test our approach using ray-theoretical synthetic seismograms generated by the RAYSUM algorithm. Estimated parameters are usually in good agreement with the input, however, the most robustly estimated value is always the fast splitting direction. Besides synthetics, we also applied our technique to the recordings of the ANZA network stations that are locate in southern California. Every station in this network shows significant amount of energy on the transverse component receiver functions indicating the presence of crustal anisotropy or dipping interface. In addition to lateral variations in fast polarization direction across this array, we also present our preliminary results for the neighboring states. At some stations, we detect converted energy from a strong mid-crustal interface with polarity reversals on transverse component, which implies the presence of multiple anisotropic layers within the crust. The new approach can be applied for studying multi-layered anisotropy, and provides a unique opportunity for investigating depth-varying crustal anisotropy.",

Recent seismological and geological studies suggest that the lithospheric structure between these two plateaus differs significantly since the Zagros fold-thrust belt in western Iran is associated with a thick lithospheric root (up to 225 km) whereas the East Anatolia seems to be lacking its mantle lithosphere. In this work, we use 2-D numerical experiments to test the applicability of small-scale convection model to account for the anomalous topography and uplift across the Turkish-Iranian plateau. Our models are designed to track the evolution of the surface topography as a response to a mantle flow activity in the step like morphology of the lithospheric base as wells as the temperature field. We test the role of several rheological parameters (e.g., viscosity) and variation in the lithospheric thickness in a series of experiments. Modeling results are tested against various observables for eastern Anatolia and Iran such as surface topography, crustal thickness, and surface strain rate. Our results provide new insight in the geodynamic evolution of Alpine type orogenic systems and suggest alternative mechanism to lithospheric delamination and/or slab break-off for the uplift of mountain belts.",

            "abstract": "Stishovite is stable at 9~50GPa and further transformed into CaCl2-type silica. It is estimated that stishovite makes up more than 20% of the subducted oceanic crust in the mantle transition zone and lower mantle. Therefore, the properties of stishovite and its polymorph are critical for us to understand the mantle convection. We calculated the elastic constants of stishovite and CaCl2-type silica at high-temperature and -pressure using the new method developed by Wu and Wentzcovitch [1], which requires only tenth of computational time of the conventional first principles method. The elastic properties of stishovite show not only strong pressure dependence but also temperature dependence. By increasing temperature, the shear instability of stishovite is shifted to an elevated pressure with a slope of ~5.4±1.4 MPa/K. The softening of the shear modulus and the positive Clapeyron slope result in crossing of the sound velocities at different temperatures, which leads to the unusual positive temperature dependence of the sound velocities around the phase boundary. The transition from stishovite to the CaCl2-type silica at the lower mantle’s temperature occurs at a depth far deeper than 1200 km and is accompanied by a velocity jump ~ 0.98±0.08 km/s in S wave velocity (VS)  and ~ 0.45±0.15 km/s in P wave velocity (VP). This transition is likely related to the seismic discontinuity at the depth ~1670 km in the vicinity of Mariana Island. The unusual positive temperature dependence of VS of stishovite and strong anisotropy of stishovite and the CaCl2-type silica around the phase boundary provide potential ways to identify the origin of the seismic discontinuity [2].\n[1].

Comparing those fractures to the mechanical properties of the rocks provides key insights into predicting fractures in the subsurface. The Ozark Dome is an ideal study area for fracture research due to multiple fracturing events resulting from the multi-stage deformation Ouachita Orogeny during the late Paleozoic.\nThis study used field observations of lithology and fracture attributes over ~10 outcrops in the Mississppian-Pennsylvanian (360-298 ma) carbonate sequence of the Ozark Plateau. Outcrops were chosen having excellent lithological exposure up the sequence from the Boone to Atoka formations and with 3D representations of the fracture patterns. In all, the area investigated covered nearly 60 square miles.\nFracture attributes collected included fracture intensity, length, and abutting relationships; and rock hardness data collected from a Schmidt Hammer. Data was analyzed using programs such as Stereonet and MOVE structural software that generated rose diagrams, structural cross sections, and products.\nInitial results indicate 4 main fracture orientations that resulted from at least 3 discrete phases of deformation during the Miss-Penn. Initial results also indicate that the present-day mechanical stratigraphy is not the same one that existed during the deformation phases. Work done at the Tiger Blvd. outcrops showed at least 2 distinct mechanical units. Fractures observed at the outcrop did not respect mechanical bed boundaries, and showed no relationship to the differences in mechanical properties observed.\nThis study will aid in the interpretation of fractures in regards to mechanical stratigraphy, which allows for a better understanding of subsurface fracture prediction in carbonate sequences worldwide. Finally, the fracture work here will also help in elucidating the tectonic history of the field area during the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian.",

These phenomena are relevant in geophysical, environmental, industrial and biological applications.\nThe fluid is characterized by an Ostwald-DeWaele constitutive equation with behaviour index n. The flow is driven by the release of fluid at the origin of an infinite porous domain. In order to represent several possible spreading scenarios, we consider: i) different domain geometries: plane, radial, and channelized, with the channel shape parameterized by k; ii) instantaneous or continuous injection, depending on the time exponent of the volume of fluid in the current, α; iii) horizontal or inclined impermeable boundaries. Systematic heterogeneity along the streamwise and/or transverse direction is added to the conceptualization upon considering a power-law permeability variation governed by two additional parameters ω and β. Scalings for current length and thickness are derived in self similar form coupling the modified Darcy’s law accounting for the fluid rheology with the mass balance equation. The length, thickness, and aspect ratio of the current are studied as functions of model parameters; several different critical values of α emerge and govern the type of dependency, as well as the tendency of the current to accelerate or decelerate and become thicker or thinner at a given point. The asymptotic validity of the solutions is limited to certain ranges of model parameters.\nExperimental validation is performed under constant volume, constant and variable flux regimes in tanks/channels filled with transparent glass beads of uniform or variable diameter, using shear-thinning suspensions and Newtonian mixtures. The experimental results for the length and profile of the current agree well with the self-similar solutions at intermediate and late times.",

A field experiment was therefore conducted in farmers’ field in Hanoi, Vietnam to examine whether the use of straw compost or straw biochar, in combination with the safe alternate wetting and drying (AWD) has the potential to suppress both CH4 and N2O emissions from rice paddies while maintaining the rice yield. The study compared the proposed strategies with local farmers’ practice of permanent flooding (PF) and farmyard manure (FYM) incorporation, respectively. A control treatment without organic matter incorporation in both AWD and PF water regimes was also included in the study; all treatments received equal amounts of mineral fertilizer. Gas emissions were monitored using the closed chamber method at seven-day intervals during the first 50 days and at 15-day intervals thereafter. Addition of FYM, straw compost and biochar increased CH4 emissions by 230 %, 150 % and 38 %, respectively, when compared with the control treatments in both the AWD and PF water regimes. Within AWD, FYM increased N2O emissions by 30 %, straw compost and biochar displayed similar amount of N2O emissions as the control treatment. Within PF, N2O emissions under FYM and straw compost were 40 % and 35 % higher than the control treatment, respectively, and biochar once again displayed similar amount of N2O emissions as the control treatment. Yield difference was not significant (P > 0.05) between any of the treatments. These results indicated that the straw compost incorporation might not reduce the global warming potential (GWP) and yield-scaled GWP of rice production, whereas biochar in combination with AWD has the potential to maintain the GWP and yield-scaled GWP of rice production at lower level than the farmers’ practice.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring of rainfall and vegetation over the continent of Africa is important for assessing the status of crop health and agriculture, along with long-term changes in land use change. These issues can be addressed through examination of long-term precipitation (rainfall) data sets and remote sensing of land surface vegetation and land use types. Two products have been used previously to address these goals: the Climate Hazard Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall data, and multi-day composites of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the FEWS NET’s eMODIS product. Combined, these are very large data sets that require unique tools and architecture to facilitate a variety of data analysis methods or data exploration by the end user community. To address these needs, a web-enabled system has been developed to allow end-users to interrogate CHIRPS rainfall and eMODIS NDVI data over the continent of Africa. The architecture allows end-users to use custom defined geometries, or the use of predefined political boundaries in their interrogation of the data. The massive amount of data interrogated by the system allows the end-users with only a web browser to extract vital information in order to investigate land use change and its causes. The system can be used to generate daily, monthly and yearly averages over a geographical area and range of dates of interest to the user. It also provides analysis of trends in precipitation or vegetation change for times of interest. The data provided back to the end-user is displayed in graphical form and can be exported for use in other, external tools. The development of this tool has significantly decreased the investment and requirements for end-users to use these two important datasets, while also allowing the flexibility to the end-user to limit the search to the area of interest.",

            "abstract": "Mineral aerosols are an increasingly important component of the climate system that affect the radiative budget, nutrient cycles, and human environments. Dust emissions are largely controlled by regional climate factors such as atmospheric stability, precipitation, soil moisture, and vegetation. Regional climates, particularly within the tropics, are affected by teleconnections excited by sea surface temperatures. We therefore explore the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly patterns on local climates in major dust source regions (including southern Africa, the Arabian Desert, the Lake Eyre basin, and three others in North Africa) to help understand variability in the global dust cycle. We investigate the sensitivity of regional climate variables impacting mineral aerosol emissions to global SST anomaly patterns by estimating the global teleconnection operator (GTO), which relates regional climate responses to SST anomaly patterns. We estimate the GTO using the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model version 5.0 (CAM5.0) forced by an ensemble of randomly perturbed climatological SST fields.\nVariability in dust emissions are connected to SST anomaly patterns in the tropical oceans, particularly in the Indian and western Pacific Oceans. Teleconnections excited by remote SST anomalies typically modify dust emissions via near-surface circulation changes that impact friction velocity. However, the impact of SST-driven changes on threshold friction velocity can be on the same order of magnitude as those of friction velocity, suggesting the impact of SST anomalies on surface conditions are also significant. We reconstruct historical climates using the GTO and compare the results to a non-linear model and observations to assess the GTO capabilities and to identify ocean basins with the strongest influence on major dust source regions. Recognizing SST anomaly patterns as a component of internal variability in regional dust emissions helps characterize the impact of human influences on the dust cycle as well as improve predictions of dust and their climate impacts.",

            "abstract": "Hydropower is a dominant renewable energy source at the global level, accounting for more than 15% of the world’s total power supply. It is also very vulnerable to climate change. Improved understanding of climate change impact on hydropower can help develop adaptation measures to increase the resilience of energy system. In this study, we developed a comprehensive estimate of global hydropower potential using runoff and stream flow data derived from a global hydrologic model with a river routing sub-model, along with turbine technology performance, cost assumptions, and environmental consideration (Figure 1). We find that hydropower has the potential to supply a significant portion of the world energy needs, although this potential varies substantially by regions. Resources in a number of countries exceed by multiple folds the total current demand for electricity, e.g., Russia and Indonesia. A sensitivity analysis indicates that hydropower potential can be highly sensitive to a number of parameters including designed flow for capacity, cost and financing, turbine efficiency, and stream flow. The climate change impact on hydropower potential was evaluated by using runoff outputs from 4 climate models (HadCM3, PCM, CGCM2, and CSIRO2). It was found that the climate change on hydropower shows large variation not only by regions, but also climate models, and this demonstrates the importance of incorporating climate change into infrastructure-planning at the regional level though the existing uncertainties.",

            "abstract": "Daily station records and output from the MERRA atmospheric reanalysis are used to examine the characteristics of extreme daily precipitation events in Spitzbergen. Spitzbergen is the largest island of the Svalbard Archipelago, located between about 77-79oN in the northern North Atlantic. The region is frequently influenced by strong extratropical cyclones associated with the North Atlantic Cyclone track and (in winter) pronounced regional baroclinicity due to proximity to the sea ice margin. Despite the stronger cyclone activity in winter, extreme daily precipitation events, defined as those of at least 25 mm, can occur year round. Based on composite analysis, the average pattern associated with extremes has the island influenced by a strong trough of low sea level pressure extending from the southwest, unusually strong southerly winds in troposphere, positive anomalies in precipitable water and pronounced upward motion (negative omega) at 500 hPa. This is linked aloft to positive anomalies in 500 hPa height over the Barents Sea and negative anomalies over Greenland. The mean pattern for summer-only events is similar. While individual extreme events do not share all of these characteristics, strong southerly flow and positive anomalies in precipitable water provide a near common thread. Several of the largest precipitation events can be associated with “atmospheric rivers” seen as narrow corridors of strong positive anomalies in precipitable water extending thousands of kilometers south into the subtropical Atlantic. Reflecting local topography, large precipitation events at one of the Spitsbergen sites are typically not well represented at others, a notable exception being the two-day event of 29-30 January, 2012, which appears to be clearly linked to an atmospheric river and is examined as a case study.",

            "abstract": "The CLiDE (CAESAR-Lisflood-DESC) platform integrates a variety of modelling components, in order to represent coupled environmental processes and assess their co-evolution over daily to centennial time-scales. A distributed surface-subsurface water partitioning component lies conceptually at the platform centre; providing the key linkages between the atmospheric, sediment transport and vegetation components. Fluvial sediment transport is simulated using the CAESAR model, which has previously been used to investigate a variety of sediment transport, erosional and depositional processes at centennial to millennial scales. Driving CAESAR with a higher resolution, distributed hydrology allows CLiDE to effectively capture geomorphological features that operate at sub-centennial timescales. Non-fluvial sediment transport at the mesoscale is handled by a debris flow component, which drives sediment transport through exchanges of energy and is triggered through modification of local gradient and hydrology. The coupled nature of the platform allows a variety of geomorphological assessments to be undertaken.\nWe present a variety of regional scale, modelling case studies, which assess the impacts of climate, groundwater and land use on geomorphology. We investigate the non-linear influence of these drivers on the spatial and temporal evolution of river basins and find that antecedent conditions can have a major influence on future erosion events.

            "abstract": "The Landsat archive is increasingly being used to detect trends in the occurrence of forest disturbance. Beyond information about the amount of area affected, forest managers need to know if and how disturbance severity is changing. For example, the United States National Forest System (NFS) has developed a comprehensive plan for carbon monitoring, which requires a detailed temporal mapping of forest disturbance magnitudes across 75 million hectares. To meet this need, we have prepared multitemporal models of percent canopy cover that were calibrated with extensive field data from the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA). By applying these models to pre- and post-event Landsat images at the site of known disturbances, we develop maps showing first-order estimates of disturbance magnitude on the basis of cover removal. However, validation activities consistently show that these initial estimates under-estimate disturbance magnitude. We have developed an approach, which quantifies this under-prediction at the landscape level and uses empirical validation data to adjust change magnitude estimates derived from initial disturbance maps.\nIn an assessment of adjusted magnitude trends of NFS’ Northern Region from 1990 to the present, we observed significant declines since 1990 (p < .01) in harvest magnitude, likely related to known reduction of clearcutting practices in the region. Fire, conversely, did not show strongly significant trends in magnitude, despite an increase in the overall area affected. As Landsat is used to provide increasingly precise maps of the timing and location of historical forest disturbance, a logical next step is to use the archive to generate widely interpretable and objective estimates of disturbance magnitude.",

            "abstract": "During the last two decades climate studies have reported a tendency toward a decline in measured near-surface wind speed in some regions of Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. This weakening in observed wind speed has been recently termed “global stilling”, showing a worldwide average trend of -0.140 m s-1 dec-1 during last 50-years. The precise cause of the “global stilling” remains largely uncertain and has been hypothetically attributed to several factors, mainly related to: (i) an increasing surface roughness (i.e. forest growth, land use changes, and urbanization); (ii) a slowdown in large-scale atmospheric circulation; (iii) instrumental drifts and technological improvements, maintenance, and shifts in measurements sites and calibration issues; (iv) sunlight dimming due to air pollution; and (v) astronomical changes. This study proposed a novel investigation aimed at analyzing how different measurement time intervals used to calculate a wind speed series can affect the sign and magnitude of long-term wind speed trends. For instance, National Weather Services across the globe estimate daily average wind speed using different time intervals and formulae that may affect the trend results. Firstly, we carried out a comprehensive review of wind studies reporting the sign and magnitude of wind speed trend and the sampling intervals used. Secondly, we analyzed near-surface wind speed trends recorded at 59 land-based stations across Spain comparing monthly mean wind speed series obtained from: (a) daily mean wind speed data averaged from standard 10-min mean observations at 0000, 0700, 1300 and 1800 UTC; and (b) average wind speed of 24 hourly measurements (i.e., wind run measurements) from 0000 to 2400 UTC. Thirdly and finally, we quantified the impact of anemometer drift (i.e. bearing malfunction) by presenting preliminary results (1-year of paired measurements) from a comparison of one new anemometer sensor against one malfunctioned anenometer sensor due to old bearings.",

            "abstract": "In the last decades methyl bromide (CH3Br) has been widely used for pest control in agriculture, during transport and in susceptible environments such as grain elevators, flour mills. Due to its ozone-depleting properties most applications, except for quarantine-preshipment uses, are practically forbidden within the Montreal Protocol and its amendments. This led to a decline of both world-wide emissions and of global background concentrations. In Europe, emissions have declined concurrently, as CH3Br has not been allowed to be used in Europe from 2007 onwards in agriculture and from 2010 in quarantine/preshipment uses. Continuous measurements from the European high-altitude sites Jungfraujoch (Switzerland) and Monte Cimone (Italy) are used to verify this phase-out in different parts of Europe. Pollution events were still detected at these sites until around 2012, potentially indicating forbidden small scale usage of CH3Br in Europe. However, within the last 2 years the abundance and the height of these events have become very small - showing an overall good acceptance of the CH3Br ban in Europe.\nOn the other hand, sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) is used as a partial replacement of CH3Br in the fumigation of food processing structures. It shows very distinct, sporadic peak events at the Jungfraujoch measurement site. SO2F2 does not affect the ozone layer but is a potent greenhouse gas (100-year GWP: 4740) with a lifetime of 36 years. European sources of SO2F2 were estimated by using measurements at Jungfraujoch.",

Only a limited number of normal-faulting earthquakes have geodetic measurements of viscoelastic relaxation and there is limited knowledge of the viscosity structure of the lower crust/upper mantle in the Central Appennines. Since this region is currently experiencing active extension that gives rise to normal-faulting seismicity, the estimation of the typical relaxation time of the region is of great interest for interseismic strain-rate estimations and to better understand how extension is accommodated beneath the upper seismogenic crust. GPS data are processed by using GIPSY/OASIS software. Particular care has been taken to estimate and correct for the interseismic deformation and the early afterslip deformation, well documented by GPS and InSAR (D’Agostino et al., 2012). A particularly interesting signal observed in the time series is related to hydrological loading with seasonal and multi-annual periodicities. Here we present the preliminary results of the comparison between about 5 years of postseismic deformation recorded at permanent GPS stations, and the surface deformation expected running different viscoelastic models in order to estimate best-fit rheological parameters. Forward models are generated by means of the PSCMP/PSGRN code (Wang et al. 2006). Preliminary results will be presented and possible implications for the mechanism of active crustal extension in general and of the Apennines in particular, will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The seismic gap theory, which identifies regions of elevated hazard based on a lack of recent seismicity in comparison to other portions of a fault, has successfully explained past earthquakes and is useful for qualitatively describing where future large earthquakes might occur. A large earthquake had been expected in the subduction zone adjacent to northern Chile, which until recently had not ruptured in a megathrust earthquake since a M~8.8 event in 1877. On April 1 2014, a M 8.2 earthquake occurred within this northern Chile seismic gap, offshore of the city of Iquique; the size and spatial extent of the rupture indicate it was not the earthquake that had been anticipated.\nHere, we present a rapid assessment of the seismotectonics of the March-April 2014 seismic sequence offshore northern Chile, including analyses of earthquake (fore- and aftershock) relocations, moment tensors, finite fault models, moment deficit calculations, and cumulative Coulomb stress transfer calculations over the duration of the sequence. This ensemble of information allows us to place the current sequence within the context of historic seismicity in the region, and to assess areas of remaining and/or elevated hazard. Our results indicate that while accumulated strain has been released for a portion of the northern Chile seismic gap, significant sections have not ruptured in almost 150 years. These observations suggest that large-to-great sized megathrust earthquakes will occur north and south of the 2014 Iquique sequence sooner than might be expected had the 2014 events ruptured the entire seismic gap.",

            "abstract": "To model and predict the structure, dynamics, and composition of Earth’s deep interior, accurate and precise measurements of thermal expansion and compressibility are required. The laser-heated diamond-anvil cell (LHDAC) coupled with synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction (XRD) is a powerful tool to determine pressure-volume-temperature (P-V-T) relationships. However, LHDAC experiments may be hampered by non-uniform heating caused by the mixing of transparent materials with opaque laser absorbers. Additionally, radial temperature gradients are exacerbated by small misalignments (1-3 µm) of the x-ray beam with respect to the center of the laser-heated hotspot. We have fabricated three-dimensional, controlled-geometry, double hot-plate samples. In this double hot-plate arrangement, a transparent oxide layer (SiO2) is sandwiched between two laser absorbing layers (Ni) in a single, cohesive sample. These samples were mass manufactured (>105 samples) using a combination of physical vapor deposition, photolithography, wet etching, and plasma etching. The double hot-plate arrangement coupled with the chemical and spatial homogeneity of the laser absorbing layers addresses problems caused by mixtures of transparent and opaque samples. The controlled-geometry samples have dimensions of 50 µm x 50 µm x 1.4 µm. The dimensions of the samples are much larger than the synchrotron x-ray beam. With a heating laser FWHM of ~50 µm, the radial temperature gradients within the volume probed by the x-ray are reduced. We conducted XRD experiments to P > 50 GPa and T > 2200 K at beamline 16-ID-B (HPCAT) of the Advanced Photon Source. Here we present relevant thermal modeling of the LHDAC environment along with Ni and SiO2 P-V-T equations of state. Our photolithography method of sample fabrication can be extended to different materials including but not limited to Fe and MgO.",

            "abstract": "The effect of temperature on maize yield has generally been considered using a single value for the entire growing season. We compare the effect of temperature trends on yield between two distinct models: a single temperature sensitivity for the whole season and a variable sensitivity across four distinct agronomic development stages. The more resolved variable-sensitivity model indicates roughly a factor of two greater influence of temperature on yield than that implied by the single-sensitivity model. The largest discrepancies occur in silking, which is demonstrated to be the most sensitive stage in the variable-sensitivity model. For instance, whereas median yields are observed to be only 53% of typical values during the hottest 1% of silking-stage temperatures, the single-sensitivity model over predicts median yields of 68% whereas the variable-sensitivity model more correctly predicts median yields of 61%. That the variable sensitivity model is also not capable of capturing the full extent of yield losses suggests that further refinement to represent the non-linear response would be useful. Results from the variable sensitivity model also indicate that management decisions regarding planting times, which have generally shifted toward earlier dates, have led to greater yield benefit than that implied by the single-sensitivity model. Together, the variation of both temperature trends and yield variability within growing stages calls for closer attention to how changes in management interact with changes in climate to ultimately affect yields.",

            "abstract": "The viability of using magnetic fabric analyses as geothermometers in sedimentary basins was investigated and new constraints on regional-scale geotherms for the Karoo sedimentary Basin were identified. A comparative study of the variation in magnetic properties in eight boreholes located along a southwest to northeast traverse across the Karoo Basin was performed. The thermal impact of the intrusive Karoo Dolerite Suite on the surrounding sediments was determined using several magnetic experiments. The methods employed during the investigation include low field anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility, variation in magneto-stratigraphy using the classic baked contact test, the magnetic Alteration Index (A40) as well as looking at the possibility to use magnetite-pyrrhotite geothermometry.\nThe experiments indicated the heating effect of the dolerite intrusions to be limited to short distances within the contact aureole. Boreholes that intersected dolerite sills indicated that the heating effect occurred no wider than half the sill thicknesses. However, due to the extensive network of sills and dykes in the Karoo Basin, an overall elevation in the geomagnetic temperatures of the stratigraphic sequence to temperatures above 150 °C was observed. This knowledge could have major implications for any potential shale-gas industry in South Africa.\nTemperatures calculated by the A40 method (minimum observed values) indicated a general increase from southwest to northeast in the thermal effect of intrusions on the Karoo sediments. This correlates with reported increased coal maturity from west to east. Several hypotheses exist for this geothermal variation including the influence that distance to magma source might have had. The most probable hypothesis however, relates to the different environmental settings that prevailed between the western and eastern parts of the basin during magma intrusion and the associated differences in thermal conductivity of low permeable marine shale in the west compared to the porous lacustrine sandstone and siltstone towards the east.",

            "abstract": "The climatology and variability of Shamal wind, an important regulator of summertime Middle Eastern dust storm activity, have been poorly characterized in the scientific literature. The Middle Eastern Shamal is a strong low-level northwesterly wind, which can lift dust from the Syrian and Iraqi deserts and transport it to the Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula. Despite its critical role as a dust storm driver, the variability and controls of summertime Shamal wind has not been addressed by previous studies. The spatial distribution and seasonal cycle of the Shamal wind during 1970-2013, along with its interannual variability, covariability with dust storm activities, and potential link to sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Pacific Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, are studied using hourly station records, reanalysis data, and remotely-sensed data. According to a wind-direction and speed-based criterion for Shamal days, the summertime Shamal behaves like a summer monsoon with variability in its onset, termination, and distinct break periods. Based on a multi-station criterion for Shamal onset and termination, the onset occurs on May 23 ± 8 days (one standard deviation), and the termination date is Sep 2 ± 21 days. The highest wind speed on a Shamal day occurs around the noon along the west coast of the Persian Gulf, corresponding to a peak in horizontal pressure gradient. The onset of Shamal is associated with the development of low pressure over Iran and high pressure over the eastern Mediterranean and northwestern Arabian Peninsula - an eastward expansion of the high over subtropical Atlantic. El Niño events support the delayed onset and weaker intensity of the summer Shamal. Intensified summer Shamal winds are associated with anomalously cool Mediterranean SSTs, which enhance the high pressure over the eastern Mediterranean. The impacts of El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Mediterranean SSTs on summer Shamal are validated by an independent statistical method, the General Equilibrium Feedback Assessment. Periods of enhanced Shamal wind intensity favor increased summertime floating dust frequency (temporal correlation = 0.77,1975-2013), dust storm frequency (temporal correlation = 0.57, 1975-2013), and aerosol optical depth (temporal correlation = 0.73, 2000-2013).",

            "abstract": "The transition between seismic rupture and aseismic creep is of central interest to better understand the mechanics of subduction processes. A M 8.2 earthquake occurred on April 1st, 2014 in the Iquique seismic gap of Northern Chile. This event was preceded by a 2-week-long foreshock sequence including a M 6.7 earthquake. Repeating earthquakes are found among the foreshock sequence that migrated towards the mainshock area, suggesting a large scale slow-slip event on the megathrust preceding the mainshock. The variations of the recurrence time of repeating earthquakes highlights the diverse seismic and aseismic slip behaviors on different megathrust segments. The repeaters that were active only before the mainshock recurred more often and were distributed in areas of substantial coseismic slip, while other repeaters occurred both before and after the mainshock in the area complementary to the mainshock rupture. The spatial and temporal distribution of the repeating earthquakes illustrate the essential role of propagating aseismic slip in leading up to the mainshock and aftershock activities. Various finite fault models indicate that the coseismic slip generally occurred down-dip from the foreshock activity and the mainshock hypocenter. Source imaging by teleseismic back-projection indicates an initial down-dip propagation stage followed by a rupture-expansion stage. In the first stage, the finite fault models show slow initiation with low amplitude moment rate at low frequency (< 0.1 Hz), while back-projection shows a steady initiation at high frequency (> 0.5 Hz). This indicates frequency-dependent manifestations of seismic radiation in the low-stress foreshock region. In the second stage, the high-frequency rupture remains within an area of low gravity anomaly, suggesting possible upper-crustal structures that promote high-frequency generation. Back-projection also shows an episode of reverse rupture propagation which suggests a delayed failure of asperities in the foreshock area. Our results highlight the complexity of the interactions between large-scale aseismic slow-slip and dynamic ruptures of megathrust earthquakes. ",

Recent studies of vesicle population properties within MORB samples suggest a similar correlation between spreading rate and magma ascent rate. This study examines dissolved CO2 and H2O analyses in MORB glasses from a comprehensive sample suite – compiled from the literature (n = 300) and from new measurements (n = 100) – spanning nearly the full range of spreading rates to investigate patterns in supersaturation. We find that samples from ridges with spreading rates <6 mm yr-1 show a distinctly different population of supersaturations and indicate a fundamental change in magma ascent rate and degassing. We explore the proposed mechanisms that control magma ascent and decompression rates in these systems including viscosity variations, tectonic stress variations, and dynamic decompression of melt reservoirs. Our results suggest that variation in ascent path length, controlled by the thermal structure of the ridge most likely exerts a first-order control on magma dynamics and hence degassing in these systems. We use these results to examine variations in the extent of degassing across the global mid-ocean ridge as a means to refine predictions of CO2 flux.",

            "abstract": "Northern Hemisphere snow water equivalent (SWE) is a key element of the Northern Hemisphere energy and water balance. It is expected to respond in a complex way to projected temperature and precipitation changes, decreasing at midlatitudes associated with warming and increasing at high latitudes associated with increases in precipitable water. Evaluation of past and projected SWE trends and initialization of seasonal to decadal forecasts requires a gridded observational SWE product. For snow cover extent several such data sets exist and their intercomparison has led to a reasonable understanding of the errors therein. We use a similar multi-data set approach for SWE, comparing an ensemble of daily gridded products in order to produce a combined product with quantitative measures of spread.\nWe use several daily, observation-based SWE products obtained from remote sensing, land surface assimilation systems, physical snow models and reanalyses: (1) GlobSnow analysis based on satellite-based passive microwave retrievals; (2) Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS); (3) Crocus distributed physical snow model driven by ERA-Interim meteorology; (4) ERA-Interim/Land reanalysis; (5) Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA reanalysis); and (6) Snow Model simulations forced by downscaled MERRA meteorology (available for the Arctic only). While the climatologies of the various SWE products differ by as much as 50%, their interannual variability and daily anomalies are comparable. The latter correlations are between 50%-90% on both interannual and intraseasonal time scales. In particular, we examine how inter-product spread, spatial correlation and temporal correlation of total Northern Hemisphere snow mass vary over the analysis period and among the various data products. Our analysis indicates that the reanalysis-derived products (3-6) are most similar to one another in comparison to GlobSnow (1) and GLDAS (2). Preliminary analysis also suggests that details of the driving meteorology rather than the particular snow or land model bear the largest influence on the resulting SWE anomalies in data products (2-6). Evaluations of historical simulations and seasonal forecasts from coupled climate model simulations using our combined data product will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) has become a key tool for the analysis of environmental models. Objectives for GSA include model simplification to support calibration, diagnostic analysis of model controls and subsequent comparison with underlying perceptual models, or decision-making analysis to understand over what range of uncertainty a specific action is robust. Variance-based approaches are most widely used for GSA of environmental models. However, methods that consider the entire Probability Density Function (PDF) of the model output, rather than its variance only, are preferable in cases where variance is not an adequate proxy of uncertainty, e.g. when the output distribution is highly-skewed or multi-modal. Additionally, in contrast to variance-based strategies, they might allow for the mapping of the output on the input space, e.g. a prerequisite for the use of GSA in robust decision-making under uncertainty. Still, the adoption of density-based methods has been limited so far, possibly because they are relatively more difficult to implement. Here we present a novel GSA method, called PAWN, to efficiently compute density-based sensitivity indices, while also enabling the necessary input-output space mapping. The key idea is to characterize output distributions by their Cumulative Distribution Functions, which are easier to derive than PDFs. We discuss and demonstrate the advantages of PAWN by application to numerical and environmental examples. We expect PAWN to increase the application of density-based approaches and to be a necessary complimentary approach to variance-based GSA.",

To support monitoring of the trends of these gases over decades, NOAA maintains the WMO World Calibration Scales for the major contributors to radiative forcing and its own universally accepted scales for most of the minor greenhouse gases. Maintenance of these scales over time ensures the consistency of measurements from decade to decade. Further quality control through use of internal and external comparisons of on-going measurements places tight constraints on spatial and temporal bias.\nBy far the most influential greenhouse gas contributing to radiative forcing is carbon dioxide (CO2). Its amount at Mauna Loa is reported on-line daily and its global trend updated monthly on NOAA’s global monitoring website and at climate.gov. This is one of the most closely watched records of atmospheric composition, as its accelerating rate of increase is a constant reminder that society has yet to deal successfully with its emissions of this gas. Much of CO2 emitted remains in the atmosphere for 1000s of years, which is why it is of substantial concern. But atmospheric CO2 is not alone in warming the planet and driving climate change. Many other gases contribute in a lesser way to this long-term trend and are captured along with CO2 in NOAA’s Annual Greenhouse Gas Index (AGGI). The AGGI is a normalized compilation of the radiative forcing (RF) of five major long-lived greenhouse gases (96% of RF) and 15 minor gases (4% of RF). Because it does not include short lived gases (< ~10 years), it measures a robust RF trend that represents the warming influence society has already committed itself to living in. This presentation discusses the development of these two indexes and their national and global use.",

            "abstract": "The choice of the representative averaging time to compute surface-layer fluxes remains a source of discrepancy between studies. While the Ogive function (Oncley et al. 1996) has become the standard approach to determine the ‘physically sound’ averaging time, uncertainty remains on how to precisely select the minimum-necessary averaging time. Alternatives based on a multiresolution analysis exist and they can further provide a characteristic time-scale separating turbulence from mesoscale motions (Vickers and Mahrt, 2003, 2005). Yet little is learned from the inherent turbulent time scales and their corresponding contribution to the overall surface-layer fluxes.\nHere a new approach based on a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) will be presented, where the extracted characteristic averaging times are energy optimal. Consequently one can now select from these POD-provided characteristic times, the most relevant time scales depending on the desired application and based on the overall energy contribution to the surface-layer fluxes. One of the main advantages of the POD-technique compared to traditional Fourier analysis or wavelet decompositions is that the shape of the eigenfunctions is directly dictated by the input data and that the resultant eigenfunctions are energy ordered in the most optimal sense. Thus, one can really determine a-priori the most ‘physically relevant’ averaging time without source of ambiguity. Examples of the proposed approach in varied complex scenarios will be presented, spanning multiple atmospheric stratifications and topography driven flows. Further, results exploring the potential of the POD technique to determine the proper averaging times for tilt corrections will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s mantle connects the atmosphere with the deep interior through convection thus setting up a gradient of oxidation: currently the atmosphere is ~20% oxygen, while the core is mostly metallic iron. As the atmosphere has changed composition throughout Earth history, the redox evolution has proven to be critical to Earth’s evolution and the origin of life. Despite its importance, the redox state of Earth’s mantle is largely an enigma and its effect on composition, phase relations and the physicochemical properties of the mantle phases is controversial. It is expected that oxygen fugacity of the mantle decreases with increasing depth. However, some experiments show an increase in the ferric iron (Fe3+) concentration in Mg-silicate perovskite (bridgmanite)—the most abundant mineral in the Earth—with accompanying metallic Fe, and suggest that the trend in iron oxidation state is opposite. In this study, we take two samples of nearly identical bulk composition [enstatite chondrite composition (Javoy, 1995: Mg/Si ~0.77, Fe/Si ~0.26)] that only differ in the relative abundance of Fe3+ to the same synthesis conditions in a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell (LHDAC). We find that despite similar starting bulk compositions and synthesis conditions (lower mantle conditions: ~30-90 GPa, 1900-2300 K), different assemblages are synthesized due to differing ferric iron content. For a more reduced (lower Fe3+/ΣFe) composition, we find Al2O3 forms its own phase separate from the dominant Mg-silicate perovskite phase, in contrast to a more Al-rich Mg-silicate perovskite-dominated assemblage for a more oxidized starting composition. The density of the reduced composition is found to be 1-1.5% denser than the more oxidized sample. This implies that as a single composition is taken deeper in to the mantle, where it is more reducing, may become denser than if the redox state remained constant. This redox-induced density difference could potentially cause sluggish convection due to the increased density in Earth’s lower mantle and lead to a more oxidized upper mantle and more reduced lower mantle.",

An empirical model for the location and rate of occurrence of the nightside near-Earth reconnection site is calculated as a function of both XGSM and YGSM from Cluster and Geotail observations. We find that the rate of occurrence of the ion-electron decoupling region is localized in YGSM and biased towards dusk. We update our empirical model to reflect the updated predicted ephemeris for the upcoming NASA Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) mission. Despite the recent change in the launch date of MMS, the predicted number of instances where MMS will encounter the reconnection region does not change from our previously determined value of 11±4. To lay the groundwork for further empirical modeling that accounts for the shape of the YGSM-dependent occurrence rate and estimates the cross-tail scale size, we analyze in situ observations of the reconnection region. Initial results constraining the cross-tail scale of an extended X-line, and the driving conditions that govern it, are presented.",

The goal of the network is to produce a map of strong shaking immediately following a major earthquake as a proxy for damage and a guide for first responders. We have also instrumented a number of buildings with the goal of determining the state of health of these structures before and after they have been shaken. In one 15-story structure, our sensors distributed two per floor, and show body waves propagating in the structure after a moderate local earthquake (M4.4 in Encino, CA). Sensors in a 52-story structure, which we plan to instrument with two sensors per floor as well, show the modes of the building (see Figure) down to the fundamental mode at 5 sec due to a M5.1 earthquake in La Habra, CA.\nThe CSN utilizes a number of technologies that will likely be important in building robust low-cost networks. These include:\nDistributed computing – the sensors themselves are smart-sensors that perform the basic detection and size estimation in the onboard computers and send the results immediately (without packetization latency) to the central facility.\nCloud computing – the central facility is housed in the cloud, which means it is more robust than a local site, and has expandable computing resources available so that it can operate with minimal resources during quiet times but still be able to exploit an very large computing facility during an earthquake.\nLow-cost/low-maintenance sensors – the MEM sensors are capable of staying onscale to +/- 2g, and can measure events in the Los Angeles Basin a low as magnitude 3.",

Pillow structure is well-preserved in the Archean greenstone belt (e.g. Komiya et al., 1999). Oxygen and hydrogen isotope of rims in the pillow is useful conventional tool to decipher chemistry of Paleao-seawater from Archean to Present. However, Archean greenstone belt suffered regional metamorphism from greenschist to Amphibolite facies conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to testify the validity of pillow chemistry from recent (Phanerozoic) metamorphosed greenstone. We have systematically collected pillowed greenstone from blueschist and eclogites. Two eclogite exhibiting pillow structures were chosen for oxygen and hydrogen isotope analysis. One is from Corsica (lawsonite eclogite collected with Dr. Alberto Vidale Barbarone) and another is from Cazadero, Franciscan belt (collected by Dr. Tatsuki Tsujimori). The both are ascribed as MORB from major and trace bulk chemistry and Ca is rich in the core and Na is poor in the rims. The former exhibits garnet, omphacite, lawsonite, and glacophane. Phengite is in core of the pillow and chlorite is in the rims. In the latter, besides garnet, omphacite, epdiote and glaucophane, chlorite is recognized with phengite in the core. Glaucophane is richer in the rims from the both samples, therefore istope analysis of glaucophane was done. Mineral separation was carefully done using micro-mill, heavy liquid and isodynamic separator. 20 mg specimens were used for oxygen isotope analysis and 2mg were for hydrogen analysis. δ18O of the all analysis (7.7 to 8.3) is within the range of unaltered igneous oceanic crust and high temperature hydrothermal alteration although rims (8.3 for Franciscan and 8.0 for Corsica) are higher than cores (7.7 for Franciscan and Corsica). δD data is also consistent with hydrothermal alteration. It is relative higher in core from the Corsica and Franciscan (-45 and -56) than of the rims (-49 and -57, respectively), suggesting dehydration in deep subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "The ecosystem services concept is seen by many as a useful paradigm to support decision-making at the complex interface between science, policy and practice. However, to be successful, it requires a strong willingness for collaboration and joint understanding. In support of this aspiration, OPPLA is being developed as a web portal to enable European communities to better manage ecosystems for human well-being and livelihoods. OPPLA will provide access to a variety of online resources such as tools, case studies, lessons learned, videos, manuals and training and educational materials. It will also provide expert forums and spaces for discussions between researchers, practitioners and decision makers. Hence a critical aspect of the success of OPPLA is the co-evolution of communities of practice.\nAn example of a community of practice is the recently launched Ecosystem Services Community – Scotland (ESCom-Scotland; escomscotland.wordpress.com). ESCom-Scotland aims to support better management of Scotland’s natural resources by helping to establish a community of practice between individuals and groups involved in the science, policy and practice behind sustainable ecosystem management. It aspires to encourage the sharing of ideas, increase collaboration and to initiate a support network for those engaging with the ecosystem services concept and it will use the OPPLA resources to support these activities.\nOPPLA is currently at the developmental stage and was instigated by two large European Commission funded research projects: OPERAs (www.operas-project.eu) and OpenNESS (www.openness-project.eu), with a combined budget of ca. €24m. These projects aim to improve understanding of how ecosystem services contribute to human well-being in different social-ecological systems. Research will establish whether, how and under what conditions the ecosystem services concept can move beyond the academic domain towards practical implementation in support of sustainable ecosystem management. New insights, and improved or novel tools and instruments, will be tested in practice in case studies that cover a range of socio-ecological systems across locales, sectors, scales and time. This presentation will discuss the development of OPPLA and the communities of practice that are emerging around it.",

The February 22, 2011, Christchurch earthquake (Mw=6.3) is the biggest aftershock of the 2010 Canterbury earthquake that is located at about 50 km to the east of the mainshock. Both earthquakes occurred on previously unrecognized faults.\nField observations indicate that the rupture of the 2010 Canterbury earthquake reached the surface; the surface rupture with a length of about 30 km is located about 4 km south of the epicenter. Also various data including the aftershock distribution and strong motion seismograms suggest a very complex rupture process. For these reasons it is useful to investigate the complex rupture process using multiple data with various sensitivities to the rupture process. While previously published source models are based on one or two datasets, here we infer the rupture process with three datasets, InSAR, strong-motion, and teleseismic data.\nWe first performed point source inversions to derive the focal mechanism of the 2010 Canterbury earthquake. Based on the focal mechanism, the aftershock distribution, the surface fault traces and the SAR interferograms, we assigned several source faults. We then performed the joint inversion to determine the rupture process of the 2010 Canterbury earthquake most suitable for reproducing all the datasets. The obtained slip distribution is in good agreement with the surface fault traces.\nWe also performed similar inversions to reveal the rupture process of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Our result indicates steep dip and large up-dip slip. This reveals the observed large vertical ground motion around the source region is due to the rupture process, rather than the local subsurface structure.\nTo investigate the effects of the 3-D velocity structure on characteristic strong motion seismograms of the two earthquakes, we plan to perform the inversion taking 3-D velocity structure of this region into account.",

Two methodologies, i) a fixed regional precipitation signal based on the current monsoon regions modern areal extent and ii) a migrating regional construct based on the modern day monsoon regions back rotated through time are investigated. These two methodologies allow an examination of the evolution of tropical precipitation over time in the region. The large-scale processes (paleogeography, CO2) of the monsoon system and the regional dynamics (e.g. sea surface temperatures, regional atmospheric circulation, oceanic heat transport, land-sea temperature differential) that control them are also examined with numerical results compared against available proxy data.\nPreliminary results indicate a downward trend in global precipitation since the late Eocene with significant change at the E/O boundary. In addition, tropical precipitation (40°N - 40°S) has seen a downward trend in rainfall since the mid-Cretaceous. S.E. Asia is shown to be influenced by changes in topographical features/ location, CO2 concentrations, and the regional atmospheric circulation playing a key role in modification of the monsoon system which drive variability on tectonic time scales.",

            "abstract": "Research into the deep carbon cycle has expanded our understanding of the depth and extent of abiotic organic synthesis in the deep Earth beyond the hydrothermal vents of the deep ocean floor, and of the role of reduced gases in supporting deep subsurface microbial communities. Most recently, this research has expanded our understanding not only of the deep biosphere but the deep hydrosphere – identifying for the first time the extreme antiquity (millions to billions of years residence time) of deep saline fracture waters in the world’s oldest rocks. Energy-rich saline fracture waters in the Precambrian crust that makes up more than 70% of the Earth’s continental lithosphereprovide important constraints on our understanding of the extent of the crust that is habitable, on the time scales of hydrogeologic isolation (and conversely mixing) of fluids relevant to the deep carbon cycle, and on the geochemistry of substrates that sustain both abiotic organic synthesis and biogeochemical cycles driven by microbial communities. Ultimately the chemistry and hydrogeology of the deep hydrosphere will help define the limits for life in the subsurface and the boundary between the biotic-abiotic fringe. Using a variety of novel techniques including noble gas analysis, clumped isotopologues of methane, and compound specific isotope analysis of CHNOS, this research is addressing questions about the distribution of deep saline fluids in Precambrian rocks worldwide, the degree of interconnectedness of these potential biomes, the habitability of these fluids, and the biogeographic diversity of this new realm of the deep hydrosphere.",

            "abstract": "OneGeology (1G) is an initiative of Geological Survey Organisations (GSOs) around the globe that dates back to 2007. Since then, OneGeology has been a leader in developing geological online map data using GeoSciML- an international interoperability standard for the exchange of geological data. Increased use of this new standard allows geological data to be shared and integrated across the planet among organisations. One of the goals of OneGeology is an exchange of know-how with the developing world, shortening the digital learning curve. In autumn 2013 OneGeology was transformed into a Consortium with a clearly defined governance structure, making it more transparent, its operation more sustainable and its membership more open where in addition to GSOs, other types of organisations that create and use geoscience data can join and contribute. The next stage of the OneGeology initiative is focused on increasing the openness and richness of that data from individual countries to create a multi-thematic global geological data resource about the rocks beneath our feet. Authoritative geoscience information will help to mitigate natural disasters, explore for resources (water, minerals and energy) and identify risks to human health on a planetary scale with the aim of 1G to increase awareness of the geosciences and their relevance among professionals and general public- to be part of the solution. We live in a digital world that enables prompt access to vast amounts of open access data. Understanding our world, the geology beneath our feet and environmental challenges related to geology calls for accessibility of geoscience data and the OneGeology Portal (portal.onegeology.org) is the place to find them.",

            "abstract": "Mixing parameterizations of current climate models could be improved by a better understanding of energy cascades in the submesoscale ocean (1 – 10 km). This study uses spectral analysis to compare energy cascades in two different data sets that resolve processes of about 1 km scale. The first data set consists of 20 years of in situ measurements from an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP, temperature and velocity) and about 10 years of in situ data from a thermosalinograph (TSG, temperature and salinity) both mounted on the Oleander, a container vessel that makes weekly trips from New Jersey to Bermuda. The second data set consists of global sea surface skin temperature data from the Visible-Infrared Imager-Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) mounted on the Soumi-NPP NASA spacecraft. The slopes of the ADCP and TSG potential energy spectra are between -2.4 and -2.6, the similarity suggesting they represent the same physical processes. Because the TSG produces higher resolution data than the ADCP, the TSG energy spectrum better resolves processes at scales < 10 km. When separated by region, the TSG energy spectra have different slopes in three distinct regions along the Oleander track: on the continental shelf and in the Gulf Stream the slopes are about -2.7, and in the Sargasso Sea the slope is about -2.5. All slopes determined from the temperature structure functions for the same regions are between 1.0 and 1.3, with the Sargasso Sea slope being the lowest of the four (the three separated regions and the entire Oleander track). In theory, the energy spectrum slope (n) and the structure function slope (p) should be related by n = p + 1 if the underlying physical processes are both isotropic and homogeneous. The deviations from theory may result from failure of this assumption and/or from the contribution of multiple processes to the spectra, which are combined differently for structure functions than for energy spectra. Of interest here is that our estimates show consistent differences in slopes in the different regions. Comparisons will be made between TSG and VIIRS temperature structure functions to determine if surface properties are consistent with in situ data.",

Nanoflare heating is a leading explanation for these observed high temperatures. Here we present results from a parameter study modeling the temperature and density structure of ARs using an impulsive nanoflare heating model. To estimate the coronal magnetic field, we have performed non-linear force free field (NLFFF) extrapolations on HMI vector magnetograms. We have traced field lines in closed field regions to obtain more than 12,000 individual flux tubes and have simulated nanoflares within each of these using a 1D hydrodynamic code. We have varied the energy released during the nanoflares as a function of magnetic field strength, loop length, flare duration and frequency. From the simulations, we can construct 3D models of the EUV/SXR emission produced by the ARs. We compare the simulated emission with that observed by AIA to constrain the heating parameters.",

Cold-water coral (CWC) colonies and their ecosystem dynamics thus offer a perfect opportunity for learning more about factors controlling deep-sea biomineralization. Our research aims to combine classical views of coral calcification with variability caused by species interaction in order to reveal impacts on skeletal formation in cold-water coral ecosystems. Symbiotic relationships, e.g. with polychaetes, offer great possibilities for studying the different intrinsic and extrinsic influences on biomineralization in CWCs. While the biological aspects of such interactions have been investigated to some extent, the processes of biomineralization which are involved in the aragonite precipitation are still largely unexplored. Our results from multi-proxy studies including high resolution mapping of different trace and minor element compositions highlight variations in growth rates, metabolic activity and precipitation patterns during calcification. The results will be discussed in light of nutrient availability, possible seasonality, and potential for pH reconstruction.",

Over the tropical oceans, several coarsely spaced buoy networks (TAO/TRITON in the Pacific, PIRATA in the Atlantic, RAMA in the Indian Ocean) are maintained as part of the Global Tropical Moored Buoy Array. For finer global scale analysis, further improvements to the modeling and understanding of physical processes within the coupled atmosphere ocean is based upon analysis of a disparate collection of low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellite based ocean surface wind data records. Since LEO satellite observations represent intermittently spaced, instantaneous snapshots, sampling against the backdrop of continuously changing physical processes, its is important to carefully merge and analyze the multiple satellite datasets in order to extract meaningful information on diurnal and semi-diurnal wind cycles. Early analysis of an investigation are described whereby multi-year collections of global sun-synchronous and asynchronous orbiting satellite ocean wind data are used to investigate the diurnal and semi-diurnal ocean wind vector variability over certain regions. A unique feature of the effort is the utilization of all capable sensors, including both wind speed and wind vector capable sensors, using overlapping asynchronous satellite observations to establish self-consistency, including inter-sensor bias correction to a common reference platform.",

It can be difficult for instructors trained in the physical sciences to design effective ways of including ethical issues in large lecture courses where whole-class discussions are not practical. The Quality Enhancement Plan for James Madison University, “The Madison Collaborative: Ethical Reasoning in Action,” (\nhttp://www.jmu.edu/mc/index.shtml\n) has identified eight key questions to be used as a framework for developing ethical reasoning exercises and evaluating student learning. These eight questions are represented by the acronym FOR CLEAR and are represented by the concepts of Fairness, Outcomes, Responsibilities, Character, Liberty, Empathy, Authority, and Rights. In this study, we use the eight key questions as an inquiry-based framework for addressing ethical issues in a 100-student general education Earth systems and climate change course. Ethical reasoning exercises are presented throughout the course and range from questions of personal behavior to issues regarding potential future generations and global natural resources. In the first few exercises, key questions are identified for the students and calibrated responses are provided as examples. By the end of the semester, students are expected to identify key questions themselves and justify their own ethical and scientific reasoning. Evaluation rubrics are customized to this scaffolding approach to the exercises. Student feedback and course data will be presented to encourage discussion of this and other approaches to explicitly incorporating ethical reasoning in general education geoscience courses.",

On the Cutting Edge (CE) has offered more than 100 face-to-face and virtual workshops, webinars, journal clubs, and other events to more than 3000 participants. The award-winning website has more than 5000 pages including 47 modules on career management, pedagogy, and geoscience topics. It has more than 1800 instructional activities contributed by the community, the majority of which have been peer-reviewed. The website had more than one million visitors last year. We have worked to support a community in which faculty improve their teaching by designing courses using research-based methods to foster higher-order thinking, incorporate geoscience data, and address cognitive and affective aspects of learning as well as a community in which faculty are comfortable and successful in managing their careers. The program addresses the needs of faculty in all career stages at the full spectrum of institutions and covering the breadth of the geoscience curriculum. We select timely and compelling topics that attract different groups of participants. CE workshops are interactive, model best pedagogical practices, emphasize participant learning, provide opportunities for participants to share their knowledge and experience, provide high-quality resources, give participants time to reflect and to develop action plans, and help transform their ideas about teaching. On the Cutting Edge has had an impact on teaching based on data from national surveys, interview and classroom observation studies, and website usage.

It defines seasonal cycles of discharge, water temperature (WT), and heat flux (HF) for the basins, and compares their main features with the Lena River in eastern Siberia, so as to understand their similarity and difference. Both rivers have similar hydrographs, i.e. low flows in winter and high discharge in summer, with the peak flood in June due to snowmelt runoff. Mackenzie River has many large lakes and they sustain the higher base flows over the fall/winter season. Mackenzie basin is large with high precipitation, thus producing 50% more discharge to the Arctic Ocean. The WT regimes are also similar between the 2 rivers. Yukon River WT is about 2-3C warmer than the Mackenzie over the open water months. Both rivers have the highest WT in the mid summer and they transport large amount of heat to the ocean system. Yukon River monthly HF is lower by 10-60% than the Mackenzie mainly due to small discharge. Mackenzie River heat transport peaks in July, while the Yukon HF reaches the maximum in June and July. These results provide critical new knowledge of river thermal condition and energy transport to the northern seas. They are useful for large-scale climate/ocean model development and validation, and climate/hydrology change research in the northern regions.",

A technique for the remote sensing of atmospheric WV content using ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS)has become available, which can routinely achieve accuracies for integrated WV content of 1–2 kg/m2. Some experimental work has shown that the accuracy of WV measurements from a moving platform is comparable to that of (static) land-based receivers. Extending this technique into the marine environment on a moving platform would be greatly beneficial for many aspects of meteorological research, such as the calibration of satellite data, investigation of the air–sea interface, as well as forecasting and climatological studies. In this study, kinematic precise point positioning has been developed to investigate WV in the \nArctic \nOcean (70–80°N) and annual variations are obtained for 2008 and 2012 that are identical to those related to the enhanced greenhouse effect.",

Furthermore, in the neighborhood of various\nresonances, the pump wave can undergo parametric instabilities to produce a variety of electrostatic\nand electromagnetic waves. We have used a Vlasov simulation with 1-spatial dimension, 2-velocity\ndimensions, and 2-components of fields, to study the effects of ionospheric heating when the pump\nfrequency is in the vicinity of the upper hybrid resonance, employing parameters\ncurrently available at ionospheric heaters such as HAARP. We have found that by seeding the\nplasma with a FAS of width \u0019 ~20% of the simulation domain, ~10% depletion, and by\napplying a spatially uniform HF dipole pump electric field, the pump wave gives rise to a broad\nspectrum of density fluctuations as well as to upper hybrid and lower hybrid oscillating electric\nfields. We also observe collisionless bulk-heating of the electrons that varies non-linearly with the\namplitude of the pump field.",

            "abstract": "One of the most immediate and obvious impacts of climate change is on the weather-sensitive agriculture sector. Both local and global impacts on production of food will have a negative effect on the ability of humanity to meet its growing food demands. Agriculture has become more risky, particularly for farmers in the most vulnerable and food insecure regions of the world such as East Africa. Smallholders and low-income farmers need better financial tools to reduce the risk to food security while enabling productivity increases to meet the needs of a growing population. This paper will describe a recently funded project that brings together climate science, economics, and remote sensing expertise to focus on providing a scalable and sensor-independent remote sensing based product that can be used in developing regional rainfed agriculture insurance programs around the world. We will focus our efforts in Ethiopia and Kenya in East Africa and in Senegal and Burkina Faso in West Africa, where there are active index insurance pilots that can test the effectiveness of our remote sensing-based approach for use in the agriculture insurance industry. The paper will present the overall program, explain links to the insurance industry, and present comparisons of the four remote sensing datasets used to identify drought: the CHIRPS 30-year rainfall data product, the GIMMS 30-year vegetation data product from AVHRR, the ESA soil moisture ECV-30 year soil moisture data product, and a MODIS Evapotranspiration (ET) 15-year dataset. A summary of next year’s plans for this project will be presented at the close of the presentation.",

            "abstract": "Extreme reductions in Arctic sea ice extent and thickness have become a hallmark of climate change, but impacts to the marine ecosystem are poorly understood. As top predators, marine mammals must adapt to biological responses to physical forcing and thereby become sentinels to ecosystem variability and reorganization. Recent sea ice retreats have influenced the ecology of marine mammals in the Pacific Arctic sector. Walruses now often haul out by the thousands along the NW Alaska coast in late summer, and reports of harbor porpoise, humpback, fin and minke whales in the Chukchi Sea demonstrate that these temperate species routinely occur there. In 2010, satellite tagged bowhead whales from Atlantic and Pacific populations met in the Northwest Passage, an overlap thought precluded by sea ice since the Holocene. To forage effectively, baleen whales must target dense patches of zooplankton and small fishes. In the Pacific Arctic, bowhead and gray whales appear to be responding to enhanced prey availability delivered both by new production and advection pathways. Two programs, the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) and the Synthesis of Arctic Research (SOAR), include tracking of marine mammal and prey species’ responses to ecosystem shifts associated with sea ice loss. Both programs provide an integrated-ecosystem baseline in support of the development of a web-based Marine Mammal Health Map, envisioned as a component of the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). An overarching goal is to identify ecological patterns for marine mammals in the ‘new’ Arctic, as a foundation for integrative research, local response and adaptive management.",

            "abstract": "Understanding electroosmosis in microporous media is important for species separation in electrochromatography, flooding control in fuel cells, contaminants removal in soil and electrokinetic displacement in oil extraction. Because of the complexity of transport and randomness of porous media, investigation of electroosmosis in porous media is mostly based on the assumption that the solid surface is homogeneously charged. However, based on the surface complexation model, the surface charge and zeta potential are much dependent on the local chemical environment of the solution. Therefore, variations of concentration, pH and temperature and so on will lead to a non-homogeneous charge distribution in the porous media. In addition, since the characteristic length of the pore is comparable to the characteristic length of the double layer in the microporous media, overlap of the double layer occurs and this will further regulate the surface charge distribution. In this work, we propose a 3-D lattice Poisson-Boltzmann model for electroosmosis in porous media with non-homogeneous charge for above reasons. We employ a generation-growth method to reproduce the 3-D random microstructures of natural porous media and solve the Navier-Stokes equation and Poisson-Boltzmann equation using lattice Boltzmann method. To determine the surface charge and zeta potential, we adopt the Basic-Stern model to describe the electrical double layer. Electroosmotic permeability is investigated for various cases with non-homogeneous charge and compared to the results with homogeneous charge to determine the validity of the homogeneous charge assumption.",

            "abstract": "Kilbourne Hole (NM, USA) and Dish Hill (CA, USA) mantle xenoliths sample continental mantle in two different tectonic settings. Kilbourne Hole (KH) is located in the Rio Grande rift. Dish Hill (DH) is located in the southern Mojave province, an area potentially affected by subduction of the Farallon plate beneath North America [1]. FTIR analyses were obtained on well characterized pyroxenite, dunite and wehrlite xenoliths, thought to represent crystallized melts at mantle depths. PUM normalized REE patterns of the KH bulk-rocks are slightly LREE enriched and consistent with those of liquids generated by < 5% melting of a spinel peridotite source [2]. Clinopyroxenes contain from 272 to 313 ppm weight H2O similar to the lower limit of KH peridotite clinopyroxenes (250-530 ppm H2O, [3]). This is unexpected as crystallized melts like pyroxenites should concentrate water more than residual mantle-like peridotites, given that H is incompatible. PUM normalized bulk REE of the DH pyroxenites are characterized by flat to LREE depleted REE profiles consistent with > 6% melting of a spinel peridotite source. Pyroxenite pyroxenes have no detectable water but one DH wehrlite, which bulk-rock is LREE enriched, has 4 ppm H2O in orthopyroxene and <1ppm in clinopyroxene. The DH pyroxenites may thus come from a dry mantle source, potentially unaffected by the subduction of the Farallon plate. These water-poor melts either originated from shallow oceanic lithosphere overlaying the Farallon slab [4] or from continental mantle formed > 2 Ga [5]. The Farallon subduction appears to have enriched in water the southwestern United States lithospheric mantle further east than DH, beneath the Colorado plateau [6].

            "abstract": "One of the critical problems for carbon dioxide capture and storage projects is the occurrence of microseismicity due to increased pore pressure during CO2 injection. The mechanism of microseismicity can be explained by the notion that the injection-induced pore pressure increase can potentially alter the reservoir rock in the form of either creating fractures or triggering slip on pre-existing discontinuities by reducing the effective normal stress. Therefore, it is important to estimate the critical pore pressure (Pcr) to prevent excessive seismicity. The purpose of this study is to attempt to simulate the microseismicity induced from increased pore pressure by CO2 injection into Berea sandstone. Cylindrical specimens were saw-cut at 30° from the specimen axis. Specimens were either dry or saturated by tap water. The frictional coefficients of the fractures were determined from triaxial shear tests to be 0.71 (dry) and 0.65 (water-saturated). With the frictional coefficients known, we then injected CO2 (either gaseous of liquid state) into the specimens (either dry or water-saturated) subjected to triaxial stress conditions. Under the conditions of constant confining pressures and axial stresses, we increased pore pressure in steps by injecting CO2 using a syringe pump. We monitored shear slip along the fracture using axial LVDTs and microseismicity using an acoustic emission sensor. The critical pore pressure that would initiate shear slip along the fracture was calculated from the Coulomb friction law. When CO2 was injected into dry specimens, shear slip and associated microseismicity started to occur at the pore pressure levels exactly estimated from the Coulomb theory. However, when CO2 (both gaseous and liquid states) was injected into water-saturated specimens, the same were initiated at pore pressures slightly higher (by 1.2-3.7 MPa) than that estimated from the Coulomb friction law. These results suggest that the presence of water and associated water-CO2-rock interaction might probably strengthen friction of fractures in Berea sandstone, which needs further investigations. Nonetheless, our experimental study demonstrates that the simple Coulomb friction theory can conservatively be utilized to estimate Pcr to prevent microseismicity triggered by shear slip during CO2 injection.",

            "abstract": "Analysis of deformation from actively failing slopes is essential for gaining insight into the rates, mechanisms and controls on failure. Recent models have focussed upon the temporal evolution of failures, the validation of which requires increasingly high-resolution, high-frequency monitoring data. Since its introduction to geomorphological study, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) has become a frequently used means of characterising change to failing slopes. The most computationally efficient approach represents change on a pixel-by-pixel basis using rasterised 2.5D DEMs of Difference; however, the level of detail reduces on steep surfaces and the use of a fixed grid spacing limits the ability to resolve fine-scaled features, both of which may underpin failure mechanisms. A number of algorithms and software packages have been developed to better characterise surface and joint structures using ‘true 3D’ point clouds; however, 3D change detection with a large number of scans remains limited. In addition to developments in geometric change detection, TLS systems now provide radiometric information by digitising the energy-time structure of the reflected laser pulse, sensitive to surface moisture amongst other variables.\nThis study draws upon a unique dataset of > 800 sequential scans captured across a failing rock slope. Our algorithm extracts change between a large number of scans, using a Moving Least Squares adjustment to filter data through time and space. The analysis explores optimal kernel structures for retaining spatial resolution and temporal responsiveness to articulate the nature of change in rock slopes, distinguishing discrete failures (e.g. rockfalls) from ongoing deformation (e.g. creep). The code segments successive clouds into an octree structure of planar surfaces and provides 3D change metrics through time. We use the code to test the ability to separate movement at various scales, with the aim of capturing movements suited for failure-time prediction. In addition, rasterised amplitude data from a coastal cliff is presented as a means of identifying regions of ground water seepage and tide inundation, both of which may predispose a slope to failure. The approach holds implications for analysing 3D data in order to extract geomorphologically intuitive deformation measurements.",

A total of 140 Mars Rover teachers from the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 cohorts were invited to complete the Mars Rover Teacher Evaluation Survey. The survey was administered online and could be taken at the convenience of the participant. So far ~40 teachers have participated with responses still coming in. A total of 675 students from the 2013-2014 cohort were invited to submit brief self-assessments of their participation in the program. Teachers were asked to rate their current level of confidence in their ability to teach specific topics within the Earth and Life Science realms, as well as their confidence in their ability to implement teaching strategies with their students. The majority of teachers (81-90%) felt somewhat to very confident in their ability to effectively teach concepts related to earth and life sciences to their students. In addition, many of the teachers felt that their confidence in teaching these concepts increased somewhat to quite a bit as a result of their participation in the MRC program (54-88%). The most striking increase in this area was the reported 48% of teachers who felt their confidence in teaching “Earth and the solar system and universe” increased “Quite a bit” as a result of their participation in the MRC program.

The spatial variation of hydraulic properties\nin the shallow subsurface has been extensively studied in the past two decades. A\nrecent approach to characterize subsurface properties is hydraulic tomography, in which\npressure data from multiple constant-rate pumping tests is inverted using a numerical\nmodel. Many laboratory sandbox studies have explored the performance of hydraulic\ntomography under different controlled conditions and shown that detailed heterogeneity\ninformation can be extracted (Liu et al., 2002, Illman et al., 2007, 2008, 2010a, 2010b,\nLiu et al., 2007, 2008, Xiang et al., 2009, Yin and Illman, 2009, Liu and Kitanidis, 2011,\nBerg and Illman, 2011a). Recently, Cardiff et al. (2013) proposed a modified approach\nof Oscillatory Hydraulic Tomography (OHT) – in which periodic pumping signals of\ndifferent frequencies are used for aquifer stimulation – to characterize aquifer properties.\nThe potential advantages of OHT over traditional hydraulic tomography include: 1) no\nnet injection or extraction of water; 2) little movement of existing contamination; 3)\nminimal impact of model boundary conditions; and 4) robust extraction of oscillatory\nsignals from noisy data.\nTo evaluate the premise of OHT, we built a highly-instrumented 2-D laboratory\nsandbox and record pressure responses to periodic pumping tests. In our setup, the\nlaboratory sandbox is filled with sand of known hydraulic properties, and we measure\naquifer responses at a variety of testing frequencies. The signals recorded are processed\nusing Fourier-domain analysis, and compared against expected results under linear\n(Darcian) theory. The responses are analyzed using analytical and numerical models,\nwhich provide key insights as to: 1) how “effective” hydraulic properties estimated using\nhomogeneous models are associated with aquifer heterogeneity; and 2) how OHT is able\nto detect and image aquifer heterogeneity.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation patterns in the western US are characterized by a north-south dipole, typically manifesting as wet conditions in the northwest and a dry southwest. This pattern is, in large part, determined by the strength and position of the Pacific subtropical jet, which is responsible for the generation and trajectory of winter storms that provide the majority of annual moisture. Modern climate variability on interannual/decadal timescales results in latitudinal shifts in the boundary between the wet-north/dry-south; strong ENSO activity typically results in drying in the north and increased precipitation in the south. Previous paleoclimate work in the Great Basin has shown coherence in the timing of major climatic shifts in the Holocene, yet past spatial variability of the dipole remains little studied. Here we present new data from a site that lies within the transition zone of the precipitation dipole.\nSwan Lake, located in southeastern Idaho along the northeast edge of the Great Basin, was formed in the spillway channel created by the catastrophic flooding of Lake Bonneville ~14,500 yrs BP. This study seeks to provide insight into the timing and magnitude of late-glacial and Holocene climate variability in the northeastern Great Basin in order to better understand past spatial variability of precipitation patterns. Charcoal, pollen and sedimentological data from a 7.65 m sediment core from Swan Lake are used to reconstruct fire history and vegetation change in the area. Age control is provided by 15 AMS radiocarbon determinations. Results are placed in the context of regional paleoclimate studies. These data build on earlier work by Bright (1966) who reported on pollen, macrofossils and sedimentology from Swan Lake, as well as characterizing the modern vegetation biomes within this area and the climate conditions necessary for their occurrence.\nOur preliminary data suggest dramatic reduction in fire frequency coinciding with results from nearby studies that point to either cold or very wet climate phases. Principal cold/wet phases are: 12.5-6.5 and 4.6-1.0 ka BP.

            "abstract": "The dramatic asymmetry in terms of surface elevation, Cenozoic volcanisms, and earthquake activity across the Red Sea is an enigmatic issue in global tectonics, partially due to the unavailability of broadband seismic data on the African plate adjacent to the Red Sea. Here we report the first results from a receiver function study of the mantle transition zone (MTZ) discontinuities using data from the Egyptian National Seismic Network, and compare the resulting depths of the 410 and 660 km discontinuities (d410 and d660) with those observed on the Arabian side. Results using more than 6000 P-to-S receiver functions recorded at 49 broadband seismic stations in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and adjacent areas show that when the IASP91 Earth model is used for time-to-depth conversion, the resulting depth of the discontinuities increases systematically toward the axis of the Afro-Arabian Dome (AAD) from both the west and east. Relative to the westernmost area, the maximum depression of the 410-km discontinuity is about 30 km, and that of the 660-km discontinuity is about 45 km. Highly correlated d410 and d660 depths suggest that the observed apparent depth variations are mostly caused by lateral velocity anomalies in the upper mantle, while the 15 km additional depression of the d660 relative to the d410 requires either a colder-than-normal MTZ or the presence of water in the MTZ. We tested several models involving upper mantle and MTZ velocity anomalies and undulations of the MTZ discontinuities due to temperature anomalies and water content, and found that the observed systematic variations can best be explained by a model involving a hydrated MTZ and an upper-mantle low-velocity zone beneath the AAD (Mohamed et al., 2014, doi: 10.1093/gji/ggu284). Models invoking one or more mantle plumes originated from the MTZ or the lower-mantle beneath the study area are not consistent with the observations.",

            "abstract": "The summit of Volcan Turrialba (elev. 3340 m) lies less than 50 km upstream in the prevailing easterlies from the Ticosonde balloon launch site at San Jose, Costa Rica, where ECC ozone sondes have been launched regularly since 2005. In 2006 we began to see telltale notches in the ozone profiles in the altitude range between 2 and 6 km. Given the proximity of Turrialba, it seemed likely that SO2 in the volcano's plume was interfering in the chemical reaction in the ECC ozone sonde used to detect ozone. In early 2010, fumarolic activity in the Turrialba crater increased strongly, and the profile notches in our soundings increased in frequency as well, consistent with this hypothesis. In February 2012 we tested a dual ECC sonde system, where an additional sonde is flown on the same payload using a selective SO2 filter. The difference of the measurements in the dual sonde is a direct measure of the amount of SO2 encountered. This first dual sonde passed through the plume, and the data indicated a tropospheric SO2 column of 1.4 DU, comparing favorably with a total column of 1.7 DU in the OMI 3-km linear fit (LF) product at the sonde profile location and at nearly the same time. We are now launching dual sondes on a regular basis with 18 launches in the first 12 months through July 2014; 11 of these have detectable SO2 signals. These soundings have great potential for validation of the Aura OMI and the Suomi-NPP OMPS retrievals of SO2. Here we present the sonde measurements and compare them with two satellite datasets: the Aura OMI Linear Fit (LF) product and the Suomi-NPP OMPS Principal Components Analysis (PCA) boundary layer product. The PCA algorithm reduces retrieval noise and artifacts by more accurately accounting for various interferences in SO2 retrievals such as O3 absorption and rotational Raman scattering. The comparisons with the in situ observations indicate a significant improvement of the PCA algorithm in capturing relatively weak volcanic SO2 signals.",

The present technique for propagating the solar wind from L1 to Earth currently used by NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) assumes that all observed solar wind discontinuities, such as interplanetary shocks and interplanetary coronal mass ejection boundaries, are in a flat plane perpendicular to the Sun-Earth line traveling in the GSE X direction at the solar wind velocity. In reality, these phase plane fronts can have significantly tilted orientations, and by relying on a ballistic propagation method, delay time errors of ±15 minutes are common. The L1 to Earth delay time product presented here is designed to more accurately predict the delay time from L1 to Earth by taking into account these tilted phase plane fronts. This algorithm is based on the work of Weimer and King [2008] and is currently running in real-time in test mode at SWPC as part of the SWPC Testbed. We discuss the current algorithm performance, observed improvements in space weather forecasting, as well as the limitations of this model. Both real-time and historic events will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Ahead of CMEs usually exist the shocked sheaths, in which the background solar corona / solar wind is heated due to the compression of the driving CME. The other regions around the CME, e.g., the side and wake, which may also be influenced by the CME, are the objects of this work. Various instruments including LASCO, AIA, and CoMP observed a CME close to the east limb on October 26th, 2013. The CME core is very hot (~10 MK) (appearing only in the 131 channel of AIA), and ejects away at a high speed (~330 km/s). Magnetic structures (low-lying loops and large loop legs) on both sides and in the wake of the CME are strongly disturbed, showing turbulent signatures with enhanced Doppler-shift oscillations (~±15km/s) and effective thermal velocities (~60 km/s) from the CoMP observations in the Fe XIII line. As recognized from the CoMP Doppler-shift maps, the turbulent vortices behave differently at various heights, illustrating torsional oscillations back and forth around the leg axis at lower altitude and continuous rotation with the same handedness at higher altitude. This difference may be due to the lower part being more likely to be line-tied with the motionless footpoint than the upper part. The turbulence of loop legs is also revealed in the AIA animations in the Fe 171 Å and Fe 193 Å channels with some differences between each other. The turbulence in Fe 171 Å seems to be weaker than that in Fe 193 Å, with the former behaving more wave-like and the latter involving more whirling vortices. The difference in turbulence level might come from the difference in turnover time of the vortices: ~1000s for Fe 171 Å and ~500s for Fe 193 Å. Moreover, in the wake of the CME, the eddies turning over up and down as well as the eddies rotating horizontally are also presented in the Fe 193 Å. The leg-like straps in Fe 171 Å seem to be braided by the turbulent vortices, and disappear afterwards probably due to heating by coherent current sheet formed between braided straps. Meanwhile, low-lying loops are oscillating back and forth during its reaction to the fast compressive waves as driven by the CME. The subsequent brightening of the low-lying loops implies a heating due to the dissipation of compressive waves. This work suggests that the effects at the side and wake of the CME cannot be ignored when considering the heating of the solar corona and solar wind.",

            "abstract": "Northern Chile has been identified as a likely mature seismic gap that spans approximately from Mejillones peninsula to Ilo in southern Peru. The 2014 Mw 8.1 Pisagua earthquake broke the middle segment, and coseismic slip models show that the slipped zone occurred in the intermediate to deeper portion of the megathrust fault interface between the downgoing and overriding plate. The tsunami generated by the Pisagua earthquake caused minor impact along the Chile shore, and, for instance, at the Iquique tide gauge, the leading wave reached an elevation of about 1.8 m and a depression of ~2.5 m. In the present work, we would like to address the tsunami generation, propagation and runup associated to the 2014 Pisagua earthquake. This work aims to understand, from a numerical point of view, why this event did caused a minor tsunami, to test the feasibility to model correctly the sea water level at DART buoys and local tide gauges, and to estimate the sensitivity of the runup amplitudes to earthquake source parameters. We collect published coseismic slips for this earthquake and used a proposed coseismic slip model obtained using seismological data. Assuming an elastic halfspace and the linear superposition principle, the static displacement field from these earthquake slip models was computed using the Okada's formula for a point-source and we use the vertical displacement computed at the seafloor as initial condition to propagate the tsunami. Preliminary results shows that major differences are observed in the near-field. Obtaining the static seafloor deformation we can immediately obtain an estimation of the maximum runup by using a multisloping beach model which allow us to understand how well-conditioned is the zone for a large tsunami. In terms of earthquake source, most of slip models show a single asperity that one can model as an elliptical slip crack. To test the sensitivity of the runup and water elevation to earthquake source parameters, we use a simple earthquake model to describe the coseismic slip associated to the 2014 Pisagua earthquake. By varying the crack location and fault geometry, we are currently estimating the variability of runup distribution and seawater elevation in the near-field.",

            "abstract": "The Papoose Flat pluton in the White-Inyo Range is one of the best examples of forcefully emplacement of magma with room created by softening of its contact aureole. The western part of the aureole, consisting of schists, marbles and quartzites, displays a ductile deformation with strong foliation and lineation. The softening of the aureole under lithostatic fluid pressure conditions and variable H2O activity was modeled using the Fortran program SUTRAMET. The model assumes a geothermal gradient of 30oC km-1 and instantaneous magma intrusion with liquidus of 970oC and solidus of 650oC. The Papoose Flat pluton was emplaced at the depth of 10-15 km.\nAssuming the power-law dependence of rheology, under hydrous conditions consistent with the observed greenschist-facies regional metamorphism, the brittle-ductile transition for quartzite in the crustal section is at the ~13 km depth and for limestone at the ~11 km depth. Under anhydrous condition, the brittle-ductile transition would have been at the ~15 km depth for quartzite and the ~12 km depth for limestone. There is no obvious brittle-ductile transition zone for schist due to its inherent weakness and very small temperature-dependence of strength.\nDuring cooling of magma, the model pluton was completely crystallized by ~233,330 y. Water fugacity plays an important role in the rheology and deformation of the host rocks. A ductile deformation aureole that is produced due to conductive heat flow above the pluton and in the presence of H2O is 1-2 km wide, which is consistent with observations. The limestone produces a wider ductile aureole than the quartzite. At low H2O fugacities the model aureoles are narrower.\nThese calculations suggest that the Papoose Flat and other plutons in the White-Inyo Range were emplaced at the brittle-ductile transition. The relatively hot host rocks at these depths caused slow cooling of the plutons and promoted the development of broad ductile aureoles that permitted growth of plutons. On the other hand, emplacement of magma in the shallower crust within the brittle regime is less likely to produce ductile aureoles due to more rapid cooling. Growth of plutons in this regime may require other means for creating space.",

During early stage of testing EEW systems from 2011 to 2013, we applied a very simple criteria for event alerting with the combination of the numbers of station and magnitude. As a result of the testing we found out that the real-time test result of Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system in Korea showed that most of false alarms with big magnitude over 5.0 were related to the teleseismic events. This teleseismic-relevant false alarm is caused by logical co-relation during association procedure and the corresponding geometric distribution of associated stations is crescent-shaped. Seismic stations are not deployed uniformly, so the expected bias ratio varies with evaluated epicentral location. This ratio is calculated in advance and stored into database, called as TrigDB, for the discrimination of teleseismic-origin false alarm. We tested the change of the geometrical distribution density and directivity of triggered stations in the two ways based on the nearest station or the grid point to the epicenter. Considering together with conventional spatial density of triggered station, TrigDB works as a very efficient filter to quickly reject teleseismic-relevant false alarms except some moderate or big regional distance earthquakes outside of seismic network.",

            "abstract": "Risk assessments of the threat posed by rock avalanches rely upon numerical modelling of potential run-out and spreading, and are contingent upon a thorough understanding of the flow dynamics inferred from deposits left by previous events. Few records exist of multiple rock avalanches with boundary conditions sufficiently consistent to develop a set of more generalised rules for behaviour across events. A unique cluster of 20 large (3 x 106 – 94 x 106 m3) rock avalanche deposits along the Vaigat Strait, West Greenland, offers a unique opportunity to model a large sample of adjacent events sourced from a stretch of coastal mountains of relatively uniform geology and structure.\nOur simulations of these events were performed using VolcFlow, a geophysical mass flow code developed to simulate volcanic debris avalanches. Rheological calibration of the model was performed using a well-constrained event at Paatuut (AD 2000). The best-fit simulation assumes a constant retarding stress with a collisional stress coefficient (T0 = 250 kPa, ξ = 0.01), and simulates run-out to within ±0.3% of that observed. Despite being widely used to simulate rock avalanche propagation, other models, that assume either a Coulomb frictional or a Voellmy rheology, failed to reproduce the observed event characteristics and deposit distribution at Paatuut. We applied this calibration to 19 other events, simulating rock avalanche motion across 3D terrain of varying levels of complexity.\nOur findings illustrate the utility and sensitivity of modelling a single rock avalanche satisfactorily as a function of rheology, alongside the validity of applying the same parameters elsewhere, even within similar boundary conditions. VolcFlow can plausibly account for the observed morphology of a series of deposits emplaced by events of different types, although its performance is sensitive to a range of topographic and geometric factors. These exercises show encouraging results in the model’s ability to simulate a series of events using a single set of parameters obtained by back-analysis of the Paatuut event alone. The results also hold important implications for our process understanding of rock avalanches in confined fjord settings, where correctly modelling material flux at the point of entry into the water is critical in tsunami generation.",

            "abstract": "The subsidence of seafloor is generally considered as a passive phenomenon related to the conductive cooling of the lithosphere since its creation at mid-oceanic ridges. Recent alternative theories suggest that the mantle dynamics plays an important role in the structure and depth of the oceanic lithosphere. However, the link between mantle dynamics and seafloor subsidence has still to be quantitatively assessed. Here we provide a statistic study of the subsidence parameters (subsidence rate and ridge depth) for all the oceans. These parameters are retrieved through the positive outliers method, a classical method used in signal processing. We also model the mantle convection pattern from the S40RTS tomography model. The density anomalies derived from this model are used to compute the instantaneous flow in a global 3D spherical geometry, and the induced dynamic topography.\n The variations of the mid-oceanic ridge depths are well recovered by the modeled dynamic topography. Moreover, the dynamic topography perfectly matches the subsidence trend away from mid-oceanic ridges. The systematic fit of the bathymetry allows the recovery of the subsidence rate, from which we derive the effective thermal conductivity, keff. This parameter ranges between 1 and 7 Wm-1K-1. We show that departures from the keff=3 Wm-1K-1 standard value are systematically related to mantle convection and not to the lithospheric structure. Regions characterized by keff>3 Wm-1K-1 are associated with the uplift of mantle plumes. Regions characterized by keff<3 Wm-1K-1 are related to large scale mantle downwellings such as the Australia-Antarctic Discordance (ADD) or the return flow from the South Pacific Superswell to the East Pacific rise. This demonstrates that the mantle dynamics plays a major role in the shaping of the oceanic seafloor. In particular, the parameters generally considered to quantify the lithosphere structure, such as the thermal conductivity, are not only representative of this structure but also incorporate signals from the mantle convection occurring beneath the lithosphere.\n ",

            "abstract": "Water management frameworks that were designed assuming stationary climate conditions will be increasingly difficult to implement in non-stationary climates, presenting a barrier to climate change adaptation and efficient water management for people and ecosystems. Hydrologic indices, or water year classification systems as they are also called, categorize streamflow by year type, such as wet, dry, or normal, compared to historical averages. Numerical thresholds separate water year types, often set by weighted winter and spring runoff volume for rivers. Year type classification is tied to water resources planning, helping to answer the question of whether there is ‘enough’ water, and water allocations to competing water uses are typically adjusted based on water year type. Hydrologic indices were developed for Utah’s Bear, Weber, and Jordan-Provo rivers using long-term reconstructed streamflow from tree-ring data (~1500 to present). Tree-ring data have considerably more variability than measured streamflow from the 20th Century, indicating droughts and wet periods could be longer, more intense, and of greater magnitude than more recent records suggest. Tree-ring reconstructed streamflow is also a promising surrogate to represent increasing future hydroclimatic variability. The Bear, Weber, and Jordan-Provo rivers make up approximately 95% of the streamflow to the Great Salt Lake and supply water to the Salt Lake City, Ogden, and Logan metropolitan areas. The frequency of water year types changes with increased hydroclimatic variability represented in tree-ring reconstructed streamflow when historical year type thresholds or historical year type distributions are maintained. In turn, this affects allocations to urban, agricultural, and environmental water uses, and highlights potential adaptation strategies for watershed-scale water resources management with increased climate variability from climate change.",

            "abstract": "The large-scale atmospheric variability and its impact on the ocean circulation in the Nordic (Greenland, Norwegian, and Iceland) Seas are analyzed. The winter mean atmospheric circulation over the region is dominated by strong cyclonic winds. Analysis of the ocean surface wind fields over the Nordic Seas estimated from wind measurements by the NASA Quik Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) demonstrates substantial interannual variability of cyclonic wind stress. Large-scale variability in the surface winds impacts ocean circulation through several mechanisms, such as Ekman pumping and Ekman transport resulting in upwelling in the central Greenland Sea, downwelling along the coasts, generation of coastal waves, modification of coastal and open ocean currents, etc. Our particular interest is impact of the large-scale cyclonic winds on the East Greenland Current. It is speculated that besides direct impact through the northerly winds along eastern Greenland coast, cyclonic winds affect the East Greenland Current by modifying the Sverdrup balance. In this presentation, climatology and statistics of the ocean surface wind fields over the Nordic Seas derived from the NASA QuikSCAT and Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform surface wind data (CCMP) are presented. Ocean response to the large-scale atmospheric variability is investigated from numerical experiments with the fully coupled 1/12° resolution HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and CICE sea ice model of the Arctic Ocean. Preliminary analysis of the model data shows that maximum and minimum values of the wind-driven Sverdrup transport correlate with variations in the southward volume flux of the East Greenland Current with a one month lead. Variability of freshwater content and relation between freshwater fluxes in the East Greenland Current and the large-scale winds are furhter analyzed.",

            "abstract": "To enhance numerical forecast guidance and predictability for week 3 & 4, and build up seamless forecast system across all time scales, a series of 35-day extended ensemble forecast experiments with the most recent version of the GEFS are carried out. Three identical configurations of the GEFS with distinct treatment of the SSTs are compared. The first configuration, referred to as the benchmark consists of keeping the default configuration, which damps the initial SST anomaly to climatology. In the second configuration, akin to AMIP runs, the global SST analysis fields are prescribed every 24-hour as the integration of the prediction system progresses. The third configuration uses predicted SST anomalies from the CFSv2, which is a coupled model with a low resolution GFS model as its atmospheric component. One critical aspect sought in the comparison of configurations is to determine the level at which MJO signal is captured and how the signal is propagated through the extratropics via teleconnections (such as mid-, high-latitude blocking). In the benchmark experiments, a strong relationship between the prediction skill of extratropical flow and the MJO signal is found, with high skills during periods of strong MJO signal. This suggests that the atmospheric model adequately responds to forcing in the tropical Pacific. Prediction skills of main variables near the surface tend to decay fast beyond one week but upper level variables have useful skills beyond two weeks. Results of the second and third configuration indicate small changes in the flow of the extratropics but the bias of low-level and surface tropical variables is reduced. This talk will present diagnostics and skill assessments of the comparison.",

            "abstract": "Data on greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange in high Arctic environments is rare but badly needed, as the environment in these places will likely respond early and most rapidly to climate warming. Also, the high Arctic holds carbon stocks in permafrost that is most likely to be made vulnerable to decomposition as ecosystems get warmer.\nIn 2011 we established a long-term GHG flux-monitoring site in the Adventdalen valley on the Svalbard archipelago. The site is characterised by little precipitation (about 200 mm/year), a strong marine influence (summer air temperatures predominantly around 5 degrees Celsius), and a continuous permafrost ground with low-centered ice wedge polygons at the surface. The measurement equipment features an eddy-covariance tower and an automatic chamber system, both set up in accordance with already existing monitoring programs (INTERACT, ICOS and the Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring program). Here, we present the first results of this multi-year campaign, such as the pattern of carbon dioxide and methane fluxes during the growing and shoulder seasons, including the recently discovered autumn burst, as well as carbon dioxide fluxes during wintertime.\nCarbon dioxide fluxes measured with eddy-covariance agree well with the automatic chamber data, and indicate that the site acts as a sink for carbon dioxide. Methane fluxes measured by the automatic chamber system indicate a significant methane source, which is, however, weaker than at comparable sites in Greenland. There is a high degree of inter-annual variation in methane emissions, which seems to be driven by the amount of precipitation in summer. On top of that, there is a strong spatial variability resembling the polygonal ground pattern. This variability is also reflected in the occurrence of the methane autumn burst, which could be detected and is spatially and temporally distributed at a few locations and years.",

            "abstract": "Rapid melting of ice in Iceland results in uplift rates exceeding 25 mm/yr in central Iceland and uplift accelerations of nearly 2 mm/yr2, but the relative contributions of the lithosphere’s elastic and viscoelastic responses to uplift acceleration is currently not well understood. We analyzed data from 62 continuous GPS (CGPS) stations throughout Iceland to investigate the uplift signal and its relationship to ice melting. We find that sites in central and southern Iceland, closest to the major ice caps, which measure the largest velocities and accelerations, also display the largest annual vertical variations. Velocity and acceleration estimates are positively correlated with the amplitude of annual site motion with calculated correlation coefficients of 0.8027 and 0.4664 respectively (r95 = 0.2489, n = 62). Since seasonal snow load on the Icelandic glaciers account for a significant proportion of the annual signal measured by GPS, these observations suggest that variability of snow and ice mass loads result in a similar spatial pattern of crustal motion on both annual and decadal time scales, presumably controlled by the current locations of the ice caps and driven by weather and climate, respectively. Simple admittance analysis indicates that annual differences in ice cap mass balance translate to contemporaneous vertical position differences, with model results within 10 mm of observations. We are also able to reproduce observed velocities and accelerations by calculating the response to unloading over a viscous half-space. Both models, however, require an accelerating ice melt rate. We aim to include variations in the seasonal component of CPGS site motion in Iceland as a way to improve our models. We build upon previous work (Grapenthin et al., 2006) and take into account the changing global climate and a documented lengthening of the Arctic melt season in an attempt to better constrain the elastic contribution to observed uplift.",

The participants of this meeting identified that there was a strong need to coordinate operational efforts for multibeam data acquisition across all vessels of the fleet. To address this need, the University of New Hampshire’s Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping joined with Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in submitting a proposal to NSF to form the Multibeam Advisory Committee (MAC), which was funded in the fall of 2011.\nThe MAC through the last three years has assembled a team of experts who have been called upon to respond to questions about MBES data acquisition and data quality, conduct shipboard assessments of MBES systems, create documentation supporting best practices for multibeam acquisition and data workflow, and to develop tools to support both data acquisition and quality assessment. Tools and techniques developed through the MAC include:\nSVP Editor – a graphical display and editing program for SVP, CTD, XBT, and XSV data. This program integrates directly with multibeam acquisition software to both receive navigation and depth information, used during the processing of the sound velocity data, and also has the ability to send edited and processed cast directly to the sounder.\nMBES Accuracy and Swath Performance Tools - tools which can assess both the accuracy of MBES bathymetric data as compared to a reference surface grid and to examine swath width performance of MBES systems as a function of depth.\nRemote Patch Test Support - the MAC provides patch test site selection, detailed execution plans, and tools to support the transmittal of a downsized raw MBES data files from ships over satellite in order to determine the angular offset values (pitch, heading, and roll) for MBES systems with no MAC personnel on board. \nBuilt In Self Test (BIST) Evaluation Tools – tools which can plot and evaluate BIST data including TX and RX array impedance and noise assessment.\nWhile these tools and techniques were developed specifically to address the needs of collecting high quality MBES data for ships of the US Academic fleet, they can and have been used for other MBES systems outside of the fleet.",

Therefore, simple arithmetic averaging is unsuitable for estimating thermal conductivity and diffusivity of the jadeite-diopside solid-solution system. The thermal property of eclogite was estimated from those of garnet and omphacite. The thermal conductivity of eclogite is much smaller than that of harzburgite, which is assumed to compose of 80% olivine and 20% enstatite, implying that subducted oceanic crust impedes thermal conduction from the hotter wedge mantle to the subducting slab.

Obviously this kind of problem is very interesting from the geopyshical point of view, since the Stokes equations are used to model various geopydynamical processes: like the dynamic of lithosphere and asthenosphere.\nWe present a novel stress-velocity formulation, that can be intepreted as a real mixed formulation for the Stokes problem. Even if this formulation looks technically more challenging with respect to the usual velocity-pressure formulation, it seems to be more suitable for solving problem with highly variable parameters. From the physical point this formulation enforces the continuity of the normal component of stress, on the other hand the velocity-pressure formulation ensures the continuity of velocity, for this reason the can interpret the first as dynamic formulation and the latter as kinematic one.\nDue to the symmetry of the stress tensor also the discretization of this problem is challenging and if this constraint is not handled properly then the problem can be not well-posed or, otherwise, a huge number of degrees of freedom per cell is needed. In order to circumvent this problems the symmetry is enforced only weakly, as proposed by other authors.\nWe show how an incorrect choice of the finite element spaces for the velocity-pressure formulation leads to less accurate results even if the approximate problem is well-posed, on the other hand the finite element formulation of stress-velocity formulation leads to the correct results in a natural way.\nWe present an embarrassingly parallel preconditioning techique which is very robust with respect to parameters variations, in particular for discontinuous parameters. Moreover the problem can be hybridized in order to reduce the number of degrees of freedom: in particular the stress-velocity formulation can be reduced to another saddle-point problem where the unknowns are the velocity, defined only on the elements' boundary, and another auxiliary variable, for which only one degree of freedom per cell is needed regardless of approximation order.",

            "abstract": "A second generation University of Colorado closed-path laser hygrometer (CLH-2) is an airborne in situ instrument that fits in a wing canister on the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream-V aircraft and is designed to measure cloud water content (CWC) over a wide range of altitudes and total water values. We report on the results of recent work to improve the retrieval for total water (and, hence, CWC) from the CLH-2 by more reliably estimating the background laser signal profile and by more precisely fitting the line shape of the water absorption feature at 1368.6 nm. Using three different line profiles to model the absorption feature, including Voigt, Lorentz, and Gaussian, we find the Voigt and Lorentz profiles to produce the more versatile and reproducible results. Intercomparisons in clouds with CWC measured with the NCAR counterflow virtual impactor (CVI) and in clear air to ambient water measured with a Picarro cavity ringdown spectrometer demonstrate good agreement down to 500 ppm and below, with reliable identification of the water vapor absorption line in individual 1-second spectra. This method appears to consistently resolve meaningful water vapor variations of several hundred ppm at absolute values of less than 1000 ppm, which is at least a factor-of-three improvement over previous retrievals for this instrument. Even lower detection thresholds are achievable with additional averaging. After accounting for the enrichment of droplets through the forward facing sub-isokinetic sampling inlet, this represents a minimum resolvable CWC of approximately 0.01 g/kg. With additional minor modifications, including second harmonic detection the instrument should be capable of resolving variations of 10 ppm at low ambient water mixing ratios. This work will help to improve the performance of the CLH-2 in future field campaigns using the Gulfstream V or other suitable aircraft and allows us to refine CWC results from the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry field campaign which took place over the continental United States in the summer of 2012.",

The area is located in the northern part of the Mixteco Terrain characterized by a Paleozoic metamorphic basement and overlain by a sedimentary platform (Guerrero-Morelos Platform). The iron deposits located north of the state, between the cities of Taxco and Iguala have motivated studies in the region.\nThe analyzed region covers a rectangular area of 660 km2 approximately from 440000, 2025000 to 462000, 2055000 UTM. The total field aeromagnetic data was obtained with a Geometrics G-803 proton magnetometer at a flight altitude of 300 m above ground level. For the analysis of the anomalies, the data was further smoothed to construct a 2 km regularly spaced grid.\nThe anomaly map was compared with the surface geology and larger anomalies were correlated with major geologic features. Our main interest was in mapping the subsurface intrusive and plutonic bodies.\nThe total field magnetic anomalies were reduced to the pole by using the double integral Fourier method. The analysis and interpretation of these anomalies allows us to infer the presence of four plutonic bodies of evolved composition that would be associated with metallic mineralized bodies in two new prospective areas.",

            "abstract": "Catchment systems deliver many benefits to society and ecology but also produce a range of undesirable externalities including flooding, diffuse pollution from agriculture, forestry and urban areas and the export of FIOs. These diffuse pressures are coupled with increasing stream temperature pressures on river from projected climate change. These pressures can be reduced through actions at the landscape scale but are often tackled individually. Any intervention may have benefits for other pressures and hence the challenge is to consider all of the different pressures simultaneously to find solutions with high levels of cross-pressure benefits.\nThe general approach taken within this research has been to use simple but spatially distributed models to predict the pattern of each of the pressures at the landscape scale. These models follow a minimum information requirement approach along the lines of the SCIMAP modelling approach (www.scimap.org.uk). This approach aims to capture the key features of the processes in relative rather than an absolute sense and hence is good at determining key locations to act within a landscape for maximum benefit. The core of the approach is to define the critical sources areas for each pressure based on the analysis of the pattern of the pressure in the landscape and the connectivity from the sources areas to the rivers and lakes.\nTo identify the optimal locations with the landscape for mitigation actions, the benefit of a mitigation action at each location in the landscape needs to be considered. However, as one action has been made, it may change the suitability of other locations in the landscape. For example, as tree cover reduces the temperature in one river reach, the impacts of this cooling are transported downstream with the flow. Therefore, actions need to be considered in sets across multiple sites and objectives to identify the optimal actions set.\nThese modelling results are integrated into a decision support tool which allows the user to explore the implications of considering an individual pressure as opposed to the set of pressures. This is achieved by allowing the user to change the importance of different pressures to identify the optimal locations for a custom combination of pressures. For example, reductions in flood risk can be prioritized over reductions in fine sediment.",

            "abstract": "Assessing the sensitivity of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a major challenge for paleoclimatology, because its strength and structure is a crucial element of the global heat- and carbon distribution towards the deep ocean. Here the focus is set on how excessive freshwater input through abrupt melting of continental ice sheets can affect its overturning vigour. Such forcing can be tested by investigating its behaviour during extreme iceberg discharge events into the open North Atlantic during the last glacial period, so called Heinrich-Events [Heinrich 1988; Hemming 2004].\nThe sedimentary activity ratio 231Pa/230Th has been increasingly used as a kinematic circulation proxy in the Atlantic Ocean over the past decade [Gherardi et al. 2009; McManus et al. 2004; Lippold et al. 2012]. Here we present 231Pa/230Th ratios from several Atlantic sediment cores across Heinrich Events 1 (~17 ka BP) and 2 (~24 ka BP). The comparison of the profiles demonstrates the potential pitfalls when interpreating a single 231Pa/230Th profile. E. g. core IODP 1313 (Mid Atlantic Ridge, 3412 m water depth) shows 231Pa/230Th between 0.04 and 0.06, which would indicate a vigorous circulation over the entire time period. On the other hand core GeoB 16202-2 (Brasilan coastal area, 2248 m water depth) has a profile similar to the well known data set of [McManus et al. 2004] (i.e. during Heinrich Stadials values close to the production ratio of ~0.093, lower values at Holocene and LGM).\nSuch divergency can be explained by 231Pa/230Th dependence on water depth, latitude, water mass and water mass age [Luo et al. 2010; Lippold et al. 2011], but also on changes in bioproductivity especially the flux of biogenic opal [Anderson et al. 1983A; Bradtmiller et al. 2007; Chase et al. 2002]. To avoid misleading interpretations, the here shown data set is accompanied by measurements of biogenic opal contents to appraise possible influences on the proxies. We observe large variations of opal contents - up to 10% at location IODP 1314 (close to Iceland, 2899 m water depth) in contrast to GeoB 16202-2 with an average of about 1-2% - and with a few data points showing correlation with 231Pa/230Th.\nWith an inverse model approach [Luo et al. 2010] strength of the AMOC before, during and after the Heinrich-Stadials 1 & 2 will be derived from this database.",

            "abstract": "Bedrock landsliding is thought to be one of the dominant hillslope erosion process in active mountain belts and is fundamentally stochastic. Owing to the heavy-tailed distribution of landslide volume, rare but very large landsliding events contribute significantly to long-term hillslope erosion and are major disturbances to drainage network: they can inhibit river incision for a long time by supplying large volumes of debris (e.g., following a large earthquake or major storm) or even dam rivers resulting in long-term storage of coarse material and catastrophic release. Bedrock landsliding is also the dominant mechanisms by which divides migrate. River incision on the other end is expected to play a key role in driving hillslope instability over long timescales. The dynamics of this interplay and its role in the long-term evolution of mountain topography remain largely unknown. Landscape Evolution Models resolving correctly the interaction between bedrock landsliding and river incision are needed to progress on this topic.\nSurprisingly, only one algorithm of bedrock landsliding has been proposed for Landscape Evolution Models (LEMs). It reproduces the stochastic nature of landsliding, but has limited success in capturing the pdf of landslide area and has only a rudimentary runout algorithm. Here, we introduce a new reduced complexity bedrock landsliding algorithm (SLIDOS) that has been implemented in the stochastic 2D LEM €ROS. It is based on the probabilistic identification of unstable nodes according to local instability drivers (topographic slope, runoff, peak ground acceleration) and rock mass characteristics (cohesion, friction angle). From each of these nodes, a rupture plane is propagated upslope recursively. The landslide material above the rupture plane is then routed downslope on the topography by a particle method governed by a single tunable parameter.\nWe calibrate the 3 parameters of this algorithm and show that it can quantitatively reproduce (i) the pdf of source area, (ii) the volume-area scaling and (iii) the apparent decrease in runout friction coefficient with landslide volume observed in nature. We then illustrate the key differences between full-stochastic (floods+landslides) and non-stochastic simulations of landscape response to tectonic perturbations.",

It is located in the Tarim Basin (average elevation: 1.1 km) in northwest China and surrounded by high mountains and plateaus (average elevation over 4.5 km). The Taklimakan Desert is a particularly interesting area not only because a large amount of dust particles is emitted into the atmosphere from this region every year, but also due to the very unique orography and the prevailing wind direction in lower troposphere, dust particles can be lofted above 5 km into upper troposphere. In this study, we found that dust particles from the Taklimakan Desert can be vertically transported to Tibetan Plateau (TP) during spring and summer seasons while suspend within boundary layer in autumn and winter by using multi-year Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations. We investigated the relationship between dust aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface wind speeds by using multi-angle imaging spectro radiometer (MISR) observations and ERA-Interim data, and further modified the EROD map in the default Weather Research and Forecasting model with chemistry (WRF-Chem) according this relationship in order to ensure realistic simulations of dust emissions.

With a spectral range from 750-2000 Å and spatial resolution of 30 m by 150 m at the comet from a spacecraft distance of 30 km, Alice will map the surface of C-G obtaining the first far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectral data set of a spatially resolved comet nucleus, studying the chemical heterogeneity of the nucleus, and determining albedo and color variation between the two lobes. Following successful instrument re-commissioning in March 2014, Alice began studying the surface at the end of July as Rosetta approached its target and determined, as expected from the UV behavior of many refractory materials, that C-G has a low FUV albedo. Subsequent observations made during the pre-landing and landing phases of the mission will be presented and discussed in the context of contemporaneous in situ and other remote sensing measurements, including FUV spectra of C-G highlighting spectral features of the landing site region.",

Specifically the ability of each sensor to detect, classify, and quantify instantaneous surface precipitation at its native pixel resolution is examined and linked to surface and precipitation characteristics. Surface characteristics were derived optically using NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Precipitation mesoscale characteristics such as convective-stratiform classification and spatial structure were obtained from the high-resolution reference data.\nThe quality of both PMW sensors’ retrievals varied considerably with surface characteristics; both sensors displayed decreased detection and quantification statistics over sparsely vegetated and dry surfaces. Similarly, the quality of the precipitation retrievals was affected by precipitation characteristics and high relative errors were evident in isolated and small-scale precipitation events as well as in mixed stratiform-convective events. The error characteristics of the two sensors also differed in several significant aspects, namely TMI tended to overestimate precipitation relative to the reference, while GMI underestimated precipitation. The influence of the precipitation and surface characteristics was less evident in the more sophisticated GMI retrievals. An additional outcome of the study was the adaptation of the comparison framework between space and ground precipitation estimates to accommodate the new probabilistic features of the GPM-era PMW precipitation retrievals.",

We use benthic and planktic foram assemblages, IP25 sea ice biomarker, ice-rafted detritus (IRD), lithofacies and quantitative mineralogy to reconstruct paleoceanographic conditions. HU2008029-12PC comprises bioturbated, thin turbidites and hemipelagic sediments with Greenlandic provenance from >19.2 to 16.7 cal ka BP. Abundance spikes of planktic forams provide the radiocarbon dates in this interval and coincide with abundance spikes of benthic foram species indicative of chilled Atlantic Water and episodic marine productivity. IRD and IP25 are rare in this interval. These characteristics are consistent with the ice margin at the shelf edge meeting a heavily sea-ice covered ocean with chilled Atlantic Water at depth, rather than an ice shelf-covered ocean. Initial deglaciation from the West Greenland margin began c. 16.7 ka BP, as recorded by a lithofacies shift from turbidites to bioturbated mud with dispersed IRD and continued presence of Atlantic Water benthic species. After 16.7 ka BP, IP25, large diatoms and benthic forams indicative of sea-ice edge productivity show warming conditions. By 15.2 ka BP Greenlandic IRD and meltwater species, Elphidium excavatum, reflect accelerated ice sheet ablation. By 14.4 ka BP a strong rise in IP25 content, introduction of key Atlantic Water species Cassidulina neoteretis, and IRD spikes rich in detrital carbonate with a northern Baffin Bay provenance provide evidence for increased advection of West Greenland Current, collapse of the LIS ice streams, and formation of an IRD belt along the W.

            "abstract": "Most of the historical eruptive activity in Tenerife has been relatively mafic and mildly-explosive monogenetic eruptions, and thus it seems that this activity is the most likely in the near future. Here we investigate the processes and time scales that lead to such eruptions with the aim to better interpret and plan for any possible unrest in the island. We focus on three historical eruptions: Siete Fuentes (December 31 1704-January 1705), Fasnia (January 5-January 13 1705) and Arafo (February 2-February 26 1705) issued from a 10 km long basaltic fissure eruption oriented N45E and covering an area of 10.4 km2. The erupted volume increases by 5-fold from the first to the last eruption. All magmas are tephritic, although the bulk-rock becomes more mafic with time due to accumulation of olivine with Cr-spinel inclusions, and clinopyroxene rather than to the appearance of a truly more primitive melt. Olivine core compositions of the three eruptions range between Fo79 and Fo87. Frequency histograms show three main populations: at Fo79-80, Fo80-82 and Fo84-87 displaying normal and reverse zoning. Thermodynamic calculations show that only cores with Fo80-82 are in equilibrium with the whole rock. Clinopyroxene phenocrysts can have large pools of matrix glass and show rims of different composition. Only the rims, with Mg#84-86, are in equilibrium with the whole-rock. Considering olivine cores and clinopyroxene rims in equilibrium we obtained a temperature range of 1150-1165°C, and MELTS calculations suggest pressures of 1 to 5 kbar. The variety of olivine core populations reflects mixing and mingling between three different magmas, and their proportions have changed with time from Siete Fuentes to Arafo. Most crystals have complex zoning profiles that record two events: (1) one of magma mixing/mingling at depth, (2) another of magma transport and ascent to the surface. Magma mixing at depth ranges from about 3 months to two years and is similar for the three eruptions. Magma transport times vary between about one week and one month, with somewhat longer times in the last eruption. The longer magma mixing times might be related to precursory seismicity of a few months as it occurred in the recent eruption of El Hierro in 2011. The shorter transport times of a week to a month might be more relevant for emergency plans in Tenerife Island.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection at the Earth’s magnetopause facilitates the transfer of mass, energy, and momentum from the solar wind into the Earth’s magnetosphere. Owing to the variability of the solar wind plasma and magnetic field, the reconnection process typically involves different conditions on both inflow sides, but occasionally more symmetric conditions are encountered as well. Based on prior research we now know that the structure of the reconnection diffusion region depends substantially on the symmetry (or lack thereof) of the inflowing plasmas and magnetic fields. It is therefore of considerable interest to investigate the transition of one scenario to the other - in particular for the purpose of understanding the role of plasma mixing, heating, and of features such as pressure nongyrotropies. This presentation will involve recent theory and modeling results pertaining to these topics, and it will illuminate the means by which these kinetic processes play a role in determining the reconnection rate. Specific emphasis will be on the structure of the reconnection region, when both inflow regions are asymmetric and reconnection occurs at shear angles other than 180 degrees.",

            "abstract": "Mid-latitude precipitation over land exhibits a high degree of variability due to the complex interaction of governing atmospheric processes with coastlines, the heterogeneous land surface, and orography. General circulation models (GCMs) have traditionally shown limited ability in capturing variability in the mesoscale range (here ~50–500 km), due to their low resolution. Recent advances in resolution have provided ensembles of multidecadal climate simulations with GCMs using ~25 km grid spacing. Here, we assess this class of GCM simulations, from the UPSCALE (UK on PrACE - weather-resolving Simulations of Climate for globAL Environmental risk) campaign.\nIncreased model resolution also poses new challenges to the observational datasets used to evaluate models. Global gridded data products (e.g. from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project, GPCP) are invaluable for assessing large-scale precipitation features, but may not sufficiently resolve mesoscale structures. In the absence of alternative estimates, the intercomparison of specialised, regional observational datasets may be the only way to gain insight into the uncertainties associated with these observations. We focus on three mid-latitude continental regions where gridded precipitation observations based on higher-density gauge networks are available, complementing the global data sets: Europe (with a particular emphasis on the Alps), South and East Asia, and the continental US.\nAdditional motivation, and opportunity, arises from continuing efforts to quantify the components of the global radiation budget and water cycle. Recent estimates based on radiation measurements suggest that the global mean precipitation/evaporation may be up to 10 Wm-2 (about 0.35 mm day-1) larger than the estimate obtained from GPCP. While the main part of this discrepancy is thought to be due to the underestimation of remotely-sensed ocean precipitation, there is also considerable uncertainty about ‘unobserved’ precipitation over land, in particular in the form of snow in regions of high latitude/altitude.\nCombining the strength of these different observations, we present case studies of how area-averaged mountain precipitation is represented in different observational datasets and by a GCM at different resolutions.",

            "abstract": "AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork), which is a network of ground-based sun photometers, includes also so-called Aerosol Spectral Deconvolution Algorithm (SDA) that utilizes spectral total extinction AOD data to infer the component fine and coarse mode optical depths at 500nm. Based on its assumptions, SDA identifies cloud optical depth as the coarse mode AOD component and therefore effectively computes the fine mode AOD also in mixed cloud-aerosol observations. Therefore, it can be argued that the more representative AOD for fine mode fraction should be based on all direct sun measurements and not only on those cloud-screened for clear-sky conditions, in other words on those from Level 1 (L1) instead of Level 2 (L2). The objective of our study was to assess, including all the available AERONET sites, the magnitude of this cloud enhancement in fine mode AOD, in other words contrasting SDA L1 and L2 in our analysis. Assuming that the cloud-screening correctly separates the cloudy and clear-sky conditions, then the increases in fine mode AOD in can be due to various cloud-related processes, mainly by in-cloud processing and hygroscopic growth. We estimated these cloud-related enhancements in fine mode AOD seasonally and found, for instance, than in June-July season the average over all the AERONET sites was 0.034, when total fine mode AOD from L2 data was 0.192, therefore the relative enhancement was 18%. It is difficult to separate the fine mode AOD enhancements due to in-cloud processing and hygroscopic growth, but we attempted to get some understanding by conducting a similar analysis for SDA-based fine mode Angstrom Exponent patterns. Moreover, we included OMI NO2 and Glyoxal data, to infer whether the regional patterns of fine mode AOD enhancements contain similar features than these two data products that could serve as a proxy of the strength of in-cloud processing.",

            "abstract": "Terra Meridiani displays remanent crustal magnetization, roughly symmetric and coherent over long distances, that has been interpreted by some workers as resulting from seafloor spreading. A detailed magnetization map of this region, located at 0º, 0º ±20º, will be compared with that of Terra Cimmeria (-40º, 180º) which hosts Mars' most intense and continuous magnetization. Mars Global Surveyor magnetometer (MGS MAG) data from mapping altitude (~400km) was downward continued to the surface. Data from the MGS aerobraking phase contains tracks in Terra Meridiani at altitudes between 110-190 km, revealing localized persistent Br signatures between -268 and 278 nT, with standard deviations of 24 and 17 nT, respectively. These signatures coincide with areas of strongest magnetization on the downward continued map at corresponding altitudes. However, several uncorrelated small-scale pockets of magnetization that appear in the aerobraking dataset may be attributed to shorter wavelength signals or noise. Positive and negative sources in Terra Meridiani show comparable decay with altitude. Similarly, sources in Terra Cimmeria resemble this decay. By extrapolating into the subsurface, we estimate the source depths for both regions and observe that Terra Meridiani has shallower sources than Terra Cimmeria. The strongest magnetization in Terra Meridiani lies along the 4,600 km diameter outer ring of the Chryse basin. A similar association occurs in Terra Cimmeria along the outer rings of the Sirenum basin. The decay of magnetization intensity with altitude, crustal composition, and crustal thickness estimates will be used to create simple models of magnetic sources for Terra Meridiani.",

            "abstract": "The interactions of water with microscopic defects in porous rock continues to be a long standing challenge in the studying of corresponding emitted acoustic signals. Although different physical aspects of these microscopic events, driven or influenced by water, have been extensively discussed in atomic scale calculations, they have yet to be matched by calibrations or testing on laboratory scale experimentation. For the first time we present new data and analysis of the emitted signals generated during dynamic rock deformation experiments on samples with a well characterised defects. We find that the onset of secondary instability – known as hybrid events –occurs in during a fast healing phase of micro cracking. This leads to a localised and rapid increase of pore water pressure in the damage/process zone, inducing a secondary instability, which is then followed by a fast-locking regime of the microscopic faults (i.e., pulse-like rupture). Furthermore, we show that wet-crackling noise could reveal symmetric to right-handed asymmetry signatures; a distinguished feature from dry-micro defects. Our findings elucidate of the role of water in enhancing the ability of fracture and rupture formation by weakening atomic bonds prior to the main weakening regime, and consequently how ruptures then spread throughout the micro-fault before the fast detachment front (i.e., main fast-slip regime).",

            "abstract": "From the late Paleocene to the early Eocene, Earth’s surface temperatures generally rose, resulting in an increase of at least 5°C in the deep ocean and culminating in the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO). This long-term warming was punctuated by a series of short-lived global warming events known as “hyperthermals”, of which the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) represents the most extreme example. At least two other short-term episodes have been identified as hyperthermals: the ETM2 (or Elmo event) at about 53.7 Myr and the ETM3 (or X-event) at about 52.5 Myr. These transient events are marked by prominent carbon isotope excursions (CIEs), recorded in marine and continental sedimentary sequences and driven by fast and massive injections of 13C-depleted carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system. Recently, evidence has indicated the presence of a regular series of hyperthermal events following the peak in temperatures of the EECO. However, continuous records are needed to investigate short- and long- term changes in the climate system throughout the Early Eocene warming trend. Here, we present new high-resolution benthic stable isotope records of the Early Eocene from ODP Site 1263, (Walvis Ridge, SE Atlantic). The carbon and oxygen records document changes in deep-sea temperature and global carbon cycle encompassing the Early Eocene hyperthermal events and the EECO interval. The transition phase to the post-EECO events is distinct by the decoupling of carbon and oxygen isotopes on the long-term scale. Spectral and wavelet analyses suggest the influence of orbital forcing, specifically long and short eccentricity cycles.",

The aeromagnetic data collected by the Naval Research Lab [Brozena et al., 2003] in the Eurasian Basin and Canadian data from the Labrador Sea have been re-evaluated using new gridding algorithms and profile modeling using ModMag (Mendel et al., 2005). As a consequence, we have changed the published correlations, mostly prior to Chron C6 [19.05 Ma]. Presently published seafloor magnetic anomalies from the Labrador Sea assume that seafloor spreading ceased at C13 [33.06 Ma] but such an assumption produces an unacceptable overlap of Kronprins Christian Land of northeast Greenland with Svalbard, up to 140 km of overlap in some models. Our new model does not need any “unacceptable” overlap but does produce a slight amount of Eocene compression on Svalbard as is found on land there. Our model allows for an Early Eocene seaway between Ellesmere Island and northwest Greenland that may have connected the Labrador Sea through Baffin Bay and ultimately to the nascent Eurasian Basin, although its depth or even its essential existence is unknowable. During the Miocene, there is no room for a deepwater seaway in Fram Strait until at least the very end of the Early Miocene and perhaps not until Middle Miocene.\nBrozena, J. and six others, 2003.

            "abstract": "In Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces, the identification of an ancient, low-relief landscape has provided an important datum for measuring surface uplift and inferring geodynamic process. It has been argued that a regionally significant landscape surface was formed by river planation and deposition at low elevation. Thereafter, this surface was progressively uplifted and incised as the Tibetan Plateau grew during Neogene time. However, recent geomorphic analysis and stable isotope paleoaltimetry have indicated a more complex history of surface uplift. We present new Be-10 drainage-average erosion rates and normalized river steepness (Ks) calculations from both on and off the mapped remnants of the paleolandscape in order to understand its evolution. We sampled river sands for Be-10 from 16 tributaries of the Red, Mekong and Yantze Rivers in clusters that span Yunnan and western-most Sichuan between 22.5° N and 28.5° N. Each cluster typically includes samples from 2 small (~25 km2) tributaries and 1 larger (~1000 km2) tributary that encompass both smaller ones. We also calculated Ks values for these tributaries and others in the region, covering ~140,000 km2 in total. At the provincial scale, Be-10 erosion rates appear uniform, with an average value of 104 mm/kyr and a standard deviation of 36 mm/yr. There is no trend with latitude. At a finer scale, within each sample cluster, erosion rates are typically lower on the paleolandscape than off (mean rate on: 83 ± 12 mm/kyr (1 s.d.); mean rate off: 138 ± 19 mm/kyr (1 s.d.)). Ks values are also consistently lower on the mapped paleolandscape than off (mean on: 81 ± 26 (1 s.d.); mean off: 174 ± 98 (1 s.d.)). Unlike erosion rates, Ks values increase northward, with a pronounced jump near the Yalong-Yulong fault. Our results support the mapped paleolandscape as locally important. However, the erosion rates on the paleolandscape are likely too fast to preserve such a landscape over tens of millions of years. (Low-temperature thermochronology could confirm this.) We tentatively suggest that the fragments of “paleolandscape”, south of the Yalong-Yulong Fault, are independent features, constantly being created by river capture and destroyed by erosion.",

            "abstract": "Two-stage ditches are a novel approach to managing agricultural drainage and are designed with floodplain benches set within the banks of a standard, trapezoidal channel. The floodplain bench serves to attenuate pollutant loads in surface waters through (1) capture of sediments, (2) nutrient assimilation by vegetation, and (3) transformation of C and residual N and P by indigenous microorganisms. Two-stage channels have been constructed in the tri-state region of Ohio-Michigan-Indiana over the last decade with initial results indicating C and P sequestration and enhanced N removal via denitrification. However, the sustainability and the net ecosystem services provided by these designs are relatively unknown beyond this timeframe. To better characterize the properties of two-stage ditches aged more than a decade, we examined the physical and chemical properties of sediments in unplanned, self-formed floodplain benches across 5 distinct Midwest ecoregions. Established benches were selected from 3 locations within each ecoregion and sampled along depth and bench-positional gradients from geo-referenced sites. The sediment-bound C, N, and P concentrations were quantified along with soil texture and channel geomorphology. Nutrient concentrations did not differ across bench position (upstream, downstream, near bank, or near channel); however, significant differences were observed between ecoregions. Steeper slopes and higher benches were associated with higher sand content than surrounding soils and promoted greater storage of C and N. Gradual slopes, on the other hand, were associated with higher clay and silt content. Across these specific ecoregions, P storage declined with increasing depth. However, this was unexplained by the particle size distribution at these depths. Further research is therefore needed to investigate whether P is released from waterlogged sediments or there is biological redistribution of this nutrient across the column depth.",

            "abstract": "Flow patterns observed at-a-station are the dynamical byproduct of a cascade of processes involving different compartments of the hydro-climatic network (e.g., climate, rainfall, soil, vegetation) that regulates the transformation of rainfall into streamflows. In complex branching rivers, flow regimes result from the heterogeneous arrangement around the stream network of multiple hydrologic cascades that simultaneously occur within distinct contributing areas. As such, flow regimes are seen as the integrated output of a complex “network of networks”, which can be properly characterized by its degree of temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity.\nHydrologic networks that generate river flow regimes are dynamic in nature. In pristine rivers, the time-variance naturally emerges at multiple timescales from climate variability (namely, seasonality and inter-annual fluctuations), implying that the magnitude (and the features) of the water flow between two nodes may be highly variable across different seasons and years. Conversely, the spatial distribution of river flow regimes within pristine rivers involves scale-dependent transport features, as well as regional climatic and soil use gradients, which in small and meso-scale catchments (A < 103 km2) are usually mild enough to guarantee quite uniform flow regimes and high spatial correlations. Human-impacted rivers, instead, constitute hybrid networks where observed spatio-temporal patterns are dominated by anthropogenic shifts, such as landscape alterations and river regulation. In regulated rivers, the magnitude and the features of water flows from node to node may change significantly through time due to damming and withdrawals. However, regulation may impact river regimes in a spatially heterogeneous manner (e.g. in localized river reaches), with a significant decrease of spatial correlations and network connectivity. Provided that the spatial and temporal dynamics of flow regimes in complex rivers may strongly impact important biotic processes involved in the river food web (e.g. biofilm and riparian vegetation dynamics), the study of rivers as dynamic networks provides important clues to water management strategies and freshwater ecosystem studies.",

            "abstract": "In this study, primary productivities of phytoplankton in the areas of Liaodong Bay and Liaohe River Delta, China were investigated with chlorophyll contents and components, nutrient dynamics and all related environment parameters in July, 2013. Water samples collected from 14 typical sites were incubated under in situ or simulated in situ conditions by the 14C tracer method. Surface chl-a concentration in the coastal zone of Liaodong Bay ranged from 2.16 to 19.85 mg·m-3, and the corresponding primary productivity of particulate organic carbon (POC) ranged from 26.82 to 204.91 mg·m-3·h-1. Although both our chl-a and primary productivity measurements reveal significant spatial variability across the Liaodong Bay, the release rates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from phytoplankton cells into seawater accounts for 4.94±1.44% of the primary productivity of total organic carbon (TOC). Furthermore, the mean and standard deviation of photosynthetic assimilation numbers were 11.65±2.33 (range = 8.78 to 14.63; n=6) with specific maxima in two sites where transparency was better than others, comparatively. In the Liaohe River Delta, it is observed that chl-a concentration and the primary productivity of POC declined from 11.20 mg·m-3 and 89.03 mg·m-3·h-1 to be 1.54 mg·m-3 and 13.22 mg·m-3·h-1, separately, corresponding to the increasing of salinity from 1.0 to be 6.7 in the area dominated by the salinity gradient. The maxima primary productivity of TOC in the river (99.74 mg·m-3·h-1) was about ten times higher than the minima primary productivity (9.73 mg·m-3·h-1) in the coastal area of Liaodong Bay, probably because of the significant variation of nutrient dynamics, suspended particulate matter and transparency along the river discharge. The percentage of DOC release from phytoplankton cell in the river delta area was approximately 13.71±3.62%, much higher than that in the coastal area of Liaodong Bay. The possible effect of phytoplankton community on the chl-a distribution and the spatial variation of primary productivity will be studied; meanwhile, the ability of carbon uptake and storage of phytoplankton in the process of photosynthesis and its long-term effect on the global warming and climate change will be discussed as well.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric processes such as convection and boundary layer turbulence are modeled differently at the large and small scales. Convection, for example, is often represented with mass flux parameterizations in mesoscale or general circulation models (GCMs), but is resolved in cloud-resolving models (CRMs) or large-eddy simulations (LES). As resolution for these models improves, previously parameterized processes become partially resolved on the grid. At these grid spacings, neither the parameterization nor the LES closure is appropriate. In light of the modeling difficulties, the model “gray zone” is named to describe the region where the grid resolution is similar to the dominant length scale of an atmospheric process. \nOne of the difficulties of gray zone modeling is flow instabilities. We examine thermal and shear instability mechanisms in their respective model gray zone. The former represents daytime boundary layer convection, and the latter is typical for triggering nighttime turbulent events. The nature of both marginal instability states suggests that in the gray zone, the onset of vigorous turbulent mixing as well as the most unstable modes are grid-dependent. While first order mean profiles of LES, mesoscale, and gray zone simulations converge, higher order statistics such as variance and skewness from the gray zone simulations may diverge from physically realistic values. Linear instability theories are used to explain the observed unphysical behavior of gray zone results. Such dynamical difficulties must be considered when building scale-aware parameterizations for high-resolution mesoscale or GCMs, or subgrid-scale closures for coarse resolution CRMs or LES.",

A new model of the IL is suggested and tested. The model performs better than previous first-order models of the entrainment and provides physical insights into the main controls of the mixed-layer and IL growths. A consistent prognostic equation of the IL growth is derived, with explicit dependence on the position of the minimum buoyancy flux, convective Richardson number and relative stratification across the inversion G. The IL model expresses the interrelationship between the position and magnitude of the minimum buoyancy flux and inversion layer depth. These relationships emphasize why zero-order–jump models of the convective boundary layer perform well under a strong inversion and show that these models miss the additional parameter, G, to fully characterize the entrainment process under a weak inversion. Additionally, the position of the minimum buoyancy flux within the new IL model is shown to be a key component of convective boundary layer entrainment. The new IL model is sufficiently simple to be used in numerical weather prediction or general circulation models as a way to resolve the IL in a low vertical resolution model.",

            "abstract": "Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to study and predict the outcome of global changes on species. In human dominated ecosystems the presence of a given species is the result of both its ecological suitability and human footprint on nature such as land use choices. Land use choices may thus be responsible for a selection bias in the presence/absence data used in SDM calibration. We present a structural modelling approach (i.e. based on structural equation modelling) that accounts for this selection bias. The new structural species distribution model (SSDM) estimates simultaneously land use choices and species responses to bioclimatic variables. A land use equation based on an econometric model of landowner choices was joined to an equation of species response to bioclimatic variables. SSDM allows the residuals of both equations to be dependent, taking into account the possibility of shared omitted variables and measurement errors. We provide a general description of the statistical theory and a set of applications on forest trees over France using databases of climate and forest inventory at different spatial resolution (from 2km to 8km). We also compared the outputs of the SSDM with outputs of a classical SDM (i.e. Biomod ensemble modelling) in terms of bioclimatic response curves and potential distributions under current climate and climate change scenarios. The shapes of the bioclimatic response curves and the modelled species distribution maps differed markedly between SSDM and classical SDMs, with contrasted patterns according to species and spatial resolutions. The magnitude and directions of these differences were dependent on the correlations between the errors from both equations and were highest for higher spatial resolutions. A first conclusion is that the use of classical SDMs can potentially lead to strong miss-estimation of the actual and future probability of presence modelled. Beyond this selection bias, the SSDM we propose represents a crucial step to account for economic constraints on tree species distributions that will help to assess the trade-offs and opportunities arising from global changes and refine adaptive management strategies.",

Recently, a large amount of CO2 concentration data are becoming available from high-frequency aircraft measurements (e.g., CONTRAIL) and satellite measurements (e.g., GOSAT and OCO-2), in addition to expansion of surface measurement networks. To exploit those observational data, a new inversion system has been developed with the four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) method. The system is based on Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model-based Transport Model (NICAM-TM), which consists of forward and adjoint transport modes. For the a priori fluxes at terrestrial biospheres and oceans, CO2 flux data from Vegetation Integrative SImulator for Trace Gases (VISIT) and the diagnostic model of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) are respectively used. In the iterative calculation, the quasi-Newton method of Preconditioned Optimizing Utility for Large-dimensional analyses (POpULar) is used. In this study, we present the structure of the newly developed system and performances for CO2 flux estimates in ideal twin experiments. By the twin experiments, sensitivities to prior error covariance, numerical algorithms, and observational networks are investigated.\nAcknowledgment: This study is supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2-1401) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.",

Their existence demonstrates prima facie that some planetesimals only experienced partial rather than complete melting. We present the first paleomagnetic measurements of acapulcoite-lodranite meteorites to determine the existence and intensity of ancient magnetic fields on their parent body. Our paleomagnetic study tests the hypothesis that their parent body had an advecting metallic core, with the goal of providing one of the first geophysical constraints on its large-scale structure and the extent of interior differentiation. In particular, by analyzing samples whose petrologic textures require an origin on a partially differentiated body, we will be able to critically test a recent proposal that some achondrites and chondrite groups could have originated on a single body (Weiss and Elkins-Tanton 2013).\nWe analyzed samples of the meteorites Acapulco and Lodran. Like other acapulcoites and lodranites, these meteorites are granular rocks containing large (~0.1-0.3 mm) kamacite and taenite grains along with similarly sized silicate crystals. Many silicate grains contain numerous fine (1-10 μm) FeNi metal inclusions. Our compositional measurements and rock magnetic data suggest that tetrataenite is rare or absent. Bulk paleomagnetic measurements were done on four mutually oriented bulk samples of Acapulco and one bulk sample of Lodran. Alternating field (AF) demagnetization revealed that the magnetization of the bulk samples is highly unstable, likely due to the large (~0.1-0.3 mm) interstitial kamacite grains throughout the samples. To overcome this challenge, we are analyzing individual ~0.2 mm mutually oriented silicate grains extracted using a wire saw micromill. Preliminary SQUID microscopy measurements of a Lodran silicate grain suggest magnetization stable to AF levels of at least 25-40 mT.",

The results showed that the average total OC content was higher at inner shelf stations than those offshore. The δ13C was more depleted at nearshore than offshore stations. Principal component analysis indicated that terrestrial OC, as indicated by lignin-phenols values, was preserved in sediment closer to the coast while offshore sediment was more composed of lignin-poor degraded OC, that was likely hydrodynamically sorted. Marine-derived OC, as indicated by plant pigments, was significantly more abundant in the sediment mixed layer than the underlying accumulation layer. Historical flooding events were detected in lignin-phenols profiles in two of the six cores located at mid-shelf stations. Despite the magnitude of the 2010 flood in East China, we did not see any signature of this event with the chemical biomarker in these two cores used in this study. This may suggest that reduced sediment loading due to recent dam construction may have greatly decoupled river inputs with sediment loading to shelf sediment. This work further supports the need for more research to better understand how the reduced inputs of fluvial input of sediments from Chinese rivers (due to river diversions and dams) affect carbon cycling in the East China Sea.",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of drought is associated with agricultural loss, water supply shortfalls, and other economic impacts. Here we explore the physical relationships between precipitation deficits, high temperatures, and hydrologic responses as a pathway to better anticipate drought impacts. Current methodologies to predict hydrologic scarcity include local monitoring of river flows, remote sensing of land-surface wetness, drought indices, expert judgment, climate indices (e.g. SST-relationships) and the application of hydrologic models. At longer lead times, predictions of drought have most frequently been made on the basis of GCM ensembles, with subsequent downscaling of those to scales over which hydrologic predictions can be made. This study focuses on two important aspects of drought. First, we explore the causal hydro-climatic timeline of a drought event, namely (a) the lack of precipitation, which serves to reduce soil moisture and produce (b) a skewed Bowen ratio, i.e. comparatively more sensible heating (warming) with less ET, resulting in (c) anomalously warm conditions. We seek to assess the extent to which the lack of precipitation contributes to warming temperatures, and the further effects of that warming on hydrology and the severity of drought impacts. An ensemble of GCM simulations will be used to explore the evolution of the land surface energy budget during a recent Great Plains drought event, which will subsequently be used to drive a hydrologic model. Second, we examine the impacts of the critical assumptions relating climatic variables with water demand, specifically the relationship between potential evapotranspiration (PET) and temperature. The common oversimplification in relating PET to temperature is explored against a more physically consistent energy balance estimate of PET, using the Penman-Monteith approach and the hydrologic impacts are presented. Results from this work are anticipated to have broad relevance for future water management and planning, to better characterize drought impacts.",

            "abstract": "Synoptic weather patterns that enhance water vapour transport over North Pacific Ocean are common triggers for autumn flooding events in coastal British Columbia (BC). The bulk of this water vapor transport takes place through narrow corridors known as atmospheric rivers (ARs) that occur within the warm conveyor belt of extratropical cyclones. Global climate models (GCMs) simulate ARs to varying degrees, however, all GCMs can simulate the synoptic patterns that favor ARs development. Thus by looking into the synoptic patterns in GCMs one can indirectly investigate future changes in frequency and intensity of AR events, a goal that we have set for this study. First we evaluate the performance of five GCMs in simulating the synoptic patterns responsible for AR-extreme events (landfalling ARs in BC with extreme precipitation over the province). As reference data we used four reanalysis data-sets for the period 1979-2010. With the use of a clustering algorithm we identified characteristic daily patterns of integrated vapour transport (IVT) over the North Pacific Ocean, and further identified the IVT patterns linked to AR-extreme events. We find that for the period 1974-2005 all five GCMs are relatively unsuccessful in simulating the frequencies of these patterns, as well as total precipitation during the AR-extreme events. Despite the large range of projections and uncertainties, better performing GCMs agree in their projections for the end of the 21st century, simulating more frequent AR-extreme events, as well higher precipitation totals during these events. In the best performing model ensemble of three GCMs, the projections according to RCP4.5 emission scenario reveal an increase of AR-extreme events from 18% per extended fall season (Sep-Dec) in 1974-2005 to 22% in 2070-2100, while the seasonal (Sep-Dec) AR-extreme total precipitation averaged over BC increases by 44% between the two periods.",

            "abstract": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s National Weather Service (NWS) is implementing the Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast Service (HEFS) across the operating areas of the 13 NWS River Forecast Centers (RFCs). As the implementation progresses, hindcasting and validation is necessary to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the HEFS and to guide its operational use. Particularly in regions such as California that encompass a broad range of elevation, temperature, and precipitation gradients, the quality of the HEFS forecasts will vary geographically, and it is important to understand the degrees and controls on forecast quality in this context. This study aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the quality of HEFS forecasts in California, with the aim of guiding and enhancing the implementation of the HEFS, as well as informing end-users about the expected quality of the HEFS forecasts. The HEFS was calibrated with temperature and precipitation forecasts from the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Also, in order to determine forecast skill and to benchmark the HEFS against a simpler forecasting system, the HEFS was calibrated with a conditional (“resampled”) climatology. The calibrated HEFS was used to generate retrospective forecasts of precipitation, temperature, and streamflow for a 25-year (1985-2009) period for six basins in the state. The forecast horizon was 1-14 days. The retrospective forecasts were verified conditionally on forecast lead time, magnitude, and season. Preliminary results indicate that HEFS forecasts are much more skillful when forced by inputs from the GEFS, rather than resampled climatology. However, there are noticeable differences in forecast quality among basins. These observations demonstrate the applicability of HEFS in a wide hydroclimatic gradient within California, while highlighting the difficulty in generalizing its behavior across the state.",

            "abstract": "The impacts of aerosol direct radiative forcing on the atmospheric temperature and wind circulation during the two contrasting monsoon (Jun-Sep) seasons of 2009 (deficit year) and 2010 (normal year) are examined using a regional climate model, RegCM over India. RegCM is coupled with an online aerosol module, which considers both natural dust and anthropogenic aerosols (hydrophilic and hydrophobic black carbon and organic carbon and sulfate). Comparison with satellite and ground-based observations reveal that the model captures the spatial variation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Great Indian Desert and Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) appreciably well with a bias in AOD within ±15% of the observations. The spatial patterns in surface shortwave radiative forcing (SWRF) are similar in both the years with a larger dimming observed in the 2010 relative to the previous 2009 season, which is attributed to larger dust transport in 2010 by stronger westerlies. The SWRF at TOA is observed to be < -21 W m-2 over the IGB during 2010 compared to -15 to -20 W m-2 during 2009. Changes in near surface air temperature at 2m show a spatial dipole pattern with the aerosol effect dampening out above mid-troposphere with a larger change observed for natural aerosols relative to anthropogenic aerosols. Aerosols tend to strengthen the summer monsoon zonal mean wind at 850 hPa over the regional hotspots, whereas there is negligible impact on the corresponding meridional wind component. This has resulted in a southward shift of the monsoon circulation during the 2010 monsoon season, leading to an increase in upward motion over the core monsoon region and thereby increasing the cloud fraction. In 2009, the upward motion is enhanced to the south of the core monsoon region. These results suggest a positive feedback of the aerosol direct SWRF on the monsoon circulation over India and imply that dynamic impacts are as important as aerosol microphysical impacts.",

Data at Pakitsoq demonstrate that sea-level rose at a rate of 3.5 ±1.7 mm/yr prior to 1850AD and slowed to 0.3 ±0.6mm/yr thereafter, producing a slowdown in sea level of 3.2 ± 1.8 mm/yr. A similar slowdown, occurring at 1600AD, is observed at Aasiaat and Sisimiut.\nWe interpret these observed changes using a glacial isostatic adjustment model of sea-level change truncated at degree and order 4096, with an aim to determine if the sea-level data can be used to place constraints on changes in Jakobshavn Isbrae and/or Kangiata Nunaata Sermia (Nuuk fjord) during this period. Modelled sea level at Pakitsoq is insensitive to the location of thickening (thinning) associated with grounding line advance (retreat) and the rate of advance and retreat but is sensitive to the change point in time between periods of growth associated with LIA expansion (sea level rise) and the onset of 19th century recession (sea level fall) of Jakobshavn Isbrae. We conclude that the change in sea-level rate observed at Pakitsoq circa 1850AD marks the onset of post LIA retreat of this outlet glacier. Conversely, the modelled sea-level response to the retreat of Kangiata Nunaata Sermia from its LIA maximum at ca. 1761AD is below the detection threshold of the salt marsh record at Sisimiut.",

The collection focuses on U.S. coastline and the primary goal of these photos was to provide reference for coastal map construction. There are approximately 200,000 frames of film and print taken by multiple instruments. The majority of the photographs were taken by multilens cameras which captures nadir and oblique imageries to cover a larger area hence reduce the number of flightlines required. This huge collection not only shows the change of U.S coast over decades but also gracefully demonstrates how the technique of photogrammetry evolved. It is regarded as the premier record of land cover and coastal features for the era prior to the advent of satellite remote sensing. The collection was stored for many years at the Federal Records Center in Takoma Park, Maryland. After aging past the retention date, the FRC was ready to dispose the collection. NGDC volunteered to pay for the shipping and the collection was transferred to NGDC in 2004. In 2009-11 approximately 10% of the collection was digitally scanned by NOAA's Climate Data Modernization Program.

This canyon starts from the Hsiukuluan River estuary, runs eastward across the eastern flank of the Luzon arc, and merges into the Hualien Canyon near the western end of the Ryukyu Trench off NE Taiwan. The Chimei canyon can be divided into two parts: the upper section is a U-shaped canyon with broad and flat bottom and high walls; the lower section meanders across a deep sea fan in the Huatung basin. In this study, we use multichannel seismic reflection profile data together with high resolution bathymetry data to study the topography, basement structures and seismic sequences along the canyon path and in the distal fan.\nThe U-shaped upper Chimei canyon seems to be carved not only by submarine erosion but also by structural uplift of both side-walls. The canyon walls are up to 950 m above the canyon floor, strata truncations along both sides of the canyon walls and many slumps are observed. The upper Chimei canyon was developed along basement lows of the highly deformed Luzon arc, and runs across a series of N-S trending thrusts. Acoustic basement and lower strata are deformed and folded, and young sediments cover the canyon floor smoothly. We find many thrusts run across the upper Chimei canyon, but now the canyon bottom is smooth. The concave thalweg profile seems to reach the equilibrium between erosion and deposition. An east-vergent thrust fault lies at the foot of the eastern flank of the Luzon arc which separates the upper section from the lower section of the Chimei Canyon. The lower section of the Chimei canyon flows over a submarine fan where eight seismic sequences are recognized. The two lower sequences show continuous, parallel to sub-parallel sheet-drape seismic facies which fill the basement low. They are interpreted to be old deep sea sediment. The six upper sequences show chaotic and mounded seismic facies, and also transparent and continuous parallel seismic strata. We interpret those are characters of submarine fan. Some large slumps occurred at northern half of the submarine fan. The northern half of the submarine fan has been eroded away already by canyon and slumps.",

The abundance of seismic activity both in the subducting Nazca plate and in the overriding South American plate allow us to better understand this margin through the generation of high resolution subsurface images of the subducting slab and the upper crust. A regional body wave tomographic 3D model was obtained using 23.300 locally recorded earthquakes coming from different deployments done in northern Chile between 1990 and the 2014 Mw=8.2 sequence, including the dense 2013 short period FONDECYT 1130071 around Pisagua. Through this way, the 3D architecture of the major forearc faults in the study area was determined for the first time using a geological and geophysical approach. Previous studies in the northern Chile seismic gap, between the coast and the Altiplano, established the presence of abundant microseismic activity in the upper part of the interplate contact, corresponding to continental intraplate seismicity. These geometrical arrangements, from the surface down to 40 km depth, are almost perpendicular to the subducting slab, and are well correlated with low Vp/Vs ratio, indicating the presence of a fractured zone and well correlated with the Neogene. Kilometer-long faults existing in the northern Chilean region, indicating that the outer forearc absorb permanent deformation through active faulting. It is interesting to note that some low-magnitude earthquakes associated with the 2014 aftershock sequence are found along the mentioned faults, indicating their ability to be activated upon the occurrence of a large earthquake",

            "abstract": "Different atomic arrangements of perovskite (pv) and post-perovskite (ppv) in the systems MgSiO3-FeSiO3 and MgSiO3-FeAlO3 (MS-FS and MS-FA) were examined by Boltzmann statistics and density functional theory (GGA+U). The vibrational contribution to the free energy is calculated within the quasi-harmonic approximation. The FS and FA components partition in opposite directions, towards ppv and pv, respectively. The diverse experimental results on the Fe-partitioning between the two phases are broadly consistent with our theoretical investigation.\nWe determined a Clapeyron slope for the pv-ppv transition of 9.6 MPa/K for MS, decreasing to 8.4 and 8.1 MPa/K at 6.3 and 12.5 mol% FS and to 8.2 and 7.3 MPa/K at 6.3 and 12.5 mol% FA. An isochemical pv to ppv transition within the investigated solid solution range (up tp 25 mol% FS and FA) is characterized by decreasing bulk and increasing shear modulus. At a reference pressure of ­­­100 GPa, the bulk modulus for pv and ppv increases by 1.4% and 1.0%, respectively, from MS to MS-FS12.5 and decreases by 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, from MS to MS-FA12.5 (subscripts indicate mol%). The shear modulus decreases for both pv and ppv along both of the solid solution series from the pure MS composition, with the largest decrese along the FA-join. For pv and ppv the shear modulus decreases with 2.4% and 1.3%, respectively from MS100 to MS-FS12.5 and with 4.4% and 3.0%, respectively, from MS100 to MS-FA12.5. The results for the MS-FS join are in general agreement with previous DFT-studies (Caracas & Cohen, 2005, GRL; Stackhouse et al. 2006, GRL; Stackhouse & Brodholt 2008, PEPI). Boffa Ballaran et al. (2012, EPSL), however, found a decrease in the bulk modulus for pv on the MS-FS join relative to pure MS. The decreasing bulk modulus along the MS-FA join agrees with Boffa Ballaran et al.\nA chemical reaction from FA-rich pv and reduced Fe to form FS-rich ppv produces additional Al2O3 and MgO:\n2 FeAlO3 + 3 MgSiO3 + Fe = 3 FeSiO3 + Al2O3 + 3 MgO\nIn peridotite, the excess MgO and Al2O3 may dissolve in ferropericlase and ppv, respectively. If ppv becomes Al-saturated, Ca-ferrite- (CF) or Ca-titanite- (CT) structured phases with the MgAl2O4 component might form. In basaltic rocks MgAl2O4 may enter preexisting CF-CT-phases and excess MgO may combine with SiO2 from silica-dominated phases to the MS-component of ppv.",

            "abstract": "Paid summer REU experiences successfully engage undergraduate students in research and encourage them to continue to graduate school and scientific careers. However these programs only accommodate a limited number of students due to funding constraints, faculty time commitments, and limited access to needed instrumentation. At JMU, the Department of Geology and Environmental Science has embedded undergraduate research into the curriculum. Each student fulfilling a BS in Geology or a BA in Earth Science completes 3 credits of research, including a 1-credit course on scientific communication, 2 credits of research or internship, followed by a presentation of that research. Our department has successfully acquired many analytical instruments and now has an XRD, SEM/EDS, FTIR, handheld Raman, AA, ion chromatograph, and an IRMS. To give as many students as possible an overview to the scientific uses and operation methods for these instruments, we revived a laboratory methods course that includes theory and practical use of instrumentation at JMU, plus XRF sample preparation and analysis training at Virginia Tech during a 1-day field trip. In addition to practical training, projects included analytical concepts such as evaluating analytical vs. natural uncertainty, determining error on multiple measurements, signal-to-noise ratio, and evaluating data quality. State funding through the 4-VA program helped pay for analytical supplies and support for students to complete research projects over the summer or during the next academic year using instrumentation from the course. This course exemplifies an alternative path to broadening participation in undergraduate research and creating stronger partnerships between PUI’s and research universities.",

            "abstract": "Many large rivers in southern Africa are characterised by a macro-channel cut 10 – 20 m into the ancient planation surface. This has resulted in a variable channel morphology strongly influenced by bedrock outcrops. The influence of bedrock upon flow hydraulics and sediment transport often results in a repeat sequence of alluvial channel types behind bedrock obstructions. This study investigates the hydraulic controls on channel type sequencing on the Sabie River, which drains a 6500 km2 semi-arid catchment of the Lowveld of South Africa and Mozambique. Aerial LIDAR data within the Kruger National Park was interrogated to isolate a bedrock influenced anastomosing reach, together with its associated alluvial sequences up- and downstream. These data were used to create a 2m DEM and a 2D flow model (JFLOW) was used to simulate a sequence of flows from 20 m3s-1 to 5000 m3s-1, with spatial data on water surface, flow depth and channel velocity extracted from the model.\nWater surface data revealed the strong gradient control exerted by the bedrock influenced anastomosed channel, creating hydraulic conditions suitable for deposition upstream and restricting sedimentation downstream. Steepening of the gradient through the anastomosing reach resulted in altered hydraulics and a changed pattern of sedimentation. At moderate discharges, flow is distributed efficiently across numerous interconnected channels, over low berms and islands, promoting sedimentation. Similarly the backwater effect encourages deposition of fine sediments upstream to create and maintain the alluvial sequence. Under higher flows, water levels rise significantly in the confined upstream reach and shear stress exceeds the threshold necessary to strip stored sediment. In contrast, conditions within the anastomosed reach remain less energetic due to the continued effect of flow distribution. Under extreme flow conditions the bedrock influence is drowned out resulting in dramatically increased energy levels and a general stripping of soft sediment regardless of initial channel type or location. This hydraulic sequencing helps to explain development and longevity of crucial riverine forest habitat across the anastomosing channel types whilst this development is absent in the more sensitive alluvial reaches upstream.",

            "abstract": "The hydroxyl radical is the dominant daytime oxidant responsible for the removal of many trace gases. Its short lifetime means it is an ideal target species for models in order to test the accuracy of tropospheric chemical mechanisms. Its steady-state concentration is controlled by the balance of its rate of production and destruction, but it is often difficult, particularly in more polluted conditions, to adequately characterise the nature of all of the sinks for OH. Measurements of OH reactivity and comparison with model calculations have revealed that OH sinks are often underestimated, sometimes by significant amounts. In this presentation we will describe a new instrument to identify the chemical nature of “missing” OH reactivity in the troposphere. A chemical flow reactor in which OH is generated artificially was interfaced to a gas chromatograph time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC-TOF-MS). Ambient air is passed through the reactor and a fraction of the OH sinks are removed according to their reactivity towards OH. By measuring the change in the TOFMS signal in the presence and absence of OH in the reactor (the latter to establish the trapping efficiency for each species), the relative rate coefficient for that species reacting with OH can be measured. By comparison with the known values for identified species, the rate coefficient for reaction of OH with unidentified sinks can therefore be measured, and their retention time and mass/fragmentation pattern used to infer their identity and functionality. The new instrument was deployed in a field campaign at the University of York in May/June 2014 and identified OH sinks were found to decrease on exposure to OH according to their rate coefficient for reaction with OH. The resulting relationship was used to determine rate coefficients for unidentified species and from their estimated concentrations their contribution towards total OH reactivity was estimated. In addition, the total OH reactivity was measured independently, as well as concentrations of OH, HO2 and RO2 radicals, a very detailed suite of VOCs, HCHO, HONO, NOx, CO and O3.",

The monitored results showed subsidence was distributed through most parts of the plain area and formed a broad plain-wide bowl for the period 1955-2010. The maximum accumulated subsidence of five primary localized subsidence bowls-northwest, north, central, south, southwest bowl- recognized in the plain were 700 mm, 1233 mm, 1058 mm, 961 mm, 1030 mm, respectively. Range of subsidence area has expanded outward from urban area to suburban area. The subsidence rates of these subsidence bowls are between 10 mm/yr to 60 mm/yr. Most records show the subsidence rates for the period of 2000-1010 is faster than that of 1955-2000, which indicates land subsidence in Beijing plain area of China has been undergoing rapid development at present.\nKeywords Land Subsidence • Beijing • Groundwater • InSAR • Mechanism",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty for bedload estimates in gravel bed rivers is largely driven by our inability to characterize the arrangement and orientation of the sediment grains within the bed. The characteristics of the surface structure are produced by the water working of grains, which leads to structural differences in bedforms through differential patterns of grain sorting, packing, imbrication, mortaring and degree of bed armoring. Until recently the technical and logistical difficulties of characterizing the arrangement of sediment in 3D have prohibited a full understanding of how grains interact with stream flow and the feedback mechanisms that exist.\nMicro-focus X-ray CT has been used for non-destructive 3D imaging of grains within a series of intact sections of river bed taken from key morphological units (see Figure 1). Volume, center of mass, points of contact, protrusion and spatial orientation of individual surface grains are derived from these 3D images, which in turn, facilitates estimates of 3D static force properties at the grain-scale such as pivoting angles, buoyancy and gravity forces, and grain exposure.\nBy aggregating representative samples of grain-scale properties of localized interacting sediment into overall metrics, we can compare and contrast bed stability at a macro-scale with respect to stream bed morphology. Understanding differences in bed stability through representative metrics derived at the grain-scale will ultimately lead to improved bedload estimates with reduced uncertainty and increased understanding of interactions between grain-scale properties on channel morphology.\nFigure 1.

            "abstract": "Ecosystem science has a long history as a core component of the discipline of Ecology, and although topics of research have fluctuated over the years, it retains a clear identity and continues to be a vital field. As science is becoming more interdisciplinary, particularly the science of global environmental change, ecosystem scientists are addressing new and important questions at the interface of multiple disciplines. Over the last two years, we organized a series of workshops and discussion groups at multiple scientific-society meetings, including AGU to identify frontiers in ecosystem research. The workshops featured short “soapbox” presentations where speakers highlighted key questions in ecosystem science. The presentations were recorded (video and audio) and subjected to qualitative text analysis for identification of frontier themes, attendees completed surveys, and a dozen additional “key informants” were interviewed about their views about frontiers of the discipline.\nOur effort produced 253 survey participants; the two largest groups of participants were full professors (24%) and graduate students (24%); no other specific group was > 10%. Formal text analysis of the soapbox presentations produced three major themes; “frontiers,” “capacity building,” and “barriers to implementation” with four or five sub-themes within each major theme. Key “frontiers” included; 1) better understanding of the drivers of ecosystem change, 2) better understanding of ecosystem process and function, 3) human dimensions of ecosystem science, and 4) problem-solving/applied research. Under “capacity building,” key topics included: holistic approaches, cross-disciplinary collaboration, public support for research, data, training, and technology investment. Under “barriers” key topics included: limitations in theoretical thinking, insufficient funding/support, fragmentation across discipline, data access and data synthesis. In-depth interviews with 13 experts validated findings from analysis of soapbox presentations and surveys and also resulted in a conceptual model for understanding disciplinary frontiers.",

            "abstract": "Historical variations in North Atlantic SSTs have been a key driver of regional climate change – linked to drought frequency in the Sahel, Amazon and American Mid-West, rainfall and heat waves in Europe and frequency of Atlantic tropical storms. Traditionally these SST variations were deemed to arise from internally generated ocean variability. We present results from recent studies (Booth et al, 2012, Dunstone, 2013) that identify a mechanism via which volcanic and industrial aerosols could explain a large fraction of observed Atlantic variability, and its associated climate impacts.\nThis work has prompted a lot of subsequent discussion about the relative contribution of ocean generated and external forced variability in the Atlantic. Here we present new results, that extend this earlier work, by looking at forced variability in the CMIP5 modelling context. This provides new insights into the potential externally forced role aerosols may play in the real world. CMIP5 models that represent aerosol-cloud interactions tend to have stronger correlations to observed variations in SSTs, but disagree on the magnitude of forced variability that they explain. We can link this contribution to the magnitude of aerosol forcing in each of these models – a factor that is both dependent on the aerosol parameterisation and the representation of boundary layer cloud in this region. This suggests that whether aerosols have played a larger or smaller role in historical Atlantic variability is tied to whether aerosols have a larger or smaller aerosol forcing (particularly indirect) in the real world. This in turn suggests that benefits of reducing current aerosol uncertainty are likely to extend beyond better estimates of global forcing, to providing a clearer picture of the past aerosol driven role in historical regional climate change.",

In this region, new tactics and partnerships are needed to increase outreach exposure. IRIS and EarthScope are partnering with the Alaska Earthquake Center, part of University of Alaska Geophysical Institute, to spread awareness of Alaska earthquakes and the benefits of the Transportable Array for Alaskans.\nNearly all parts of Alaska are tectonically active. The tectonic and seismic variability of Alaska requires focused attention at the regional level, and the remoteness and inaccessibility of most Alaska villages and towns often makes frequent visits difficult. For this reason, Alaska outreach most often occurs at community events. When a community is accessible, every opportunity to engage the residents is made. Booths at state fairs and large cultural gatherings, such as the annual convention of the Alaska Federation of Natives, are excellent venues to distribute earthquake information and to demonstrate a wide variety of educational products and web-based applications related to seismology and the Transportable Array that residents can use in their own communities. Region-specific publications have been developed to tie in a sense of place for residents of Alaska. The Alaska content for IRIS’s Active Earth Monitor will emphasize the widespread tectonic and seismic features and offer not just Alaska residents, but anyone interested in Alaska, a glimpse into what is going on beneath their feet. The concerted efforts of the outreach team will have lasting effects on Alaskan understanding of the seismic hazard and tectonics of the region.\nEfforts to publicize the presence of the Transportable Array in Alaska, western Canada, and the Lower 48 also continue. There have been recent articles published in university, local and regional newspapers; stories appearing in national and international print and broadcast media; and documentaries produced by some of the world’s most respected scientific and educational production companies that have included a segment about EarthScope and the Transportable Array.",

For ocean reanalysis products we derive the net surface heat flux as the sum of the mean mixed layer heating rate and the net horizontal and vertical heat fluxes. We evaluate reproducibility of the net tropical ocean surface heat flux climatology and trend in various reanalysis products to assess how well the surface air-sea heat exchange is represented in ocean and atmospheric reanalyses, by measure of their spatial and temporal corroboration. The direct comparison of the net ocean surface heat flux between atmospheric and ocean reanalyses tests the surface energy budget of atmospheric reanalyses with the mixed layer energy budget of ocean reanalyses. Preliminary results suggest that there is strong agreement among the various atmospheric reanalyses in the net tropical ocean surface heat flux mean value and three year running mean trend anomalies from 1980 - 2010. We expect less agreement among ocean reanalyses, potentially due to the great disparity of vertical and horizontal resolutions, diversity of assimilated data sets, and subsequent method of variable calculation with depth.",

            "abstract": "Cloud properties determined from satellite imager radiances provide a valuable source of information for nowcasting and weather forecasting. In recent years, it has been shown that assimilation of cloud top temperature, optical depth, and total water path can increase the accuracies of weather analyses and forecasts. Aircraft icing conditions can be accurately diagnosed in near-real time (NRT) retrievals of cloud effective particle size, phase, and water path, providing valuable data for pilots. NRT retrievals of surface skin temperature can also be assimilated in numerical weather prediction models to provide more accurate representations of solar heating and longwave cooling at the surface, where convective initiation. These and other applications are being exploited more frequently as the value of NRT cloud data become recognized. At NASA Langley, cloud properties and surface skin temperature are being retrieved in near-real time globally from both geostationary (GEO) and low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellite imagers for weather model assimilation and nowcasting for hazards such as aircraft icing. Cloud data from GEO satellites over North America are disseminated through NCEP, while those data and global LEO and GEO retrievals are disseminated from a Langley website. This paper presents an overview of the various available datasets, provides examples of their application, and discusses the use of the various datasets downstream. Future challenges and areas of improvement are also presented.",

            "abstract": "Temperature is widely believed to be one major factor controlling the distribution of seismicity along plate-boundary faults. However, there are few detailed measurements of the strength and frictional properties of natural fault gouges at elevated temperatures, which are necessary to quantify the role of temperature on friction and to understand underlying mechanisms. Here, we report on a suite of shearing experiments designed to investigate this question using fault rocks from the Alpine Fault in New Zealand, sampled by coring in Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP) borehole 1B. The DFDP-1B borehole penetrated 151 m, through – from top to bottom - hanging wall mylonites and ultramylonites, damage zone cataclasite, a ~30 cm-thick clay-rich ultra fine-grained principal slip zone (PSZ) gouge, and granitic footwall cataclasites.\n We tested five samples from DFDP-1B: two chloritic cataclasites from 111.5 m and 127.1 m, PSZ gouge from 128.1 m, and two granitic cataclasites from 130.3 m and 142.9 m. We powdered and sieved samples to <106 µm, and conducted shearing experiments on gouge layers in a triaxial saw-cut geometry. In our experiments, we sheared 1-mm thick gouge layers at an effective normal stress of 80 MPa, and at temperatures ranging from 23-500°C. In each test, we sheared at an initial velocity of 1 µm/s for ~0.5 mm and then conducted velocity-steps over a range of load-point velocities from 0.1-100 µm/s.\nBoth the hanging wall and footwall cataclasites exhibit an increase in friction coefficient (µ) with increasing temperature from 0.60-0.64 at 23°C to 0.87 at 500°C, and from 0.45-0.62 at 23°C to 0.70-0.84 at 350°C, respectively. The PSZ material friction coefficient (µ = 0.46) at 23°C decreases to 0.20-0.40 at 180°C, and then increases to 0.87-0.90 at 500°C. All of the samples exhibit velocity-strengthening at 23°C, transition to velocity-weakening at 180-350°C, and remain velocity-weakening once at 500°C. The chloritic cataclasites, granitic cataclasites, and PSZ also become frictionally unstable, producing stick-slip behavior at 350-500°C. We suggest that both the increased frictional strength and the transition to velocity-weakening and unstable behavior with increasing temperature may result from enhanced gouge consolidation and lithification associated with shearing at elevated temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change has the potential to alter current levels of Tropical Cyclone (TC) damage, yet the degree of change and its importance relative to changes in exposure and vulnerability are debated. This study isolates the climate drivers of TC damage and develops an approach to translate climate model data directly to a measure of Cyclone Damage Potential (CDP). The actual damage then depends on a given user’s impacted exposure and vulnerability.\nOur approach is motivated by recent work that highlighted the importance of accounting for TC size and TC translation speed in addition to maximum wind speed in driving TC damage. Since coarse resolution climate models are not able to adequately capture many TC characteristics, these key damaging parameters are modeled in terms of large-scale climate variables, to sidestep the need for information on individual TCs and to enable assessments of CDP directly from large-scale climate model data.\nThe CDP is applied to ensembles of future climates generated under a range of anthropogenic forcing scenarios to assess the degree of avoided CDP under lower emission pathways. Users may then translate avoided CDP to avoided losses using relationships between CDP and their specific exposure and vulnerability characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Mineral carbonation is considered a permanent option to capture and store atmospheric CO2. This reaction occurs naturally under ambient conditions in ultramafic mining and milling waste. In the region of Thetford Mines, Quebec, chrysotile mining has produced approximately 0.8 Gt of magnesium-rich milling waste, which mainly consists of poorly sorted ultramafic rock fragments (< 10 cm) and chrysotile fibers.\nTo quantify the amount of CO2 that can be captured in the mine wastes of Thetford Mines, two experimental pilot-scale tailings cells were constructed and instrumented for measuring soil temperature, volumetric water content, gas pressure and gas composition, with ambient conditions recorded by an autonomous meteorological station. The cells were monitored for water geochemistry, carbon content and mineralogy, with the objective to better understand the mineral carbonation processes under natural conditions and to propose a conceptual model for mineral carbonation at the pilot scale. To validate this model, numerical simulations with the MIN3P reactive transport code have been carried out.\nThe chemical composition of the cell leachate (pH > 10, Mg from 85 to 140 mg.L-1, and high total alkalinity from 260 to 300 mg.L-1 CaCO3) is consistent with active CO2 mineralization reactions within the cell. SEM analyses show precipitation of dypingite with a lamellar texture and cemented grain surfaces. The milling waste contains up to 1.2% C, which indicates CO2 sequestration by mineral carbonation. Measured CO2 concentrations in the interstitial air are also ten times lower than in the atmosphere. Analysis of seasonal variations in fluid flow and heat transfer (essentially by thermal conduction) shows that molecular diffusion is the main process for CO2 supply within the experimental cells. These observations have helped develop a conceptual model for mineral carbonation in the wastes and were used to calibrate the reactive transport model.",

            "abstract": "The Italian Peninsula is the site of intense subduction-related potassic magmatism with bimodal character in terms of silica activity: Ca-poor silica-saturated lamproitic rocks and Ca-enriched silica-undersaturated leucitites. Lamproitic magmas formed in the early phases of magmatic activity and were followed by leucititic magmas. The primary magmas are generated in the sub-continental lithospheric mantle at the destructive plate margin, and both series have olivine as the first crystallizing phenocrysts.\nTrace elements in olivine phenocrysts are important in recognizing metasomatic effects on the mineralogy of the mantle source. Since Ni is the most compatible trace element in olivine, particularly in alkaline melts, modal changes of olivine in the source strongly affect its bulk partition coefficient, and therefore its content in primary melts and in olivine that crystallizes from them.The concentration of other compatible trace elements (e.g. Mn, Co) in olivine phenocrysts also depends on the abundance of olivine in the magma source.\nNi contents in olivine of the Italian rocks show a clear bimodal distribution. Olivine from lamproitic samples has systematically higher Fo and Ni contents, whereas olivine from leucititic rocks never exceeds Fo92 and has markedly lower Ni, reaching among the lowest levels ever observed in olivine phenocrysts in primitive melts. The Mn/Fe ratio of olivine is also sensitive to changes of the modal abundance of olivine in the source, 100*Mn/Fe of olivine from lamproitic rocks never exceeds 2, while it is always >1.8 in leucititic rocks, meaning that the leucitite source regions are much richer in olivine.\nLithium is generally enriched in the crust and in sediments compared to the lithospheric mantle and to mantle-derived melts,so that Li in olivine above 10 ppm is suggested to indicate recycled sediments. Li contents are up to 35 ppm in leucititic olivines and up to >50 ppm in lamproitic olivines, confirming the recycling of crustal material into the mantle wedge.\nOur data indicate opposite effects for metasomatism by silicate- and carbonate-rich melts, namely the removal and growth of olivine, respectively. This new line of evidence establishes olivine as a key tool to investigate the role of carbonatitic and silicate melts in the Earth’s mantle.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the structure of the lithosphere is vital to our comprehension of plate tectonic processes. Using a seismograph network in Quebec, Canada, we attempt to identify horizontal discontinuities associated with the crust and lithospheric mantle. We also investigate systematic changes in these discontinuities across the Grenville Front and Appalachian Front, two tectonic boundaries separating the Proterozoic Grenville Province from the Archean Superior craton to the north and the Appalachian orogen to the south.\nUsing data from long-term seismic stations, we analyzed over 3000 teleseismic earthquakes from the period 2000-2013. For each station we constructed P-to-S receiver function (RF) gathers arranged by backazimuth and epicentral distance, to identify individual phases that we can associate with seismic boundaries within the crust and upper mantle.\nAt stations across the Superior craton, we see a strong positive phase at ~5 s with a prominent first multiple, suggesting a flat, sharp Moho boundary at ~35 km depth. A phase at ~2 s is also pervasive, likely due to an intra-crustal boundary. We do not see any evidence for a sharp lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) in the RF data for this region. A remarkably similar structure is inferred at stations within the Grenville Province.\nAround the St. Lawrence River, observations from both sides of the Appalachian Front are broadly similar to each other, but systematically different from those further north. The Moho phase suggests a crustal thickness of ~40-45 km, and we do not observe any pulses that may be interpreted as Moho multiples. The crustal structure is more complex, with significant directional variation in RF signal at individual sites, and noticeable differences in RF gathers between stations separated by tens of km. This complexity likely explains the lack of coherent crustal multiples. At some stations, a negative pulse at ~15-17 s is observed, consistent with a predicted LAB depth of ~150 km.\nOur data suggest that the surface tectonic boundaries of the Grenville Province do not correspond to significant changes in lithospheric discontinuity structure at depth. Instead, a major change in lithospheric layering is inferred between the St. Lawrence River and the northern Grenville Province near Lac St-Jean.",

            "abstract": "The aeolian dust deposits of the Chinese Loess Plateau are attributed to spring and winter monsoonal storms sweeping clastic material from the deserts of the Asian interior into central China and are reported to begin 25-22 million years (Myr) ago. The beginning of aeolian dust sedimentation has been attributed to the onset of central Asia desertification and winter monsoonal circulation, and are commonly linked to development of high topographic relief associated with the Tibetan-Himalayan orogenic system. However, recent papers suggest that the core of the Tibetan Plateau may have reached significant elevation since the earliest phases of the India-Asia collision 55 Myr ago.\nHere, we extend the sedimentary record of the Chinese Loess Plateau at its western margin to include the late Eocene - late Oligocene deposits of the Xining Basin, which were deposited between 41 and 25 Myr ago based on detailed magnetostratigraphy. The particle size, shape, and surface microtexture of quartz grains in these deposits display textures indicative of prolonged aeolian transport; grain-size distributions show a bimodal distribution similar to Miocene through Quaternary deposits of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The clay mineralogy of the finer fraction and U/Pb zircon ages of the coarser fraction from Xining Loess sediments sampled along three sections spanning the whole studied interval are also similar to those observed in Quaternary and Neogene aeolian deposits of the Chinese Loess Plateau and thus suggest similar sources located in central China. However, slight differences in Eocene U/Pb zircon ages, such as the lack of Cenozoic ages or the scarcity of zircons older than 2000 Myr, suggest that the Tibetan Plateau may have contributed little to the aeolian dust deposition, in favor of sources located further north and west (Kunlun and Tian Shan Ranges).\nThe Xining deposits are thus the first direct evidence that winter monsoonal winds were active 15 Myr earlier than previously reported and indicate that the process of central Asian desertification was already significant. Together with Eocene East Asian palynological datasets and recently published paleoclimatic data from the Eocene proto-Bengal Bay, these results provide additional evidence that the monsoons are much older than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "In recent years the known diversity of hydrocarbon activation mechanisms under anaerobic conditions has been extended by intra-aerobic denitrification, a process in which oxygen is derived from NO and used for substrate activation. For two phylogenetically unrelated bacterial species, the freshwater NC10 phylum bacterium Methylomirabilis oxyfera [1] and the marine γ-proteobacterial strain HdN1 [2] it has been shown that, under anoxic conditions with nitrate and/or nitrite, mono-oxygenases are used for methane and hexadecane oxidation, respectively. No degradation was observed with nitrous oxide (N2O) only. In the anaerobic methanotroph M. oxyfera, which lacks apparent nitrous oxide reductase in its genome, substrate activation in the presence of nitrite was directly associated with both O2 and N2 formation. These findings strongly argue for the role of nitric oxide (NO), or an oxygen species derived from it, in the activation reaction of methane. Although intracellular oxygen generation has been experimentally documented and elegantly explains the utilization of ‘aerobic’ pathways under anoxic conditions, research about the underlying molecular mechanism has just started. The proposed candidate enzymes for oxygen (or possibly another another reactive intermediate) production from NO, an NO dismutase (NOD) [3], related to quinol-dependent NO reductases (qNORs), is present and highly expressed in both M. oxyfera and strain HdN1. Besides that, several recently sequenced species from the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group harbor Nod/Nor genes, but experimential evidence is needed to show if these have NOD activity, are unusual but functional qNORs, or represent transition states between the two. Additionally, for several anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading organisms the biochemical mechanism of substrate activation has not been elucidated yet: whereas signature genes of anaerobic degradation are missing, monooxygenase genes are present. Also these microorganisms may, analogously to chlorate-reducing bacteria, produce their own supply of oxygen to activate recalcitrant hydrocarbons in anoxic environments.\n[1] Ettwig et al.

In this study, we developed the effective teaching material that is both student is easy understanding and teacher is easy treating.\nThe teaching material that we developed is the Movement of the Moon and the Sun using about 30-cm turntable and a USB Camera. As for the previous teaching materials, every student was checking (see) the moon and the sun spatial relationship, and the shape of the moon to each. The developed teaching material have the advantage that all student in the class can check the same phenomenon on a Video screen, by using a USB Camera. And we carried the questionnaire survey to student of attached elementary school of Shimane University. The result checked that such teaching materials were useful to a student's understanding of the movement of the celestial sphere.",

            "abstract": "Oxidized mercury species constitute a small fraction of the total atmospheric burden of mercury, but play an important role in the cycling of mercury in the environment. They dominate the deposition flux of mercury from the atmosphere to the Earth’s surfaces, because of their high solubility and low vapor pressure. Their primary source is in-situ oxidation of elemental mercury, but our understanding of these oxidation mechanisms is limited. The Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury, and Aerosol Distribution, Sources, and Sinks (NOMADSS) experiment was designed with the aim of addressing these limitations, using aircraft-based speicated measurements of mercury in the troposphere over the eastern US in the summer of 2013. We observed high concentrations of oxidized mercury in clean, dry pockets of air originating in the upper troposphere. We analyze these observations with the GEOS-Chem model, which simulates oxidation of mercury by bromine radicals. The modeled concentrations of oxidized mercury are found to be low, by up to a factor of ten, compared to the observations. This indicates that the oxidation rate of mercury is much faster than that calculated in the model. We perform two simulations to test the sensitivity of the modeled oxidation: (i) by increasing bromine radical concentrations by a factor of three in the 45°S-45°N latitude band, and (ii) by using an oxidation rate constant that is higher by a factor of five. We find that the model performance improves considerably in both these simulations. Here, we present a comparison of the standard and the sensitivity simulations to the NOMADSS and the surface-based Mercury Deposition Network (MDN) observations. We further discuss the potential implications of the faster oxidation on the global transport, distribution, and burden of oxidized mercury.",

            "abstract": "The origin of the relation between the MJO and the cyclogenesis above the south Indian Ocean during austral summer (October to March) is analyzed. The emphasis is put on the physical process at the origin of the initiation of tropical depressions (TD) and on the probability for a TD to reach the Tropical Storm strength (sustained wind > 33 kt). An original TD tracking approach, based on ERA-Interim geopotential fields, is developed. Cyclogenetic TDs are identified by a comparison with the IBTrACS dataset. About 1/3 of the TD are cyclogenetic and this proportion is only slightly modulated by the MJO. The MJO modulation of the number of cyclones is thus mostly due to the modulation of the number of TD initiations.\nThe TD are initiated mostly over three regions centered at 10°S and at 55°E, 75°E and 95°E. The TD initiation is due to the development of an unstable (inversion of the PV meridional gradient) cyclonic meridional shear of the zonal wind at low-levels. This shear results first from a heat low, due to a convective perturbation, which triggers westerly winds north of the TD initiation region. The shear is reinforced by large-scale geostrophic easterly wind south of the initiation regions due either to a reinforcement of the subtropical high (for the western IO) or to a large-scale depression above the Maritime Continent (for the eastern IO). This large-scale depression is related more directly to the MJO than the subtropical high and the MJO thus modulates primarily the TD initiation in the eastern IO (a factor of 5 between active and inactive MJO phases).",

            "abstract": "The structure of conjugate passive margins provides information about rifting styles, opening of an ocean and formation of it's associated sedimentary basins. In order to distinguish between tectonic inheritance and structures directly related to rifting of passive margins conjugate profiles have to be acquired on margins on diverse locations and different ages. In this study we use new and existing reflection and wide-angle seismic data from two margin pairs, the 200 Ma year old Nova-Scotia – Morocco margin pair and the only 20 Ma Gulf of Lions – Sardinia margin pair. On both margin pairs wide-angle seismic data combined with reflection seismic data were acquired on conjugate profiles on sea and extended on land. Forward modelling of the deep crustal structure along the four transects indicates that a high velocity zone (HVZ) (> 7.2 km/s) is present at the base of the lower crust on all four margins along the ocean-continental transition zone (OCT). This may represent either exhumed upper mantle material or injection of upper mantle material into proto-oceanic crust at the onset of sea-floor spreading. However the width of the HVZ might strongly differ between conjugates, which may be the result of tectonic inheritance, for example the presence of ancient subduction zones or orogens. Both margin pairs show a similar unthinned continental crustal thickness. Crustal thinning and upper-to-lower crustal thickness vary between margin pairs, but remain nearly symmetric on conjugate profiles and might therefore depend on the structure and mechanical properties of the original continental crust. For the Mediterranean margin pair, the oceanic crust is similar on both sides, with a thickness of only 4-5 km. For the Atlantic margin pair, oceanic crustal thickness is higher on the Moroccan Margin, a fact that can be explained by either asymmetric spreading or by the volcanic underplating, possibly originating from the Canary Hot Spot.",

This work addresses the need for a better understanding of the quality of existing global elevation and vegetation products by validating a radar-derived, void-filled digital elevation model and a lidar-derived global canopy height model against ICESat waveforms and a small-footprint airborne lidar survey over tropical forests in the country of Gabon. The bare-earth digital terrain model and canopy height model obtained from the airborne lidar survey are validated against ICESat waveforms, and are then used to evaluate errors and biases in SRTMv3 and the 1km global canopy height model developed by Simard, et al. across the extent of the survey region near the city of Libreville, Gabon. ICESat waveforms are subsequently used to evaluate SRTMv3 and Simard, et al.’s canopy height model for the entire country of Gabon.",

            "abstract": "Can subsidence in river deltas be monitored in near real-time at the spatial and temporal resolution needed for informing critical management decisions? Interferometric Synthetic Radar Aperture (InSAR) is a satellite-based technique that can map ground deformation with millimeter-scale vertical resolution over thousands of square kilometers. InSAR has enormous potential to shed light on the dynamics of actively subsiding deltas, but the technique is not commonly applied outside of major cities due to the difficulty of performing InSAR in wet, vegetated settings. Given these limitations, how can InSAR best serve the global effort to monitor sinking deltas?\nHere, an overview of InSAR processing is provided that addresses delta-specific challenges, including frequent cloud-cover in tropical areas; noisy signals in wetlands and flooded fields; dense forests that interact unpredictably with different radar wavelengths; flat landscapes that hinder image stacking algorithms; rapid urban development that can render Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) inaccurate; and a lack of in situ GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers for InSAR calibration. InSAR has unique value for monitoring subsidence in deltas, and some natural and anthropogenic drivers of subsidence can be resolved by InSAR.\nHigh-resolution InSAR measurements from the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta (GBD) are then presented and validated against GPS data. Surface motion is shown to reflect subsurface stratigraphy, and sediment compaction is shown to be the most important factor in this delta on short (non-tectonic) timescales. Average compaction rates throughout the eastern delta range from 0 to > 18 mm/y, varying by more than an order of magnitude depending on the ages and grain sizes of surface and subsurface sediment layers. Fastest subsidence is observed in Holocene organic-rich mud, and slowest subsidence is observed along the Meghna River and in areas with surface or subsurface sand deposits. Although groundwater extraction rates are high in Dhaka, much of the city is built on a consolidated Pleistocene terrace that appears to compact little even under sustained drawdown. This has minimized the impact of anthropogenic fluid extraction in the Dhaka region.",

            "abstract": "The Zagros orogenic belt and foreland basin formed during the Cenozoic Arabia-Eurasia collision, but the precise histories of shortening and sediment accumulation remain ambiguous, especially at the NW extent of the fold-thrust belt in Iraqi Kurdistan. This region is characterized by well-preserved successions of Cenozoic clastic foreland-basin fill and deformed Paleozoic-Mesozoic hinterland bedrock. The study area provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the linkage between orogenic wedge behavior and surface processes of erosion and deposition. The aim of this research is to test whether the Zagros orogenic wedge advanced steadily under critical to supercritical wedge conditions involving in-sequence thrusting with minimal erosion or propagated intermittently under subcritical condition involving out-of-sequence deformation with intense erosion. These endmember modes of mountain building can be assessed by integrating geo/thermochronologic and basin analyses techniques, including apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronology, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, stratigraphic synthesis, and seismic interpretations. Preliminary apatite (U-Th)/He data indicate activation of the Main Zagros Fault (MZF) at ~10 Ma with frontal thrusts initiating at ~8 Ma. However, thermochronometric results from the intervening Mountain Front Flexure (MFF), located between the MZF and the frontal thrusts, suggest rapid exhumation at ~6 Ma. These results suggest that the MFF, represented by the thrust-cored Qaradagh anticline, represents a major episode of out-of-sequence deformation. Detrital zircon U-Pb analyses from the Neogene foreland-basin deposits show continuous sediment derivation from sources to the NNE in Iraq and western Iran, suggesting that out-of-sequence thrusting did not significantly alter sedimentary provenance. Rather, intense hinterland erosion and recycling of older foreland-basin fill dominated sediment delivery to the basin. The irregular distribution of thermochronologic ages, hinterland growth, extensive erosion, and recycled sediment in the Neogene foreland basin imply that the Zagros orogenic wedge in the Iraqi Kurdistan region largely developed under subcritical wedge conditions.",

The majority of studies of 17O-excess in waters focus on high-latitude precipitation and ice; little is known about the variation in 17O-excess of precipitation from low- and mid-latitudes. Here we present δ18O, δD and δ17O data from weekly precipitation collections from the western United States. Among precipitation samples that range in δ18O from -26 to +5‰, 17O-excess averages 0.02 ± 0.02‰ (1σ) and ranges between -0.06 and +0.07‰. In the majority of locations, 17O-excess values of summer precipitation are considerably lower and more variable than 17O-excess of winter precipitation. For summer precipitation, there is a strong negative correlation between 17O-excess and δ18O and a weak, positive correlation with d-excess. We attribute both the lower and more variable summer 17O-excess values to the effects of re-evaporation of rainfall in warmer settings. However, in some regions, like western Oregon, there is little seasonal variation in 17O-excess and no trend between 17O-excess and d-excess. These data indicate that both season and climate regime are important factors in determining 17O-excess of precipitation and its relationship to both δ18O and d-excess. We use these data to show how measurements of 17O-excess can complement measurements of δ18O and δD in hydrologic studies, and how 17O-excess can be used as an additional constraint on the climate variables that drive variation of δ18O in sedimentary archives.",

            "abstract": "Over the years significant progress has been made in understanding the regional geologic models of the Greenstone Belts associated with gold mineralization in the fields of exploration geochemistry, geophysics and data integration. Improved knowledge of the geological models together with advancements in exploration techniques have resulted in the discovery of many near surface, and relatively large gold mines around the world such as the Abitibi, Isua, Barberton, Lake Victoria, Sadiola, and Yatela.\nHowever, the search for new deposits becomes more difficult due to the fact that most easily detectable, near surface deposits have been discovered. Many of the remaining deposits tend to be remotely located and deep underground. Effective exploration for new economically viable deposits requires approaches that integrate multiple techniques capable of resolving smaller, deeper and remotely located resources.\nGravity surveys have been widely used to map and define geometry and structure of greenstones belts at a regional scale. Structure and hydrothermally altered zones can be mapped, either directly by gravity in weathered environments or inferred in terrains where geological units of different density are offset and/or altered\nGravity gradiometry is increasingly becoming a standard method of commercial minerals exploration. Gradiometry presents a significant increase in spatial resolution when compared to previous airborne gravity methods. Airborne full tensor gravity gradiometry surveys have been flown in the past for prospect-level gold exploration in Quebec, Nunavut, Nevada, Brazil, Mali, Zambia and New Zealand and Nevada.\nThe application of airborne gravity gradiometry for prospect-level gold exploration over greenstone belts is discussed in this paper. The high resolution system capability to detect small, high frequency targets is the key for successful results. In addition, this paper presents and discusses data enhancement and 3D inversion results. It is expected that the result of data enhancement and 3D inversion will help resolve subsurface structures associated with gold mineralization and updates the existing geological model over the property.",

While the spectra from observations in nadir and limb modes have been used successfully to retrieve trace gas columns and profiles, one of the biggest remaining issues is their accurate absolute radiometric calibration, thereby accounting for the polarization sensitivity of the instrument.\nTo measure the linear polarization, the instrument is equipped with broadband sensors, so called Polarization Measurement Devices (PMDs). The polarization response of the spectral channels and the PMDs had been calibrated on ground, but comparison of in-flight data with model and other instruments revealed that those measurements may have been compromised or that the response changed from on ground to inflight conditions. In order to understand and monitor the instrument behavior, several statistical methods have been explored and evaluated. They make use of the in flight limb and nadir data and reference data from radiative transfer models and instruments such as GOME-2 and PARASOL. Triggered by the observed inconsistencies between on-ground and in-flight data, the on-ground measurements have been reanalysed at SRON. The resulting on-ground polarization sensitivities now show much better agreement with the data derived from in-flight. The results for the effective polarization response from various methods will be presented and compared with the old and new on-ground data sets.",

            "abstract": "The culmination of Scandinavian glaciers during the Late Glacial period (16-11 ka) has been connected to the Younger Dryas stadial (12.9-11.7 ka). Here we present a detailed geomorphic, chronologic and model reconstruction of LG and Holocene fluctuations of Rødhetta Glacier on the Island of Arnøya in Arctic Norway. Our comprehensive Late Glacial through Holocene 10Be mountain glacier moraine chronology indicates that the Late Glacial culmination occurred 14.1 ka ago, more than 1000 years prior to the onset of the Younger Dryas stadial. The Younger Dryas glacier advances, with an onset around 12.3 ka ago, were significantly smaller in amplitude than the earlier LG culmination, and Rødhetta Glacier slightly retreated through the Younger Dryas stadial with the final culmination 11.5 ka ago. No subsequent culminations took place during the Holocene until the Little Ice Age. Glacier modeling indicates an Equilibrium Line Altitude lowering compared to present-day (695 m a.s.l.) for the Late Glacial moraine sequence of ~220 m, for the Younger Dryas of ~130 m, and for the Little Ice Age of ~80 m. The most likely climate conditions during the moraine formation periods are represented by summer temperature coolings compared to present-day by Late Glacial ~3.2 °C, Younger Dryas ~1.9 °C, and Little Ice Age ~0.8 °C.\nWe show that this Late Glacial mountain glacier pattern of Arctic glacier culminations and retreat during the Late Glacial period and the Younger Dryas stadial is consistent with updated glacier records in the North Atlantic region. Recent 10Be moraine chronologies from the southern mid-latitudes are strikingly similar.",

The low-level horizontal winds, leading to topographic forced upward motion, are dynamically important for its occurrence. We further examine thermodynamic characters of the atmospheric environment which shallow orographic heavy rainfall may be linked to. Depth of heavy orographic rainfall decreases with relative humidity, in opposite to what were observed for convection over the tropical ocean. In contrast to transient and ubiquitous occurrence of convection over the tropical ocean, orographic convection occurs stationary and thus strongly stabilize their environment. Depth of heavy orographic rainfall decreases with the static stability of mid-troposphere, and therefore the static stability of mid-troposphere is inferred to inhibit cloud growth and promote cloud detrainment.",

HICO collects hyperspectral data from 0.35 to 1.08 µm thus excluding the SWIR vibrational overtone region of clays and carbonates. We are assessing the utility of HICO for detecting iron-bearing minerals and materials associated with playas and mapping their fractional abundance outside of the playa boundaries. Sites being investigated include the clastics-dominated Railroad Valley and Lunar Lake playas of Nevada, the evaporite-dominated Bonneville Salt Flats, and the acid-saline Lake Tyrrell of northwest Victoria, Australia. HICO, and supporting airborne hyperspectral datasets (AVIRIS and HyMap), are being converted from at-sensor radiance to surface reflectance using the FLAASH radiance transfer-based atmospheric correction software. Fe-bearing minerals and materials are determined through a standardized endmember detection approach using the commercial ENVI software and mapped using a variety of approaches including linear spectral mixture analysis, constrained energy minimization, and spectral feature fitting. Interpretations of remote data are guided by field-based observations and mapping. We are using the remote sensing data to assess the surface state of the playa (wet vs. dry, soft vs. hard). These factors have bearing in that dusts stripped from playa surfaces can affect nearby human communities and agricultural fields. Playas are also used for recreation and sometimes as transportation corridors and their physical state has important bearing for those functions. Assessing the types of minerals present has relevance for their impact as wind-entrained particulates that could have adverse effects on the health of humans, crops, or livestock.",

As the tectonic movement was controlled by three different plates, South China Sea basin has the colorful geological phenomenons and complex structure. From the point of its structural development history, South China Sea has its own unique development model, which is formed by the continent rifting and expansion, while the tectonic evolution has close relationship with geological peripheral units. According to the seismic detection and magnetic integrated geophysics, the studies found that high-speed lower crust layers are widespread in the northern South China Sea and the northeast of continental margin, these layers are mainly located in continental slopes and some high-degree tensional continental shelves. Researches suggested that materials of high-speed in lower crustal layers are formed by the bottom magmatic underplating rather than serpentinized mantle peridotite. These layers are formed in Cenozoic and has close relationship with extension. This study established a two-dimensional thermal - mechanical coupled finite element model to simulate the role of underplated magmatic bodies in the localization of deformation. Studies show that the deformation can be redistributed into a different region if the underplated magmatic bodies emplacement in multiple regions during the extensional process. Based on the numerical model behaviour in this study, we have discussed the microcontinent formations observed in the South China Sea.",

We identified major indicators for sustainable water use with considering multiple aspects of water use: not only physical, biological and chemical aspects but also social and environmental aspects. Furthermore, stressors for sustainable water use were of major interests because they were straightforward and easy to measure in comparison to indicators representing the state- and impact-related indictors. As a result, sustainability index was constructed with a theme-based hierarchical approach. It is comprised of two components of stress and response to sustainable water use and each component includes five sub-components of human water requirements, water quality requirements, 4) h, equitable water use and others. Then for each sub-component, multiple indicators, i.e., proxy variables were identified. For drainage basins in South Korea, standard hydrologic units with their total number of about 100 across the country, total 19 indicators were identified and their data from the various sources such as remote-sensing based datasets and survey-based national datasets were collected for current times. Then they were integrated to estimate the sustainability index with a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. At last, we evaluated sustainability index with focusing on the spatial variability of indices and indicators and the sensitivity of indices to individual indicators to better understand the sustainability of water use in Korea. In addition, we derived the indices with different MCDM methods to evaluate the sensitivity of index to various mathematical techniques.",

            "abstract": "The freshwater fraction of water that is derived from melted sea ice has increased significantly on the Chukchi shelf relative to runoff within the past decade, based upon analysis of salinity and δ18O mixing lines from a number of research cruises from 1993-2013. The shift to summertime dominance of melted sea ice (freshwater end-member δ18O >-10 per mil) relative to runoff occurred within the past ten years with a transition primarily observed from runoff dominance to sea ice melt after 2004. This shift is localized to the Chukchi shelf and does not reflect large amounts of melted sea ice flowing north through Bering Strait, which still largely transports a freshwater component with runoff origins (freshwater end-member δ18O ~-20 per mil). These observations have implications for understanding high latitude shelf biogeochemical cycling as melted sea ice carries much lower fractions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than runoff, allowing for greater light penetration, including through melt ponds in sea ice, and potential changes in productivity. Lower alkalinity and buffering capacity in melted sea ice compared to runoff will also increase the vulnerability of shelf organisms to water column acidification. Melted sea ice, with low DOC relative to runoff can dominate the freshwater budget in Chukchi shelf waters even under apparently continuous ice coverage. The higher transmission of light through melted sea ice with low DOC may be in part responsible for recent reported under-ice blooms on the Chukchi shelf. Since these blooms occur in waters with the freshwater budget dominated by melted sea ice, they can reasonably interpreted as being part of a continuum with other ice melt-associated blooms and not independent of sea ice retreat and dissolution.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we investigate up to what extent the spatial heterogeneity in the projected changes in DTR during the rest of the 21st century (under several emission scenarios) is explained by the regional variability in projected precipitation changes. DTR is indeed a suitable index of climate variability and change [1] and several studies have highlighted the existence of a negative correlation with both the cloud cover and the precipitation rate over land throughout last century [2]. Precipitation reduces DTR mainly by decreasing surface solar radiation through increased cloud cover and by increasing daytime surface evaporative cooling through increased soil moisture content. Whether or not these processes are captured in the current generation of global and regional models is matter of research.\nTo achieve our objective, we make use of the climate projections made available by the CMIP5 project as well as their historical runs, along with reanalysis and station data. At inter-annual timescale, the seasonal mean DTR simulated by an ensemble of CMIP5 models for the last decades shows a negative relationship over land with the simulated precipitation at zero lag. The correlation is globally very strong except during winter at higher latitudes. This corresponds well with the correlations observed in the re-analysis datasets. Some spatial variability in correlation strength is however noticeable between both datasets.\nConcerning the projected changes, the negative correlation between DTR and precipitation does not hold globally; no correlation or even positive correlations are observed in different climate regions, including Northern South America and Central Europe. Within this study we will further investigate the physical process that could explain this change in correlation sign as well as the reason why positive correlations are rarely observed or simulated at inter-annual timescale under current climate during summer and at lower latitudes during winter.\n[1] K.

            "abstract": "Regime diagrams are commonly employed in geophysical fluid dynamics to classify experimental results and, ideally, to define non-dimensional parameters that allow those results to be applied to natural systems. Petrologic experiments, in contrast, are typically run to mimic a specific natural system, and to infer conditions of magma storage, cooling or decompression. This approach has produced important insight into specific volcanoes, but the results are difficult to generalize. Additionally, very few experimental studies evaluate the vesiculation, crystallization and degassing histories of the same sample suite, an omission that is understandable given the time-consuming nature of the experiments and analysis, but which leaves important gaps in our general understanding of the interplay between gas exsolution, crystal formation and eruption dynamics.\nOne way to bridge these gaps is to construct a regime diagram for conditions of vesiculation and crystallization. As both are controlled by the effective supercooling experienced by the magma during cooling or decompression, one key parameter is supersaturation, although in practice, decompression rate (cooling rate) are commonly used as proxies for supersaturation. Vesiculation and crystallization are also modulated by diffusion (dependent on individual species and melt viscosity), which can be simply approximated by melt composition. Using these parameters and published data for water-saturated decompression experiments, the following fields can be (partially) defined: (1) non-equilibrium volatile exsolution, (2) equilibrium volatile exsolution, and (3) exsolution accompanied by crystallization. Melt compositions, volatile contents and crystal textures of natural samples can be measured, and thus related (crudely) to the regime diagram. Additional information required for fully linking experiments and volcanic pyroclasts includes phase proportions (crystallization efficiency), pyroclast textures (phase change conditions) and gas loss (closed- or open-system degassing). Although simplified, this approach helps to provide a kinetic framework for predicting threshold behaviors (such as transitions from explosive to effusive, or steady to pulsatory) that characterize volcanic activity.",

            "abstract": "Productivity hotspots are traditionally defined as concentrations of relatively high biomass compared to global reference values. These hotspots often signal atypical processes occurring in a location, and identifying them is a great first step at understanding the complexity inherent in the system. However, identifying local hotspots can be difficult when an overarching global pattern (i.e. spatial autocorrelation) already exists. This problem is particularly apparent in marine ecosystems because values of productivity in near-shore areas are consistently higher than those of the open ocean due to oceanographic processes such as upwelling. In such cases, if the global reference layer used to detect hotspots is too wide, hotspots may be only identified near the coast while missing known concentrations of organisms in offshore waters. On the other hand, if the global reference layer is too small, every single location may be considered a hotspot. We applied spatial and traditional statistics to remote sensing data to determine the optimal reference global spatial scale for identifying marine productivity hotspots in the Gulf of Maine. Our iterative process measured Getis and Ord’s local G* statistic at different global scales until the variance of each hotspot was maximized. We tested this process with different full resolution MERIS chlorophyll layers (300m spatial resolution) for the whole Gulf of Maine. We concluded that the optimal global scale depends on the time of the year the remote sensing data was collected, particularly when coinciding with known seasonal phytoplankton blooms. The hotspots found through this process were also spatially heterogeneous in size, with bigger hotspots in areas offshore than in locations inshore. These results may be instructive for both managers and fisheries researchers as they adapt their fisheries management policies and methods to an ecosystem based approach (EBM).",

            "abstract": "Oceanic flexure studies suggest that the long-term strength and effective elastic thickness, Te, of oceanic lithosphere increases with age due to thermal cooling. A recent study at trench – outer rise systems (Bry and White, 2007, JGR), however, has questioned whether such a relationship exists. In order to reassess this issue, we model trench-perpendicular, ensemble-averaged profiles of satellite-derived free-air gravity anomalies at the trench - outer-rise of circum-Pacific subduction zones. A broken elastic plate model is used with an inverse approach, in which we iterate for Te and invert for the applied vertical force and bending moment at the trench using damped least squares. We first model the profiles using a plate of constant Te. Results show that, to first order, oceanic lithosphere does indeed strengthen with age. However, there is scatter, which we attribute to variations in plate curvature and axial loading, and the effects of hotspot volcanism. Comparisons between our results and those of Bry and White reveal that the discrepancy can be explained by the different ways the two studies treat the regional long-wavelength gravity field, the position of the plate break and the applied bending moment. In many subduction zones, a constant Te plate cannot fully explain the amplitude and wavelength of the bulge and the high curvature of the outer trench slope. We therefore model the profiles with a plate that is allowed to weaken trenchward of the outer-rise. The weakening is attributed to inelastic yielding, evidence of which is manifest in swath bathymetry and seismicity data. In an attempt to constrain experimentally derived low temperature flow laws for olivine, we compare our inverted Te values with the predictions of viscoelastic-plastic yield strength envelopes derived from recently published flow laws. We test six flow laws, finding that Mei et al (2010, JGR) is too strong to fit our inverted Te values. This is in accordance with the findings of Zhong and Watts (2013, JGR), who modelled Hawaiian Island loading using a 3D multilayered viscoelastic plate, suggesting that their result maybe generally true for oceanic lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Wave breaking is the dominant physical process acting along beaches and coasts exposed to surface waves during storms, causing large gradients in wave momentum that generate strong currents in the nearshore zone. At the outer edge of the wave breaking region, strong horizontal current shear between the alongshore currents and alongshelf flows can develop and drive strong shear and mixing between these regions. Wave and current observations from a cross-shore array of six acoustic sensors in water depths of 2-11 m at Duck, NC, are used to elucidate the balance of momentum under storm wave conditions with wide surf zones, corresponding to offshore hurricanes. Offshore hurricanes that are distal (calm local wind) and proximal (local wind up to 25 m/s) generate large wave heights (3-5 m) and very strong alongshore currents (up to 2 m/s). We find that horizontal shear contributes strongly to momentum at the seaward limit of the surf zone and that radiation stress gradients, bottom stress, wind stress, mixing and advection play important roles at different times and locations in the cross-shore integrated momentum balance. The results provide insight into the cross-shore distribution of the alongshore current and the connection between alongshore flows inside the surf zone and outside it during major storms.",

            "abstract": "Biogeochemical reactions in rivers that decrease excessive loads of nutrients, metals, organic compounds, etc. are enhanced by hydrologic interactions with microbially and geochemically active sediments of the hyporheic zone. The significance of reactions in individual hyporheic flow paths has been shown to be controlled by the contact time between river water and sediment and the intrinsic reaction rate in the sediment. However, little is known about how the cumulative effects of hyporheic processing in large river basins. We used the river network model NEXSS (Gomez-Velez and Harvey, submitted) to simulate hyporheic exchange through synthetic river networks based on the best available models of network topology, hydraulic geometry and scaling of geomorphic features, grain size, hydraulic conductivity, and intrinsic reaction rates of nutrients and metals in river sediment. The dimensionless reaction significance factor, RSF (Harvey et al., 2013) was used to quantify the cumulative removal fraction of a reactive solute by hyporheic processing. SF scales reaction progress in a single pass through the hyporheic zone with the proportion of stream discharge passing through the hyporheic zone for a specified distance. Reaction progress is optimal where the intrinsic reaction timescale in sediment matches the residence time of hyporheic flow and is less efficient in longer residence time hyporheic flow as a result of the decreasing proportion of river flow that is processed by longer residence time hyporheic flow paths. In contrast, higher fluxes through short residence time hyporheic flow paths may be inefficient because of the repeated surface-subsurface exchanges required to complete the reaction. Using NEXSS we found that reaction efficiency may be high in both small streams and large rivers, although for different reasons. In small streams reaction progress generally is dominated by faster pathways of vertical exchange beneath submerged bedforms. Slower exchange beneath meandering river banks mainly has importance only in large rivers. For solutes entering networks in proportion to water inputs it is the lower order streams that tend to dominate cumulative reaction progress.",

            "abstract": "Ion cyclotron frequency range waves (or electromagnetic ion cyclotron wave, EMIC) have been often observed at Mercury’s magnetospheres. The previous statistical study showed the magnetic compressional component is dominant near the magnetic equator and the transition from compressional to transverse dominance occurs roughly at magnetic latitudes of ±20˚. Because the observed waves also often show linearly polarization, the field-line resonance in the single or multiple ion plasmas have been suggested to discuss such waves. On the other hand, electromagnetic ion Bernstein wave (IBW) is also suggested because of strong power of compressional component. In this talk, we will address both field-line resonance and electromagnetic IBWs in order to discuss the ULF waves detected from MESSENGER. We adopted 2D full-wave code that recently developed at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. When compressional fast waves are launched in the outer magnetosphere, the waves propagate to inner magnetosphere and strong field-aligned waves are mode-converted from the incoming compressional waves. Such mode-converted waves globally oscillate and have strong transverse components. Near the magnetic equator, due to mixture of incoming compressional waves and mode-converted field-line resonance, magnetic compressional component is dominant while transverse component is dominant off the equator, which is consistent with statistical study. We also used warm plasma ray-tracing to explore the propagation of the IBW mode in a dipole magnetic field and found that the electromagnetic IBWs are highly unstable to the proton loss cone distribution function and the wave's group velocity is highly field aligned. The wavelength of this mode is on the order of 100 km. We also discovered that as the waves propagate they can become highly compressional even in a moderate proton beta ~0.05 to 0.54 plasma, which is also consistent with observations.",

The Eocene swarm is located along the MAGIC seismic array (Crampton 2013). The phenocrysts and mantle xenocrysts within these volcanic rocks are the most direct constraints on the water content of the mantle in this region and will aid interpretation of geophysical data. In this study, we measured structural hydroxyl concentrations, [OH], in clinopyroxene (cpx) and olivine (ol) xenocrysts and cpx phenocrysts from three basaltic intrusions: Mole Hill, a volcanic neck, Trimble Knob, a diatreme, and Rt.631, a dike. Polarized FTIR spectra were obtained at JMU and the Smithsonian Institution. Mineral compositions were obtained on the electron microprobe at the USGS, Reston. The cpx xenocrysts show hydration profiles, whereas cpx phenocrysts have flat or dehydration profiles. Cpx xenocryst cores contain [OH]=25-300 ppm H2O and ol xenocrysts have [OH]<2 ppm. Cpx xenocryst rims contain [OH]=160-1300 ppm, and cpx phenocrysts have [OH]=100-570 ppm, and a cpx from Trimble Knob conservatively contains 1500-3500 ppm. Magmatic water contents calculated using O’Leary (2010) range from 0.3-4.9 wt% for xenocryst rims and phenocrysts, and >6 wt% at Trimble Knob. P and T were calculated using equilibrium exchange reactions from Putirka (2008). Xenocryst rims from Mole Hill have P=13.7±1.7 kbar and T=1287±24°C, and cpx phenocrysts from the Rt.631 dike record similar conditions of P=16.1±2.8 kbar and T=1339±37°C. A cpx phenocryst from Trimble Knob has P=23.8±4.0 kbar and T=1143±124°C. We interpret our data to indicate a dry lithospheric mantle as represented by the cpx and ol xenocrysts, underplated by a wet layer at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary produced by fractional crystallization of magma generated deeper in the asthenosphere, as represented by the cpx phenocrysts.",

            "abstract": "Observed axial morphology of Valu Fa (VF) and Eastern Lau (EL) (southern and central regions along the Lau back-arc spreading center) suggest that VF is more magmatically robust than EL despite EL spreading nearly twice as fast as VF. Early geochemical and geophysical studies showed a gradational decrease in subduction enhanced melting moving north from VF to EL. More recent geochemical and seismic observations detail a rapid stepwise decrease in subduction influence and melt production as the spreading center axis sweeps away from the Tofua Volcanic-Arc. As the ridge sweeps away from the volcanic-arc, the influence of the slab hydrated mantle in the melting structure of the ridge decreases. Furthermore, EL produces an anomalously thin crust for a robust spreading center. While 2-D numerical studies show a decrease in subduction influence and melting going from VF to EL, they have difficulty explaining the thinning of EL’s crust.\nTo understand the geophysical observations, we implement the effects of 3-D flow and slab hydration in three numerical experiments. The first model with no slab hydration shows that observed geometric and surface kinematic boundary conditions cause a steep northward gradational increase in relative melting (anhydrous) with increasing spreading rate. A peak in the relative melting appears particularly close to EL where crust is shown to be thinnest resulting from a northwestern along axis mantle flow from slower spreading VF to the faster spreading ELSC. These predictions run in opposition to the observations. The second model including a viscosity reduction in the mantle wedge due to slab hydration causes a subdued relative melting increase with spreading rate and a “saddle” shaped decrease in relative melting north of 20.9°S. This saddle shaped melting structure is caused by a reversal in along axis flow towards the southeast. Mantle is driven from below EL towards the lower viscosity region beneath VF, accounting for the thin crust observed at EL. Finally, introducing a direct hydration of the wedge in the third model increases the melt production under VF and causes a stepwise decrease in melt production at EL due to its decreased proximity to the slab-hydrated region and its position above the saddle point in melt production, consistent with geophysical observations.",

This suggests that climate models need to simulate the degree of organization of convection, and not just the mean precipitation and convective fluxes, in order to fully represent interactions between convection and larger scales. In this study, we use five years of CloudSat-CALIPSO cloud profiles alongside TRMM rainfall, geostationary IR data, ERA-Interim water vapor, and other observations to investigate the relationship between vertical cloud distributions and the SCAI aggregation index. We find that there is a significant decrease in anvil cloud (and in cloudiness as a whole) and increase in shallow cumulus as aggregation increases (for a given precipitation rate). There are also greater variations in most cloud fractions and types when varying SCAI for a given precipitation than when varying precipitation for a given SCAI.",

Due to limited parameterization of the complex interactions between fertilizer usage, farm practices, soil and meteorological conditions, ammonia emission estimates for agricultural fertilization over China, one of the most important ammonia emission sources, are usually based on time-averaged emission factors and temporal profiles. Here we develop a process-based ammonia emission model for fertilize use at fine spatial and temporal scales in support of air quality models. The model estimates NH3 emissions based on the parameterization of crop acreages, fertilizer application rates, plant growth period, fertilizer use patterns, soil processes, and meteorological conditions. Preliminary results show that the total ammonia fertilizer emission in China was approximately 3.8 Tg in 2006 with peak emissions during April to June. The regions with the highest emission rates are located in Central China. We also examine the sensitivities of different parameters on NH3 emission estimates. We found that the magnitude of NH3 emissions is most sensitive to fertilizer application rates while the seasonality of emissions is more sensitive to fertilization time.",

It is considered to be a fragment of heterogeneous Jurassic lithosphere that records tectono-magmatic and alteration histories similar to those documented along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), such as at the 15°20’N area and the Atlantis Massif at 30°N. Structural and petrological studies on these rocks provide constraints on metamorphic/deformation processes during formation and hydrothermal alteration of the Jurassic oceanic lithosphere. We present a petrological and geochemical study of serpentinization processes and fluid-rock interaction in the Bracco-Levanto ophiolitic complex and compare these to published data from modern oceanic hydrothermal systems, such as the Lost City hydrothermal field hosted in serpentinites on the Atlantis Massif. Major element and mineral compositional data allow us to distinguish a multiphase history of alteration characterized by: (1) widespread Si-metasomatism during progressive serpentinization, and (2) multiple phases of veining and carbonate precipitation associated with circulation of seawater in the shallow ultramafic-dominated portions of the Jurassic seafloor, resulting in the formation of ophicalcites. In detail, regional variations in Si, Mg and Al content are observed in zones of ophicalcite formation, indicating metasomatic reactions and Si-Al transport during long-lived fluid-rock interaction and channelling of hydrothermal fluids. Rare earth element and isotopic analysis indicate that the Si-rich fluids are derived from alteration of pyroxenes to talc and tremolite in ultramafic rocks at depth. Comparison with serpentinites from the Atlantis Massif and 15°20’N indicates a similar degree of Si-enrichment in the modern seafloor and suggests that Si-metasomatism may be a fundamental process associated with serpentinization at slow-spreading ridge environments. However, in contrast to metasomatic processes at the MAR, we find no geochemical evidence for a gabbroic source of the fluids, and thus, processes leading to Si-rich fluids can be variable in these environments.",

Although variability in ice-sheet volume is inferred from as early as ~40 Ma using proxies such as Mg/Ca ratios of benthic foraminifer, the location and spatial extent of Antarctic ice-sheet lobes cannot be deduced from such data. The use of neodymium (Nd) isotopes in bulk marine sediments as a provenance tracer can however provide insight into these questions, serving as a connection between the marine and terrestrial realms.\n We present new bulk-sediment Nd isotopic data from a well-dated Eocene-to-Oligocene section recovered from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 318 Site U1356, located proximal to the Antarctic continent on the East Antarctic margin. Sediment at this location is predominantly terrigenous material, and bulk Nd analysis reveals the provenance of sediment and hence the geological location of the most active ice erosion. A total of 90 samples were analysed that span the Eocene and Oligocene sections at Site U1356, with 45 of these samples targeting a ~500kyr window to study orbitally-paced changes in ice dynamics (<10kyr resolution).\n\nLow-resolution Eocene and Oligocene Nd isotope results reveal (i) two distinct baseline Nd isotopic values separated by two epsilon units (-14.1 and -12.0), and (ii) an abrupt shift between these values at the transition from the late Eocene to the early Oligocene. While this change is likely related to a provenance change associated with continental scale ice expansion on Antarctica, short-term fluctuations during the Oligocene point to an alternation of the same two source areas at precessional (~20kyr) and long-eccentricity (400kyr) periodicities. These results indicate that systematic Nd isotope variations in detrital marine sediments from the Antarctic margin can be used as a tool to link proximal records of ice sheet dynamics with the global record of climate change from the deep sea.\n ",

We present\nsimultaneous observations of these radio bursts from the STEREO A, B and WIND spacecraft at low frequencies, located at different vantage points in the ecliptic plane. Using these stereoscopic observations, we\ndetermine the directivity of these complex radio bursts. We estimate the angles between the directions of the magnetic field at the sources and the lines connecting the source to the spacecraft (viewing angles) by assuming that the sources are located on the Parker spiral magnetic field lines emerging from the associated active regions into the spherically symmetric solar atmosphere. We estimate the normalized peak intensities of these bursts (directivity factors) at each spacecraft using their time profiles at each spacecraft. These observations indicate that the complex type III bursts can be divided into two groups: (1) bursts emitting into a very narrow cone centered around the tangent to the magnetic field, and (2) bursts emitting into a wider cone. We show that the bursts , which are emitted along the tangent to the spiral magnetic field lines at the source are very intense, and their intensities steadily fall as the viewing angles increase to higher values. We have developed a ray tracing code and computed the distributions of the trajectories of rays emitted at the fundamental and second harmonic of the electron plasma frequency. The comparison of the observed emission patterns with the computed distributions of the ray\ntrajectories indicate that the intense bursts visible in a narrow range of angles around the magnetic field directions probably are emitted in the fundamental mode, whereas the relatively\nweaker bursts visible to a wide range of angles are probably emitted in the harmonic mode.",

Based on social scientific insights from project Advisor, Suzanne Moser, and others, ETOM aimed to avoid “climate porn” scare tactics and over-used footage, and to enlist a diverse group of “messengers” in addition to Alley. An important design criterion was to give equal time to clean energy solutions while pulling no punches as to the consensus findings of leading climate scientists. With the ETOM project now completed and final reports submitted to NSF, what results can be shared to inform future efforts? And how did ETOM compare in audience impact with other major media efforts such as Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth” or Showtime’s more recent “Years of Living Dangerously”? Results reported draw on the external evaluation by Rockman Et Al, and include both quantitative and qualitative data. Key findings are the importance of including Texan ranchers enthusiastic about wind power alongside Navy Admirals adamant that climate change is human-caused and Marines implementing solar energy to reduce casualties incurred while transporting fossil fuels. In-person presentations by Alley and others at science centers served as de facto focus groups for scripting the TV programs, along with actual focus groups convened by Rockman. The 3rd program, ENERGY QUEST USA, documented 5 quite different communities, from Alaska to Forth Worth, Baltimore, Portland and Kansas, all using competition, local values, and economic incentives to move ahead. Might a more political approach have generated larger audiences? Perhaps, but at the cost of generating materials that have proven potential for long-lived use in both secondary and tertiary education.",

            "abstract": "Large, general education courses are important to the geoscience community. These courses serve as valuable recruiting tools for future geoscience majors because over 55% of geoscience students select their major in the first two years of college (Wilson, 2013). These courses can have many challenges such as large class sizes, limited (or no) laboratory time and facilities, little financial resource support, non-permanent faculty, and a variety of student abilities and needs. High impact practices, such as writing courses, student research, and community service can be difficult to integrate into large, non-major courses. Student-produced audio (e. g. podcasts) provide one approach to providing high impact practices within these courses. Other researchers have found student produced audio to be effective at transmitting content, integrating place based experiences, and building community connections within the students. Here I present the implementation of student-created audio within a large (100+), general education course (AST 30 – Mission to the Planets) over the last 4 years called ‘Telescopic Topics.’ Activities scaffold the students through the semester where they select a topic on planetary science, work with the science reference librarian, visit the writing center, and record their podcast at campus student radio station. The top podcasts are then aired on the campus radio station during the news broadcasts through a rotating series. Surveys of student experiences find that student find the activity valuable and engaging. Students reported feeling less intimidated by the science content and more connected to the subject matter. In addition, it provides many of them with their first introduction to and use of the university library and associated campus resources.",

            "abstract": "The present study investigates the structural failure conditions of uniformly rotating bifurcated asteroids with cohesion due to a static spin-up. We apply a newly derived technique (Hirabayashi and Scheeres, submitted) that probes the failure state of an asteroid. The technique determines an upper bound condition for structural failure of a slice normal to the minimum moment of inertia axis. The detailed study of these failure modes for cohesive, rotating rubble pile asteroid is motivated by recent observations of 'active asteroids,' bodies which are seemingly disintegrating and fissioning due to their rapid spin rates (Jewitt et al. 2013, 2014; Hirabayashi et al. 2014).\nFigure 1 shows the shape of 4486 Mithra. We compare 3 slices, slices 1 and 3 including the knobs and slice 2 being the neck (Fig. 1), to determine a more precise condition for structural failure. Figures 2 and 3 describe the limit of friction angle with cohesion of 0 Pa and 500 Pa, respectively. The narrow solid, dashed, and dotted lines give the limits of slices 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The bold solid lines indicate the limit of the total volume, i.e., the whole volume reaching the failure point, and that of the partial volume, i.e., the most sensitive condition among the slices. The shadowed areas show the structurally stable regions.\nThe results show that Mithra’s failure locations change as a function of its spin periods and cohesion. For the cohesionless case, the knobs are more sensitive to structural failure than the neck at a spin period ranging from 3.8 hr to 4.8 hr, while the neck fails first at other spin periods. For the 500 Pa cohesion case, the limits of friction angle shift to higher spin periods. Also, at higher spin periods, we find that a lower friction angle is sometimes stronger than a higher friction angle. This comes from the fact that under constant cohesion a lower friction angle can give wider stable regions below the yield envelope.\nOur study reveals that there exits a diversity of possible structural failure modes of Mithra as its geophysical properties. This implies that if a detailed pre and post failure model of an asteroid can be determined, this could give strong constraints on its internal structure. In the presentation, we will also consider (25143) Itokawa, (4769) Castalia, and (8567) 1996 HW1.",

            "abstract": "The Si cycle was dramatically different in the Precambrian ocean due to the absence of marine Si-secreting organisms. Precambrian Si isotopic compositions were largely controlled by chemical precipitation of Si, input of Si with different isotopic compositions (e.g., continental versus hydrothermal sources) and later alteration and diagenetic processes associated with silicification. In Precambrian banded iron formations (BIFs) and chert deposits there is an over 4‰ spread of Si isotopes (δ30Si), which stands in marked contrast to the narrow range (<0.5) measured in igneous rocks, highlighting the potential of using Si isotopes to reconstruct those processes that controlled the Precambrian marine Si cycle. However, unequivocal interpretations of Si isotope compositions measured in Precambrian Fe-Si rich sediments is hampered by a lack of understanding of Si-isotope fractionation factors associated with formation of these sediments and subsequent diagenetic processes. This study experimentally investigates Si isotope fractionation during the formation of Fe-Si co-precipitates, and between aqueous Si and Fe-Si co-precipitates. All experiments are conducted in an artificially prepared medium that mimics Archean seawater (e.g. Si: ~60 ppm), rather than in a simple Fe-Si solution, because previous studies have revealed distinct Fe isotope fractionation behaviors in artificial Archean seawater (AAS) compared to simple solutions. One set of experiments investigated oxidation of Fe2+ in the AAS at room temperature, which produced amorphous Fe-Si precipitates. Preliminary results show that δ30Si values of Fe-Si co-precipitates are ~2‰ lower than the initial AAS (Δ30Siprecip-AAS = -2.13 ± 0.18‰ (2σ)). A second set of experiments trace Si-isotope exchange between aqueous Si (AAS) and Fe-Si co-precipitates in an anaerobic chamber, using a 29Si spike (i.e. three-isotope method). The results of these experiments will form a basis for reliable interpretations of Si isotopes recorded in Precambrian sediments.",

            "abstract": "Climate change has accelerated glacial retreat in high altitude glaciated regions of Peru leading to the growth and formation of glacier lakes. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) are sudden events triggered by an earthquake, avalanche into the lake or other shock that causes a sudden outflow of water. These floods are catastrophic because of their sudden onset, the difficulty predicting them, and enormous quantity of water and debris rapidly flooding downstream areas. Palcacocha Lake in the Peruvian Andes has experienced accelerated growth since it burst in 1941 and threatens the major city of Huaraz and surrounding communities. Since the 1941 flood stakeholders have advocated for projects to adapt to the increasing threat posed by Palcacocha Lake. Nonetheless, discussions surrounding projects for Palcacocha have not included a rigorous analysis of the potential consequences of a flood, probability of an event, or costs of mitigation projects. This work presents the first step to rationally analyze the risks posed by Palcacocha Lake and the various adaptation projects proposed. In this work the authors use decision analysis to asses proposed adaptation measures that would mitigate damage in downstream communities from a GLOF. We use an existing hydrodynamic model of the at-risk area to determine how adaptation projects will affect downstream flooding. Flood characteristics are used in the HEC-FIA software to estimate fatalities and injuries from an outburst flood, which we convert to monetary units using the value of a statistical life. We combine the monetary consequences of a GLOF with the cost of the proposed projects and a diffuse probability distribution for the likelihood of an event to estimate the expected cost of the adaptation plans. From this analysis we found that lowering the lake level by 15 meters has the least expected cost of any proposal despite uncertainty in the effect of lake lowering on flooding downstream.",

            "abstract": "We report the first results from an observing campaign in support of the VAULT2.0 sounding rocket launch on September 30, 2014. VAULT2.0 is a Lya (1216Å) spectroheliograph capable of 0.3” (~250 km) spatial resolution. The objective of the VAULT2.0 project is the study of the chromosphere-corona interface. This interface has acquired renewed emphasis over the last few years, thanks to high-resolution observations from Hinode/SOT and EIS instruments and the Lya imaging from the two VAULT flights. The observations have shown that the upper chromosphere may play a more important role in heating the corona and in affecting EUV observations that previously thought: (1) by supplying the mass via Type-II spicules and, (2) by absorbing coronal emission. Many of the required clues for further progress are located in sub-arcsecond structures with temperatures between 10000 and 50000 K, a regime not accessible by Hinode or SDO. Lyman-alpha observations are, therefore, ideal, for filling in this gap.\nThe observing campaign in support of the VAULT2.0 is closely coordinated with the Hinode and IRIS missions to study the mass/energy flow from the chromosphere to the corona with joint observations of type-II spicules, and the magnetic connectivity of coronal loops using the full imaging and spectral capabilities of IRIS, Hinode and SDO. Several ground-based observatories also provide important observations (IBIS, BBSO, SOLIS).\nThe VAULT2.0 project is funded by the NASA LCAS program.",

            "abstract": "Mantle melt depletion is fundamental to stabilization of thick lithospheric mantle and to craton formation and survival. Three potential mechanisms to grow lithospheric mantle are: partial melting of upwelling mantle plumes; imbrication and accretion of oceanic lithosphere at subduction zones; and flux melting of the mantle wedge at volcanic arcs. Stable isotopes can distinguish these models because stable isotopes fractionate substantially at low temperature, making the mantle sensitive to the incorporation of subducted material. Correlations between stable isotopes and trace elements can then distinguish seafloor weathering processes from flux melting processes, allowing subducted oceanic lithosphere to be discerned from flux-melted lithosphere. We find that indices of melt depletion (e.g. cpx Cr#, Yb concentrations and Mg#) in xenoliths from the Colorado Plateau correlate with δ18O values of olivine. Xenoliths from The Thumb volcanic neck have δ18Ool values ranging from +5.05 to +5.50‰ (n=12) that correlate positively with indices of melt depletion, and xenoliths from the Green Knobs diatreme have δ18Ool values that range from +4.85 to +5.36‰ (n=9) and correlate negatively with indices of melt depletion. These trends may reflect coupled fluid input and melt depletion, typical of flux melting. The different trends at each locality may be due to fluxing of different fluids- either high δ18O fluids derived from altered oceanic crust or low δ18O fluids derived from recycled serpentinite. Canil and Lee (2009) interpreted correlations between whole rock δ18O values and MgO/SiO2 in xenoliths from The Thumb to be due to seafloor weathering and Mg loss of abyssal peridotites followed by later accretion of the rocks to the Colorado Plateau lithosphere. However, chrome and alumina are immobile during seafloor weathering, so correlations between δ18O values and Cr# also present in The Thumb xenoliths are inconsistent with seafloor weathering. Evidence for flux melting is consistent with the results of Selverstone et al. (1999), who found that the constituent terranes of the Colorado Plateau are accreted arcs. Stable isotope analyses of older SCLM peridotites may help distinguish lithospheric mantle formation mechanisms in other cratons and constrain the timing of onset of modern plate tectonics.",

            "abstract": "To assess the impacts of human water use and trade on water balances, we estimate virtual water flows for counties in the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes basin. This is a water-rich region, but one where ecohydrological ‘hotspots’ are created by water scarcity in certain locations (Mubako et al., 2012). Trade shifts water uses from one location to another, causing water scarcity in some locations but mitigating water scarcity in other locations.\nA database of water withdrawals was assembled to give point-wise withdrawals by location, source, and use category (commercial, thermoelectric power, industrial, agricultural, mining). Point-wise consumptive use is aggregated to the county level, giving direct, virtual water exports by county. A county-level trade database provides import and export data for the various use categories. We link the annual virtual water exported from a county for a given use category to corresponding annual trade exports. Virtual water balances for each county by use category are calculated, and then compared with the renewable annual freshwater supply.\nPreliminary findings are that overall virtual water balances (imports - exports) are positive for almost all counties, because urban areas import goods and services that are more water intensive than the exported goods and services. However, for some agriculturally-intensive counties, the overall impact of virtual water trade on the water balance is close to zero, and the balance for agricultural sector virtual water trade is negative, reflecting a net impact of economic trade on the water balance in these locations. We also compare the virtual water balance to available water resources, using annual precipitation less evapotranspiration as a crude estimate of net renewable water availability. In some counties virtual water exports approach 30% of the available water resources, indicating the potential for water scarcity, especially from an aquatic ecosystem standpoint.",

Polycrystalline quartz aggregates have been synthesized from natural milky quartz powders (ground to 5 µm) by HIP methods at T = 1000oC, Pc = 1.5 GPa and t = 24 hours, resulting in dense, fine-grained aggregates of uniform water content of ~4000 ppm (H/106Si), as indicated by a broad OH absorption band at 3400 cm-1. In experiments performed at 800o and 900oC, grain sizes of the samples are essentially constant over the duration of each experiment, though grain shapes change significantly, and undulatory extinction and deformation lamellae indicate that much of the sample shortening (to 50%) is accomplished, over the four strain-rate steps, by dislocation creep. Differential stresses measured at T = 800oC decrease from 160 to 30 MPa as strain rate is reduced from 10-4.6 to 10-5.5 s-1, and a stress of 140 MPa is measured when strain rate is returned to 10-4.5 s-1. Samples deformed at 1000o and 1100oC experience normal grain growth, with grain boundary energy-driven grain-coarsening textures superposed by undulatory extinction and deformation lamellae. Differential stresses measured at 1000oC and strain rates of 10-3.6, 10-4.6, and 10-5.5 s-1 are 185, 80, and 80 MPa, respectively, while an increased flow stress of 260 MPa is measured (following ~28 hours of prior high temperature deformation and grain growth) when strain rate is returned to 10-3.6 s-1. While all samples exhibit lattice preferred orientations, the stress exponent n inferred for the fine-grained 800oC sample is 1.5 and the stress exponent of the coarse-grained 1000oC sample is between ~3 and 4. Our value for n of fine-grained quartz samples (and previously reported values of n < 3 for quartz aggregates with added water) may attest to a component of diffusion creep and grain boundary sliding that accompanies dislocation creep.",

These techniques were originally proven effective in Antarctica using moderate spatial resolution (30 m/pixel) Advanced Land Imager (ALI) data, and showed great successes in identifying even minor variations in composition throughout the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) [Salvatore et al., 2013]. However, due to the orbital inclination of the Earth Observing-1 spacecraft, ALI is unable to image the central and southern TAM, making comparable studies at comparable resolutions impossible on a continental scale. Fortunately, the WorldView-2 satellite (DigitalGlobe, Inc.) boasts high-resolution (2 m/pixel) multispectral capabilities, with 8 spectral bands located between 427 nm and 908 nm, and is able to image the entirety of the TAM through off-nadir pointing capabilities. This provides the ability to continue our remote spectral mapping campaign throughout the TAM to identify compositional variations in support of past and future field operations.\nWe present an updated map of relative spectral variability (RSV) in the vicinity of Shackleton Glacier. This mapping product consists of 91 individual WorldView-2 images, each corrected to top-of-atmosphere radiance and parameterized to highlight known compositional properties. The mapped area covers approximately 17,850 square kilometers of ice-covered and exposed terrain. Compositional variations are easily mapped, and small-scale variations in iron-bearing mineralogy are particularly well resolved. We also describe our updated atmospheric correction algorithm for the WorldView-2 dataset, which utilizes in-scene techniques to derive surface reflectance and does not necessitate the use of radiative transfer modeling. Our technique is validated using laboratory reflectance measurements. In conjunction with the Polar Rock Repository at the Ohio State University, we have measured hundreds of individual samples in an effort to verify and “ground-truth” this atmospheric removal algorithm. Using these methodologies and revised techniques, our objective is to make a fully calibrated and atmospherically corrected spectral map of the central TAM available to the scientific community.",

            "abstract": "Garnet is one of the most important minerals controlling partitioning of U and Th in the upper mantle. U is redox sensitive, while Th is tetra-valent at redox conditions of the silicate Earth. U-series disequilibria have provided a unique tool to constrain the time-scales and processes of magmatism at convergent margins. Variation of garnet/meltDU/Th with fO2 is critical to understand U-series disequilibria in arc lavas. However, there is still no systematic experimental study about the effect of fO2 on partitioning of U and Th between garnet and melt.\nHere we present experiments on partitioning of U, Th, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, and REE between garnet and silicate melts at various fO2. The starting material was hydrous haplo-basalt. The piston cylinder experiments were performed with Pt double capsules with C-CO, MnO-Mn3O4 (MM), and hematite-magnetite (HM) buffers at 3 GPa and 1185-1230 oC. The experiments produced garnets with diameters > 50μm and quenched melt. Major elements were measured by EMPA at ETH Zurich. Trace elements were determined using LA-ICP-MS at Northwestern University (Xi’an, China) and SIMS (Cameca1280 at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Beijing, China), producing consistent partition coefficient data for U and Th.\nWith fO2 increasing from CCO to MM and HM, garnet/meltDU decreases from 0.041 to 0.005, while garnet/meltDTh ranges from 0.003 to 0.007 without correlation with fO2. Notably, garnet/meltDTh/U increases from 0.136 at CCO to 0.41 at HM. Our results indicate that U is still more compatible than Th in garnet even at the highest fO2 considered for the subarc mantle wedge (~NNO). Therefore, we predict that if garnet is the dominant phase controlling U-Th partitioning during melting of the mantle wedge, melts would still have 230Th excess over 238U. This explains why most young continental arc lavas have 230Th excess. If clinopyroxene is the dominant residual phase during mantle melting, U could be more incompatible than Th at high fO2 because increasing fO2 can increase clinopyroxene/meltDTh/U by more than two magnitudes (Lundstrom et al. 1994). In this case, in-growth melting of the mantle can produce 238U excess over 230Th observed in the oceanic arc lavas.",

            "abstract": "Non-volcanic tremors (NVTs) are observed in transition zones between freely slipping and locked sections of faults, and in particular along subduction zones. Since 2001 NVTs have also been recorded in the Cholame segment of the San Andreas fault, where the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (BSL) provides origin location and duration estimates for observed events. Due to their deep location below the seismogenic zone (i.e., about 15-35 kilometers), they have the potential to serve as substitutes for the lack of earthquakes, providing us with insights into the deep crust and its stress conditions.\nOur first analysis of the BSL NVT catalogue showed that, similarly to the Gutenberg-Richter law for earthquake magnitude, the number of events in different duration classes of NVTs in this region follows a power law. Subsequently, using a spectral analysis technique, we sought to derive a magnitude scale for the tremors based on their radiated energy, Me, as typically applied to earthquakes. In order to obtain sufficiently low noise levels across a broad range of frequencies we used the BSL High Resolution Seismic Network (HRSN), a borehole network with high sensitivity seismometers. We use the entire duration of the tremor signal (e.g., 3-21.5 min), assuming that it originates at the source provided by the BSL. Analysis of the obtained Fourier spectra for more than 3000 events reveal distinct sets of NVT: Some with stronger, and some with weaker high-frequency falloff. Due to the absence of a correlation with propagation distance, we speculate that this effect must be related to either the source or recording site. The independence of the effect from the recording stations strongly suggests a source effect. We first present preliminary results of the magnitude scaling of NVTs and its relation to duration. We then discuss possible explanations for the significant distinction between the different types of tremors.",

            "abstract": "Ephemeral streams are an important but little studied resource in the American Southwest. Many streams in arid and semi-arid regions are ephemeral (e.g. 89% of western US), only flowing in response to rainfall, and the distribution of these streams is likely to increase in a changing climate. Given the hydrologic variability and additional water present in ephemeral stream systems, decomposition rates are likely to vary as a function of stream flow presence and soil-water presence.\nHere we examine how different types of litter decompose across a climate gradient in Arizona with a range of ephemeral, intermittent to perennial streams. We used a space for time substitution and deployed common gamble oak and sycamore litterbags at three replicate reach transects at 13 sites in Arizona over an 18-month period. Within each of these sites, we deployed little bags in channel, riparian, and channel landscape positions for (1100 total litter bags). We measured soil-water presence and stream flow days with electrical resistivity sensors.\nCumulative rainfall ranged from 9 to 38 cm across the sites whereas cumulative stream flow presence varied dramatically across the sites, from 11 to 433 days over the 18-month deployment. As expected, rates of decomposition were higher in channels than riparian and upland positions at sites with higher soil-water and stream flow presence and slower for oak compared to sycamore leaves. Eighty-six of the oak compared to seventy four percent of the sycamore mass was remaining after 180 days. Cumulative days of soil –water presence and stream flow associated with each site were positively related to rates of decomposition of litter located in channels suggesting that changes in streamflow and soil-water presence associated climate change will have large effects of rates of nutrient release via the process of decomposition.",

During 2012 to 2013, more than one hundred of sediment related disasters including landslides occurred especially in the settlement area. The damage was particularly severe in the city and at several sites along the transportation network. The sediment related disasters resulted of hundreds houses destroyed, including 43 deaths, numerous injured people and hundreds people evacuated. Rainfall threshold method is an approach for develop a warning system for sediment related disasters occurence. Two types of rainfall thresholds can be established (Aleotti, 2004): (1) empirical thresholds, based on historic analysis of relationship rainfall/landslide (sediment related disaster) occurrence, and (2) physical thresholds, based on numeric models that take into account the relationship between rainfall, pore pressure and slope stability by coupling hydrologic and stability models. Empirical thresholds were used in this study. Empirical threshold has been considered as collecting rainfall data for sediment related disaster events from 2007 to 2013. The results show that the sediment related disasters occurred in short periods (2 hours) with a high average intensity and longer periods (48 hours) with a lower average intensity. We determined new rainfall thresholds for possible sediment related disaster occurrence with the regression value of I = 83.88D-0.80 (I is rainfall intensity, mm/hr and D is duration, hr). It is expected that the new rainfall thresholds could be used for the development of a warning system in Ambon city.",

            "abstract": "Many of the energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) observed by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) are created in the inner and outer heliosheath regions, where the plasma is in a non-equilibrium state with properties that can be extracted from the IBEX ENA data. The energy distribution of the plasma is a composite of a thermal core, and a high energy non-thermal tail that can be described by a power-law with the index kappa. Interstellar dust grains with sizes 0.03-2.0 microns are contained in the flow of interstellar material through the heliosphere. These grains have reached the inner heliosphere only after traversing the magnetized plasmas of the inner and outer heliosheath regions, where impacts with ions and electrons control the grain charge and therefore the grain gyroradius and trajectory. Many studies of grain charging in the heliosheath regions exist, including 3D models that predict spatial distributions of grains of different masses from the grain charge, and models that set limits on the magnetic field strength in heliosheath regions based on observed grain mass. These studies were performed before IBEX measured the energy distribution of the heliosheath plasmas. In the heliosheath, grains are charged by the emission of secondary electrons after collisions with plasma particles, including electrons and ions, in addition to the photoejectron of electrons and other minor processes. We will present new models of dust grain charging in the non-equilibrium inner and outer heliosheath plasmas using the plasma energy distribution obtained from IBEX ENA data and theoretical models of the non-equilibrium electrons. Implications of this study for grain trajectories and the interstellar magnetic field strength will be discussed.",

The main objective of this study was to better understand factors influencing fAPAR, its relationship with seasonal variation in canopy greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)), and the consequences of potential seasonal changes in the NDVI- fAPAR relationship for light-use efficiency model calculations of ecosystem photosynthesis in a semi-arid grassland. We used two approaches to determine fAPAR, (i) incoming and outgoing radiance measurements above and below the canopy, and (ii) an inversion approach based on incident photosynthetically active radiation and the light response curve of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) measured by eddy covariance at low light levels. The two approaches resulted in fAPAR values that were very strongly correlated during the initial development of the canopy until peak leaf area index (LAI) was reached. A strong linear relationship also occurred between fAPAR and NDVI, based on reflectance measurements made along a tram system above the grassland canopy during initial LAI development. After peak LAI, there was hysteresis in the NDVI- fAPAR relationship. Light-use efficiency model calculations of ecosystem photosynthesis made using fAPAR values were strongly correlated with chamber CO2 exchange measurements during the initial development of the canopy leaf area. After peak LAI, a relative stress function, based on either soil moisture or vapour pressure deficit (VPD) measurements, was necessary to reduce quantum yield and model calculations of ecosystem photosynthesis during periods of relatively low soil moisture and higher VPD later in the growing season. Both stress functions were similarly effective in improving the correlation between modeled and measured ecosystem photosynthesis values.",

            "abstract": "Subduction is often reported to be difficult to initiate, yet in the West Pacific and Eastern Indonesia there are many young subduction zones. Few theoretical or modelling studies consider such settings in which subduction commonly began close to boundaries between ocean crust and thickened crust of arc or continental origin.\nIn Eastern Indonesia there are subduction zones at different stages of development. Some young examples such as the Banda Arc developed by propagation of an existing trench into a new area by tearing, probably along an ocean-continent boundary. This ‘solves’ the problem since the older subducted slab provides the driving force to drag down unsubducted ocean lithosphere. However, similar explanations cannot account for other subduction zones, such as North Sulawesi, nearby examples in which the subducted slab is not yet at 100 km depth, or troughs where subduction appears to be beginning.\nThese examples show that subduction initiated at a point, such as a corner in an ocean basin, where there were very great differences in elevation between land and adjacent ocean floor. Depression of ocean crust by flow of arc/continent crust is associated with granitic magmatism and detachments within the upper crust. Once the oceanic corner reaches depths of c.100 km, eclogite formation may lead to slab pull that causes the new subduction zone to grow in both directions along strike; arc magmatism may or may not begin.\nThe close relationship between subduction and extension in Eastern Indonesia links dramatic elevation of land, exhumation of deep crust, and spectacular subsidence of basins imaged by oil exploration seismic and multibeam data. Exhumed granites and high-grade metamorphic rocks at elevations up to 3 km, separated by Neogene alluvial sediments from carbonate reefs now at depths of 2 kilometres, imply vertical movements of several kilometres in a few million years. These observations raise the question of whether subduction is driving extension or vice versa.",

Since precipitation is known to have high uncertainty, analysis of the influence of the E-P field on the model-data misfit will provide insight into that field’s strengths and weaknesses. Comparing the Aquarius measurements to results from the 1/12.5-degree Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HyCOM) output provides further information on the representation of temporally short and spatially small features, and longer time-scale averages of seasonal and annual cycles. A better understanding of the connections between these features and the modeled counterparts provides a framework for including these data into a complete HyCOM-based reanalysis.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, Colorado has experienced a significant rise in oil and gas development with the greatest concentration of activity occurring in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJB) in the Northeast corner of the state. According to the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, as of June 2014, there are approximately 52,200 active oil and gas wells statewide, with over 21,300 located in Weld County, the epicenter of the DJB. In this water-scarce region, much attention is paid to the source and quantity of water being used to produce energy. This information is not readily accessible, but is of great importance to many. In response, our research team is undertaking an evaluation of water quantity impacts and tradeoffs associated with oil and gas development.\nTechnological advancements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing require additional sources of water - about 2.8 million gallons of per well (Goodwin et al.). The statewide water use for hydraulic fracturing is estimated to be less than 0.1%; however, on a local scale, when water is transferred from agricultural and municipal uses to industrial use, there are economic, environmental and social tradeoffs. Unfortunately, the pathway of a particular water transfer and its associated tradeoffs can be difficult to predict and quantify, further complicating the ability of local and state stakeholders to make sound and informative decisions about energy development. Energy companies are implementing new strategies to ensure reliable water supplies for their operations. These include tapping into non-tributary aquifers to help reduce competition for fully appropriated surface and tributary groundwater sources and recycling and reusing wastewater that results from the drilling and extraction practices.\nMany conflicting perspectives shape the water-energy discussion in the DJB so non-biased scientific data plays an important role in addressing the questions surrounding water use for energy development. This presentation will address the data gathered through the National Science Foundation Sustainability Research Network AirWaterGas Project (http://airwatergas.org/) and its contribution to the dynamic conversation about the changing uses of limited water resources in Colorado.",

            "abstract": "Deep ocean carbonate chemistry is inherently linked to atmospheric CO2 concentration, a fundamental driver of glacial-interglacial climate change. Deep ocean carbonate ion concentration ([CO32-]), carbon isotope ratio (δ13C), and sediment CaCO3% impose crucial constraints on the carbonate system throughout glacial cycles, providing important indicators of why atmospheric pCO2 shifted between strict upper and lower bounds. We present the first medium to high resolution deep ocean [CO32-] records that span more than one full glacial cycle, extending to MIS 12, in a number of key locations such as the South Atlantic, Central Pacific, and Indian Oceans. In the South Atlantic Ocean, at 3702m, our results show unprecedented glacial-interglacial [CO32-] increases of 40-50 μmol/kg that are preceded by a positive shift in δ13C. Coupled with deglacial [CO32-] peaks in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and a steady decrease in South Atlantic [CO32-] and δ13C during glaciations, our results strongly support suggestions that atmospheric CO2 was stored in the stratified glacial deep ocean and released during reinvigoration of ocean circulation.\nThe ocean circulation driven response of deep South Atlantic [CO32-] is reproducible over successive glacial cycles, however this is not replicated in the Pacific Ocean. Deep Equatorial Pacific [CO32-] gradually increased by 25 μmol/kg throughout glaciation from MIS 5 - MIS 2. However, during the MIS 7 - MIS 6 transition, [CO32-] increased by 15 μmol/kg in less than 20Kyr and remained unchanged during a further ~80Kyr of atmospheric pCO2 decline. This highlights the requirement for long term [CO32-] records to fully constrain carbonate system influences on atmospheric pCO2. Even a small rise in Deep Pacific Ocean [CO32-] could increase glacial CO2 storage further than changes in ocean circulation alone.",

            "abstract": "Pitch-angle scattering coupled with drift-shell splitting in an asymmetric magnetic field can give cyclotron-drift and bounce-drift cross diffusion terms in the radiation belt Fokker-Planck equation. More specifically, cyclotron-resonant pitch-angle scattering coupled with pitch-angle dependent second and third adiabatic invariants gives rise to non-zero DML and DKL cross diffusion coefficients (where M is the first invariant, K is the usual geometric bounce invariant, and L is the Roederer L-shell), plus an additional “anomalous” contribution to the radial diffusion coefficient, DALL [O’Brien, GRL, 2014]. In this paper we describe calculations of these additional terms and we present solutions of the corresponding radiation belt Fokker-Planck equation. The DML, DKL, and DALL diffusion coefficients are calculated assuming a Tsyganenko 1989 magnetic field model and a chorus wave model from Shprits et al. [JGR, 2011] that includes dayside and nightside chorus waves. Solutions to the corresponding Fokker-Planck diffusion equation are obtained using the REM diffusion code, which uses stochastic differential equation (SDE) methods to solve the fully 3-D diffusion equation in adiabatic invariant coordinates. One of the advantages of the SDE methods is that off-diagonal diffusion tensor terms are easily incorporated and the resulting phase-space densities are always non-negative. Initial results show that the new drift-shell splitting contributions are stronger for electrons of a few hundred keV near geosynchronous orbit, with associated changes in MeV electron phase-space densities over a range of L-values and at later times.",

            "abstract": "The Antarctic Peninsula has been warming at an anomalously high rate with respect to other parts of the globe for the past 115 years. The increased atmospheric and ocean warmth has caused both increased precipitation and loss of buttressing near the trunks of the numerous outlet glaciers that drain into the ocean. The measurements by space gravimetry (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment or ‘GRACE’) have been crucial to identifying the dominant role of losses in butressing in a decadal-scale total ice mass budget for the Peninsula north of about 69 °S. One of the major losses of butressing came at a time when the Larsen B Ice Shelf catastrophically disintegrated into the northernmost Weddell Sea in March of 2002, the same month that GRACE was launched into orbit. The solid Earth rebounded in phase with the speed-up of the unbutressed outlet glaciers as evidenced by GNSS station data. The process has been repeating itself throughout the northern Peninsula since the late 1980’s. Larsen A Ice Shelf breakup (LAISb) occurred, for example, in the Austral summer of 1993. Rott et al. (2011) have estimated a velocity acceleration at the trunks of 11 LBISb outlet glaciers for which flux-gate mass transport can be measured. Butress loss caused an increase in discharge of 4.3 ± 1.6 Gt/a in 2008, relative to measurements that span 1995-1999 for 11 Larsen B feeding glaciers. GRACE analysis centers have now released 12 years of monthly solutions (RL05) for global mass change. Solutions for the region of the Peninsula north of 69 ° S (Graham Land) using both constrained and unconstrained mascon methods show 2003-2011 net ice loss to the oceans with a trend of greater than 32 Gt/yr (Ivins et al., 2011; Luthcke et al., 2013). A new set of mascon solutions developed by JPL (Wiese et al., 2014) provide a high-resolution look at the evolution of mass in the Antarctic Peninsula from 2003-2014. We employ a time-series from these solutions and discuss the evolution of mass changes over the past 12-150 years, the GNSS uplift rates and the GIA correction that can be retrieved from modeling. The solutions for Graham Land yield a trend of -29.8 ± 4.8 Gt/yr using a GIA correction of 6.9 ± 1.0 Gt/yr. We infer that much of this mass loss began at least 50 years ago, and we attempt to quantify this ice mass history as it drives a substantial viscoelastic flow in the mantle.",

            "abstract": "The Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) was launched in 2009, with a primary mission to better understand net fluxes of carbon dioxide on regional scales. However, this effort has been hampered not only by uncertainties and biases in the satellite retrievals of column-mean CO2 concentrations (XCO2), but also issues on the inverse modeling side into which the measurements are fed to derive fluxes. These issues include transport model errors, incorrect or unfairly constrained prior fluxes, and issues related to the inversion scheme itself (such as temporal window length in EnKF systems).\nIn this work, we avoid the full global inversions and explore the idea that existing GOSAT observations can help evaluate land-surface carbon flux through direct comparison with forward model simulations. In this work, we compare forward model simulations of several biosphere models to GOSAT observations from the Atmospheric Carbon Observations from Space (ACOS) retrieval system. These include two versions of the Simple Biosphere (SiB) model, the Carnegie-Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model, and the Organizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE) model. We provide evidence that large model-data differences tend to be driven by differences in the assumed net surface fluxes rather than from transport model errors. Tropical land fluxes, poorly sampled by the in-situ network, can exhibit significant differences when compared to the satellite observations and point to the possibility that these satellite data could help drive direct improvements to the land carbon flux models.",

            "abstract": "Calderas in the southern Stillwater Range (SSR) and Clan Alpine Mountains (CAM) were formed during the mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flareup and subsequently tilted (40->90°) by large-magnitude extension. New geologic mapping, geochemistry, and 40Ar/39Ar and SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dating document 2 periods of magmatism resulting in 4 nested calderas and related granitoid plutons in sections up to 10 km thick. The first period included pre-caldera rhyolite lava domes (30(?) Ma), ~5 km of pre- and post-collapse intermediate lavas and rhyolite tuff that filled the Job Canyon caldera (~29.4 to 28.8 Ma), and the >4-5 km thick, geochemically similar IXL pluton (28.9±0.4 Ma) that intruded the Job Canyon caldera. The second period included pre-caldera rhyolite lava domes and dikes (~25.5 Ma) and 3 ignimbrite units in 3 calderas: tuff of the Louderback Mountains (low-silica rhyolite; ≥600 m thick; ~25.2 Ma); tuff of Poco Canyon (high-silica rhyolite; up to 4.3 km thick; 25.27±0.05 Ma); and ≥2000 km3 tuff of Elevenmile Canyon (trachydacite to rhyolite; up to 4.5 km thick; 25.12±0.01 Ma). The composite Freeman Creek pluton (granite, 24.8±0.4 Ma; granodiorite, 25.0±0.2 Ma) and Chalk Mountain rhyolite porphyry (25.2±0.2 Ma) and granite (24.8±0.3 Ma) plutons intruded the Poco Canyon and Elevenmile Canyon calderas. Early (30 Ma) rhyolites have the least radiogenic compositions (Sri~0.7040), whereas other units are relatively homogeneous (Sri~0.7050, ENd~0.0). Oxygen isotope compositions for SSR and CAM calderas are highly variable (d18Oquartz=5.6-8.2‰, d18Osanidine=5.5-7.0‰, d18Ozircon= 4.1-6.3‰), corresponding to a magmatic range of 5.7-7.9‰. U-Pb dating of zircons indicates homogeneous age populations and few/no xenocrysts and antecrysts. These data show that (1) thick plutons (>2-5 km) underlie compositionally and temporally related caldera-filling ignimbrites, (2) caldera-forming cycles are isotopically variable, requiring divergent magmatic sources in relatively focused (space and time) magmatic episodes, (3) caldera magmas have a strong mantle affinity and overlap isotopically (Sr, Nd, and O) with regional Late Cenozoic basalts, and (4) silicic magmatism replaced the Mesozoic crust to depths >5 to 10 km, radically altering the crustal profile in the western Nevada Great Basin at ~30-25 Ma.",

            "abstract": "The Galileo probe’s measurement of a uniform enrichment of Jupiter’s atmosphere in volatiles, including noble gases, relative to a gas of solar composition has proven to be a challenge to models of planet formation. This uniform enrichment requires that Jupiter accreted planetesimals with solar ratios in all elements, except for hydrogen and helium. Given the very low temperatures needed to achieve such compositions if all elements behaved chemically as pure substances, efforts have focused on understanding how extremely volatile elements could be physically incorporated into ices and organics at low temperatures. Two primary methods for incorporation of these volatiles have emerged: formation of clathrate hydrates and trapping of gases during the formation of amorphous ice. These modes for incorporating volatiles make different predictions about the amount of water that would be contained within Jupiter, an issue that will be addressed by the Juno Mission.\nEither mode for incorporating volatiles will reveal details about the dynamical behavior of ices during planet formation and the environments in which planetary materials were formed. For example, Ciesla (2014) showed that amorphous ice formation, and thus trapping of volatiles in this manner, can occur as water molecules are photodesorbed and freeze-out again on grain surfaces, thus requiring high UV flux environments at the birth of the solar system or significant vertical lofting of grains in the disk by turbulence. I will review the conditions that are required for amorphous trapping and clathrate hydrate formation to have occurred in the solar nebula and discuss the implications for the compositions of the other giant planets and cometary bodies, as well as the relation of these materials to the sources of volatiles on terrestrial planets.",

The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change established the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” among nations, signaling the recognition that industrialized nations who had produced the lion’s share of historic emissions bore particular responsibility for avoiding dangerous interference with the climate system. But climate responsibilities can be distributed in other ways as well. This talk focuses on the scientific, historical and ethical basis for considering the climate responsibilities of the major fossil energy companies that have produced and marketed the coal, oil and natural gas whose use largely drives global warming, often while investing in efforts to discredit the scientific evidence and prevent policies that would encourage a transition to low-carbon energy. Earth scientists and scientific societies who rely on financial support from these companies have an opportunity to consider what ethical stance they might take to align their research, scientific understanding and values.",

But while the Wikipedia definition says such problems are “impossible” to solve, not even to try will lead to certain failure. “Earth: The Operators’ Manual” (ETOM) was an NSF-funded informal science education project with 3 hour-long TV programs appearing on PBS in 2011 and 2012, along with live presentations by series host, Penn State’s Richard Alley, and others at 5 major science centers. Uniquely among climate change programming, ETOM gave equal time to identifying solutions along with climate science, and made all its materials freely available via YouTube. Formal and informal science educators can register to download HD videos for classroom and outreach use, and signups have ranged from middle schools to 4-year colleges. Building on the success of the series and Alley’s companion tradebook of the same name, Penn State working with Coursera invited Alley to develop a MOOC entitled “Energy, The Environment and Our Future” that similarly combined the essential science along with clean energy solutions. The course reached more than 30,000 students in the first semester of 2014. More recently the ETOM team has partnered with the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) to develop “READ for the EARTH,” an NSF EAGER project, offering campuses the opportunity to adopt Alley’s book, the ETOM videos (including “How To Talk To An Ostrich”), NCSE’s\nwww.CAMELclimatechange.org\nweb site and other resources for both formal and informal uses. Some campuses have used the book with honors classes, and some are exploring adapting ETOM as a first year reading experience for all freshman. Our presentation will share reactions to the MOOC, to the pilot phases of “READ for the EARTH” and present both qualitative and quantitative results. Some of the most interesting of the latter include EDA (electrodermal activity) data comparing real-time responses to viewing one of the ETOM videos contrasted with discussion and lecture formats at a university level. Attendees will be invited to participate in “READ” and to utilize the “evergreen” version of the 2014 MOOC through “InTeGrate” (\nwww.serc.carleton.edu/InTeGrate\n.)",

            "abstract": "We have used 7 years of in-situ magnetic and and particle data from the CAPS and MIMI instruments onboard the Cassini spacecraft to study Saturn’s magnetopause boundary throughout the mission. In addition to the solar wind dynamic pressure, we find that magnetopause size is also strongly modulated by changing conditions inside the magnetosphere for which the usual scaling law (stand-off distance versus dynamic pressure) cannot account. At a fixed dynamic pressure, the stand-off distance can vary by 10-15 Saturn radii (Rs) depending on the plasma pressure inside the magnetosphere. We have quantified the variability in stand-off distance as a function of both dynamic pressure and interior plasma beta, both of which show considerable variability at Saturn. We modify the power law that is usually used to specify the size of a magnetosphere as a function of dynamic pressure by adding an additional dependency on plasma beta. We have also fitted empirical surfaces, using both 'old' and 'new' power laws, to observed magnetopause crossings. To describe the magnetopause shape and scale, we have used the original analytical form of Shue et al. (1997), as modified by Pilkington et al. (2014) to incorporate polar flattening. Using the new power law reduces the discrepancy between where the boundary is observed and where the model predicts it should be by ~1Rs on average, which is ~20% of the typical r.m.s. deviation between observed and modelled location. Hence, the internal variation in plasma beta strongly influences the magnetopause location at Saturn and, presumably, must also be taken into account for Jupiter and other magnetised planets with strong internal plasma sources.",

            "abstract": "The water storage capacity in the Earth’s deep interior and its transport between reservoirs is in part dependent upon the stability of high-pressure phases of hydrous minerals. Prediction of mineral stability in the Earth's mantle is dependent upon accurately calculating the Gibbs free energy of each phase as a function of pressure, temperature, and composition. Contributions from crystallographic disorder to the configurational entropy can extend the stability field of minerals at high temperatures. In certain hydrous and anhydrous aluminum and magnesium silicates such as ringwoodite, some degree of disorder is favored at mantle pressure and temperature conditions. This study constrains the water storage capacity of the mantle by examining the effects of cation disorder on the structure and energetics of hydrous and anhydrous aluminum and magnesium silicates (kyanite, topaz-OH, phase egg, phase D, and δ-AlOOH) as a function of Si and Al coordination. We present the energetics of disorder at mantle pressure and temperature conditions from static lattice energy minimizations using interatomic potentials and complementary first-principles calculations coupled with modeling of configurational entropy. This work assesses the applicability of the aluminum avoidance principle in high-pressure hydrous aluminosilicates.",

            "abstract": "In the taiga-tundra ecotone (TTE), vegetation structure change can be subtle and site-dependent, yet occur across broad scales. Recent remote sensing studies have highlighted the degree to which vegetation structure in the TTE can be characterized with spaceborne remote sensing at the plot-scale. These studies demonstrate the fundamental uncertainty of space-based local-scale vertical structure measurements that are available across broad scales and provide the opportunity to understand regional variation in detailed vegetation characteristics. Patch-scale analyses of vegetation structure provide a means to examine vertical structure and horizontal patch form, their association with landscape characteristics, and a basis for examining the variation of change in patch characteristics across sites. In this study we delineate forest patches in study sites along the TTE in northern Siberia with high resolution (0.5 - 3m) spaceborne imagery (HRSI) and attribute patches with tree cover and spectral data from Landsat 7, backscatter power from ALOS PALSAR and canopy height data based on a HRSI-derived digital surface model and ICESat-GLAS ground elevation. We examine the uncertainty of forest patch height from this suite of spaceborne medium and high resolution optical, radar, and LiDAR data. Results demonstrate the potential and limits of spaceborne estimates of patch-scale forest height whose differences are often small, biophysically relevant, and subject to variable rates of change across the broad-scale of the circumpolar TTE.",

            "abstract": "Ultraslow spreading ridge makes up about 25% of global mid-ocean ridge length. Previous studies believed that hydrothermal activity is not widespread on the ultraslow spreading ridge owing to lower magma supply. Southwest Indian ridge (SWIR) with the spreading rate between 1.2cm/a to 1.4cm/a, represents the ultraslow spreading ridge. In 2007, Chinese Cruise (CC) 19th discovered the Dragon Flag deposit (DFD) on the SWIR, which is the first active hydrothermal field found on the ultraslow spreading ridge. In recent years, over 10 hydrothermal fields have been found on the SWIR between Indomed and Gallieni transform faults by the Chinese team. Tao et al. (2012) implied that the segment sections with excess heat from enhanced magmatism and suitable crustal permeability along slow and ultraslow ridges might be the most promising areas for searching for hydrothermal activities. In 2014, CC 30thdiscovered five hydrothermal fields and several hydrothermal anomalies on the SWIR.\nDragon Horn Area (DHA). The DHA is located on the southern of segment 27 SWIR, with an area of about 400 km2. The geophysical studies indicated that the DHA belongs to the oceanic core complex (OCC), which is widespread on the slow spreading ridges (Zhao et al., 2013). The rocks, such as gabbro, serpentinized peridotite, and consolidated carbonate were collected in the DHA, which provide the direct evidence with the existence of the OCC. However, all rock samples gathered by three TV-grab stations are basalts on the top of the OCC. A hydrothermal anomaly area, centered at 49.66°E，37.80° S with a range of several kms, is detected in the DHA. It is probably comprised of several hydrothermal fields and controlled by a NW fault.\nNew discovery of hydrothermal fields. From January to April 2014, five hydrothermal fields were discovered on the SWIR between 48°E to 50°E during the leg 2&3 of the CC 30th, which are the Su Causeway field (48.6°E, 38.1°S), Bai Causeway field (48.8°E, 37.9 °S), Dragon Well West field (49.6°E, 37.8°S), Dragon Well East field (49.8°E, 37.8°S), and Landing Stage field (51.0°E, 37.5°S), respectively.",

            "abstract": "Water is ubiquitous on Earth and plays a fundamental role in all aspects of biogeochemical cycling. Our existence on an aqua planet hampers our ability to interpret a planet like Mars where it may not have rained for a billion years. Soils from the hyperarid core of Chile's Atacama Desert may represent the closest geochemical analog to Martian soils, as this region has the lowest precipitation on Earth. The extreme lack of rainfall (a few mm per decade) limits both weathering and biological activity to the point where soils are effectively sterile. Oxidized end products of atmospheric chemistry such as nitrate and perchlorate build up to values approaching those measured on Mars by NASA's Phoenix Lander. In June 2012, we collected soil samples from 8 locations along an aridity gradient from the hyperarid core of the Atacama (rainfall < 1 mm/yr) towards the arid (5-100 mm/yr) surrounding areas where microbial community activity is sufficient to support the hardiest of desert plant species. Field observations indicate that microbial activity and geochemical heterogeneity are anti-correlated. We will present our quantitative results coupling geochemical heterogeneity (salt concentrations, org C/N, trace metals) and microbial community activity (TRFLP, nitrogen cycling) along this transect, and argue that geochemical heterogeneity (which could be measured by a rover or lander on Mars) may be a proxy for lifeless soils.",

            "abstract": "Solar energetic particles or SEPs from suprathermal (few keV) up to relativistic (~few GeV) speeds are accelerated near the Sun in at least two ways, namely, (1) by magnetic reconnection-driven processes during solar flares resulting in impulsive SEPs and (2) at fast coronal-mass-ejection-driven shock waves that produce large gradual SEP events. Large gradual SEP events are of particular interest because the accompanying high-energy (>10s MeV) protons pose serious radiation threats to human explorers living and working outside low-Earth orbit and to technological assets such as communications and scientific satellites in space. However, a complete understanding of SEP events has eluded us primarily because their properties, as observed near Earth orbit, are smeared due to mixing and contributions from many important physical effects. Thus, despite being studied for decades, several key questions regarding SEP events remain unanswered. These include (1) What are the contributions of co-temporal flares, jets, and CME shocks to impulsive and gradual SEP events?; (2) Do flares contribute to large SEP events directly by providing high-energy particles and/or by providing the suprathermal seed population?; (3) What are the roles of ambient turbulence/waves and self-generated waves?; (4) What are the origins of the source populations and how do their temporal and spatial variations affect SEP properties?; and (5) How do diffusion and scattering during acceleration and propagation through the interplanetary medium affect SEP properties observed out in the heliosphere? This talk describes how during the next decade, inner heliospheric measurements from the Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter in conjunction with high sensitivity measurements from the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe will provide the ground-truth for various models of particle acceleration and transport and address these questions.",

            "abstract": "The Oil Sand Region (OSR) of North-Central Alberta exists within the sub-humid Boreal Plains (BP) ecozone, with a slight long-term moisture deficit regime. Despite this deficit, the BP is comprised of productive wetland and mixed wood (aspen and conifer dominated) forests. Reclamation activities are now underway at a large number of surface mining operations in the OSR, where target ecosystems are identified, soil prescriptions placed and commercial forest species planted. Some watersheds have been created that now contain wetlands. However, recent work in the BP suggests that over time wetlands supply moisture for the productivity of upland forests. Thus, water use of reclaimed forests is going to be critical in determining the sustainability of these systems and adjacent wetlands, and whether in time, either will achieve some form of equivalent capability that will allow for certification by regulators.\nA critical component in the success of any reclamation is that sufficient water is available to support target ecosystems through the course of natural climate cycles in the region. Water Use Efficiency (WUE), which links photosynthesis (GEP) with water use (Evapotranspiration (ET)), provides a useful metric to compare ecosystems and evaluate their utilization of resources. In this study, 41 site years of total growing season water and carbon flux data over 8 sites (4 reclamation, 4 regeneration) were evaluated using eddy covariance micrometeorological towers. WUE shows clear discrimination among ecosystem types as aspen stands assimilate more carbon per unit weight of water than conifers. WUEs also change with time as ecosystems become more effective at transpiring water through plant pathways compared with bare-soil evaporation, which allows an assessment of ability to limit water loss without carbon uptake. In addition, clonal rooting systems allow aspen forests to recover quicker after disturbance than reclamation sites in terms of their WUE. For reclamation sites, there is considerable variability in GEP and ET associated with vegetation establishment, with enhanced ET losses over-riding any significant changes in C uptake, suggesting that long-term mine water management must consider ecosystem pathways if down-gradient wetlands and end-pit lakes are to be sustained.",

Temperatures recorded at mid-lake buoys indicate the date of annual summer stratification is arriving earlier and surface temperatures are increasing. In this study, we use a realistically configured, 3D model of Lake Superior to characterize the exchange of nearshore waters with offshore waters and evaluate the hypothesis that warmer coastal waters, transported offshore, contribute to warming the surface waters of the central lake basin. There are relatively few studies on Superior’s circulation and it is unclear how long nearshore waters remain along the coast, an important timescale influencing the lake’s water quality and biogeochemistry. Preliminary results indicate that nearshore waters have months-long residence time in select locations along the southern coast where coastline and bottom slope seem to favor sluggish circulation. Nearshore-offshore exchange occurs rapidly when counterclockwise coastal circulation sets in during the summer stratified period. We assess the contribution of this exchange to lake-wide surface temperatures and biogeochemistry.",

            "abstract": "The spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity K highly influences flow and solute transport in the subsurface. The estimation of the spatial distribution of K in heterogeneous aquifers with an adequate resolution and support scale is therefore one of the major challenges in hydrogeology and still seems to be unsolved. Even though direct measurements of K with modern methods reveal the distribution with typically high vertical resolutions, they still are scarce and local. Therefore, K is mostly inferred from measurements of quantities depending on K, such as hydraulic heads monitored during hydraulic tests and tracer test data. Conventional approaches, such as the type-curve approach for pumping tests, fail in estimating the spatial distribution of K, since they are based on the assumption of homogeneity. Even if data from multi-well pumping tests are analyzed, they always will yield different effective parameters. In contrast, tomographic techniques originally derived for geophysical surveying can be transferred to hydraulic applications and are much better suitable to derive K distributions. In this presentation, we will show results of the project “Tomographic Methods in Hydrogeology” in which we focused on the development of geostatistical methods for the inversion of tomographic data sets of different types (hydraulic testing, heat and ERT-monitoring of salt tracer tests) and the development and improvement of such experimental techniques. Based on selected examples we will present our developments related to the joint geostatistical inversion of tomographic data sets, its efficient parallelization, and its application to a 3D-inversion of tomographic thermal tracer tests. Related to the acquisition of tomographic data sets, we discuss different aspects of the field application of hydraulic tomography, the development of tracer-tomographic methods using heat as tracer, and efficient salt-tracer techniques with a ERT-based salt-tracer monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Warming climate may cause permafrost regions to become stronger sources of C due to increased decomposition or fire. However, the dynamics of soil C storage in subarctic peatlands—one of the largest sinks of high-latitude soil C—potentially complicate this hypothesis for two reasons: (1) Warming may increase C storage, presumably as productivity in temperature-limited regions is enhanced by longer growing seasons relative to losses from decomposition. (2) Regional climatic effects on C accumulation may be mediated by local processes, such as peatland development (e.g., bog vs. fen, permafrost vs. no permafrost) and associated differences in moisture and attendant response of fires to moisture. We examined 13 peat cores spanning the Holocene across a continental gradient in moisture/seasonality, from the Canadian continental interior (permafrost plateau bogs in Manitoba) to eastern coastline (unfrozen bogs along the southern boundary of permafrost in Labrador). We used 90 AMS 14C dates, percent carbon, and bulk density measurements to estimate sedimentation and C accumulation rates. Macroscopic charcoal was used to determine local fire severity. Macrofossil analysis was conducted to determine historical changes in the plant community and peatland type. The effects of past climatic changes depend on peatland development and moisture. Sites in Labrador were classified as wet, poor fens for much of their history, and fires were practically nonexistent. C accumulation rates were greatest during the Holocene Thermal Maximum and lower during more recent Neoglacial cooling. In contrast, C accumulation in Manitoba sites appeared to be greatest during initial wetter fen phases and slower during subsequent, drier bog phases. Fire was more common and severe in Manitoba during the bog phases, and the combination of drier bogs and fire slowed C accumulation rates during the HTM, thereby making C storage less sensitive to past climate. These results suggest that in regions that are potentially less moisture limited, C accumulation rates are high and may be sensitive to regional climatic changes. However, in drier regions, or where peatlands transitioned early from fen to bog, the combination of lower productivity and increased fire may constrain C accumulation response to regional climate.",

            "abstract": "The productivity of Amazon rainforest is constrained by the availability of nutrients, in particular phosphorus (P). Deposition of transported African dust in boreal winter and spring is considered an important nutrient input for the Amazon Basin, though its magnitude is not well qunatified. This study provides a remote sensing observation-based estimate of dust deposition in the Amazon Basin using a 7-year (2007-2013) record of three dimensional (3D) distributions of aerosol in both cloud-free and above-cloud conditions from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). It is estimated that the 7-year average of dust deposition into the Amazon Basin amounts to 15.1 ~ 32.1 Tg a-1 (Tg = 1012 g). This imported dust could provide 0.012 ~ 0.025 Tg P a-1 or equivalent to 12 ~ 26 g P ha-1 a-1 to fertilize the Amazon rainforest, which largely compensates the hydrological loss of P. The CLAIOP-based estimate agrees better with estimates from in-situ measurements and model simulations than what has been reported in literature. The closer agreement benefits from a more realistic geographic definition of the Amazon Basin and inclusion of meridional dust transport calculation in addition to the 3D nature of CALIOP aerosol measurements. The trans-Atlantic transport and deposition of dust shows strong interannual variations that are found to correlate with the North Atlantic Oscillation index in the winter season and anticorrelate with the prior-year Sahel Precipitation Index on an annual basis. Uncertainties associated with the estimate will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Secondary eyewall formation (SEF) is widely recognized as an important research problem in the dynamics of mature tropical cyclones. It has been shown that the development of the wind maxima in SEF occurs within the boundary layer and that it follows a chain of events initiated by a substantial radial expansion of the tangential wind field. In this context, there is not yet a consensus on the phenomenon’s essential physics. It has been proposed that the boundary-layer dynamics of a maturing hurricane vortex is an important controlling element in SEF. However, recent literature also argues that hurricane boundary layers and the related coupling with the interior flow can be described through an Ekman-like balance and that shock-like structures are relevant in the swirling boundary layer of the inner core of mature storms.\nWe analyze the radial and vertical structure of the specific forces and accelerations in in the boundary layer in a mature hurricane that includes a canonical eyewall replacement cycle. The case occurred in a mesoscale, convection-permitting numerical simulation of a tropical cyclone, integrated from an initial weak mesoscale vortex in an idealized quiescent environment. The simulation has been studied extensively in the literature. We find that momentum advection is almost everywhere important (some of it is associated with asymmetric eddies). We discuss the implication of our findings on the proposed importance of Ekman-like balance dynamics during SEF. Finally, our analysis does not support the recently proposed idea that the radial advection of radial momentum, and shock-like structures, are closely related to the supergradient wind phenomena observed during SEF.",

            "abstract": "The accuracy and comparability of airborne hygrometers remains under debate often only reaching ±10% under static lab conditions or even >±30% in flight. This often limits atmospheric models as well as other species sensors which need to be corrected for water vapor dilution or cross sensitivity. Further challenges come from the huge dynamic range (2–40000 ppmv), the strong spatial gradients (up to several 1000 ppmv/s). and the difficult and error-prone calibration processes, very often without any direct links to the accurate global metrological water vapor scales, which are defined via national primary humidity generators.\nTo fill this gap and provide “traceable”, i.e. metrologically validated, airborne hygrometers we developed the Selective Extractive Airborne Laser Diode Hygrometer, SEALDH, which uses dTDLAS with a special, calibration-free data evaluation to circumvent the need for frequent field calibrations and to ensure high accuracy and comparability by a holistic data quality assurance concept in combination with extensive metrological validations at national primary standards. Thus SEALDH-II can be used in a calibration-free field sensor mode (with an absolute, metrologically defined uncertainty of 4.3% +- 3ppmv). The response time is mainly limited by the gas flow and significantly below 1 sec, yielding precision down to 0.08 ppmv (1σ, 1sec) measured at 600 ppmv and 1000 hPa. Its excellent long-term stability, <1% over 18 months, and the metrologically validated range from 5 to 30 000 ppmv makes it also well suited as a hygrometric field transfer standard. SEALDH-II has been recently operated without any failures for over 50 hours on several airborne science missions (DENCHAR, AIRTOSS-I, and AIRTOSS-II). In addition SEALDH participated in the representative, international comparison AquaVIT‑II.\nThe performance during these missions and the value of a traceability will be demonstrated and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Enceladus is a new world for Astrobiology. The Cassini discovery of the icy plume emanating from the South Polar region indicates an active world, where detection of water, organics, sodium, and nano-particle silica in the plume strongly suggests that the source is a subsurface salty ocean reservoir. Recent gravity data from Cassini confirms the presence of a regional sea extending north to 50°S. An ocean habitat under a thick ice cover is perhaps a recurring theme in the Outer Solar System, but what makes Enceladus unique is that the plume jetting out into space is carrying samples of this ocean. Therefore, through the study of Enceladus’ plumes we can gain new insights not only of a possible habitable world in the Solar Systems, but also about the formation and evolution of other icy-satellites. Cassini has been able to fly through this plume – effectively sampling the ocean. It is time to plan for future missions that do more detailed analyses, possibly return samples back to Earth and search for evidence of life. To help prepare for such missions, the need for earth-based analog environments is essential for logistical, methodological (life detection) and theoretical development. We have undertaken studies of two terrestrial environments that are close analogs to Enceladus’ ocean: Lake Vida and Lake Untersee – two ice-sealed Antarctic lakes that represent physical, chemical and possibly biological analogs for Enceladus. By studying the diverse biology and physical and chemical constraints to life in these two unique lakes we will begin to understand the potential habitability of Enceladus and other icy moons, including possible sources of nutrients and energy, which together with liquid water are the key ingredients for life. Analog research such as this will also enable us to develop and test new strategies to search for evidence of life on Enceladus.",

            "abstract": "Ice melt from mountain glaciers can represent a significant contribution to freshwater hydrological budgets, along with seasonal snow melt, rainfall and groundwater. In the rivers of High Asia, understanding the proportion of glacier ice melt is critical for water resource management of irrigation and planning for hydropower generation and human consumption. Current climate conditions are producing heterogeneous glacier responses across the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayan ranges. However, it is not yet clear how contrasting glacier patterns affect regional water resources. For example, in the Upper Indus basin, estimates of glacial contribution to runoff are often not distinguished from seasonal snow contribution, and vary widely, from as little as 15% to as much as 55%. While many studies are based on reasonable concepts, most are based on assumptions uninformed by actual snow or ice cover measurements. While straightforward temperature index models have been used to estimate glacier runoff in some Himalayan basins, application of these models in larger Himalayan basins is limited by difficulties in estimating key model parameters, particularly air temperature. Estimating glacial area from the MODIS Permanent Snow and Ice Extent (MODICE) product for the years 2000-2013, with recently released Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTMGL3) elevation data, we use a simple ablation gradient approach to calculate an upper limit on the contribution of clean glacier ice melt to streamflow data. We present model results for the five major rivers with glaciated headwaters in High Asia: the Bramaputra, Ganges, Indus, Amu Darya and Syr Darya. Using GRDC historical discharge records, we characterize the annual contribution from glacier ice melt. We use MODICE interannual trends in each basin to estimate glacier ice melt uncertainties. Our results are being used in the USAID project, Contribution to High Asia Runoff from Ice and Snow (CHARIS), to inform regional-scale planning for vulnerability to changing water resources.",

            "abstract": "Nonstationarity of flood risk has emerged as an important issue and progress in addressing this concern can only come from an improved understanding of the associated climate dynamics. An understanding of the dynamical mechanisms and statistics associated with the frequency and structure of heavy precipitation induced floods events can aid exploration of the key sources of uncertainties that challenge extreme hydrometerological forecasts, and improve reliability of streamflow forecasts for real-time applications.\nAlthough the climate mechanisms governing precipitation vary by location, extreme precipitation events in the mid-latitudes are typically associated with anomalous atmospheric moisture from warmer tropical or subtropical oceanic areas. Tropical moisture exports (TMEs) to the Northern Hemispheric extratropics are an important feature of the general circulation of the atmosphere and link tropical moisture sources with extratropical precipitation and occasionally with explosive cyclogenesis. TMEs, contributing to the global climatology precipitation and its extremes, are closely related to flood events, especially in the midlatitudes.\nHere, a statistically and physically based framework is put forward that investigates the relationship between TMEs, and Extreme Precipitation and Floods over the continental United States, and relates the spatial flood incidence across the regions to the persistence and spatiotemporal structure of these tracks. The origins and pathways of moist and warm tropical air masses, which are the fuel for the heavy precipitation events and rapid cyclogenesis in the extratropics, are examined. The clustered TME tracks provide a critical source of identify different moisture sources and climate dynamics, which governs and drives the movements of water vapor to the flooded areas, together with an atmospheric circulation pattern that leads to persistent multi-day convergence and precipitation in those regions. The genesis location of TME can be linked to the seasonality and sea surface temperature; while the variance or the second moments of the tracks recognize the water vapor contents and most importantly monitor the lease of the moisture, which may directly induces intensive precipitation, that are potentially attributable for flooding events followed.",

            "abstract": "Coastal wetlands provide valuable ecosystem services, but are threatened by sea level rise, anthropogenic disturbance, and changing sediment supply. Watershed characteristics, such as watershed area and upland land use, can mediate suspended sediment concentration; while estuarine characteristics, such as fetch, can determine the wave energy and erosion in a coastal area. These combined effects are mediated by local biogeomorphic feedbacks within wetlands to determine wetland extent. There has been little empirical or theoretical study of how broad-scale features of estuaries and watersheds influence wetland formation, persistence, and loss. As such, we cannot predict how wetland extent and resilience to sea level rise will respond to land use change and other human alterations. In this study, we ask, what factors control the broad-scale distribution of coastal wetlands? We examined relationships between coastal wetland extent and watershed/estuarine characteristics at multiple scales along the Eastern and Gulf coasts of the United States. Using existing GIS resources, we delineated the absolute and relative extents of coastal wetlands, and generated watershed and estuarine characteristics to serve as proxies of sediment input, the estuarine energy environment, and local wetland alteration. We found that present coastal wetland distributions reflect interactions across a wide range of spatial scales, ranging from local biogeomorphic processes, to estuarine-scale morphology that governs hydrodynamics, and to past and present watershed processes that influence sediment delivery. Coastal wetland extent scales with estuary size to the half power and the residuals reflect a bimodal distribution. The wetland extent distribution also displays multiple clusters, possibly signaling that local feedbacks drive wetland extent at some scales. When the results are broken up by region, this pattern is stronger in Northeastern United States. Using continental-scale variation in watershed and estuarine characteristics to understand where and how coastal wetlands have established, we hope to predict how wetland distributions will respond to sea level rise, altered sediment concentrations, and anthropogenic disturbance.",

One aspect of this work is a need to characterize the magnitude of electron density and temperature variations that may be encountered at ISS orbital altitudes (~400 km), the latitudes over which they occur, and the time periods for which the disturbances persist. We will present preliminary results from a study of ionospheric disturbances in the “mid-latitude” region defined as the ~30 degree to ~60 degree extra-equatorial magnetic latitudes sampled by ISS. The study is focused on geomagnetic storm periods because they are well known drivers for disturbances in the high-latitude and mid-latitude ionospheric plasma. Changes in the F2 peak electron density obtained from ground based ionosonde records are compared to in-situ electron density and temperature measurements from the CHAMP and ISS spacecraft at altitudes near, or above, the F2 peak. Results from a number of geomagnetic storms will be presented and their potential impact on ISS charging will be discussed.",

The data were taken over a three week period in April, 2014. Jupiter was observed continuously with Hisaki, six times with the Chandra/HRC instrument for roughly 12 hours per observation, and twice by XMM-Newton. The goal of this observational campaign was to understand how energy and matter are exchanged between the Jovian aurora, the IPT, and the Solar wind. X-ray observations provide key diagnostics on highly stripped ions and keV electrons in the Jovian magnetosphere. We use the temporal, spatial, and spectral capabilities of the three instruments to search for correlated variability between the Solar wind, the EUV-emitting plasma of the IPT and UV aurora, and the ions responsible for the X-ray aurora. Preliminary analysis suggests a strong 45 min periodicity in the EUV emission from the electron aurora. There is some evidence for complex variability of the X-ray auroras on scales of tens of minutes. There is also clear morphological changes in the X-ray aurora that do not appear to be correlated with either variations in the IPT or Solar wind.",

            "abstract": "Seasonal thermal variability of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon was severely decreased by closure of Glen Canyon Dam and filling of Lake Powell reservoir that was achieved in 1980. From 1973 to 2002, downstream summer river temperatures at Lees Ferry were about 18°C below pre-dam conditions, and limited juvenile native fish growth and survival. A large-scale flow experiment to improve the river’s thermal regime for spawning and rearing habitat of endangered native humpback chub and other native fish in eastern Grand Canyon was conducted in Water Year 2000. Monitoring revealed warming, but well below the 16-18°C optimum for chub 124 km below the dam near the Little Colorado River confluence, and no measurable chub population increase in Grand Canyon. Fall-timed stable flow experiments to improve shoreline chub nursery habitat (2008-12) were also inconclusive relative to juvenile chub growth and recruitment. Field studies also showed that daytime warming of shoreline habitats used by fish under steady flows is limited by high daily exchange rates with main channel water. Monthly averaged and higher resolution temperature models have also been developed and used to support more recent experimental management planning. Temperature simulations have been useful for screening dam release scenarios under varied reservoir storage conditions with and without use of previously proposed but never constructed multilevel intake structures on the dam’s hydroelectric units. Most importantly, modeling revealed the geophysical limits on downstream warming under existing water management and dam operating policies. Hourly unsteady flow simulations in 2006 predicted equivalent levels of average downstream river warming under either fluctuating or steady flows for a given monthly release volume. River warming observed since 2002, has resulted from reduced Lake Powell storage resulting from drier upper basin hydrology. In support of new environmental compliance on dam operations, temperature models have informed decision makers that it is possible for the river to approach near-optimal temperatures for native fish in eastern Grand Canyon when Lake Powell storage is higher (fig. 1), but only if summer dam releases are held well below current operating policies or multilevel intake structures are used.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the effects of chemical erosion on the geologic CO2 cycle and seawater chemistry requires the ability to differentiate between the relative contributions of silicate and carbonate weathering to the dissolved load of rivers. Previous approaches (i.e. major elemental budgets or Sr isotopic compositions) do not always produce a straightforward explanation to the question at hand. This is especially the case in the Himalaya, where Sr isotopic compositions are extreme even in carbonate phases owing to metamorphic redistribution of radiogenic 87Sr. The aim of this study is to investigate a new isotopic approach using the 40K-40Ca system to better quantify the contributions of silicate and carbonate lithologies in the dissolved load of major Himalayan rivers. The silicate upper crust, with a K/Ca ratio of 1, is expected to have developed a radiogenic ε40Ca of ca. +2 ε–units, while marine carbonates are characterized by a homogeneous ε 40Ca=0 [1]. The 40K-40Ca system was therefore expected to produce robust constraints on the relative contribution of silicate vs. carbonate lithologies in dissolved river loads. To this end, we present high precision 40Ca data on river sediments, dissolved river loads and bedrock representative of the main Himalayan formations. Our results show that dolomites from the Lesser Himalaya (LH) exhibit no radiogenic 40Ca excess despite highly variable 87Sr/86Sr signatures (0.73-0.85). In contrast, silicate material is radiogenic, with ε40Ca ranging between +1 in the Tethyan Sedimentary Series (TSS) to +4 ε-units in the LH. Results obtained from a series of 27 Himalayan rivers show that ε40Ca in the dissolved load is significantly influenced by silicate lithologies, with ε40Ca ranging from +0.1 in carbonate dominated catchments to +1.6 ε-units in rivers draining predominantly gneissic catchments of the High Himalaya. Coherent, two end-member mixing trends between ε40Ca and major elements suggest that the 40Ca signature of Himalayan rivers primarily reflects the lithological nature of their erosional source, and highlights the potential of the 40K-40Ca decay scheme as a tracer of silicate weathering.\n[1] Caro G., Papanastassiou D.A., Wasserburg G.J. 40K-40Ca isotopic constraints on the oceanic calcium cycle.

            "abstract": "Lakes can be used as “model basins” to study fluid-flow processes with a multi-method approach in a well-defined environment. We present unprecedented insight into newly discovered pockmarks and associated subsurface sediment-mobilization structures in Lake Neuchâtel, Switzerland. A geophysical approach using multiple tools provides precise high-resolution bathymetric data and subsurface information of the sedimentary infill. We combine geophysical (300 kHz Kongsberg EM2040 multibeam, 3.5 kHz pinger seismic, deep-towed multi-frequency chirp seismic, mounted on an AUV), sedimentological (piston cores), hydrological (CTD), geochemical (methane, δ18O) and visual (ROV survey) data and observations. The data show several circular, crater-shaped pockmarks of up to 160 m in diameter and up to 30 m depth. The pockmarks are partially filled with mud in a fluid-like state. It is hypothesized that this mud is a result of active fluid flow within the pockmark. The levees of the pockmarks are characterized by high-amplitude wedge-shaped seismic reflections being intercalated with the background sediments. They are interpreted as overflow deposits originating from episodic increases in fluid flow from inside the pockmarks, causing sediment to be spilled over the margin and deposited on the levees. Data show multiple phases of sediment expulsion during discrete periods throughout the Holocene. Geochemical sediment analyses of headspace methane indicate the presence of purely microbial methane at low concentrations, thus no indications of active gas seepage. Elevated temperature values and depleted δ18O signals within the pockmark, compared to the reference sites, hint towards different water sources. We interpret these data to show two water bodies: (i) lake bottom-water, and (ii) groundwater entering as focused fluid flow through the pockmark. This multi-proxy approach shows that the newly discovered pockmarks of Lake Neuchâtel are sublacustrine springs, possibly related to regional karst structures and/or tectonic fault systems. The subsurface sediment-mobilization structures of these sublacustrine springs strongly resemble fluid-flow structures in the marine environment (e.g. mud volcanoes), thus linking processes within terrestrial hydrological systems and the marine realm.",

            "abstract": "As zones of focused metamorphism, melting, and ductile deformation, hot crustal sections are especially important for understanding the evolution of the lower crust in convergent orogens, such as Tibet. One of the best exposed crustal sections that reached ultrahigh-temperature (UHT: >900° C) is in southern Madagascar. There, the association of UHT mineral assemblages with exceptionally high concentrations of radioactive heat-producing elements begs the question of whether radiogenic heating caused UHT. Partial melting, retrogression and rapid elemental diffusion at high temperature, however, have left a complex record of radiometric dates that span 150 Myr (~650–500 Ma), making it difficult to address this question.\nWe apply laser-ablation split-stream ICPMS (LASS) petrochronology and 4+ cation thermometry to better constrain the lengthscales and timescales over which high temperatures were sustained in southern Madagascar. By deciphering complex intragrain (re)crystallization textures of zircon and monazite from a broad geographical area, we deduce that orogenesis lasted >60 Myr. Specifically, 600–540 Ma zircon and monazite with HREE depletion suggest (re)crystallization in the presence of garnet. All monazite show negative Eu anomalies (compatible with the presence of plagioclase), but ~570 to ~530 Ma monazite has more-pronounced anomalies. Ti-in-zircon and Zr-in-rutile thermometry confirm ultrahigh temperatures within a restricted area of ~100 x 200 km.\nThese thermal and chronologic constraints allow us to evaluate the potential causes of heating. Measured K, Th, and U contents of rocks within the UHT domain indicate an average heat-production rate of >4 μW/m3, sufficient to produce UHT metamorphism in 60-km thick crust within 60 Myr. We conclude that high concentrations of heat-producing elements caused focused heat production in young metasedimentary rocks that were sandwiched between older crustal domains. We speculate that ultrahigh temperatures caused by radiogenic heating led to preferential crustal melting within—and ductile extrusion of—the young metasediments.",

It has been estimated that, given a CO2 and N2 atmosphere, lightning (a proportion of it volcanic), meteorite impacts and volcanic gases would have produced enough NOx in a million years or so (>1018 g) to generate micromolar amounts of NO3- and NO2- in the ocean (Yung and McElroy, 1979; Kasting, 1990; Navarro-González et al., 1998; Martin et al., 2007). It is notable that lightning has been detected on Venus and Mars along with evidence of atmospheric NO.\nBecause a figure 1018 g of nitrate/nitrite is controversial, we will present new calculations based on 10 atmospheres of CO2, two atmospheres of N2 and stepped concentrations of water vapor dependent on surface temperatures.",

During recent global warming hiatus, the Pacific Decadal Oscillations (PDO) switches to the negative phase while the CP El Niños occur more often than EP El Niños. The changes of El Niño type in conjunction with westward drift and increasing warm pool size shows an interesting multidecadal change in the warm pool (Kidwell et al, 2014). However, the effect of these variations in other regions is not fully explored. A comprehensive study of the El Niño /La Niña (EN/LN) events and their Antarctic teleconnections was conducted using multiple remote sensing and composite data sets. During the time period from April 2002-April 2011, the sea ice coverage, remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST), outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and continental water mass variations data were all collected and analyzed. The results show the different ways in which the variations in tropical SST and OLR associated with CP and EP El Niños cause regional changes in sea ice coverage around the continent of Antarctica as well as changes in continental water mass during six distinct El Niño events and three distinct La Niña events. The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) diversity and the Southern Ocean deep warming around the Antarctic during recent “Hiatus” will also be discussed.",

Recent studies have shown considerable amounts of CH4 to be emitted via the lenticel pathway. Forested wetlands cover approximately 9.9 million hectares in North America, and to our knowledge no study has previously compared emissions of CH4 through soil and lenticel pathways in North American forested wetlands. Our objectives were to quantify the fluxes of CH4 emissions via lenticels in black ash (Fraxinus nigra Marsh.) wetlands and evaluate some factors that may affect lenticel CH4 emissions. We measured CH4 emissions from nine black ash trees monthly during the 2014 growing season and compared the fluxes to those from collocated soil chambers in three forested wetlands in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. During each sampling period, 15-mL samples were collected via syringe every ten minutes for a forty minute period. Water table depth, dissolved oxygen, air temperature, soil temperature, and lenticel density were recorded. Lenticel effluxes were up to 4.5 times greater than the soil effluxes and that water table position was correlated with soil and lenticel gas fluxes. We conclude CH4 emissions from forested wetlands may be considerably underestimated and our findings highlight the need for the inclusion of lenticel gas emissions in global estimates and Earth Systems Models.",

            "abstract": "Researchers often invoke variations in water content, stress state, and melt distribution to account for the observed variety of olivine crystallographic preferred orientations (CPOs). Since the average direction of [100] axes directly affects seismic anisotropy, there is potential to link observed anisotropy to compositional and thermo-mechanical conditions. It is well established that the (010)[100] is the weakest slip system, and therefore thought to control CPOs, in dry olivine at P < 2 GPa. However, CPOs formed in experiments on olivine plus mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) reveal a fabric in which [001] axes form weak point maxima parallel to the shear direction, and [010] axes form strong point maxima perpendicular to the shear plane, indicative of (010)[001] as the weak slip system.\nTo investigate the mechanisms that cause this change in CPO, samples fabricated from fine-grained San Carlos olivine plus MORB were deformed in torsion at T = 1200°C and P = 300 MPa. Samples with starting melt fractions of 0.01, 0.10 and 0.25 were sheared to a maximum strain of γ ≈ 13.\nWe investigate three hypotheses. 1) The easiest slip direction changes from [100] to [001] in partially molten rocks. However, no microstructural evidence for such a change has been found. 2) With the presence of a melt phase, shape preferred orientations (SPOs) play an important role in fabric development. We test this hypothesis by examining the relationship between SPOs and CPOs as a function of strain and melt content. 3) Anisotropy in the melt distribution leads to anisotropy in grain-boundary sliding, thus preferentially favoring grain rotations necessary to produce the observed fabric. We test this hypothesis by detailed analysis of misorientations between neighboring grains. Our results will provide a crucial link between seismic anisotropy and grain-scale deformation processes.",

This study analyzed one large-offset seismic profile MGL0908-23 collected during the TAIGER survey in 2009 to investigate the deep structures of the Manila subduction zone..\nRadon filter and eigenvector filter are applied to eliminate the multiples on the seismic profiles, iterative migrate velocity analysis are performed to produce correct velocity structures, and pre-stack depth migration (PSDM) profile is generated to provide better seismic images. Based on the sea floor slope α and the detachment dip β, the morphology of accretionary wedge is determined. Also, fluid retention depth is constrained by the velocity structure. Controlling factor of shape of Manlia subduction zone is investigated via the critically heterogeneous Coulomb wedge theory.\nOur seismic profile shows that the accretionary wedge can be further divided into a lower slope domain and an upper slope domain separated by a megathrust. The velocity structure is in accordance with seismic profile structure and provides the information of time-depth correlation. The sea floor slope far away from both deformation front and megathrust becomes gentler. If the detachment dip β is constant, the morphology of accretionary wedge can be controlled by the stronger wedge strength or weaker faults strength. Detailed analysis is needed to test different.",

            "abstract": "Deformation-related energy budget is usually considered in the simplest form or even completely omitted from the energy balance equation. We derive an energy balance equation that accounts not only for heat energy but also for elastic and plastic work. Such a general description of the energy balance principle will be useful for modeling complicated interactions between geodynamic processes such as thermoelastisity, thermoplasticity and mechanical consequences of metamorphism. Following the theory of large deformation plasticity, we start from the assumption that Gibbs free energy (g) is a function of temperature (T), the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress (S), density (ρ) and internal variables (qj, j=1…n). In this formulation, new terms are derived, which are related to the energy dissipated through plastic work and the elastically stored energy that are not seen in the usual form of the energy balance equation used in geodynamics. We then simplify the generic equation to one involving more familiar quantities such as Cauchy stress and material density assuming that the small deformation formulation holds for our applications. The simplified evolution equation for temperature is implemented in DyanEarthSol3D, an unstructured finite element solver for long-term tectonic deformation. We calculate each of the newly derived terms separately in simple settings and compare the numerical results with a corresponding analytic solution. We also present the effects of the new energy balance on the evolution of a large offset normal fault.",

            "abstract": "Deep saline fracture fluids have been found in billion year old rocks throughout the Precambrian shields of Canada, Fennoscandia and South Africa - geologic terrains that make up more than 70% of the Earth’s continental crust. Dissolved gases in these fluids are dominated by methane and higher hydrocarbons, some of the most radiogenic noble gas signatures ever reported, and up to mM concentrations of H2, making these environments as H2-rich as marine hydrothermal vents and spreading centers. Although the discovery of microbial ecosystems sustained by H2-producing water-rock reactions in the deep ocean vents transformed thinking about where life may have originated on Earth and the search for life on other worlds, such as Europa, the billion year old rocks of Precambrian shields have been under-investigated to date as analogs.\nNoble gas studies have provided a range of residence times from millions to tens of millions of years for the subsurface fracture fluids in South Africa. Holland et al. (2013) reported residence times of more than a billion years for fracture waters from 2.4 km depth from mines in Northern Canada – revealing an ancient previously unexplored hydrosphere[1]. Analyses of the DNA, RNA and amino acids from some of these fracture waters reveal an active biosphere supported by chemolithoautotrophs that alters the stable isotopic composition of C, N, and S aqueous and gaseous species. The discovery that ancient fluid environments capable of supporting life can remain isolated for up to billions of years in the Precambrian crust changes our understanding of the extent of the Earth’s crust, and by inference Mars’ crust, that may be habitable, and the role that such potential buried biomes play in preserving, evolving and propagating life on planetary timescales. Mars, like the Precambrian shields on Earth, is dominated by tectonically quiescent geologic terrains which are billions of years old, some with serpentinized ultramafic rocks capable of sustaining production of reduced gases. If such ancient fluids, with mM concentrations of H2 and CH4, are preserved deep in the terrestrial crust on Ga time scales, similar potential buried biomes may be preserved at depth in the subsurface of Mars.

            "abstract": "Here we describe the recent occurrence of a notch or localized region of reduced ice cover in the winter marginal ice zone offshore of the Kangerdlugssuaq Fiord, the site of the largest tidewater glacier along Greenland’s southeast coast. We will argue that the development of this notch is the result of the topographically controlled inflow of warm subtropical water, that began in the mid 1990s, along the submarine trough that connects the fiord to the deep ocean. We will also show that there is considerable inter-annual variability on the 2-8 year time scale in sea ice cover in the vicinity of the notch, This variability is associated with a seesaw in surface temperature between southeast and northeast Greenland suggesting that it may play a role in modulating the regional climate potentially affecting the ice sheet’s outlet glaciers. The dominant atmospheric signal associated with this variability is a dipole in the sea-level pressure across the Nordic Seas with poles associated with the Icelandic and Lofoten Lows. The strength of this dipole is independent of the state of the NAO suggesting that one needs to consider the variability identified in this paper as well that of the NAO when attempting to understand the atmosphere’s role in ocean-fiord interactions along the southeast coast of Greenland.",

            "abstract": "Several months after fluid injection began in December 2010 at the Northstar 1 well in Youngstown, Ohio, low-magnitude earthquakes were detected in the Youngstown area, where no prior earthquakes had been detected. Concerns that the injection might have triggered the earthquakes lead to shutdown of the well in December 2011. Earthquake relocation analysis by Kim (2013, J. Geophy. Res., v 118, p. 3506-3518) showed that, from March 2011 to January 2012, 12 earthquakes with moment magnitudes of 1.8 to 3.9 occurred at depths of 3.5 to 4 km in the Precambrian basement along a previously unmapped vertical fault. The 2.8 km deep Northstar 1 well, which penetrated the top 60 m of the basement, appeared to have been drilled into the same fault. The earthquakes occurred at lateral distances of 0 to 1 km from the well. The present study aims to estimate the fluid pressure increase due to injection. The groundwater flow model MODFLOW is used to simulate fluid pressure propagation from the well injection interval into the basement fault and two permeable sandstone layers above the basement. The basement rock away from the fault is assumed impermeable. Reservoir properties (permeability and compressibility) of the fault and sandstone layers are estimated by calibrating the model to match injection history and wellhead pressure recorded daily during the operational period. Although the available data are not sufficient to uniquely determine reservoir properties, it is possible to determine reasonable ranges. Simulated fluid pressure increases at the locations and times of the earthquakes range from less than 0.01 MPa to about 1 MPa. Pressure measurements in the well after shut-in might enhance the estimation of reservoir properties. Such data could also improve the estimation of pore fluid pressure increase due to injection.",

            "abstract": "Rifting and the subsequent breakup of continental lithosphere has given rise to the magma-poor Galicia Bank rifted margin in the North Atlantic Ocean. Hyperextension of continental crust is observed at the deep Galicia margin (west of Spain) and has been accommodated by the rotation of continental fault blocks, which are underlain by the S-reflector, an interpreted detachment fault, which has exhumed serpentinized mantle peridotite. West of these features is the enigmatic Peridotite Ridge (PR) which has been suggested to delimit the western extent of the ocean-continent transition. An outstanding question at this margin is where unequivocal oceanic crust begins, with little existing data to constrain this boundary.\nWe present results from a 160-km-long wide-angle seismic profile, which encompasses the S-reflector to the east, the PR, and the unidentified basement west of the PR. This profile consists of 32 OBS/H recording wide angle seismic data from coincident multichannel seismic surveying. First-arrival travel time tomography models of the crustal velocity structure were produced using two algorithms, with the best fit model having a RMS travel time misfit of 38ms, a χ2 of 0.99 and strong correlation with the structure observed in seismic reflection images. East of the PR, the 3.0-3.5 kms-1 velocity contours match top of crust and the S-reflector generally lies between the 6.0-6.5 kms-1 velocity contours, giving a crustal thickness of 1.5-3.5 km and an average velocity gradient of 0.75 s-1. Similarly, west of the PR we observe a basement layer which is 2.0-4.0 km thick and has an average velocity gradient of 0.72 s-1. High velocity gradients, an absence of velocities typical of oceanic layer 3 and no clear mantle reflections suggest the continued presence of exhumed, serpentinized mantle peridotite west of the PR, which could be analogous to the large expanses of mantle peridotite exposed at the seafloor on the flanks of the ultra-slow Southwest Indian ridge.",

            "abstract": "In recent decades, climate-driven range expansions of various warm-adapted marine species have been observed, including benthic foraminifera. Distribution models predict further poleward extensions in the future, which might result in significant impacts on native faunas, habitats and entire ecosystems. The prolific expansion and colonization of benthic foraminifera is related to propagule dispersal. Foraminiferal propagules – tiny juveniles – are transported well beyond their biogeographic ranges and are able to grow and become established under suitable conditions.\nHere, we focus on propagule dispersal along the southeastern coast of the United States. Sediment samples containing propagules were collected from different shallow-water locations along a latitudinal gradient from Sapelo Island (GA), Fort Pierce (FL) and the Florida Keys. We hypothesize that propagules of warm-adapted species might be transported farther to the North than their biogeographic boundaries indicate, and that their current distribution is limited.\nApplying the propagule method, we are growing foraminifera from propagules collected at these three sites under constant normal and elevated temperatures (18°, 24°, 30°C) and normal and reduced salinities (15 and 35‰) with illumination on a 12-hr cycle. These set-ups cover a wide range of shallow-water habitats from intertidal to environments more proximal to the open marine realm. They also reflect the temperature gradient along the southeastern coast.\nThe occurrence of species typically confined to warmer regions in assemblages grown at elevated temperatures would support distribution models that predicted the further range expansion of warm-adapted species within the next decades. Thus, results of this study could provide a glimpse into the future.",

Fundamentally different than the ICESat full waveform lidar (called GLAS); the primary instrument on ICESat-2 is the photon-counting ATLAS instrument. While the primary measurement of the mission is the photon range from the satellite to the Earth’s surface, most science applications require converting range into height with respect to a reference ellipsoid. The science-directed data products require systematic removal of various geophysical signals to enhance their scientific utility. We have made assessments of various present-day models of ocean tides, earth tides, atmosphere-ocean interactions, pole tides and ocean loading, among other geophysical phenomena. We present a description and evaluation of models that presently constitute leading choices, as well as an assessment of the relevant spatial and temporal scales for each correction. Our goal is to produce a set of state-of-the-art corrections that will be applied to the ICESat-2 Level 2A data product (which provides latitude, longitude, and elevation for each photon recorded by ATLAS). A design criterion is that these corrections be easily removed for investigations involving improvements to the correction modeling, itself; or for cases when an investigator desires that a different model be applied.",

Studies that have investigated the environmental and physiological drivers of δ18O values in tree ring cellulose have typically focused either on the source of the signal, e.g. the leaf and the water therein, or on the sink, e.g. the cellulose in the stem. In contrast, hardly any research has investigated the transfer of the δ18O signal from precipitation, to soil water, xylem water, leaf water, leaf sugars, phloem sugars all the way to cellulose in the tree ring. As such, critical uncertainties remain regarding the seasonal integration and precision by which precipitation and leaf water δ18O signals are recorded in the tree ring cellulose δ18O values. In our talk, we will present a unique three year dataset that shows the seasonal variation of δ18O values in precipitation, soil water, xylem water, leaf water, leaf sugars, twig and stem phloem sugars for four common European tree species, which are growing in a mature temperature Swiss mixed broadleaf/evergreen forest. This dataset allows us to assess, (i) to what degree the substantial seasonal variation in precipitation δ18O values influences the δ18O values of tree ring cellulose and (ii) if physiological and environmental δ18O signals imprinted on the tree’s leaf water δ18O values and the assimilates formed therein are altered on their way downstream to the tree stem. The new insight that we provide into the integration and possible alteration of δ18O signals along the leaf-stem pathway will contribute significantly to a better understanding of the environmental and physiological signals that can be obtained from tree ring δ18O chronologies. In addition it will be relevant for the incorporation and parameterization of tree ring isotope models into dynamic global vegetation models.",

            "abstract": "Community College students account for over 40% of all undergraduates in the US as well as the majority of minority students attending undergraduate courses. With issues in the geosciences such as; being the least diverse of all major STEM fields, an increasing number of retiring geoscientists, and a projected geoscience job growth not matching the number of geoscience graduates, the geoscience community needs to look at community colleges as a solution to these issues. A key factor for students entering and excelling in the geoscience is the opportunity for formative undergraduate field experiences. Formative field experiences go beyond one-day field excursions by incorporating field projects, interactive learning, and community building between participants in regions students are unfamiliar with. Unfortunately, these types of formative experiences often require logistics and resources that are not available or known to community college faculty. In order to build a framework for implementing formative field experiences by community colleges a two-week “field exchange” between two community colleges with different geological, social, and cultural settings was conducted. Supported with a supplemental grant from NSF, the “Border to Beltway” program provided 11 students from El Paso Community College and another 13 from Northern Virginia Community College with two one-week regional geology field trips: First, to West Texas in March 2014, and second, to the mid-Atlantic region in May 2014. Students were selected based on academic standing, non-traditional (minority, female, over 35, veteran) status, and interest in geology. Qualitative data collected from participants regarding the implementation of the field exchange include; student perception of geology before and after exchange, challenges students faced in the field or traveling for the first time, quantity and quality of projects given, and working with others from different backgrounds. Data regarding planning, logistics, budget, and implementation were also compiled by the instructors to help identify components for a successful formative field experience or exchange at a community college.",

            "abstract": "Detrital zircons from Jack Hills, Western Australia are the best known >4 Ga terrestrial mineral record. As their ca. 3 Ga host quartzite experienced several documented Precambrian metamorphic events, it is unsurprising that various alteration features have been suggested or identified in the zircons. Using these grains to understand early Earth conditions requires knowledge to what extent they have been altered. We have used 200 ion microprobe δ18O and 67 trace element analyses of these zircons, together with backscattered electron and cathodoluminescence imaging, to assess differences between spots falling on crack-bearing vs. uncracked surfaces. Analyses on uncracked surfaces were further subdivided into those within magmatic zonations versus those in altered regions. We have combined the results with data from previous studies of Jack Hills zircons to identify alteration signatures and their mechanisms. Analyses on cracks overlap the field of uncracked regions in terms of most variables, but also display trends toward distinct compositions. Regions with altered zonationare often intermediate between magmatic and cracked regions but also overlap magmatic regions in other variables. Clear alteration signals include high P (>1000 ppm), high LREE/HREE (Nd/Yb (N) >0.01), high Ti (>900°C apparent Txlln), high Fe (>1000 ppm), and low HREE/MREE (Yb/Gd (N) <10). Cracks and altered regions are more likely to show high Th/U, low Ce/Ce*, and low δ18O, but the considerable overlap with magmatic regions limits the diagnostic usefulness of these variables. Crack-associated alteration is likely due to the extensive Fe-Ti oxide and xenotime mineralization seen in the zircons. Many but not all CL-dark regions are consistent with solid-state recrystallization. Bright regions cross-cutting magmatic zonation are evident in some zircons, but we have not yet identified a diagnostic signature of this alteration mode.Mineral inclusions falling on and away from cracks show distinct modal mineralogy, but inclusions falling in altered vs. magmatic regions do not appear to differ and are likely primary. Identifying alteration signatures and likely mechanisms will help guide future work on the Jack Hills zircons, in particular in distinguishing systems robust against alteration.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol and cloud radiative effects are two of the largest uncertainties in surface energy budget estimates. In nature, aerosols and clouds can be highly variable spatially and temporally and they can co-exist. Therefore, understanding the combined radiative effects of clouds and aerosols – for example, for aerosol layers above homogeneous and inhomogeneous clouds, and for aerosol-immersed broken cloud fields – is essential to understanding the surface radiative energy budget as a whole. The Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS, 2013) experiment with its unique instrument combination, sampling strategy, and range of measurement conditions allows such studies. We use data from the Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR, onboard the ER-2 and DC-8), the Enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS), the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL, DC-8) as well as the Spectrometer for Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research (4STAR, DC-8) to identify cloud and aerosol radiative effects at the surface from both irradiance and radiance perspectives by means of their spectral signatures. For complex cloud scenes, we make use of 3-dimensional radiative transfer calculations to reproduce the measurements and to understand to which degree aerosol radiative effects can be isolated from those of the clouds by means of their distinct spectral signatures. We also discuss how the measured irradiance above and below cloud-aerosol layers systematically deviates from estimates that are obtained from one-dimensional radiative transfer models, and propose potential correction schemes that are applicable for correcting the effects of cloud inhomogeneities and aerosols.",

            "abstract": "The observation and monitoring of solar irradiance, in general, and UV (Ultra Violet) irradiance, in particular, is important due to its impact on human health and environment on regional and global scale. The UV irradiance, hence, the UV index (UVI), is affected by various atmospheric parameters, e.g., the solar zenith angle, the ozone overhead column and other atmospheric absorbers and scatters such as clouds and aerosols.\nIn order to investigate the modifications induced on human environment due to the UV irradiance, it is important to quantify the various factors affecting the UV irradiance, both UV-A and UV-B. Particularly, clouds are responsible for a great deal of the observed irradiance variability that in turn requires the examination of extensive observation data sets by detailed radiative transfer models using co-located meteorological and ozone measurements together with satellite based estimations.\nThese factors are continuously monitored over Uccle, Belgium, since 1993 by means of station based observations producing spectral measurements of UV irradiance together with UVI computation that constitutes the European UV network. Today there are six stations representing Belgium in this European network. These measurements give a good insight into the trend of UV irradiance and associated atmospheric parameters over Belgium. Here we present some of the recent results from these measurements and radiative transfer modelling, e.g., the relation between the cloudiness, uncertainty in the cloudiness due to measurements, and UVI, ozone trend and UVI, among others. It is seen that since 2000 despite of a stable ozone concentration UV irradiance continues to increase. Modelling studies show that 1% of ozone reduction implies 2% of UVB increase.\nThese station based measurement data will be used to study solar irradiance – cloud - aerosol interactions by merging them with satellite based measurements.",

            "abstract": "We perform a systematic analysis of the crustal anisotropic parameters, fast polarization direction (φ) and delay time (δt), of hundreds of earthquakes recorded during the 2009 L’Aquila seismic sequence, which occurred in the Central Apennines Neogene fold-and-thrust–belt. We benefit from the dense coverage of seismic stations operating in the area and from a catalogue of several accurate earthquakes locations to describe in detail the geometry of the anisotropic volume around the major active faults, providing new insights on the anisotropic structure beneath the L’Aquila area and surrounding region. The results show strong spatial variations in the φ and δt values, revealing the presence of anisotropic complexity in the area. At most of the stations φ are mainly oriented NW-SE (~N141°). This trend well matches both the strike of the nearby major active normal faults and the regional maximum horizontal compressive stress (sHmax). This is also in agreement with the main stress indicators, such as focal mechanisms and borehole breakouts. δt at single stations vary between 0.024-0.26 s, with average value of ~0.07s. Similar results could be explained by the presence of stress aligned microcracks or stress-opened fluid-filled cracks and fractures within the crustal layers, as suggested by the EDA model. Moreover, the sharp coherence between φ and the strike of major faults does not allow us to completely rule out the contribution from the structural anisotropy. Measurements obtained at the stations in the southeastern side of the study area show different anisotropic parameters. In this region φ do not appear parallel with either the strike of the local mapped faults or the sHmax direction, becoming oriented predominantly NE-SW. These stations also report the highest value of δt (up to 0.09 s). This results could be explained by the presence of a highly fractured and over-pressurized rock volumes, which causes the 90°-flips in φ and an increase in δt value.",

            "abstract": "The GC600 hydrocarbon seep is located at 1200 m in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Satellite data show it to be one of the most prolific sources of natural oil slicks in the entire GOM. We mapped its seafloor oil and gas vents with 3-D seismic, swath-bathymetry acoustics and submersible observations, documenting gas hydrate deposits, brine pools, benthic fauna, and authigenic carbonates. Geophysical profiles show subbottom locations of salt bodies and migration conduits. We deployed time-lapse imaging systems focused on individual vents to quantify release rates. Oil and gas flow upward along the flanks of an allochthonous salt body from source rocks at 10,000 m and migrate to the seafloor from faults emanating from the salt. Venting to the water column and surface consists of oily bubbles and occurs in two fields separated by ~1 km. The NW vent field (Megaplume) appears to be a more recent expression and hosts about three highly active vents; while the SE vent field (Birthday Candles) hosts more than 10 vents that are generally slower. We measured discharge rates of 2.6 cm3 s-1 and Megaplume and 0.09 cm3 s-1 at Birthday Candles. Although surface deposits of gas hydrate were evident at both vent fields, the Birthday Candles area featured dozens of conical mounds formed by gas hydrate that were dark brown due to large amounts of liquid oil perfused throughout the deposits. Large brine pools indicated gas hydrate formation at the seafloor. Venting occurred in horizontal fissures on the mounds, in which oil and hydrate combined to form short-lived chimneys and balloon-like structures. Ice worms (Hesiocaeca methanicola) were extremely abundant in burrows extending from the sediment into the gas hydrate. Proceeding farther to the SE, venting is reduced and absent, but surface carbonate deposits suggest relict gas hydrate mounds. We propose that the NW to SE trend at GC600 encompasses the progressive development of a biogeochemical filter that sequesters and mineralizes a very substantial portion of the source hydrocarbon prior to discharge into the water column.",

In this work, we conducted batch, column, and flow wedge experiments to study the ammonia gas transport and interaction with sediments and pore water. The uranium immobilization effectiveness of the ammonia gas treatment technology was also evaluated.\nAmmonia gas quickly partitions into sediment pore water and significantly increases the pH (up to ~13.2) and the electrical conductivity (EC). The rate and range of the increase in both pH and EC are dependent on the ammonia concentration in the gas and the pore water content and chemistry. The pH and EC changes follow a similar pattern. During an ammonia gas injection into a heterogeneous system, it was observed that the NH3 front proceeded faster in layers of lower water content compared to the same sediment layers of higher water content. Elevated pH values (11 to 13.2) initially resulted from the NH3 gas partitioning into the pore water was buffered down to ~ 9 after 7 months of sediment exposure to the air. The rate of NH3 diffusion in sediment is a function of the water content in the sediment. Higher cation/anion concentrations during the ammonia gas treatment indicated mineral dissolution due to pH increase, while lower ionic concentrations after the pH buffering revealed significant mineral precipitation. This precipitation incorporates uranium into mineral structures or provides a coating to uranium minerals, therefore achieving uranium immobilization. Treatment with 5% v/v NH3 gas for one week followed by three weeks buffering resulted in a 75% reduction in the mobile uranium mass. After 2 to 12 months of treatment, the immobile phase of uranium mass increased by up to 2.3 times.",

However, soil moisture data are collected by many agencies and organizations in the United States using a variety of instruments and methods for varying applications. These data are often distributed and represented in disparate formats, posing significant challenges for use. In recognition of these challenges, the President’s Climate Action Plan articulated the need for a coordinated national soil moisture network.\nIn response to this action plan, a team led by the National Integrated Drought Information System has begun to develop a framework for this network and has instituted a proof-of-concept pilot study. This pilot is located in the south-central plains of the US, and will serve as a reference architecture for the requisite data systems and inform the design of the national network. The pilot comprises both in-situ and modeled soil moisture datasets (historical and real-time) and will serve the following use cases: operational drought monitoring, experimental land surface modeling, and operational hydrological modeling.\nThe pilot will be implemented using a distributed network design in order to serve dispersed data in real-time directly from data providers. Standard service protocols will be used to enable future integration with external clients. The pilot network will additionally contain a catalog of data sets and web service endpoints, which will be used to broker web service calls. A mediation and aggregation service will then intelligently request, compile, and transform the distributed datasets from their native formats into a standardized output. This mediation framework allows data to be hosted and maintained locally by the data owners while simplifying access through a single service interface. These data services will then be used to create visualizations, for example, views of the current soil moisture conditions compared to historical baselines via a map-based web application. This talk will comprise an overview of the pilot design and implementation, a discussion of strategies for integrating in-situ and modeled soil moisture data sets as well as lessons learned during the course of the pilot.",

Our main goal is (1) to incorporate additional prior knowledge by using general constraints on the model parameters and (2) to reduce the computational costs of solving the inverse problem by tailoring source-encoding strategies to Newton-type methods.\nIn particular, we apply the Moreau-Yosida regularization to handle the constraints and use a continuation strategy to adjust the regularization parameter. Furthermore, we propose a semismooth Newton method with a trust-region globalization that relies on second-order adjoints to compute the Newton system with a matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient solver.\nThe costs of conventional FWI approaches scale proportionally with the number of seismic sources. Here, source-encoding strategies that trigger different sources simultaneously have been proven to be a successful tool to trade a small loss of information for huge savings of computational time to solve the inverse problem. This is particularly interesting for our setting as one iteration of Newton's methods using the full Hessian is considerably more expensive than quasi-Newton methods like L-BFGS. To this end, we discuss a sample average approximation model that is accelerated by using inexact Hessian information based on mini-batches of the samples. Furthermore, we compare its performance with stochastic descent schemes. Here, the classical stochastic gradient method is accelerated by an L-BFGS preconditioner and moreover, the stability of this stochastic preconditioner is enhanced by using the Hessian instead of only gradient information.\nNumerical results are presented for problems in geophysical exploration on reservoir-scale.",

In order to calculate exposure age, the erosion rate and previous exposure must be taken into consideration. In this study, we measured cosmogenic Ne-21 concentrations in quartz from samples of bedrock and samples taken from distinct glacial drifts in Antarctica. We determined the erosion rate using the concentrations of Ne-21 in the bedrock and then used this rate to calculate the exposure ages of the samples taken from the glacial drifts. The samples were collected from the Ong Valley, Antarctica (157.5 East, 83.25 South), an ice-free valley in the Miller Range of the Central Transantarctic Mountains that contains three distinct glacial drifts. We analyzed samples from the oldest and the youngest of these drifts, from moraines from a small alpine glacier to the east of the main valley, and from the surrounding bedrock of the valley walls above the glacial limit. The average erosion rate we calculated was 23 cm/Myrs. The six samples from the oldest glacial drift have an average exposure age of 2.1 Myrs, but have a range of 4.4 Myrs. The exposure age of samples from the middle of the youngest drift on the valley floor average 90.1 kyrs, with a range of 13.4 kyrs. Samples from a lateral moraine of this youngest drift have an average exposure age of 145 kyrs, with a range of 134 kyrs. The 7 samples taken from the alpine glacier east of Ong Valley have an average age of 1.10 Myrs, but a range of 3.87 Myrs. The high variability in ages among samples from the same glacial drift arises from prior exposure and postdepositional movement of the rocks.",

            "abstract": "Spall effects from buried explosions are seen in near-source surface accelerations and depend on explosion yield, emplacement depth-of-burial and material strength. Investigations of infrasound from buried explosions have shown how atmospheric overpressure can be derived from surface acceleration through application of the Rayleigh Integral (Bannister, 1980). Recently, underground chemical explosions as part of the Source Physics Experiment (SPE) at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) have been shown to generate spall signatures in local-distance infrasound (Jones et al. 2014). We are investigating the effects of spall on infrasound generation using two approaches. The first approach uses the Rayleigh integral to compute overpressures for buried explosions from synthetic vertical acceleration data at surface ground zero. To obtain the synthetic surface accelerations we use reported models from nuclear explosion studies and systematically vary parameters such as the spall duration, depth of burial and magnitude. The effect on the resulting acoustic waveform shape will be investigated. The second method uses a hydrodynamic approach to more fully characterize the varied parameters to produce the acoustic waveforms. As the spall decreases we find that the acoustic waveform shape changes dramatically. This waveform signature may provide diagnostics on the explosive source and may be a useful metric for underground explosion monitoring.\nThis work was done under award number DE-AC52-06NA25946.

In polar springtime, Br-atom levels can be in the range 107-109 cm-3 in the marine boundary layer, while values over the open ocean may fall in the 105 ≈ 107 cm-3 range. It is also known that many VOCs and oxygenated VOCs have oceanic/cryogenic emission sources, and reactions of Br with these (O)VOCs can then play a role in the partitioning of inorganic Br, acting as a sink for reactive Br/BrO. Thus, there is a need to develop a more complete and more reliable database for Br/(O)VOC kinetic data than what is currently available. We have embarked on a relative-rate study of the rate coefficients for reaction of Br-atoms with ≈15 (O)VOCs, including alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, isoprene, other unsaturated compounds, and various multifunctional species. Progress on these rate coefficient determinations, and trends in Br-atom reactivity with organics, will be reported.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography is the most powerful tool for imaging the internal structure of the Earth, and the deployment of dense arrays over the last decade provides opportunities for investigating the interior with exceptionally high resolution. We use travel-time data from regional earthquakes recorded by the Hi-net array in Japan to constrain the elastic properties of the crust and the upper mantle. The large number of high-quality recordings allows refined resolution through the increase of the number of model parameters. However, large amount of data also gives rise to significant challenges. It makes manual picking and reviewing impractical, and these picks are neither errorless nor objective. We address this problem by developing and applying a wavelet-based automatic algorithm to pick the arrival time of both compressional and shear waves and to obtain estimates of the picking uncertainty. Additionally, both forward and inverse calculations require significant computational resources. We use parallel computing implemented in a distributed memory cluster. Forward problem is solved under the high-frequency approximation of wave equation by calculating P and S wave ray paths using a combination of graph theory and pseudo-bending method. We incorporate finite frequency effects by calculating the first Fresnel volume of each travel-time measurement based upon its dominant frequency that is also provided by the automatic picking algorithm. The inverse problem similarly presents difficulties as the number of model parameters increases. Among the most prominent issues is the computational difficulty of explicitly calculating the model and data resolution matrices. These matrices are of great importance in quantifying the spatial resolution of the method and in designing the inverse problem, but they are computational expensive, if not almost impossible, to determine. We attempt to remedy these problems by taking advantage of recent computational developments and distributed resources. Based upon these data and approaches, we jointly invert for three-dimensional variations in both P- and S-wave speeds beneath Japan to understand detailed structure, dynamics, and chemistry of the subduction process.",

The resulting system, the NCA - Land Data Assimilation System (NCA-LDAS), is a NASA contribution to the NCA. The outputs of the NCA-LDAS contribute to the development and evaluation of a suite of water indicators. To maximize the benefit of the NCA-LDAS, on completion of planned model runs and uncertainty analysis, NASA will provide open access to all NCA-LDAS components, including input data, output fields, and validation data, to other NCA-teams and the general public. Currently released data include NCA-LDAS outputs from the Noah Land Surface Model version 3.3 (Noah-3.3) and Catchment Land Surface Model version Fortuna-2.5 (CLSM-F2.5) and the post- processed data sets for the routing variables. The NCA-LDAS data have temporal and spatial resolutions, respectively, of daily and 0.125x0.125 degree, covering North America (25N ~ 53N; 125W ~ 67W) and the period January 1979 to December 2012. The data files are in self-describing, machine-independent netCDF-4 format. The data contain a set of water- and energy-related Essential Climate Variables (ECV). The NCA-LDAS data are archived at the NASA GES DISC (Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center) and can be accessed via direct ftp (ftp://hydro1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/s4pa/NCA_LDAS), THREDDS (http://hydro1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/thredds/catalog.html), and Mirador search and download (http://mirador.gsfc.nasa.gov/). This presentation describes the main characteristics of the NCA-LDAS data and data services (access, subsetting, visualization, and analysis). The major differences between the NCA-LDAS data and the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) data are discussed as well.

            "abstract": "Most of the sedimentary basins around SE Asia were formed during Late Cretaceous to present. Previous studies suggested that Sundaland is a stable core in SE Asia that experienced the interaction of 4 major plates (Eurasia, India, Pacific and Australia plates). Although the plate tectonic history is very complicated, most of the sedimentary basins developed under the extensional regime. In Cenozoic, there are at least two contractional and four extensional events can be identified in this regime. The first contractional event is India plate colliding with Eurasia in Early Eocene, which propagated to the northern part of Sundaland and made Indochina block escape southeastward into the present-day South China Sea. The second one was in Early Miocene where Australia plate, along with many micro-continental blocks, drifted northward and collided with Sundaland that generated inversions in SE Sundaland. On the other hands, four marginal basins have their sea-floor spreading in Cenozoic, namely South China Sea (30-16Ma), Sulu Sea (17-12Ma), Celebes Sea (49-35Ma) and Andaman Sea (20-5Ma), that caused the sedimentary facies in the basins changing from mainly terrigenous to partially marine. In order to understand the evolutionary history of sedimentary basins and their relationship with plate tectonics, we used Gplates program to reconstruct SE Asia from Late Mesozoic to present. About 25 isopaches of major sedimentary basins were compiled into the program. So far, we can conclude that the key rifting event of the sedimentary basins were stared from Early Eocene that could be correlated with the India-Eurasia collision.",

            "abstract": "The Airborne Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (ACATS) is a Doppler lidar system and high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) recently developed at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). ACATS passes the returned atmospheric backscatter through a single etalon and divides the transmitted signal into several channels (wavelength intervals), which are measured simultaneously and independently (Figure 1). Both the particulate and molecular scattered signal can be directly and unambiguously measured, allowing for direct retrievals of particle extinction. The broad Rayleigh-scattered spectrum is imaged as a nearly flat background, illustrated in Figure 1c. The integral of the particulate backscattered spectrum is analogous to the aerosol measurement from the typical absorption filter HSRL technique in that the molecular and particulate backscatter components can be separated (Figure 1c and 1d). The main difference between HSRL systems that use the iodine filter technique and the multichannel etalon technique used in the ACATS instrument is that the latter directly measures the spectral broadening of the particulate backscatter using the etalon to filter out all backscattered light with the exception of a narrow wavelength interval (1.5 picometers for ACATS) that contains the particulate spectrum (grey, Figure 1a).\nThis study outlines the method and retrieval algorithms for ACATS data products, focusing on the HSRL derived cloud and aerosol properties. While previous ground-based multi-channel etalon systems have been built and operated for wind retrievals, there has been no airborne demonstration of the technique and the method has not been used to derive HSRL cloud and aerosol properties. ACATS has flown on the NASA ER-2 during flights over Alaska in July 2014 and as part of the Wallops Airborne Vegetation Experiment (WAVE) in September 2012. This study will focus on the HSRL aspect of the ACATS instrument, since the method and retrieval algorithms have direct application to the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS) to be installed on the International Space Station (ISS) in late 2014. Initial ACATS HSRL results and data products, as well as comparisons to coincident Cloud Physics Lidar data will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The impact of increased reactive nitrogen (N) deposition to terrestrial and coastal systems is well documented, but the implications of N deposition from the atmosphere to the open ocean remain uncertain. Current estimates suggest that anthropogenic emissions contribute up to 80% of N deposition to the oceans (e.g. nitrate, ammonium, and water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON)), and this contribution represents new N to the ocean, stimulating production and affecting carbon cycling [e.g., Duce et al., 2008]. Further, these estimates suggest that N deposition may rival oceanic N-fixation (38-96 Tg N yr-1 vs. 60-150 Tg N yr-1, respectively). Clearly, it is critical to understand the impact this N has on the ocean and the marine atmosphere.\nAn important underlying assumption to the global input of N to the ocean is that the ocean is a passive receptor of N from the atmosphere, adding to the ocean’s nutrient budget. On the island of Bermuda, rainwater and aerosols were collected over 18-months and analyzed for concentrations, isotopes, and chemical composition of atmospheric N. For wet deposition at Bermuda, ammonium represents 45%, nitrate 41%, and WSON 14%. For dry deposition, these numbers change to 15% ammonium, 76% nitrate, and 9% WSON. Along with air mass history and a box model of ammonia/ammonium air-sea exchange, the results suggest that: the isotopes of nitrate depend on source region (i.e. continental vs. marine), are influenced by pollution and marine boundary layer chemistry, and atmospheric nitrate contributes low-δ15N to the N. Atlantic on an annual basis; rainwater ammonium isotopes and concentration are not as dependent upon source region, ammonium is primarily sourced from the ocean year-round; and the composition of WSON is different between aerosols and rainwater, with aerosol ON primarily derived from the ocean. Based on this interpretation (and assuming the results are broadly applicable), the input of anthropogenic N to the global oceans would be revised down from ~80% to 32%. In this case, a significant percentage of deposition is not a new input of N; rather, the ocean plays an important role in determining the N content of the marine atmosphere.",

The wave-like structure in the mid-latitude green and red line intensities which can be accompanied by the Es formation is noted. The importance of AGW generation and dissipation in the tidal wind responsible for upper atmosphere-ionosphere coupling processes also is noted in the simultaneous nightglow observations of the 557.7 nm and 630.0 nm line intensities.\nThe impulse-like structures in the 630.0 nm line intensities with duration of about 3-4 hours can be caused by in situ excited shear wave and also by vertical propagation of the tidal wind.

            "abstract": "In 1877 Joseph Allen proposed that endothermic terrestrial organisms would have lower surface area to volume ratios (SAVR) in colder climates and higher SAVRs in warmer climates. With a smaller surface area compared to volume, organisms can retain more heat in cold climates. We tested to see if this principle applied to ostracods, a type of ectothermic marine invertebrate. We hypothesised that Allen’s rule applies to ostracods, as Allen’s rule has been demonstrated in frogs (Alho 2011), which are also ectotherms . We used the linear dimensions of the three major carapace axes of ostracod holotypes to estimate the SAVR. We compared ostracod SAVRs with paleotemperatures from Royer et al. (2004). We found that there was a correlation between surface area and temperature; it is a small, but statistically significant correlation (adj. R2=0.0167). This means that as temperature increased, the SAVR also increased. We also found a negative correlation between ostracod SAVR to geologic time(adj. R2=0.0114), which shows us that as time has gone on, ostracod SAVR has decreased. We then plotted the correlation coefficient of SAVR to temperature over geologic time to explore trends in the strength of Allen’s rule. For most of time there was no relationship but during the Devonian, Allen’s Rule did explain the trend. In short, temperature does explain some of the correlation between the SAVR and temperature, but it is likely there were other environmental factors affecting this relationship.",

            "abstract": "An optical instrument has been developed to investigate aerosol extinction spectra in the ambient atmosphere. Based on a White-type cell design and using a differential optical approach, aerosol extinction spectra over the 300-700 nm ultraviolet and visible (UV/Vis) wavelength range are obtained. Laboratory tests conducted at NASA Langley Research Center (NASA LaRC) in March 2014 showed good agreement with Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift (CAPS PMex, Aerodyne Research) extinction measurements (at 450, 530, and 630 nm) for a variety of aerosols, e.g., scatterers such as polystyrene latex spheres and ammonium sulfate; absorbers such as dust (including pigmented minerals), smoke (generated in a miniCAST burning propane) and laboratory smoke analogs (e.g., fullerene soot and aquadag). The instrument was field tested in Colorado in July and August 2014 aboard the NASA mobile laboratory at various ground sites during the DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality) field campaign. A description of the instrument, results from the laboratory tests, and summer field data will be presented. The instrument provides a new tool for probing in situ aerosol optical properties that may help inform remote sensing approaches well into the UV range.",

            "abstract": "The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has been operating the Aircraft Pilot Observation (APOB) campaign since 2008 to measure ozone in the upper air, mostly in the residual layer, with an objective to understand the impact of residual layer ozone on daily surface ozone concentrations in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) where both federal and state standards are often violated. A contracted flight operates daily between 5 – 6 AM over Fresno during the summer months from June – September, and makes continuous measurements of ozone throughout the residual layer up to ~3000 m above ground. The objectives of the current study are to 1) examine the correlation between the residual layer ozone and the surface level 1-hr and/or 8-hr maximum ozone concentrations by analyzing the 2008 – 2013 APOB dataset, and 2) evaluate an air quality model’s ability to capture vertical ozone profiles, especially in the residual layer, by comparing the modeling results with the measurements. Preliminary analysis shows that the summertime annual median ozone in the residual layer (between 150 – 3000 m above ground) has decreased by approximately 36% over the 2008 – 2013 period. The time series of daily 1-hr and 8-hr maximum ozone concentrations at a downtown Fresno monitoring site, and daily maximum ozone concentrations in the residual layer show similar patterns, although ozone in the residual layer shows stronger decreasing trends compared to the surface measurements. This, perhaps, indicates that the ozone in the residual layer over Fresno contains contributions from surrounding areas during the daytime. In addition, the ozone trend in the residual layer follows a similar decreasing trend as the reduction of basin-wide emissions of ozone precursors such as NOx and VOCs, which have decreased by 31% and 8%, respectively over the 2005 – 2010 period. The US EPA’s CAMQ model will be utilized to model ozone concentrations during the summer months of 2012, and the vertical distributions will be compared with those obtained from the APOB measurements to determine how well the model predicts the measured profiles. Potential improvements to the modeling will be tested if found necessary.\nKeywords: residual layer, ozone, San Joaquin Valley, CMAQ",

            "abstract": "Bergmann’s Rule predicts that body sizes of species in cold regions are larger than body sizes of species in warm regions. Using Bergmann’s Rule, we have used data on Ostracods (microscopic crustaceans) that includes their stratigraphic ranges and body size to create graphs to help us identify whether this hypothesis is true. We started by plotting the mean size throughout geologic time, from the Cambrian period to the Holocene. We also plotted the temperature changes within this time range. Both mean size and temperature gradually decreased through time. When we compare size and temperature directly, we notice a positive correlation of the mean body size versus the average temperature of the Earth over the past 540 million years; however, this graph contradicts Bergmann’s Rule. Evidently, as environmental temperature decreased over time, the mean size of Ostracods also decreased. Lastly, we created our last plot on volume and paleolatitude. The latitude is used as a proxy for temperature because it is difficult to decipher an exact degree of temperature throughout time. Our results demonstrated that as latitude increased, the volume decreased. We discovered a weak, but significant relationship between volume and latitude with a correlation coefficient of -0.144 (p-value << 0.001). This proves that a genus that occurs in multiple locations or time intervals has the same size in our data due to the limitation that we only have one measurement per genus. In conclusion, using stratigraphic range data, our project exemplified a correlation with the mean size and mean global sea surface temperatures since the Cambrian. This relationship, though, is not as obvious when you look at size vs. paleolatitude. We have found that Bergmann’s Rule, which was initially described for mammals, does not apply to Ostracods. This is likely due to distinct physiological consequences of environmental temperature for endotherms and ectotherms.",

We report on the topographic roughness measurements on two natural fault surfaces with a continuous length-scale range from 1 nm to 3 mm. The fault surfaces observed in this study include (1) the Corona Heights fault in the Castro Area of San Francisco, detail microstructures reported by Kirkpatrick et al., (2013), and (2) the Itozawa fault in Fukushima prefecture, a fault moved just after the 2011 Off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku earthquake. To measure fault surface to we performed line-measurements both parallel and perpendicular to the slickenlines using two scanner devices; a confocal white-light scanning microscope (measurable range: 0.15 ˜ 3000 μm) and a scanning probe microscope (1 ˜ 50000 nm). The topographic properties of the measured surfaces were expressed either as a Hurst exponent (H) which are calculated from Power Spectrum Density (PSD) of topography data.\nThe measurements revealed that the Corona Heights fault and the Itozawa fault exhibit a similar geometrical property, a linear behavior on a log-log plot where axes are PSD and spatial length scale. A slope of the log-log plot, H, of the Corona Heights fault and the Itozawa fault shows HN = 0.76 ± 0.01 perpendicular to the slickenslide and HP = 0.84 ± 0.01 parallel to it, and HN = 0.88 ± 0.01 and HP = 0.91 ± 0.01, respectively. The measurements on both faults show HP are higher than HN, which is inconsistent with previous results that HP is small compared to HN because surface roughness in the slip direction becomes less pronounced selectively with progressive displacement. (e.g., Sagy et al., 2007). There is a hypotheses that explain the difference that HP and HN are undifferentiated with displacement in the length-scale range from 1 nm to 3 mm．\nCandela et al., (2012) measured roughness of 13 earthquake fault surfaces and suggested that the fault geometry can be expressed as a single geometrical description (i.e., single H) over a range of scales from 50 μm to 50 km. Our data, at least HN = 0.88 ± 0.01 perpendicular to the slickenlines, is approximately consistent with their universal HN = 0.81 ± 0.04. The geometric complexity of fault surfaces in nature can be maintained over length-scales from nm- to km and be described as the single H.",

Samples were collected and vertical profiles of particulate (>51 µm and 0-51 µm) and dissolved (< 0.45 µm) phases from six Super Stations along the East Pacific Zonal Transect of the GEOTRACES cruise were analyzed. The primary objectives of this investigation include: i) to compare the scavenging intensity of 210Po and 210Pb at the high-productivity Peru margin to that in the Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) in the upper 300 m to the mesopelagic waters; ii) to quantify the differences in the scavenging intensity of 210Po and 210Pb between the bottom waters at the East Pacific Rise (EPR) to those in other stations including the station where OMZ were found; and iii) to evaluate the preferential scavenging of 210Po and/or 210Pb, if any, from the dissolved and particulate concentrations of 210Po, 210Pb, Fe, and Mn within the plume of the EPR. From preliminary 210Po results, we report the following: i) both dissolved and particulate 210Po concentrations in the South Pacific appear to be significantly higher than those of the North Atlantic; ii) the maximum concentration of 210Po is generally found between 100 and 200 m, likely due to remineralization of sinking particulate matter with 210Po/210Pb activity ratio of >1.0; and iii) in one third of stations, we observed active scavenging near the sediment-water interface, indicating removal of 210Po (and likely 210Pb) by suspended particulate matter in the bottom nepheloid layer. The preliminary modeling of the particulate and dissolved 210Po and 210Pb, the relative importance of Mn- and Fe-oxides in the EPR plume, differences in the scavenging intensity of these nuclides at critical interfaces such as mesopelagic waters at OMZ, highly productive waters at the Peru margin, and near the sediment-water interface will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Between 2005 and 2012, there were 14 large dike intrusions into the Dabbahu rift segment in the Afar rift, Ethiopia. Swarms of earthquakes with local magnitudes between 1.45<ML<4.7 occurred during the magma intrusion sequence, and hundreds of faults had visible surface displacements. Spectral analyses of the swarms accompanying the November 2007 and October 2008 diking events found 173 earthquakes with more low-frequency content and longer codas than expected for typical volcano-tectonic events. These unusual earthquakes were classified as low-frequency hybrid events based on peak frequency and percent of energy below 2 Hz.\nPrevious studies in other volcanic regions have found similar events, which has led to debate about what causes these events and how best to classify them. Explanations for hybrid events include both source and path effects, though the results from previous work and this study suggest that the Afar hybrids are largely a result of path effects based on high attenuation (Q ~ 200) and azimuthal dependence of spectral content. However, large (~3m) surface displacements on short faults indicate that unusual source processes, such as slow rupture times, may also be a factor in these hybrid events. \nThe aims of this study are to distinguish between path and source effects, to characterize the source processes of these events, and to explore the relation between hybrid and normal tectonic events in the region – are the differences in the source or only in the path? For closely located earthquakes, an Empirical Green's Function approach is a great method to isolate the source-time function. Spectral analysis of the source-time function can be used to provide insights into the rupture time, stress drop, and scaling relations of the earthquakes. These results will be used to further refine earthquake classifications and determine if there are any defining characteristics of the classes that associate them with specific faulting processes, such as surface ruptures, that occur during diking events.",

            "abstract": "Strong multiples were observed in marine seismic data of Los Angeles Regional Seismic Experiment (LARSE).It is crucial to eliminate these multiples in conventional ray-based or one-way wave-equation based depth image methods. As long as multiples contain information of target zone along travelling path, it’s possible to use them as signal, to improve the illumination coverage thus enhance the image quality of structural boundaries. Reverse time migration including multiples is a two-way wave-equation based prestack depth image method that uses both primaries and multiples to map structural boundaries. Several factors, including source wavelet, velocity model, back ground noise, data acquisition geometry and preprocessing workflow may influence the quality of image. The source wavelet is estimated from direct arrival of marine seismic data. Migration velocity model is derived from integrated model building workflow, and the sharp velocity interfaces near sea bottom needs to be preserved in order to generate multiples in the forward and backward propagation steps. The strong amplitude, low frequency marine back ground noise needs to be removed before the final imaging process. High resolution reverse time image sections of LARSE Lines 1 and Line 2 show five interfaces: depth of sea-bottom, base of sedimentary basins, top of Catalina Schist, a deep layer and a possible pluton boundary. Catalina Schist shows highs in the San Clemente ridge, Emery Knoll, Catalina Ridge, under Catalina Basin on both the lines, and a minor high under Avalon Knoll. The high of anticlinal fold in Line 1 is under the north edge of Emery Knoll and under the San Clemente fault zone. An area devoid of any reflection features are interpreted as sides of an igneous plume.",

            "abstract": "The axial melt lens (AML) is a steady-state magma-rich body located at the dyke-gabbro transition at intermediate- and fast-spreading ridges. It is widely believed to be the reservoir from which mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) is erupted. The paradox of the axial melt lens is that the plutonic rocks that occur at this level are far too evolved to be in equilibrium with MORB, which is basaltic by definition; hence, the plutonic and volcanic records do not match. We explore this paradox by study of the first comprehensive sample suite of the uppermost plutonics of a fast-spreading ridge, taken by remotely-operated vehicle from the Hess Deep rift during cruise JC21. 23 samples (8 dolerites, 14 gabbronorites, and 1 gabbro) were collected from a section containing the transition from the uppermost gabbroic section into sheeted dykes. We present the results of a detailed petrographic and microanalytical investigation of these samples. They are dominated by evolved, varitextured (both in hand sample and thin section) oxide gabbronorites; olivine occurs in only one sample. A preponderance of the samples have positive Eu/Eu* and Sr/Sr*, indicating a cumulate origin. However, the minerals have evolved compositions, and are in equilibrium with melts significantly more evolved than East Pacific Rise MORB. Furthermore, the trace element contents of clinopyroxene differ significantly from clinopyroxene in equilibrium with MORB, being more enriched in incompatible elements.\nTo account for both the evidence of derivation of MORB from the AML and the evolved nature of its rock record, we posit that the AML must be fed by melts on two different timescales: continual low-volume feeding by evolved interstitial melt from the cumulus pile below is augmented episodically by delivery of high volumes of more primitive melt. The latter episodes may trigger eruptions; hence the primitive melts are held in the magma chamber for only short periods, and erupt on the seafloor before significant crystallisation in the AML has taken place. This model for the feeding of the AML provides ample opportunity for mixing between the relatively primitive melts and the evolved, trace-element-rich melt, and accounts for the observed over-enrichment in incompatible elements of MORB.",

Here we present adjoint techniques as a new, computationally efficient means of helping to minimize these uncertainites. Automatic differentiation tools are used to construct the adjoint model of the 2009 Barahona and Nenes ice nucleation parameterization (ABN13), run in both the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 and the Goddard Earth Observing System Model version 5 at pressure levels relevant to both cirrus and mixed-phase clouds. Ice crystal number sensitivities to dynamic and aerosol inputs are calculated using two empirical spectra (Phillips et al. 2008 and Phillips et al. 2013) and one spectrum based on classical nucleation theory (Barahona and Nenes 2009). At cirrus-relevant altitudes, the sensitivity can be used to classify freezing regime; we see large regions of homogeneous freezing in the tropics but predominantly heterogeneous freezing elsewhere. The more recent empirical spectrum indicates the importance of accumulation mode dust number; of appropriately representating vertical motions; and of accurate threshold supersaturations in determining in-cloud crystal number on a global scale. Glassy aerosol has a small, seasonally-dependent contribution at high altitudes, while the global contribution of black carbon to ice number becomes negligible. Attribution analyses also allows us to pinpoint which variables and regions generate the most variability in ice crystal number, and whether this variability comes from inherent parameterization biases or from input fluctuations.",

            "abstract": "A recent paper [\nNeff et al., 2014\n]examined the factors underlying the 2012 melt episode that covered the Greenland ice sheet and compared it with the same factors identified for the last episode in 1889, using the Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR: [\nCompo et al., 2011\n]). A key factor was the presence of an Atmospheric River (AR) that transported warm air from a mid-continent heat wave over the Atlantic Ocean and thence to the west coast of Greenland and then over the ice sheet. The 20CR proved quite effective in defining the structure and transport paths for both events. Although these events with wide spread melting of the ice sheet surface are extremely rare, a question remains as to the frequency of AR events and the ancillary conditions required for extensive melting of the ice sheet. Although the 20CR was effective in capturing the structure of AR events in 1889, an analysis of the northward transport of moisture off the west coast of Greenland at 850 hPa shows weaker transport prior to 1921 than after. In this study, we use time series of meridional velocity and specific humidity at 850 hPa during boreal summer months as a screening tool for high transport events. We attribute the muted representation of synoptic features to be an artifact of of sparse available stations reporting pressure along the northeast coast of Canada prior to 1921. For this reason we use different thresholds before and after 1921 to identify potential AR events. For each potential event we then examine maps of integrated water vapor between 240oW to 340oW and 20oN to 80oN to identify those with the IWV pattern characteristic of an AR. In our earlier study, we used the only station, Ilulissat, recording daily data on the west coast of Greenland corresponding to the entire1871-2012 period of the 20CR for verification of events in 1889 and 2012. In that analysis, temperatures maximized prior to each event together with light precipitation on the coast. In this study, we have used this station to further verify our results.\nCompo, G.

The most-recent sapropel S1 formed basin-wide, synchronously between 9.8 and 5.7 14C ky BP at all water depths greater than ~200m. Increased fresh water (monsoon) input, and associated stratification resulted in the deep (> 1.8 km) eastern Mediterranean Sea to be devoid of oxygen during most of the 4,000 years of S1 formation. This resulted in a differential basin-wide preservation of S1 determined by water depth, as a result of different predominant ventilation/climate-related redox conditions above and below 1.8 km.\nThe end of this period was marked by a basin-wide sedimentary manganese-oxide  peak representing abrupt re-ventilation and remaining oxic conditions thereafter. Other, short-term ventilation events occurred during S1, notably the 8.2 ka event. This basin-wide event marks a brief episode of not only re-oxygenated deep water thus reduced preservation, but also decreased primary productivity thus lower nutrient supply. Ventilation is closely linked to Aegean/Adriatic deepwater formation.\nSapropel formation and preservation mechanisms are related to a sensitive interplay between N-African monsoonal and northern climate systems.",

They also play an important role in a wide range of industrial applications, from ground water hydrology and soil mechanics to agricultural engineering. The interaction between one or more moving fluids (e.g. rising gas immersed in a granular medium) and grains control the dynamics of these phenomena. Due to their economic and ecological importance, it is essential to understand the variety and potentiality of these phenomena.\nWhen an ascending air passes trough an immersed granular bed its fluidized producing the grains to start to move. When this process is repeated, its created a fluidized zone that evolves over time. Here, we investigate the morphology and dynamics of the region invaded by air as a function of a dimensionless parameter χ which accounts for the relative effects of the gravity and the capillarity. We propose new experimental observations on the air invasion regimes and on the morphology of the fluidized zone, in particular its growth dynamics.",

            "abstract": "A quiet revolution is taking place in ocean observations; in the last decade new multi-platform, integrated ocean observatories have been progressively implemented by forward looking countries with ocean borders of economic and strategic importance. These systems are designed to fill significant gaps in our knowledge of the ocean state and ocean variability, through long-term, science and society-led, ocean monitoring. These ocean observatories are now delivering results, not the headline results of a single issue experiment, but carefully and systematically improving our knowledge of ocean variability, and thereby, increasing model forecast skill and our ability to link physical processes to ecosystem response.\nHere we present the results from a 3-year quasi-continuous glider monitoring of a key circulation ‘choke’ point in the Western Mediterranean, undertaken by SOCIB (Balearic Islands Coastal Ocean Observing and Forecasting System). For the first time data from the high frequency glider sampling show variations in the transport volumes of water over timescales of days to weeks, as large as those previously only identifiable as seasonal or eddy driven. Although previous surveys noted high cruise-to-cruise variability, they were insufficient to show that in fact water volumes exchanged through this narrow ‘choke’ point fluctuate on ‘weather’ timescales. Using the glider data to leverage an 18-year record of ship missions, we define new seasonal cycles for the exchange of watermasses, challenging generally held assumptions. The pattern of the exchange is further simplified through the characterisation of 5 circulation modes and the defining of a new seasonal cycle for the interplay between mesoscale and basin scale dynamics.\nRestricted ‘choke points’ between our ocean basins are critical locations to monitor water transport variability, as they constrain the inter-basin exchange of heat, salt and nutrients. At the Ibiza Channel 'choke' point, the exchange of watermass is known to affect local ecosystems, including the spawning grounds of commercially important fish stocks, at a biodiversity hotspot. This new insight will be vital in improving our ocean model forecast skill and in the development of integrated ocean products for society.",

            "abstract": "Precisely locating earthquakes is fundamentally important for studying earthquake physics, fault orientations and Earth's deformation. In industry, accurately determining hypocenters of microseismic events triggered in the course of a hydraulic fracturing treatment can help improve the production of oil and gas from unconventional reservoirs.\nWe develop a novel earthquake location method based on solving full wave equations to accurately locate earthquakes (including microseismic earthquakes) in complex and heterogeneous structures. Traveltime residuals or differential traveltime measurements with the waveform cross-correlation technique are iteratively inverted to obtain the locations of earthquakes. The inversion process involves the computation of the Fréchet derivative with respect to the source (earthquake) location via the interaction between a forward wavefield emitting from the source to the receiver and an adjoint wavefield reversely propagating from the receiver to the source. When there is a source perturbation, the Fréchet derivative not only measures the influence of source location but also the effects of heterogeneity, anisotropy and attenuation of the subsurface structure on the arrival of seismic wave at the receiver. This is essential for the accuracy of earthquake location in complex media. In addition, to reduce the computational cost, we can first assume that seismic wave only propagates in a vertical plane passing through the source and the receiver. The forward wavefield, adjoint wavefield and Fréchet derivative with respect to the source location are all computed in a 2D vertical plane. By transferring the Fréchet derivative along the horizontal direction of the 2D plane into the ones along Latitude and Longitude coordinates or local 3D Cartesian coordinates, the source location can be updated in a 3D geometry. The earthquake location obtained with this combined 2D-3D approach can then be used as the initial location for a true 3D wave-equation earthquake location method. It is expected that this newly developed method can accurately obtain the origin time and hypocenter location of an earthquake (e.g., microseismic earthquake) in a complex structure. Moreover, the approach is suitable for estimating velocity structure as well as event location.",

As temperature and precipitation regimes shift, the total biomass and species composition may change in ways that promote further warming on the regional level through atmosphere-vegetation feedbacks. Changes in vegetation cover and the resulting atmosphere-vegetation feedbacks may be the determining factors in how regional terrestrial carbon stores change with climate change. This project reports on the development of a new spatially-explicit individual-based gap model SibBorK that can be utilized to investigate the potential changes in biomass and species composition in the Siberian boreal forest over the coming decades and centuries.\nSibBorK tracks the establishment, growth, and mortality of individual trees on 0.01-ha plots within a 9-ha simulation area. The new model is based on the principles of the ZELIG vegetation model, implemented in Python to facilitate interface with geographic information systems for explicit modeling of vegetation across artificial and real terrain. SibBorK was trained on modal (actual) regional forestry yield tables for southern taiga region of central Siberia. The model was calibrated and tested against the regional forestry yield tables, and further tested against an independent dataset from a forest inventory. Model comparisons were made on monospecies and mixed species stands, and included the evaluation of total stand biomass, species-specific biomass, species composition, and stem density based on site index and terrain elevation. Additionally, species distribution along altitudinal gradients and total biomass for specific locations was independently tested against other published forest inventory values. SibBorK is particularly good at predicting biomass and species composition on poor soils, with Orlov site indices III-V, which dominate the Siberian landscape. Herein, SibBorK is used to explore species distribution along soil quality and altitudinal gradients, as well as slope aspects within a complex terrain. SibBorK is further employed in a climate sensitivity analysis.",

But with declining investment in science across most of the Western World, a major challenge for society is where best to place what little resource we have. Which research questions should have the greatest priority? Nowhere are these issues more pressing than in the Antarctic, where bases have and continue to play host to ‘big-science’, multi-year programmes of research, locking up logistical support and costs. But in a warming world, the areas with the greatest effects of climate change aren’t always near government research stations.\nWith this in mind, in 2012 a plan was formed to visit Commonwealth Bay, a remote area off the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, where in 2010, an iceberg the size of Rhode Island, known as B09B, dramatically knocked a 60-mile long tongue of ice off the Mertz Glacier into the Southern Ocean, setting off a cascade of change. Inspired by the expeditions of the past, we advertised berths for sale to take citizen scientists south with us, harnessing their interest, experience and investment. People responded far and wide. We were oversubscribed, and the Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013-2014 was born. With the Russian-owned MV Akademik Shokalskiy as the expedition vessel, we set out south from the New Zealand port of Bluff in late November 2013. During our journey south and on the ice we undertook a number of scientific firsts for the region actively engaging the volunteer scientists on board in projects ranging from oceanography, biology, ecology, geology and glaciaology. The expedition demostrated how private funding could support targeted programmes of research and communicate it to the wider world. Small-science research can capture the public’s imagination and also reap real scientific outputs. Although it is a funding model developed in the Antarctic a hundred years ago, the beauty is it can applied anywhere in the world.",

However, there is a substantial thermal history gap between these end-member events, because few thermochronometers provide access to temperatures of ~300-120°C. Such data are critical for evaluating Kaapvaal’s response to Proterozoic lateral accretion and intracontinental magmatism. Our study assesses cratonic stability by applying a little-utilized but promising mid-temperature thermochronologic technique, titanite (U-Th)/He dating, to decipher cooling through 230-190°C (based on early diffusion studies).\nWe obtained titanite (U-Th)/He data for Archean basement samples across an ~200,000 km2 area of the northern Kaapvaal craton. Multiple samples with titanite eU values < 70 ppm yield He dates as old as 1200-800 Ma. In contrast, titanites with eU of 70-700 ppm yield younger dates (350-20 Ma) that display a dramatic correlation between date and eU. This pattern clearly manifests the influence of radiation damage on titanite He retentivity that has been observed in other He thermochronometers, but never previously documented for titanite. There is strong future potential to exploit this effect to decipher more detailed thermal histories, as has been done for apatite and zircon He thermochronometry. In our dataset, the oldest titanite results postdate extensive ~1.4-1.2 Ga carbonatite and kimberlite magmatism across the Kaapvaal craton, and overlap with ~1.2-1.1 Ga Namaqua-Natal arc accretion and ~1.1 Ga Umkondo intraplate large igneous province activity. The volcanic character of many of the northern Kaapvaal alkaline and carbonatite complexes indicates that the basement was exhumed to the surface by the time of their emplacement. This constraint, combined with the titanite He dates that record cooling through ~200 °C, implies 7-10 km of regional unroofing at ca. 1.0 Ga. Additional work is underway to determine the spatial extent of this substantial, but previously unidentified, erosional event to better establish its cause.",

This means that Mars will be enveloped by the outer parts of the cometary coma which consists of neutral gases, mostly water and associated molecules. Some percentage of this gas is being continually ionized thus creating a cometary ion tail which will also intersect with Mars. The amount of gas and plasma interacting with Mars depends on the production rate of gas as it sublimates from the cometary nucleus (the cometary “activity”). This activity is still uncertain but based on the most recent observations it is plausible that the amount of inflowing plasma will be temporarily comparable to the amount from a large solar storm. This means that the martian induced magnetosphere will be significantly distorted from its baseline configuration. It also means that the inflowing cometary plasma will temporarily enhance the atmospheric escape from the martian atmosphere. We will present observations by the magnetometer on MAVEN during the comet’s passage and discuss the physical implications of the observations for the comet’s effect on the martian magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock consisting primarily of clay and silt, and is of particular interest with respect to hydrocarbon production as both a source and seal rock. The deformation and fracture properties of shale depend on the mechanical properties of its basic constituents, including solid clay particles, inclusions such as silt and organics, and multiscale porosity. This paper presents the results of a combined experimental/numerical investigation into the mechanical behavior of shale at the nanoscale. Large grids of nanoindentation tests, spanning various length scales ranging from 200-20000 nanometers deep, were performed on a sample of Woodford shale in both the bedding plane normal (BPN) and bedding plane parallel (BPP) directions. The nanoindentions were performed in order to determine the mechanical properties of the constituent materials in situ as well as those of the highly heterogeneous composite material at this scale. Focused ion beam (FIB) milling and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used in conjunction (FIB-SEM) to obtain 2D and 3D images characterizing the heterogeneity of the shale at this scale. The constituent materials were found to be best described as consisting of near micrometer size clay and silt particles embedded in a mixed organic/clay matrix, with some larger (near 10 micrometers in diameter) pockets of organic material evident. Indented regions were identified through SEM, allowing the 200-1000 nanometer deep indentations to be classified according to the constituent materials which they engaged. We use nonlinear finite element modeling to capture results of low-load (on the order of milliNewtons) and high-load (on the order of a few Newtons) nanoindentation tests. Experimental results are used to develop a 3D mechanistic model that interprets the results of nanoindentation tests on specimens of Woodford shale with quantified heterogeneity.",

Io's aurora was monitored over a full variation cycle of the Jovian magnetic field to map the temporal behavior of the bright auroral spots. The aurora oscillates around the equator roughly in correlation with the time-variable orientation of the local magnetic field of Jupiter. Magnetic field perturbations near Io measured by the Galileo spacecraft were proposed to originate from induction in an electrically conductive global magma ocean. If magnetic induction modifies Io's local magnetic field environment, it will also alter the time-variable morphology of the aurora. We analyze the observed aurora variability and compare it to theoretically predicted spot morphologies for different magma ocean properties. Additionally, we compare the global O and S aurora morphology and brightness in the new observations to a large set of previous STIS images taken over a decade ago between 1997 and 2001 and investigate long-term changes of Io's neutral and plasma environment.",

            "abstract": "Over 100,000 students obtain a bachelor's degree in education every year; these students most commonly encounter the geosciences through a general education course, and it may be the only geoscience course they ever take. However, the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) contain much more Earth science content than previous standards. In addition, the NGSS emphasize the use of science and engineering practices in the K-12 classroom. Future teachers need to experience learning science as a scientist, through a hands-on, activity-based learning process, in order to give them the skills they need to teach science that same way in the future. In order to be successful at teaching the NGSS, both current and future teachers will need more than a single course in geoscience or science methods. As a result, there is now a key opportunity for geoscience programs to play a vital role in strengthening teacher preparation programs, both through introductory courses and beyond.\nTo help programs and individual faculty take advantage of this opportunity, we have developed a set of web-based resources, informed by participants in the InTeGrate program as well as by faculty in exemplary teacher preparation programs. The pages address the program-level task of creating engaging and effective courses for teacher preparation programs, with the goal of introducing education majors to the active pedagogies and geoscience methods they will later use in their own classrooms. A collection of exemplary Teacher Preparation programs is also included. Additional pages provide information on what it means to be an “expert thinker” in the geosciences and how individual faculty and teachers can explicitly teach these valuable skills that are reflected in the science and engineering practices of the NGSS.\nLearn more on the InTeGrate web site about preparing future teachers: serc.carleton.edu/integrate/programs/teacher_prep.html\nand training expert thinkers: serc.carleton.edu/integrate/teaching_materials/expert_thinkers.html",

            "abstract": "Molecular clock analysis of extant plant lineages consistently place the earliest appearance of the C4 photosynthetic pathway in the mid-to-late Oligocene, coincident with a decline in atmospheric CO2 and a spread of dry environments. Most of the approximately 70 known lineages of C4 photosynthesis, however, evolved over the subsequent 23 million years since the Oligocene. Examination of living C3-C4 intermediate species, and close C3 relatives of modern C4 lineages, indicate that the C4 pathway evolved in regions of high heat and episodic drought and/or salinity, usually in the drier ends of the monsoon belts of the subtropics. Soils associated with transitional species are typically sandy, rocky, or salinized, and have low vegetation density, which in combination with high air temperature allows for high surface heat loads that warm leaves to near 45°C. Under such conditions in low CO2 atmospheres, the rate of photorespiration is very high and would greatly impair C3 photosynthesis and establish conditions favoring C4 evolution. However, studies with modern taxa do not address whether the extreme habitats proposed to facilitate C4 evolution were actually present at the time when the C4 pathway evolved in any given lineage. Here, we examine the paleo-record to evaluate the environmental conditions present in the C4 centres of origin when the respective transitions from C3 to C4 photosynthesis are estimated to have occurred.",

These emissions are primarily observed on the dayside and detected between L shells of 3 to 6, though some events are observed down to L shells of ~2. EMFISIS simultaneously measures the vector wave magnetic field and, with the support of the Electric Fields and Waves (EFW) instrument sensors, the vector wave electric field at two locations in Earth's magnetosphere in a continuous survey mode (typically with a 6 second cadence) along with a number of different burst modes to provide high time resolution waveforms (35000 samples per second). These two modes allow a systematic survey of the occurrence of these waves. By measuring all six wave components simultaneously, the wave propagation parameters, such as the wave normal angle and Poynting vector, of these plasma wave emissions are obtained. We will present a statistical survey of the properties of these waves as detected by the Van Allen Probes, examine their occurrence location and use burst data to examine the fine structure of individual events.",

The scheme treats cloud drop, cloud ice, rain, and snow number concentrations and mixing ratios as diagnostic variables and incorporates processes of autoconversion, self-collection, collection between hydrometeor species, sedimentation, ice nucleation, drop activation, homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing, and the Bergeron-Findeisen process. Such detailed representation of microphysical processes makes the scheme suitable for studying the interactions between aerosols and convection, as well as aerosols' indirect effects on clouds and their roles in climate change.\nThe scheme is first tested in the single column version of the GFDL AM3 using forcing data obtained at the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurment project's Southern Great Planes site. Scheme's impact on SCM simulations is discussed. As the next step, runs of the full atmospheric GCM incorporating the new parameterization are compared to the unmodified version of GFDL AM3.

This includes the Southern Appalachian Mountains, which rely closely on the moisture input from fog, cap clouds and light rainfall, as well as cloud forests in the Andes with frequent occurrence of dense fog. However, the applicability of fog forecasting models becomes limited in regions of complex terrain. The motivation of this project is to develop a satellite-based hydroclimatology and physical parameterization of orographic low-level clouds and fog regimes in the Southern Appalachians using a general methodology that can be applied to mountainous regions elsewhere. An algorithm for the detection and extraction of stratus clouds and fog was developed using changes in vertical gradients of CPR reflectivity and liquid water products from almost 5-years of CLOUDSAT and SRTM terrain data. This population of low-level clouds and fog will be analyzed with GOES infrared and visible imagery, MODIS and CALIPSO products, and with airport cloud height and visibility records to expand the spatial coverage beyond narrow satellite sensor swaths. The climatology will be further developed through integration with results from WRF simulations for selected periods since the bulk of the PMM network has been in place (2008-present) to aid in defining meteorological and time-of-day constraints in the interpretation of simulated satellite radar reflectivity profiles. The overarching goal is to infer a representation of the diurnal cycle, seasonal and inter-annual variations of the vertical distribution of LWC and hydrometeors in orographic clouds and fog that vary spatially with landform toward developing a more general parameterization of seeder-feeder interactions in microphysical models.",

            "abstract": "Given the growing investment in coastal activities, such as industrial and residential settings, proper understanding of oceanographic and meteorological phenomena over such areas became very important. The winds play a major role in this context, being the main source of energy for gravity waves generation in the ocean, and determining the characterization of severe weather conditions. In this study, a statistical analysis of extreme values was applied to wind data from National Centers for Environmental Prediction and National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis (NCEP-I) grid points with 2.5º of spacial resolution and results from a simulation with the BRAMS model in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean region with 0.25º of resolution. The Peaks Over Threshold (POT) technique was applied and the analysis focused on the behavior of extreme values according to the wind direction and the resolution of the original data. The period of analysis goes from 1982 to 2011 and the domain goes from 40ºS to 5ºN latitude and 70ºW to 10ºW longitude. The POT method demanded that peaks chosen for analysis were independent and identically distributed and a minimum interval of 48 hours was given to separate the subset sampled for analysis. The peak excesses above a determined threshold were adjusted to the Generalized Pareto Distribution and extrapolation to 50 years return periods was built in each grid point. General large-scale patterns of 50-yr return values were similar for both datasets used. However, more details were verified in the analysis of simulation results with BRAMS, given the dependence of the methodology to the resolution of the original set. Thus, the greater detailing suggests the inclusion of mesoscale features originating these extreme values. In the northern part of the domain, extreme winds were weaker and prevailed from north, northeast and east, given the influence of the trade winds and the positioning of the South Atlantic Subtropical High. On the other hand, in the southern area, the extreme values were more severe and all wind directions were significant. This result suggests the influence of a larger number of phenomena originating the extreme value, such as front passages and cyclones.",

            "abstract": "The Long Wavelength Array Station 1 (LWA1) provides excellent spectral and temporal resolution of Jupiter’s decametric radio emissions over the bandwidth of 10-40 MHz. Using the full Stokes capabilities of LWA1 we show high resolution data of many well-known decametric features in Jupiter’s spectrum including nested-arc structure, modulation lanes, S-bursts, narrow band N-events, and S-N event interactions. These new data allow for the testing of emission mechanisms relating to emission geometry, source locations, propagation paths, and S-burst acceleration models. In particular, LWA1 data showing simultaneous modulation lanes in both polarizations for a Jupiter Io-C event suggest that both polarizations might be coming from the same hemisphere, contrary to the emission theory. The well-known S-bursts show very complex structures such as frequency drifting, source splitting, and combination. Initial calculations of S-burst frequency drift rates are similar to previous data but new measurements at higher frequencies will help understand the electron acceleration mechanism. Moreover, some S-bursts show interaction with N-events by either triggering or quenching the resonance set up in the source emission zone. The linearly polarized feeds on LWA1 instrument also show excellent Faraday fringes in the Jupiter observations. Further analyses are needed to understand these phenomena and other features of Jupiter’s decametric spectrum. We show Jupiter spectra and highlight the new capabilities of the LWA1 telescope.",

The temporal and spatial distribution of atmospheric aerosols depends largely on the atmospheric parameters. Time series analysis using a stochastic model reveals that atmospheric aerosols over India exhibit a long-term memory. Our analysis confirms that by using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model we can parsimoniously model the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Indian region with a reasonably good accuracy. This major advantage of this method is that by using past observations we were able to generate forecasts for next 3 years. The forecasts thus generate shows a good fit with the observations. This persistence is due to the presence of temporal dependence between successive observations.",

In addition, it is of interest to understand how short-term fluctuations of the dynamo field are eliminated through the electrically conducting mantle before searching for high-frequency waves or attempting to assimilate magnetic field data in dynamic models of the core.\nThe classical approach has consisted in prescribing the magnetic field at the CMB.\nThen, the respective parts played by spherically symmetric conducting layers in the transformation of the core signal can be determined as a function of the distance to the core surface. An immediate observation is that conductivity of mantle rocks just above the CMB, where the field is prescribed, has negligible influence.\nIn this classical framework, writing the transfer function Γ(ω) as a truncated power series in the pulsation ω severely overestimates the screening of high frequency signals by the mantle.\nHowever, the appropriate approach to the problem consists in coupling magnetic field solutions in the core and in the mantle. We rely on dynamo simulations to determine anew the respective role of the different conducting layers of the solid mantle in the transformation of the dynamo field.",

CATS will be mounted on the Japanese Experiment Module's Exposed Facility and will provide near-continuous, altitude-resolved measurements of clouds and aerosols in the Earth’s atmosphere. The ISS orbit path provides a unique opportunity to capture the full diurnal cycle of cloud and aerosol development and transport, allowing for studies that are not possible with the lidar aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission, which flies in the sun-synchronous A-Train orbit.\nOne of the primary objectives of CATS is to continue the CALIPSO data record to provide continuity of aerosol and cloud lidar observations during the transition from CALIPSO to EarthCARE. To accomplish this, the CATS project at GSFC and the CALIPSO project at NASA’s Langley Research Center are closely collaborating to develop and deliver a full suite of CALIPSO-like level 2 data products generated from the newly acquired CATS level 1B data. Now in its eighth year of on-orbit operations, the CALIPSO project has developed a robust set of mature and well-validated science algorithms to retrieve the spatial and optical properties of clouds and aerosols from multi-wavelength lidar backscatter signal. By leveraging both new and existing NASA technical resources, this joint effort by the CATS-CALIPSO team will enable rapid delivery of high-quality lidar data sets to the user community at the earliest possible opportunity. In this work we outline the development of the CALIPSO- CATS level 2 software and data products and describe the modifications made to the input CATS data stream and the CALIPSO processing algorithms in order to successfully interface two disparate data processing systems. We use simulated CATS level 1B data to provide an initial assessment of CALIPSO-like CATS level 2 data quality, and highlight those areas where the CALIPSO-like analyses of the CATS multi-beam measurements are likely to contribute to improved understanding of cloud and aerosol interactions, transport and formation processes.",

            "abstract": "Surface/groundwater interactions are an important, but poorly understood, facet of mountain hydrology. We utilize ground electrical resistivity data as a key tool for mapping groundwater pathways and aquifers. However, surface resistivity profiling is limited in both spatial extent and depth, especially in mountainous headwater environments because of inaccessibility and terrain. Because this important groundwater recharge environment is poorly understood, WyCEHG has focused efforts to increase knowledge about the dynamics and location of groundwater recharge. Currently, traditional hydrologic measurements estimate that only 10% of annual snowmelt enters the groundwater system while the rest is immediately available to surface flow. The Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics (WyCEHG) collected a 40 sq. km survey of helicopter transient electromagnetic (HTEM) and aeromagnetic data during the fall of 2013 as the first step in a “top down” geophysical characterization of a mountainous headwater catchment in the Snowy Range, Wyoming. Furthermore, mountain springs in the Snowy Range suggests that the “groundwatershed” acts as both a sink and source to surface watersheds. HTEM data show horizontal electrical conductors at depth, which are currently interpreted as fluid-filled subsurface fractures. Because these fractures eventually connect to the surface, they could be geophysical evidence of connectivity between the watershed and “groundwatershed.” However, current HTEM inversion techniques assume a layered homogenous subsurface model, which directly contradicts two characteristics of the Snowy Range: the subvertical bedding of the Cheyenne Belt and heterogeneous distribution of surface water. Ground electrical resistivity surveys and surface nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements collected during the summer of 2014 target these anomalies to determine their validity and further understand the complicated dynamic of surface and groundwater flow.",

            "abstract": "This presentation examines the sources of uncertainty for the Forced Diffusion (FD) chamber soil respiration (Rs) measurement technique, and demonstrates a protocol for uncertainty quantification that could be appropriate with any soil flux technique. Here, we sought to quantify and compare the three primary sources of uncertainty in Rs: (1) instrumentation error, (2) scaling error, defined as spatial variability of Rs across an ecosystem, and (3) random error, defined as the temporal variability of Rs at a single location, under a narrow temperature, moisture, and time range. In laboratory studies, we found that FD instrumentation error remained constant as Rs increased. In field studies from five North American ecosystems, we found that as Rs increased from winter to peak growing season, scaling error increased by about 50% of average Rs, and random error was about 40% of average Rs. Random error, which is the residual temporal variability left unexplained by soil temperature and moisture, not only scales with soil flux, but scales in a consistent way (same slope) across ecosystems. Our findings are consistent with previous findings for both soil fluxes and eddy covariance fluxes across other Northern temperate ecosystems that showed random error scales linearly with flux magnitude with a slope of ~0.2. Although the mechanistic basis for this scaling is unknown, is a suggestive of a broadly applicable rule for the scaling of flux error. Also consistent with previous studies, we found the random error of FD follows a Laplace (double-exponential) rather than a normal (Gaussian) distribution.",

            "abstract": "With the emergence of global aerosol models intended for operational forecasting use at global numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers, the International Cooperative for Aerosol Prediction (ICAP) was founded in 2010. One of the objectives of ICAP is to develop a global multi-model aerosol forecasting ensemble (ICAP-MME) for operational and basic research use. To increase the accuracy of aerosol forecasts, several of the NWP centers have incorporated assimilation of satellite and/or ground-based observations of aerosol optical thickness (AOT), the most widely available and evaluated aerosol parameter. The ICAP models are independent in their underlying meteorology, as well as aerosol sources, sinks, microphysics and chemistry. The diversity of aerosol representations in the aerosol forecast models results in differences in AOT. In addition, for models that include AOT assimilations, the diversity in assimilation methodology, the observed AOT data to be assimilated, and the pre-assimilation treatments of input data also leads to differences in the AOT analyses. Drawing from members of the ICAP latest generation of quasi-operational aerosol models, five day AOT forecasts and AOT analyses are analyzed from four multi-species models which have AOT assimilations: ECMWF, JMA, NASA GSFC/GMAO, and NRL/FNMOC. For forecast mode only, we also include the dust products from NOAA NGAC, BSC, and UK Met office in our analysis leading to a total of 7 dust models. AOT at 550nm from all models are validated at regionally representative Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites and a data assimilation grade multi-satellite aerosol analysis. These analyses are also compared with the recently developed AOT reanalysis at NRL. Here we will present the basic verification characteristics of the ICAP-MME, and identify regions of diversity between model analyses and forecasts. Notably, as in many other ensemble environments, the multi model ensemble consensus mean outperforms all of the models therein with respect to RMSE. Polluted and mixed fine-coarse environments of India, China, and the Sahel pose the most difficulty. Based on the evaluation of analyzed and forecast AOT from the ICAP models, we will discuss potential paths to improved aerosol forecasts from these systems.",

            "abstract": "Mesoproterozoic mafic magmatism at the southern part of the Baltic Shield (the Lake Ladoga region) is conventionally ascribed to epicratonic rifting. The region hosts a series of mafic dykes and sills of Mesoproterozoic ages, including a ca. 1.53-1.46 Ga sheet-like gabbro-dolerite sills and the Salmi plateau-basalts from the Lake Ladoga region. Based on chiefly geochemical data, the region is conventionally interpreted as an intracratonic Ladoga rift (graben). We question the validity of this geodynamic interpretation by analyzing regional geophysical data (crustal structure, heat flow, Bouguer gravity anomalies, magnetic anomalies, and mantle Vs velocities). We provide a complete list of tectonic, magmatic, and geophysical characteristics typical of continental rifts in general and demonstrate that, except for magmatic and, perhaps, some gravity signature, the Lake Ladoga region lacks any other rift features. We also compare the geophysical data from the Lake Ladoga region with a similar in age Midcontinent rift (USA) and the Valday rift (NW Russia), and provide alternative explanations for the Mesoproterozoic geodynamic evolution of the southern Baltic Shield. We propose that Mesoproterozoic mafic intrusions in southern Fennoscandia may be associated with a complex deformation pattern during reconfiguration of (a part of) Nuna (Columbia) supercontinent, which led to magma intrusions as a series of mafic dykes along lithosphere weakness zones and ponding of small magma pockets within the cratonic lithosphere. Consequent magma cooling and its partial transition to eclogite facies could have led to the formation of a series of basement depressions, similar to the intracratonic basins of North America, while spatially heterogeneous thermo-chemical subsidence, with phase transitions locally speeded by the presence of (subduction-related) fluids, could have produced a series of faults bounding graben-like structures.",

            "abstract": "Gulf of Alaska sediments contain distinct, low-diversity assemblages of benthic and planktic foraminifera, whose distribution is a function of food availability, water mass properties, ice proximity, transport/deposition, predation, and taphonomic processes. Spatial and temporal changes in diversity reflect these processes and provide insight into this margin’s history. Two quantitative techniques are integrated to define and characterize benthic foraminferal biozones in Gulf of Alaska sediment core samples collected by the R/V Maurice Ewing in 2004 at shelf site EW0408-79JC (59.53° N, 141.76° W, 158 m depth), and slope site EW0408-85JC (59.56° N, 144.15° W, 682 m depth). Sediments date from the end of the most recent glaciation (diamict in 85JC) to the present (bioturbated, silty clay at both sites).\nWe apply SHE analysis, a graphical, iterative technique, based on diversity trends in a plot of ln E vs. ln N, where E is species evenness and N is cumulative number of specimens. In each step, the plot is examined for the first change in slope between successive samples, representing a change in diversity. At this point a boundary is defined, samples before the break are removed, and the analysis is repeated until all samples are analyzed. Data are further analyzed using an unmixing algorithm known as polytopic vector analyses. This technique defines a small number of orthogonal end members that explain a majority of the variance, thus reducing data complexity and aiding interpretation.\nSHE-analysis of benthic foraminiferal data defines eighteen informal abundance biozones. Polytopic vector analyses indicate that the faunal assemblages reflect mixtures of up to seven distinct biofacies: outer neritic (2), upper bathyal (2), reduced oxygen (2), and inner neritic. Rapid changes in faunal diversity correspond with increased sedimentation rates, especially during the end of the most recent glaciation (17 to 16 ka). The same relationship occurs over the last 1000 years at the shelf site. Where the cores overlap in age, many more assemblage boundaries occur in the shelf core, suggesting a comparatively dynamic environment relative to the slope. The least amount of diversity change corresponds with the laminated intervals in 85JC, coincident with high productivity and development of anoxia during regional deglaciation.",

The University of Colorado CLH-2 instrument, mounted under the wing in a canister, employs a fiber-coupled distributed feedback laser (DFL) and direct absorption to quantify total water concentrations within a closed path of known pressure and temperature downstream of a heated inlet. Similarly, the NCAR CVI instrument uses a MayCom compact tunable diode laser (TDL) hygrometer mounted inside the aircraft cabin to measure condensed water evaporated in a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI) inlet. These two CWC measurements, which have similar sub-isokinetic particle enhancement characteristics, should differ primarily by the amount of ambient water vapor that is admitted by the CLH-2 inlet, but rejected by the dry counterflow in the CVI. We measured that ambient water vapor with a Picarro cavity ringdown spectrometer sourced by a backward-facing inlet. During a series of flights through a variety of clouds near Broomfield, CO, we were able to intercompare these two methods for measuring CWCs, both of which are capable of high accuracy sampling over a wide range of CWCs from the lower atmosphere to the tropopause. The results help characterize the accuracy, time-response, and precision of the two methods, and they improve our understanding of the new approach for measuring CWC using the canister-mounted CLH-2 instrument on the Gulfstream-V aircraft.",

            "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy has become increasingly desirable for astrobiological investigations on Mars due to the potential for stand-off measurements, sensitivity to organic and mineral targets, and detection on unprepared surfaces. While the majority of existing Raman instruments intended for planetary exploration operate in the visible or near infrared, an ultraviolet Raman wavelength offers potential advantages including increased Raman cross section, decreased fluorescence in the Raman window, and increased signal due to resonance with some organics. This work presents a Raman spectrometer with an excitation of 266 nm, designed around the putative requirements of a flight instrument. We demonstrate spatial mapping of organic and mineral compounds on Mars analogue samples from the Canadian Arctic and the Atacama Desert, showcasing the reduced fluorescence and increased scattering efficiency compared to longer wavelengths. The Raman window provided by a 266 nm excitation is advantageously positioned to observe fluorescence bands that are characteristic to terrestrial bacteria yet do not overlap with the Raman signal. We present the potential for time-resolved nanosecond scale gating of the detector in characterizing mineral and organic fluorescence by measuring the fluorescence lifetime of endoliths in gypsum. The characteristic short lifetime of the bacterial fluorescence provides additional information regarding the presence of organic carbon in the sample, and therefore combined Raman-fluorescence measurements may increase the sensitivity of the instrument to organic carbon. This research was carried out at the Planetary Instrumentation Laboratory at York University, and supported in part by both the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).",

            "abstract": "Evidence suggests that the synchronous acceleration and thinning in the early 2000s of Greenland’s southeast glaciers were triggered by increased submarine melting. This important control on the region’s mass balance is influenced by changes in the strength of coastal currents, which are also believed to be the cause of the subsequent slowdown of the mid-2000s. While warming of the subpolar North Atlantic and increased runoff are blamed for the enhanced submarine melting at the glacier margins, the physical processes that connect them remain largely unknown. Our lack of understanding of coastal currents and associated fluxes is due largely to a lack of observations of a complex system. Typically, data in these regions, if available at all, consist of point measurements at sparse moorings or 2D profiles of a snapshot in time. Here we present a methodology using monoscopic time-lapse imagery to characterise fjord circulation at the mouth of Sermillik Fjord near Helheim Glacier in southeast Greenland. Image resection methods are used to assign a 3D coordinate system to the 6-minute time-lapse images and the movement of icebergs and sea ice are mapped using feature tracking. Along with local wind data, these results will provide much needed information about the patterns of circulation at the fjord’s mouth on the surface and at depth, ice fluxes and the influence of wind.",

            "abstract": "Alterations to flow regimes from regulation and climate change affect the biophysical functioning of rivers. Re-operating reservoirs to provide environmental flows - the quantity, quality, and timing of water to sustain natural river functions and species - is now widely applied in multi-objective water resources management. However, the absence of a quantitative, transferable framework for evaluating the relationships between hydrologic inputs, geomorphic functions, and ecological responses, remains a major limitation to setting environmental ﬂows standards. This research addresses this gap by developing a hydrologic classification framework for the State of California that balances operational practicality with scientific defensibility. The framework organizes river reaches into: (1) natural flow classes based on (a) a classification model that clusters hydrologic indices calculated directly from unimpaired streamflow data, and (b) a regression model using a set of climatic, landscape, and local geomorphic controls over the flow regime, and (2) functional zones constrained by temporal (seasonal) ranges and hydrologic (average flow percentile-based) thresholds (e.g. summer low flows). The framework is then used to (1) identify major climatic, landscape, and local geomorphic controls over prototypical flow regime signatures, and (2) characterize key natural functions and processes expected of reaches of each flow class and functional zone during wet, dry, and normal water year types. Organizing hydrologic data in this manner provides a means of comparison and transferability of ecologically-significant hydrologic and geomorphic information across reaches of all major flow classes seen in California, both regulated and unregulated. Through this framework, transferable relationships between hydrologic and physiographic conditions, flow alteration, and ecological metrics can be developed and tested on the basis of data obtained from a limited set of study sites.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice melt ponds play an important role in spring-summer radiation absorption and upper ocean warming, light transmittance and under-ice primary production, and biogeochemical exchanges. With a larger portion of Arctic first-year sea ice (FYI) compared to multiyear ice observed in recent years comes the expectation of greater melt pond fraction due to the absence of topographical controls on FYI. Despite progress in our understanding and modelling of pond fraction evolution and coupled processes at the local scale, a reliable means for monitoring variations at regional or greater scales, uninhibited by cloud cover, is lacking. In this study we demonstrate the ability of dual-polarisation C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for estimating pond fraction and freezing conditions on level FYI in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. We use a combination of in situ C-band scatterometer and radar-scale surface roughness observations to study the dual-polarisation channel (VV+HH and HV+HH) and channel ratio characteristics of individual melt ponds and ice patches. Aerial surveys of pond fraction are used to evaluate retrieval approaches from Radarsat-2 SAR fine quad-polarisation mode imagery. Accurate retrievals of pond fraction are found using the VV/HH polarisation ratio during melting conditions. Results demonstrate the potential of dual-polarisation SAR for regional scale observations with temporal frequency suitable for contributing to process-scale studies and improvements to model parameterizations.",

            "abstract": "The planktic foraminifer Globorotalia menardii presents a cyclic behavior within Pleistocene glacial cycles on Atlantic; it disappears during glacial periods and returns to this ocean after deglaciations. Therefore, G. menardii has been used to identify limits between those cycles and the last limit is recognized as the Holocene onset. The Holocene onset has been reported before as being more than 4 kyrs later than expected at the equatorial Atlantic Ocean based on a G. menardii record (Broecker & Pena, 2014). In this study, we explore the time-transgressive Holocene onset of G. menardii in the Atlantic from 21 piston cores collected along the Brazilian continental margin, between 7 ˚N and 33 ˚S. Radiocarbon dating was conducted on Globigerinoides ruber on samples prior to and after G. menardii reappearance in the cores. Reservoir-age corrected 14C dates vary between 17 and 6.5 cal kyrs; the older ages are found at ~14 ˚S and younger ages at 6 ˚N and 33 ˚S. From these ages and latitudes, we hypothesize that G. menardii’s population has spread at higher rates southward. From the scenario observed on Brazilian coast it is possible to conclude that although ocean circulation has an important role on dispersion of planktonic foraminifera, it may be superimposed by ecological constraints of the species. G. menardii absence during glacials is linked to the Agulhas Leakage activity, which is prevented from getting to the Atlantic due the northern position of the Subtropical Convergence Zone during glacials. On interglacials, warm and saline waters carrying G. menardii are transported into the Subtropical Gyre currents, achieving Brazil's coast through the South Equatorial Current and spreading south and northward through Brazil Current and North Brazil Current, respectively. Nonetheless, from velocity and volume registered for this currents, we would expect a higher G. menardii dispersion rate northward. A faster southward dispersal during the deglaciation suggests water column conditions along the south Brazilian coast were more suitable for this species than along the north coast. Fossil records are likely to be time-transgressive and a synchronous global record cannot be expected from them. Global time-scale boundaries based on the occurrence of fossils, such as the G. menardii biozonation, need to be revisited.",

            "abstract": "Solar diameter measurements performed from the ground for several decades seem to indicate a relation between the solar diameter and the solar activity. If this relationship is confirmed, it would be possible to use measurements of solar diameter as a proxy of solar activity in the past since the 1715 solar eclipses, and to use this input for the reconstruction of solar irradiance in climate models. However the interpretation of ground observations is controversial, ground-based measurements being affected by refraction, by atmospheric turbulence, and perhaps by atmospheric aerosols scattering. The only way to be free from atmospheric effects is to measure from space. This is the reason why, since the beginning, the PICARD program included a space and a ground component set up at the Calern site of the Observatoire de la Côte dAzur. During the last 4 years, the PICARD space mission has been used for observing the apparent solar diameter. First results of the astrometry program include a study of the June 2012 Venus transit for solar diameter determination. From this, the value of the solar radius from one astronomical unit was found to be equal to 959.86 arc-seconds at 607.1 nm. However, concerning observed variations in time of the solar radius, instrumental effects affect the results. Space is known to represent a harsh environment for optical instruments. Nevertheless, we can use the PICARD data to monitor the solar radius variation. PICARD aims to perpetuate historical series of the solar radius measurements, in particular during the solar cycle 24. This paper presents solar radius measurements obtained with PICARD.",

            "abstract": "Proper calibration of hydrologic models requires both reliable observed stream flow and precipitation data. Southern New Jersey has a notable lack of observed precipitation data, in particular, at the event scale; therefore model calibration represents a significant challenge. From a design standpoint this has not been a major concern as hydrologic models have been driven using design storms and are not calibrated. However, the need for research and impact analyses in the face of climate change (changes in extreme precipitation and sea-level rise in particular) and expected population growth in the region requires calibrated models, and reliable observed precipitation data are necessary for model calibration. Several HEC-HMS watershed models were developed and calibrated using NEXRAD data for the upper Maurice River watershed in southern New Jersey, which contains the two growing urban areas of Vineland and Glassboro, to meet three objectives: (1) to validate that NEXRAD data can be effectively utilized in this region, (2) to better understand the roles that spatial variability and scaling play in the use of NEXRAD data within a hydrologic model, and (3) to determine the possible effects of urbanization on stream flow within this watershed. Gridded NEXRAD data were converted to virtual rain gages using the Watershed Modeling System and used as input for HEC-HMS models. Preliminary results indicate that models forced by a spatially coarse distribution (one rain gage for the watershed) of precipitation perform better than models driven by higher resolution precipitation data (14 rain gages for the watershed) for large or extreme events (e.g. hurricanes), and higher resolution precipitation driven models performed better than lower resolution models for smaller events indicating that models should be calibrated from events of the same scale for valid model application.",

We include the ocean bottom seismometers deployed by the Cascadia Initiative community experiment and Neptune Canada from 2011-2013, and the available broadband stations on land. We have extracted the empirical Green’s functions from continuous seismic records on the vertical components of the OBS and inland station pairs with a frequency-time normalization method, which provide useful Rayleigh-wave signals within the periods of 7-50 s. We have also selected ~50 regional earthquakes between 2011-2013 offshore of the Cascadia subduction zone, which generated useful surface-wave signals up to 75 s period. We simulate wave propagation within a 3D Earth structure using a finite-difference method to generate a station Strain Greens Tensor database and synthetic waveforms. Rayleigh wave phase delays are obtained by cross-correlating the observed and synthetic waveforms. The sensitivity kernels of Rayleigh waves on the perturbations of Vp and Vs are calculated based on the Strain Greens Tensor database. We then invert for the velocity perturbation from the reference model and progressively improve the model resolution. Our preliminary full-wave tomographic imaging using the EGFs and earthquake Rayleigh waves shows: (1) Segmented low-velocity anomalies along the forearc, which are spatially correlated with the patterns of offshore basins and high slip patches; (2) Low velocities beneath the Blanco fracture zone; (3) The distribution of pseudofaults defines the seismic velocity heterogeneities; and (4) A low-velocity zone beneath the oceanic Moho near the trench, which may indicate serpentinization of the mantle lithosphere.",

However, at present considerable uncertainty remains in understanding and predicting, much of the meltwater produced is retained and how much reaches the ocean through surface runoff or by draining through moulins. The potential for the Greenland ice sheet to retain substantial amounts of water has been highlighted by the recent and surprising discovery of a semi-permanent firn aquifer. In this study, we use a numerical model to simulate surface melt and track the meltwater evolution in the snow and firn layer to explore how the firn aquifer forms and their influence on Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance and dynamics. The model is coupled with a surface energy balance model, which computes surface energy and mass balance processes, and a snow-firn model, which simulates snow and ice metamorphic processes and englacial water transport processes. Case studies were carried on the melting part of Greenland Ice Sheet to calibrate and validate the model, driven by in situ AWS stations observational data and ERA-interim downscaled reanalysis data. Model results are used to analyze the conditions on which firn aquifer forms and examine limitations associated with driving a model with coarse scale climate data. We also examine the sensitivity to model results to different parameterization of albedo, densification and water transport.",

Foraminiferal calcareous fossils are commonly utilized as paleo-environmental indicators in a variety of studies of earth science because these have been archived as numerous materials in sediment for long time and diverse environmental information are brought by population, morphology and geochemical fingerprints. Finally, the calcareous test itself is interested by many micropalaeontologists. The knowledge about the cytological process on carbonate precipitation has been described for couples of decade using by multi approaches. Foraminiferal regulations of calcium and carbonate ion uptake into calcareous tests from ambient seawater under different pH conditions are of great interest. Our previous studies showed the potential to understanding the biomineralization of foraminifera by the application of fluorescent indicators. Recently, we apply the method to show the spatial distributions of cytological calcium and pH in living cell. Observed results show that foraminifera severely controls intra-cellular pH variation and concentration of calcium at different environmental pH conditions.

Cloud properties derived from ARM ground-based observations were averaged over a 1-hour interval centered at the satellite overpass time, while the CERES-MODIS (CM) results were averaged within a 30×30 km2 grid box centered over the Azores site. A total of 63 daytime and 92 nighttime single-layered overcast MBL cloud cases were selected from 19 months of ARM radar-lidar and satellite observations. The CM cloud-top/base heights (Htop/Hbase) were determined from cloud-top/base temperatures (Ttop/Tbase) using a regional boundary-layer lapse rate method. For daytime comparisons, the CM-derived Htop (Hbase), on average, is 0.063 km (0.068 km) higher (lower) than its ARM radar-lidar observed counterpart, and the CM-derived Ttop and Tbase are 0.9 K less and 2.5 K greater than the surface values with high correlations (R2=0.82 and 0.84, respectively). In general, the cloud-top comparisons agree better than cloud-base comparisons because the CM Tbase and Hbase are secondary product determined from Ttop and Htop. No significant day-night difference was found in the analyses.\nThe comparisons of microphysical properties reveal that, when averaged over a 30x30 km2 area, the CM-retrieved cloud-droplet effective radius (re) is 1.3 µm larger than that from the ARM retrievals (12.8 µm). While the CM-retrieved cloud liquid water path (LWP) is 13.5 gm-2 less than its ARM counterpart (114.2 gm-2) due to its small optical depth (τ, 9.6 vs. 13.7). The differences are reduced by 50% when the CM averages are computed only using the MODIS pixel nearest the AMF site. Using effective radius retrieved at 2.1-µm channel to calculate LWP can reduce the difference between the CM and ARM from -13.7 to 2.1 gm-2. The 10% differences between the ARM and CM LWP and re retrievals are within the uncertainties of the ARM LWP (~ 20 gm-2) and re (~ 10%) retrievals, however, the 30% difference in τ is significant. Possible reasons contributed to this discrepancy increased sensitivities in τ from both surface retrievals when τ ~ 10 and topography. The τ differences vary with wind direction and are consistent with the island orography.",

            "abstract": "Chemical reactions induced by the injection of CO2-rich fluids into carbonate reservoirs may cause petrophysical alterations in the host rock with possible consequences for reservoir development and monitoring.\nX-Ray microtomography is a very powerful technique to characterize and model flow and transport phenomena at the pore-scale. More recently, it became possible to image reactive flow (solid-fluid interaction) in rocks at reservoir conditions. In this work we present a particle-based method to simulate reactive transport in carbonate rocks directly on the voxels of 3D micro-CT images. We use images from a dynamic imaging experiment performed at high temperature and pressure conditions to validate our model.\nRock-fluid interaction is modeled using a three step approach – solute advection, diffusion and reaction. Particle advection is done using a novel pore-scale streamline method that is consistent with pore-scale boundary conditions – no-flow at the pore-solid walls. Diffusion by random walk is superimposed and reaction occurs when the solute particles flow across the pore-solid interfaces. For the specific case of carbonate dissolution it is possible to derive from first principles a relationship between the local particle flux (a function of the particle concentration and of the diffusion coefficient) and the calcite dissolution rate from batch experiments. Our method is capable of predicting the evolution of petrophysical properties (porosity and permeability) in carbonate rocks subjected to CO2 injection. To validate our simulations we use a set of 3D images from a dynamic imaging experiment where carbonate samples were imaged during CO2-equilibrated brine injection. The image-calculated increases in porosity and permeability are predicted within large degrees of accuracy. This is the first time a pore-scale simulation is used in conjunction with such kind of experiment to study carbonate dissolution.\nWe will also present and discuss the various dissolution patterns in heterogeneous carbonates that may arise from different flow regimes and describe how this methodology can be applied to model diagenetic phenomena in sedimentary rocks. We conclude showing how such changes in the rock frame impact the elastic properties of the reservoir rocks.",

            "abstract": "In ambient conditions, aerosol particles experience hygroscopic growth due to the influence of relative humidity (RH), scattering more light than when the particles are dry. The quantitative knowledge of the RH effect and its influence on the light scattering and, in particular, on the phase function and polarization of aerosol particles is of substantial importance when comparing ground observations with other optical aerosol measurements such satellite and sunphotometric retrievals of aerosol optical depth and their inversions. In the summer of 2014, the DISCOVER-AQ campaign was held in Colorado, where systematic and concurrent observations of column- integrated surface, and vertically‐resolved distributions of aerosols and trace gases relevant to air quality and their evolution during the day were observed. Aerosol optical properties were measured in the UMBC trailer at the city of Golden using a TSI-3563 nephelometer and an in-situ Polarized Imaging Nephelometer (PI-NEPH) designed and built by the LACO group at UMBC. The PI-NEPH measures aerosol phase matrix components in high angular range between 2 and 178 degrees scattering angle at three wavelengths (λ=473, 532 and 671nm). The two measured elements of the phase matrix, intensity (P11) and linear polarization (P12) provide extensive characterization of the scattering properties of the studied aerosol. The scattering coefficient, P11 and P12 were measured under different humidity conditions to obtain the enhancement factor f(RH) and the dependence of P11 and P12 to RH using a humidifier dryer system covering a RH range from 20 to 90%. The ratio between scattering coefficients at high and low humidity in Golden Colorado showed relatively low hygroscopic growth in the aerosol particles f(RH=80%) was 1.27±0.19 for the first three weeks of sampling. According to speciated measurements performed at the UMBC trailer, the predominance of dust and organic aerosols over more hygroscopic nitrate and sulfate in the region are responsible for the low hygroscopicity. In addition, transported smoke remnants from wildfires in the Pacific Northwest were detected as the elemental and organic carbon concentrations increased. The P11 and P12 elements from smoke and local sources are discussed as well as the vertical distribution by airborne and ground comparisons.",

We use USArray Transportable Array (TA) vertical component recording of teleseismic Rayleigh waves that we first invert for phase velocity using the modified two-plane wave method with finite frequency kernels. We then invert the resulting dispersion curves for shear velocity structure. Our analysis includes a characterization of the lithospheric structure in this tectonically transitional regime to illuminate the differences between the actively deforming western US and the stable continental interior of the northeastern Great Plains. The west is defined by slow velocities and thin lithosphere, whereas the east has fast velocities and thick lithosphere, with the thickest lithosphere in the northeast, representing the southwestern keel of the Superior craton. The Great Plains, which abut the Rocky Mountain Front, have an unusual elevation profile that possesses a much broader region of uplifted elevation and lower relief than other orogenic systems (Eaton 2009). From our tomography and regional heat flow data, we infer warm temperatures in the west and suggest that the asthenospheric mantle contributes to anomalously high elevation of the westernmost Great Plains with some secondary contribution due to crustal effects.",

            "abstract": "Reconstructions of past climatic changes from borehole temperature profiles are\nimportant independent estimates of temperature histories over the last\nmillennium. There remain, however, multiple uncertainties in the\ninterpretation of these data as climatic indicators and as estimates of the\nchanges in heat content of the continental subsurface due to long-term\nclimatic change. One of these uncertainties is associated with the often\nignored impact of the last glacial cycle on the subsurface energy content, and\nthe estimate of the background quasi steady-state signal associated with\nthe diffusion of accretionary energy from the Earth's interior. Here we provide\nthe first quantification of the impact of the Laurentide ice sheet\non energy and surface temperature reconstructions during the Common Era from measurements of\nterrestrial borehole temperatures in North America. We use basal temperature\nvalues from the data-calibrated Memorial University of Newfoundland Glacial\nSystems Model to quantify the extent of the perturbation to\nsteady-state temperature profiles and to derive spatial maps of the expected\nimpacts on measured profiles over North America. Furthermore, we present\nquantitative estimates of the potential effects of temperature changes during\nthe last glacial cycle on Common-Era surface temperature reconstructions for North America. The range of these possible impacts are\nestimated using synthetic basal temperatures for a period covering 120 ka to\nthe present day that include the basal temperature history uncertainties from\nan ensemble of results from the calibrated numerical model. For all the\nlocations, we find that within the depth ranges that are typical for available\nboreholes used to estimate surface temperature changes during the Common era (~600 m), the induced perturbations to the steady-state temperature profile are on the order of 10 mW/m2, decreasing\nwith greater depths. Results indicate that site-specific heat content estimates\nover North America can differ by as much as 50%, if the energy contribution\nof the last glacial cycle in those areas of North America that experienced\nglaciation is not taken into account when estimating recent subsurface energy\nchange from borehole temperature data.",

            "abstract": "In the past two decades there have been several advances that make the production of an atlas of submarine glacial landforms timely. First is the development of high-resolution imaging technologies; multi-beam echo-sounding or swath bathymetry that allows the detailed mapping of the sea floor at water depths of tens to thousands of metres across continental margins, and 3-D seismic methods that enable the visualisation of palaeo-continental shelves in Quaternary sediments and ancient palaeo-glacial rocks (e.g. Late Ordovician of Northern Africa). A second technological development is that of ice-breaking or ice-strengthened ships that can penetrate deep into the ice-infested waters of the Arctic and Antarctic, to deploy the multibeam systems. A third component is that of relevance – through both the recognition that the polar regions, and especially the Arctic, are particularly sensitive parts of the global environmental system and that these high-latitude margins (both modern and ancient) are likely to contain significant hydrocarbon resources. An enhanced understanding of the sediments and landforms of these fjord-shelf-slope systems is, therefore, of increasing importance to both academics and industry. We are editing an Atlas of Submarine Glacial Landforms that presents a series of individual contributions that describe, discuss and illustrate features on the high-latitude, glacier-influenced sea floor. Contributions are organised in two ways: first, by position on a continental margin – from fjords, through continental shelves to the continental slope and rise; secondly, by scale – as individual landforms and assemblages of landforms. A final section provides discussion of integrated fjord-shelf-slope systems. Over 100 contributions by scientists from many countries contain descriptions and interpretation of swath-bathymetric data from both Arctic and Antarctic margins and use 3D seismic data to investigate ancient glacial landforms. The Atlas will be published in late 2015 in the Memoir Series of the Geological Society of London.",

            "abstract": "Bioremediation using electron donor addition produces reducing conditions in an aquifer that promote the anaerobic biodegradation of contaminants such as chlorinated solvents. There is growing concern about secondary water quality impacts (SWQIs) triggered by the injection of electron donors, due to redox reactions with electron acceptors other than the target contaminant. Secondary plumes, including those with elevated concentrations of Mn(II), Fe(II), and CH4, may create long-lasting impairment of water quality. Understanding conditions that control the production and attenuation of SWQIs is needed for guiding responsible bioremediation strategies that limit unintended consequences. Using a reactive transport model developed with data from long-term anaerobic biodegradation monitoring sites, we simulate diverse geochemical scenarios to examine the sensitivity of secondary plume extent and persistence to a range of aquifer properties and treatment implementations. Data compiled from anaerobic bioremediation sites, which include variable physical and geochemical relationships, provide the basis for the conditions evaluated. Our simulations show that reduced metal and CH4 plumes may be significantly attenuated due to immobilization (through sorption and/or precipitation) and outgassing, respectively, and that recovery time to background conditions depends strongly on the chemical forms of reduced metals on sediments. Unsurprisingly, scenarios that do not easily allow outgassing (e.g. deeper injections) led to higher CH4 concentrations, and scenarios with higher hydraulic conductivity produced more dilute concentrations of secondary species. Results are sensitive to the assumed capacity for Fe(II) sorption and reductive dissolution rates of Fe(III) oxides, which control Fe(II) concentrations. Simulations also demonstrated the potential importance of chemical reactions between different secondary components. For example, limited CH4 loss from outgassing and Fe(III)-mediated anaerobic CH4 oxidation together generate more extensive Fe(II) plumes. Our work provides ranges for possible SWQIs and highlights the importance of characterizing mineral phases, electron donor injection practices, and transport behavior for understanding coupled SWQIs.",

            "abstract": "While there has been substantial improvement of understanding hyporheic exchange flow and residence time controls on biogeochemical turnover rates, there is little knowledge of the actual drivers of the spatial and temporal variability of interlinked biogeochemical cycles. Previous research has mainly focused on bedform controlled hyporheic exchange and the transformation of surface solutes along a hyporheic flow path but failed to explain observations of spatially and temporally variable nutrient turnover in streambeds with higher structural heterogeneity and autochthonous carbon and nitrogen sources.\nThe “Leverhulme Hyporheic Zone Research Network” has developed an interdisciplinary strategy for investigating the physical controls on hyporheic exchange fluxes and residence time distributions, heat and reactive solute transport along biogeographical and catchment gradients. This strategy combines smart tracer applications with distributed sensor networks in multi-scale nested monitoring schemes and numerical model studies to investigate the interactions between physico-chemical process dynamics and hyporheic microbial, invertebrate and macrophyte ecology. Investigations integrating the process knowledge from mesocosms to artificial channels and stream reaches highlight the impact of small-scale streambed structure on spatial patterns of hyporheic exchange flow, residence time distribution and the development of biogeochemical hotspots. Manipulation studies inhibiting flow through dominant hyporheic exchange flow paths allowed to quantify the functional significance, sensitivity and resilience of biogeochemical, microbial and ecological functioning of identified hyporheic hotspots to environmental change. Further discharge and stage manipulations proved to not only control in-channel macrophyte growth but also temperature patterns and residence time distributions as well as microbial metabolic activity and biogeochemical processing rates, highlighting the potential impacts of flow extremes such as droughts.\nAs an interdisciplinary project the network is striving to extend its collaborations in particular towards including a wider range of streambed environments and the investigation of biotic feedback functions on biogeochemical cycling.",

            "abstract": "The current rate of uplift at Laguna del Maule (LdM) volcanic field in Chile is among the highest ever observed geodetically for a volcano that is not actively erupting. Using data from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and the Global Positioning System (GPS) recorded at five continuously operating stations, we measure the deformation field with dense sampling in time (1/day) and space (1/hectare). These data track the temporal evolution of the current unrest episode from its inception (sometime between 2004 and 2007) to vertical velocities faster than 200 mm/yr that continue through (at least) July 2014. Building on our previous work, we evaluate the temporal evolution by analyzing data from InSAR (ALOS, TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X) and GPS [http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1093/gji/ggt438]. In addition, we consider InSAR data from (ERS, ENVISAT, COSMO-Skymed, and UAVSAR), as well as constraints from magneto-telluric (MT), seismic, and gravity surveys. The goal is to test the hypothesis that a recent magma intrusion is feeding a large, existing magma reservoir. What will happen next? To address this question, we analyze the temporal evolution of deformation at other large silicic systems such as Yellowstone, Long Valley, and Three Sisters, during well-studied episodes of unrest. We consider several parameterizations, including piecewise linear, parabolic, and Gaussian functions of time. By choosing the best-fitting model, we expect to constrain the time scales of such episodes and elucidate the processes driving them.",

            "abstract": "Coal combustion residues (CCRs), the products of coal combustion, contain high concentrations of heavy metals such as mercury. Recent structural failures of on-site containment ponds and leaching of CCRs has potentially endangered the health of adjacent water bodies. This study examines the influence of CCR enrichment of river sediments through the study of mercury, an abundant constituent of CCRs, and the concomitant production of methylmercury. We hypothesized that CCR contamination increases the exposure to mercury for aquatic life through leaching and resuspension mechanisms. Resuspension experiments were conducted using CCR-contaminated sediments from the Dan River and uncontaminated sediments enriched with 0%, 10%, and 30% CCRs in the laboratory. Sediments were sieved to obtain the silt-clay fraction, which was then resuspended in solution with a dispersant to obtain the separate silt and clay fractions and then analyzed for total mercury concentrations. We found that CCR particles and the mercury they contain are present primarily in the silt and clay fractions of sediment and there is a direct relationship between CCR concentrations and total mercury concentrations. These findings have implications for both the bioavailability of mercury to methylating bacteria, higher organisms prone to direct ingestion of fine particles, CCR spill event remediation, current industrial waste disposal practices, and further research required in this field. Our seven day incubations of river sediment cores enriched with CCRs did not increase methylmercury in porewater above controls, suggesting that there is no immediate risk of increased methylmercury bioaccumulation, however this does not necessarily reflect the long-term effects of CCRs on river ecology, which requires further research.",

The channel is filled with a series of slope failures or landslides that form lobate aprons covering the valley floor. Preliminary studies of the valley on the north wall of the valley (south facing) characterized 6 landslides using gridded MOLA topography from JMARS, including area, drop height and run out distance. These relatively small landslides have surface areas ranging from 5.6 to 55 km2. Their aprons run out ~ 10 km, often covering the entire width of the valley floor. Drop height was measured using both maximum and minimum estimates due to resolution limits of the topography and ranged from 1200 to 2200 meters. Using the drop height and run out distance, we determine the coefficient of friction and maximum velocity for two of the landslides using previously established landslide equations based on physical properties. The coefficient of friction for the landslide events ranged from 0.5 to 1.5, which corresponds to a maximum landslide velocity of 87 m/s2 to 96 m/s2. The variations in the coefficients may be due to landslides size, relative size, or possible volatile or ice content. Preliminary geomorphic surface mapping is currently under way to identify the relationship between the aprons and the channel floor, relative age of the landslides, and other characteristics. Initial analysis indicates the channel floor and depositional aprons have experienced deflation and eolian processes and aprons have a variable level of erosion indicating that the landslides did not form during a single event.",

            "abstract": "Findings from global seismic tomography studies suggest that the deep mantle may harbor a pair of broad, steep-sided, relatively dense compositionally anomalous provinces. The longevity and stability of these Large Low Shear-Wave Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) has received considerable interest but their possible influence on surface motion has drawn lesser attention. Recent work using numerical mantle convection models investigated the feedback between oceanic plate motion and high density compositional anomalies. It was found that surface mobility is affected by the presence of compositional anomalies such that critical density contrasts and volumes of the enriched material produce a transition to stagnant-lid convection. For lesser volumes and density contrast (for example, volumes that are representative of the concentrations in the Earth's mantle) the presence of the compositional anomalies affects mean plate velocity and size when compared to the characteristics of systems in which the enriched material is absent. In addition, numerous studies and lines of evidence in the geologic record suggest that the presence of the density anomalies plays a role in determining the location of mantle upwellings, which in turn influence surface dynamics. In this study, we present the results from a study implementing a two-dimensional mantle convection model featuring an anomalously dense component and distinct continental and oceanic lithosphere. The mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations are solved using a hybrid spectral-finite difference code. Compositional variations are tracked using Lagrangian tracer particles. Mobile tectonic plates are modeled using a force-balance method and plate boundary locations evolve in response to interior stresses, plate velocity, age and lithospheric chemistry (i.e., oceanic versus continental). We examine the influence of continents on compositional anomaly morphology and longevity and the influence of compositional anomalies on continental size, mobility and aggregation. The influence of continents is isolated by comparing our calculations with cases in which continents are absent.",

            "abstract": "A meromictic Lake Kai-ike is located on the northeastern margin of Kami-koshiki island, Japan. Permanent density stratification develops due to seawater infiltration through a gravel bar separating the lake from the ocean. The oxygenated surface water overlays a stagnant, saline, and anoxic deep water containing hydrogen sulfide. Purple sulfur bacteria (Chromatium sp.) inhabit the chemocline at 4.5m depth. At the lake bottom, green sulfur bacteria form microbial mat-like structures (Nakajima et al., 2003; Environ. Microbiol.). Such environment can be treated as a model for the past anoxic ocean, such as during Cretaceous OAEs (Oguri et al., 2003; Frontier Res. on Earth Evol.).\nA 25 cm-long KAI4 sediment core (Yamaguchi et al., 2010; Palaeo3) was used for two sequential extraction methods. SEDEX method (Ruttenberg, 1992; Limnol. Oceanogr.) was used for partitioning phosphorus-bearing species into Pabs (absorbed), PFe (Fe-bound), Pauth (authigenic), Pdet (detrital), and Porg (organic). Iron-bearing species were also divided into FeHCl (HCl-soluble), Fecarb (carbonate), Feox (oxide), Femag (magnetite), and Feresi (residue), following the method of Poulton et al. (2005; Chem. Geol.).\nAt the uppermost part of KAI4 core, Porg was the most abundant P-bearing species (~90% of total P). The Porg content sharply decreased with increasing depth to 5cm. The second most abundant species was PFe; however, PFe and Feox contents remained constant throughout the whole depth.\nAt sediment surface in present-day oxygenated ocean, Fe3+-(oxy)hydroxides trap phosphate diffusing from deeper-anoxic sediment, and the phosphate concentration in pore water becomes high enough to precipitate authigenic apatite (Slomp et al., 1996; J. Mar. Res.). In case of Lake Kai-ike, however, the amount of Fe3+-(oxy)hydroxides was small relative to that of Porg (PFe/Porg = ~0.1). We suggest that the excess phosphate not adsorbed on Fe3+-(oxy)hydroxides was diffused out to the overlying water mass, and the fraction enhanced the microbial activity. This positive feedback mechanism plays a significant role in maintaining anoxic environment in the bottom water.",

Organic soils contribute to an increase in soil moisture and provide a better insulation against summer heat. Better ground insulation is possible due to thermal conductivity of a thawed organic layer, which is about two times lower than thermal conductivity of a frozen organic layer. In this study, we implemented changing in time soil organic layer into the Simple Biosphere/Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (SiBCASA) terrestrial ecosystem model to illustrate how the soil organic layer affects soil temperature dynamics and soil carbon dynamics. We used CRUNCEP reanalysis data to run the model for its equilibrium state with a stable climate. Our results indicate that the presence and dynamics of the organic layer allow us to better simulate active layer thickness. Moreover, dynamic carbon redistribution as a result of changing organic layer improves the simulated distribution of soil carbon with depth.",

The analysis is performed during 2011 at low and middle latitudes using SABER temperatures and GOCE accelerometer-derived neutral densities and zonal winds. Evidence is found for vertical propagation of the UFKW and several tidal components (DE3, DE2, DE1, SE1, SE2) from the lower to the middle thermosphere. Separation of the raw data into the symmetric and anti-symmetric in longitude space allowed for clearer the extraction of the diurnal and semidiurnal tides (i.e., DE3 from SE2 for wave-4). All of the wave components exhibit significant variability throughout the year. Spectral and temporal analyses of the SABER and GOCE data also reveal the presence of secondary waves due to the modulation of tides by the UFKW.

            "abstract": "Fixing atmospheric CO2, followed by geologic storage in remote areas is considered an environmentally secure approach to climate mitigation. A moisture swing sorbent was investigated in the laboratory for CO2 capture at a remote area with humid and windy conditions. The energy requirement of moisture swing absorption could be greatly reduced compared to that of traditional high-temperature thermal swing, by assuming that the sorbent can be naturally dried and regenerated at ambient conditions. However, for currently developed moisture swing materials, the CO2 capacity would drop significantly at high relative humidity. The CO2 capture amount can be reduced by the poor thermodynamics and kinetics at high relative humidity or low temperature. Similar challenges also exist for thermal or vacuum swing sorbents. Developing sorbent materials which adapt to specific environments, such as high humidity or low temperature, can ensure sufficient capture capacity on the one hand, and realize better economics on the other hand (Figure 1) .\nAn environment adaptive sorbent should have the abilities of tunable capacity and fast kinetics at extreme conditions, such as high humidity or low temperature. In this presentation, the possibility of tuning CO2 absorption capacity of a polymerized ionic liquid material is discussed. The energy requirement evaluation shows that tuning the CO2 binding energy of sorbent, rather than increasing the temperature or reducing the humidity of air, could be much more economic. By determining whether the absorption process is controlled by physical diffusion controlled or chemical reaction, an effective approach to fast kinetics at extreme conditions is proposed. A shrinking core model for mass transfer kinetics is modified to cope with the relatively poor kinetics of air capture. For the studied sample which has a heterogeneous structure, the kinetic analysis indicates a preference of sorbent particle size optimization, rather than support layer optimization. Chemical reaction kinetics could be enhanced by stronger binding energy or higher temperature. However, the total kinetics can only be significantly improved by chemical reaction enhancement if the physical diffusion is fast enough. ",

            "abstract": "We investigate the effect that magnetic dissipation has on the flows within the heliosheath (HS), the subsonic plasma in between the termination shock (TS) and the heliopause (HP). We use a global 3D multi-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of the heliosphere, which has a grid resolution of 0.5 AU within the heliosphere along both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 trajectories. We describe the solar wind magnetic field as a monopole, to remove the heliospheric current sheet, with the magnetic field aligned with that of the interstellar medium (ISM) to diminish any numerical reconnection at the ISM – solar wind interface. This configuration of the solar wind magnetic field also reduces any numerical magnetic dissipation effects in the HS. We compare our model to the same model describing the solar wind magnetic field as a dipole. In the dipole case, there is an intrinsic loss of magnetic energy near the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) due to reconnection. This reconnection is numerical since we do not include real resistivity in the model. The comparison of the two models will allow for an estimation of the effects of reconnection in the HS since there is no numerical dissipation of the magnetic field in the monopole model. We compare steady state solutions and the role magnetic dissipation has on the global characteristics of the heliosphere. We find that the monopole model of the solar wind magnetic field removes the asymmetry observed in the TS and predicted for the HP. Furthermore, the TS is considerably closer to the Sun in the monopole model due to the build up of magnetic filed at the HP. We also investigate magnetic dissipation effects in the 11-year solar cycle variations of the solar wind in a 3D time-dependent model. This model includes 3D latitudinal and temporal variations of the solar wind density and velocity taken from SOHO/SWAN and IPS data from 1990 to 2012 as described in Provornikova et al. 2014. We additionally include a time varying magnetic field obtained from the OMNI database. We compare both models to observations along Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 and discuss whether magnetic dissipation is a significant process affecting the flows within the HS.",

At present, the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC), a branch of the Kuroshio Current, is the only warm current flowing into the marginal sea west of Japan. The TWC carries both subtropical water originating from the North Pacific and fresher runoff water derived from East China Sea continental shelf. The northerly flow of the TWC through the shallow Tsushima Straits is ultimately controlled by relative sea level variations over time.\nIODP Expedition 346 Sites U1427 and U1428/29 are ideally located to record changes in (i) the intensity of the influx of the TWC, and (ii) the intermediate ventilation of the marginal sea over the last million years. The Japan Sea Intermediate Water (JSIW) corresponds to a vertical salinity minimum, found below the TWC, between 200 and 400-500 m water depth. The JSIW shows a relatively high oxygen concentration, related to the deep water convection in winter and linked to fresh water supply during winter monsoon intervals. Based on recent observations, it is thought during glacial and interglacial conditions, and millennial scale climate cycles the intensity of deep and intermediate water currents varied but the mechanisms of such variations are not fully known.\nMicrofossil faunal proxies can be used for tracking bottom environmental conditions related to variability of the bottom water circulation intensity. Here, we present preliminary results obtained using ostracods (benthic microcrustaceans) that are abundant in the sedimentary sequences recovered at Sites U1427 and U1428/29, and are known to react sensitively to changes in water masses physico-chemical parameters. In particular, the variability of the genus Krithe through time is correlated with the sortable silt (carbonate-free, 10–63 µm sediment size distribution) to infer current speed and bottom water ventilation.",

            "abstract": "The role of cloud forcing on Arctic sea ice is fundamental but also complex, serving as an accelerant or antagonist to ice growth on a hemispheric scale. Though sea ice decline in recent decades is largely attributed to arctic amplification, plunges in ice extent and restorative winter refreezes occurring on a year-to-year basis cannot be adequately explained by this general trend. For improved understanding and prediction of these inter-annual fluctuations in ice area, cloud forcing effects on surface energy budgets must be seen as an important factor for ice growth and melt. For example, the significant rebound of arctic sea ice from the record minimum of September 2012 was aided by the surface cooling effects of negative winter cloud cover anomalies (fewer clouds), according to a recent study using satellite and reanalysis data.\nFor this study, the ERA-Interim reanalysis is used to diagnose and quantify the contribution of surface radiative forcing by wintertime cloud cover on sea ice during years with anomalous total ice areas. Comparisons between reanalysis of cloud forcing from September through March and passive microwave-derived ice concentrations in September demonstrate a significant inverse correlation between cloud cover during winter and the ice extent at the end of a melt season. Cloud re-emission of longwave radiation in winter months acts to curb the process by which polar seas radiatively cool to space and freeze, so that less winter cloud generally results in thicker sea ice. Here we investigate the role of winter cloud cover as a predictor and contributor to anomalous ice extent over the past 32 years. Our results stand to improve climate model projections of sea ice melt and assign some cause to large year-to-year ice area variability in a warming arctic regime.",

            "abstract": "Riparian areas and floodplains are characterized by woody vegetation, which is an essential feature to be accounted for in many hydro-environmental models. For applications including flood protection, river restoration and modelling of sediment processes, there is a need to improve the reliability of flow resistance estimates. Conventional methods such as the use of lumped resistance coefficients or simplistic cylinder-based drag force equations can result in significant errors, as these methods do not adequately address the effect of foliage and reconfiguration of flexible plant parts under flow action. To tackle the problem, physically-based methods relying on objective and measurable vegetation properties are advantageous for describing complex vegetation.\nWe have conducted flume and towing tank investigations with living and artificial plants, both in arrays and with isolated plants, providing new insight into advanced parameterization of natural vegetation. The stem, leaf and total areas of the trees confirmed to be suitable characteristic dimensions for estimating flow resistance. Consequently, we propose the use of leaf area index and leaf-to-stem-area ratio to achieve better drag force estimates. Novel remote sensing techniques including laser scanning have become available for effective collection of the required data. The benefits of the proposed parameterization have been clearly demonstrated in our newest experimental studies, but it remains to be investigated to what extent the parameter values are species-specific and how they depend on local habitat conditions.\nThe purpose of this contribution is to summarize developments in the estimation of vegetative drag force based on physically-based approaches as the latest research results are somewhat dispersed. In particular, concerning woody vegetation we seek to discuss three issues: 1) parameterization of reconfiguration with the Vogel exponent; 2) advantage of parameterizing plants with the leaf area index and leaf-to-stem-area ratio, and 3) effect of plant scale (size from twigs to mature trees). To analyze these issues we use experimental data from the authors’ research teams as well as from other researchers. The results are expected to be useful for the design of future experimental campaigns and developing drag force models.",

            "abstract": "It has been considered that there is a correlation between the double seismic zones and metamorphic dehydration reaction in deep slab. The lower seismic plane of the double seismic zone is considered to be located on the 600 oC isotherm in the subducting lithosphere. Antigorite terminal reaction is highly temperature sensitive around 600 oC. Therefore it has been proposed that the oceanic lithosphere was hydrated forming serpentine prior to subduction, then serpentine was decomposed to release fluid causing dehydration embrittlement in the slab. In order to unravel relation between dehydration and seismic deformation, we have investigated dehydration process of natural metamorphic rocks recording very cold geothermal history in the crust and lithosphere in the slab. Metamorphic olivine after antigorite has been described in Italian Alps and also from the Mt. Shiraga, Japan [1]. However, the olivine was formed with talc and fluid by antigorite breakdown reaction in pressures lower than 1.5 GPa. Spinifex olivine with opx in the Cerro del Almirez [2], is the product at pressures (P > 1.5 GPa) relevant to the lower seismic plane beneath Northeast Japan. It clearly indicates the presence of large amount of water facilitate crystallization of elongated olivine with opx. It is also supported by LPO pattern of olivines determined by EBSD. Fine-grained olivine-rich samples shows that Type-C fabric pattern is dominant, suggesting deformation under water-rich condition [3]. With metamorphic olivines, chlorite was also recrystallized, suggesting that water would be transported farther down to deep. The estimated dehydration reaction has a negative P-T slope at pressures higher than 1.5 GPa. The reaction is volume reducing reaction and the olivine-opx spinifex texture was formed under volume reducing reaction. In the warm slab beneath SW Japan, the reaction has a positive slope in P-T space and forms olivine+talc+fluid. From microstrucral and petrological analysis of the Serpentinite in the Sambagawa high P/T metamorphic rocks, we found that the olivine with talc, is preserved mainly in the vein along the shear crack in mylonitized serpentinite.

            "abstract": "A winter weather parameter that is underutilized in the prediction of Northeast snowfall events is critical thickness. Knowledge of atmospheric thickness values during snowfall can benefit the accuracy of winter forecasts, especially if thickness layer ranges at times without precipitation are known. This investigation aims to better understand atmospheric thickness variations in the 1000-500, 1000-700, and 1000-850 hPa layers at Albany, New York during snowfall with differing air mass conditions. Since snow can occur alongside a variety of air mass environments, distinctions in layer thickness between air mass types and critical levels will be examined. Pairing air mass information with an improved understanding of thicknesses may allow forecasters to determine normal snowfall conditions of the atmosphere and decipher when anomalous conditions are occurring alongside heavier snows. Daily geopotential height data are examined alongside Spatial Synoptic Classification weather types over the past decade. Air mass frequencies are computed and baseline thicknesses are established for non-snow days, days with snow and liquid precipitation, and days with only snowfall. Thicknesses are compared to those computed for seven air mass types and differences layers are examined for continuity. For the three air masses identified as prevalent during heavy snow, light-to-heavy and early-to-late season snowfall categories are established and thickness variations are evaluated against non-snow days for significant differences. Results indicate that the differences in layer thicknesses are comparable for all precipitation and non-snow days but around 40 geopotential meters less for pure-snow days. For air masses present during snow, layer thicknesses can vary by over 100 gpm with type. Isolating polar varieties, approximately 50 gpm thickness differences are found in pure-snow days. Comparable differences are detected between the moderate and polar types and the continuity between layers varies with type. In distinguishing by snow total, the thinnest and thickest layers vary for the Dry Polar, Moist Polar and Transitional air masses. Continuity in layer differences are also unique so that Transitional and Moist Polar exhibit comparable variations that the Dry Polar days do not display.",

            "abstract": "Most gravel-bedded rivers with perennial base flow are often armored, defined as having a bed surface grain size distribution that is coarser than the subsurface. In contrast, ephemerally flowing rivers, which are commonly flash flood-dominated, are typically unarmored. Although both types of channels have high peak discharges during floods, a key difference between these hydrological settings is in flow intermittency and how much flow occurs during moderate and low flow periods. High sediment supply and elevated shear stresses during floods have been identified as processes that may reduce or prevent armor development, but the preferential transport of smaller grain sizes during lower flows may also strongly affect armor development. We use numerical modeling to explore the relative importance of these armor-related processes. Calculations are based on a previous model called the Spawning Gravel Refresher, which includes mixed grain size sediment transport, morphodynamic feedbacks with channel slope, variable discharge hydrographs, and interactions with the subsurface grain sizes as the bed surface aggrades and erodes. Model runs are calibrated to natural rivers with varying degrees of bed surface armoring and flood hydrograph shape. These natural rivers include: i) the Nahal Yatir, an ephemerally flowing unarmored river in the Negev Desert, Israel, and ii) Trinity River, California, a larger perennially flowing, armored mountain river with annual snowmelt floods. We present a thorough exploration of model parameters, including base flow duration and magnitude, flood hydrograph shape and sand supply, combined with data from natural rivers. This produces quantitative bounds on how armor development varies in a wide range of parameter spaces unobtainable in the field alone.",

While mitigation measures exist at national and international scales, their implementation will be more effective if linked to the urban-scale of the sources. Routine top-down approaches that quantify emissions of GHG from cities and megacities are needed to understand the dynamics of the urban carbon cycle to eventually define relevant policy decisions. London is the biggest urban conurbation in Western Europe with more than 8 million inhabitants. It emitted roughly 45000 ktn CO2 in 20101. To understand the carbon dynamics and quantify anthropogenic emissions from London, airborne surveys of atmospheric CO2, O3, particles and meteorological variables were carried out over the city, onboard the NERC-ARSF Dornier-228 UK research aircraft. We applied an Integrative Mass Boundary Layer method (IMBL) using airborne CO2 observations obtained in horizontal transects crossing London at 360 m at different times of the day and by sampling upwind-downwind profiles. IMBL CO2 fluxes were compared to an emissions inventory and neighbourhood-scale eddy-covariance fluxes in central London.\nDaytime fluxes in October 2011 from the IMBL calculations ranged from 46 to 104 µmolCO2 m-2 s-1 and covered 30-70% of the urban region. The IMBL CO2 fluxes were the same order of magnitude as observed eddy-covariance fluxes and were statistically comparable to the emission inventory for the same footprint area.\nA sensitivity analysis suggested that horizontal variability of the CO2 field in the urban mixing layer is the most critical factor affecting IMBL fluxes. The determination of the boundary height and vertical wind speed had more impact on fluxes calculated from upwind-downwind profiles.\nFurthermore, low-altitude airborne measurements of CO2 provide the advantage of direct observation of the CO2 urban dome of a megacity and relate the spatial distribution of concentrations of CO2 to the spatial distribution of emissions and to meteorological conditions.\n",

            "abstract": "The processes that influence the dispersion of effluent discharges in the sea occur over a wide range of length and time scales. The distance that effluent can travel before it is considered mixed can be several kilometres, whereas the turbulent eddies that affect the near-field mixing of a discharge can be as small as a few centimetres.\nThe range of scales that are involved mean that it is not generally practical to include all influencing physical phenomena within one model. Typically, the modelling of effluent dispersion is performed using two separate numerical models: a local model of the outlet(s), including the near-field effects of momentum, buoyancy and turbulence; and a larger scale model that can include the far-field effects of tidal-, wind- and wave-driven-currents, water depth variations, atmospheric fluxes, and Coriolis forces.\nThe boundary between the two models is often not strictly defined, but is usually placed at the transition from where the behaviour of the effluent is dominated by the ambient environment, rather than the discharge characteristics and outfall configuration. In most real applications, this transition line varies considerably in time and space.\nThis paper presents the findings of collaborative research between the Applied Modelling and Computation Group (AMCG) at Imperial College London, UK, and HR Wallingford Ltd. Results are presented using a range of coupling methods to link the near- and far-field mixing regions. An idealised domain and tidal conditions are used, with the outfall and ambient conditions typical of those found at small coastal desalination plants. Open-source CFD code Fluidity is used for both the near-field and far-field modelling. Fluidity scales well when run in parallel on large numbers of cores. It also has an anisotropic adaptive mesh capability which allows local control over solution accuracy throughout the domain. This combination means that accuracy can be achieved without excessive time costs, with nodes adjusting to efficiently concentrate computational effort only on those areas of the flow that are influential to model accuracy.\nThe simulation results are used to give a pragmatic cost / benefit analysis of the various coupling methods, comparing their accuracy and speed where used in outfall design studies.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have focused on hydrological and geochemical fluxes to the ocean from land to the ocean via submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), however few have assessed these contributions of SGD in deltaic settings. The Mississippi River delta is the largest delta in North America, and the magnitude of groundwater that discharges from the river into its delta is relatively unknown. Hydrological budgets indicate that there is a large magnitude of surface water lost in the Mississippi’s delta as the river flows into the Gulf of Mexico. Recent evidence in our study indicates that paleochannels, or semi-permeable buried sandy bodies that were former distributaries of the river, allow for water to discharge out of the Mississippi’s main channel and into its delta driven by a difference in hydraulic head between the river and the lower lying coastal embayments. Our study uses geophysical data, including sonar and resistivity methods, to detect the location of these paleochannels in Barataria Bay, a coastal bay located in the Mississippi Delta. High resolution CHIRP sonar data shows that these paleochannel features are ubiquitous in the Mississippi Delta, whereas resistivity data indicates that lower salinity water is found during high river flow in bays proximate to the river. Sediment core analysis is also used to characterize the area of study, as well as further understand the regional geology of the Mississippi Delta and estimate values of permeability and hydraulic conductivity of sediments taken from two locations in Barataria Bay. The geophysical and sediment core data will likewise be used to contextualize geochemical data collected in the field, which includes an assessment of major cations and anions, as well as in situ Rn-222 activities, a method that has been proven to be useful as a tracer of groundwater movement. The results may be useful in understanding the potential global magnitude of hydrological and geochemical fluxes of other large rivers with abandoned distributaries and can have implications for urban planning and planning of coastal restoration projects, as many large global deltas sustain significant populations.",

The objectives of this work are to constrain the number of advance-retreat cycles that have occurred through the Late Quaternary, examine the impact of the Bering Glacier on the continental shelf and slope, and reconstruct Bering Glacier dynamics. By tying these sequences with δ18O stratigraphy, we can test the Bering Glacier’s relation to global ice sheet evolution and better understand the degree to which the glacial advance-retreat cycles were in phase with global events.\nOur results show that: (1) Identification of erosional surfaces and glacigenic landforms that record positions of stillstand events and diagnose the style of retreat allow us to distinguish nine phases of glacial advances and subsequent retreats. (2) Mapping shows that glacier pathways and flow directions through time are influenced by the occurrence of thick grounding-zone deposits and shifting foci of erosion. (3) Continuous buildup of glacigenic sediment fills tectonically created accommodation space and allows the glacier to advance seaward for the last three advances. Discovery of systematic, prominent deposition of glacial diamict and ice-rafted debris (IRD) during phases of glacial retreat is supported by the drilling data and suggests reconsideration of IRD impact on slope sedimentation. (4) The trough mouth fan started its development during marine isotope stage (MIS) 6, progressively advancing to the position of present shelf edge during the subsequent MIS 4 and MIS 2 and is recognized by evidence of extensive deposition of glacigenic debris flows on the slope. (5) Sedimentation rates in the depocenter are exceptionally high and are estimated to be 1-2 m/k.y. through the middle Pleistocene on the shelf and 4-5 m/k.y. average through MIS 6 on the slope.",

MADRAS was the primary instrument on-board MT to estimate rainfall characteristics, but unfortunately it's scanning mechanism failed obscuring the primary goal of the mission.So an attempt has been made to retrieve rainfall and different hydrometeors using other instrument SAPHIR onboard MT. The most important advantage of using MT is its orbitography which is specifically designed for tropical regions and can reach up to 6 passes per day more than any other satellite currently in orbit. Although SAPHIR is an humidity sounder with six channels centred around 183 GHz channel, it still operates in the microwave region which directly interacts with rainfall, especially wing channels and thus can pick up rainfall signatures. Initial analysis using radiative transfer models also establish this fact .To get more conclusive results using observations, SAPHIR level 1 brightness temperature (BT) data was compared with different rainfall products utilizing the benefits of each product. SAPHIR BT comparison with TRMM 3B42 for one pass clearly showed that channel 5 and 6 have a considerable sensitivity towards rainfall. Following this a huge database of more than 300000 raining pixels of spatially and temporally collocated 3B42 rainfall and corresponding SAPHIR BT for an entire month was created to include all kinds of rainfall events, to attain higher temporal resolution collocated database was also created for SAPHIR BT and rainfall from infrared sensor on geostationary satellite Kalpana 1.These databases were used to understand response of various channels of SAPHIR to different rainfall regimes . TRMM 2A12 rainfall product was also used to identify capabilities of SAPHIR to retrieve cloud and ice water path which also gave significant correlation.\nConclusively,we have shown that SAPHIR has capability to retrieve rainfall and hydrometeors and especially channel 6 has the maximum potential for it. Thus this capabilities of SAPHIR can be used to develop precipitation product in combination with other GPM satellites to get higher temporal resolution rainfall product for the world.",

Voyager 1 found the heliopause to be essentially a (compound) magnetic separatrix, because the intensity of the non-thermal particle population became undetectably small beyond the HP, whereas the anisotropy characteristics of the galactic cosmic rays were consistent with no re-entry of the magnetic field lines into the HS (at either end). This paper attempts to synthesize in situ observations from Voyagers 1 and 2 (thermal plasma, magnetic field, energetic ions, and cosmic rays) with global ENA images from IBEX and Cassini/INCA into a self-consistent representation of the PSD within the noseward HS from thermal energies to several MeV/nuc. The interpretation of the ENA images requires assumptions on the global behavior of the bulk plasma flow throughout the HS that are self-consistent with all the available data (e.g., the spatial and energy dependence of the IBEX ribbon), because the Compton-Getting effects produced by the flows strongly affect the intensities (and thereby the partial densities and pressures) inferred from the ENA images.",

            "abstract": "Evaluations of RCM downscaling skills in temperature extremes and understanding the extreme temperature changes are among the greatest desire because temperature extremes are expected to change in severity, frequency, and duration as a result of anthropogenic global warming. Here we develop a “borrowing strength” GEV model to evaluate the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) downscaling skill in extreme temperature. A spatial-varying long-term trend is assumed for the location parameter of the GEV model, which estimates the trend of extreme temperature. The performance of WRF in extreme maximum temperature is evaluated by comparing with a reanalysis data set from North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). The WRF model’s ability to retain and add value beyond the driving conditions is investigated by comparing with National Centers for Environmental Prediction-U.S. Department of Energy Reanalysis II (NCEP-R2), which provides the initial and boundary conditions to the WRF. Generally, despite of certain biases for different parameters over different parts of US, there is a good agreement in spatial pattern and magnitude of three parameters of GEV distribution between the WRF and NARR. The WRF retains some value from its driver — NCEP-R2, but more importantly, it adds small-scale features beyond NCEP-R2, which is close to the NARR and essential to reproduce the extreme events.\nOn the other hand, we will show useful approaches for identifying added value by the WRF beyond the driving data in terms of precipitation (light and heavy). The approaches include (1) spatial correlation for a range of spatial lags using total monthly precipitation and non-seasonal precipitation components; and (2) spatio-temporal correlation for a wide range of distances, directions, and time lags using daily precipitation occurrence. The WRF provides realistic details of spatial and spatio-temporal correlations at finer scales than the NCEP-R2, and interestingly, the WRF also provides more accurate correlations than the driver (NCEP-R2) at the resolution of the NCEP-R2.",

            "abstract": "The planetary boundary layer (PBL) is a region of inherent interest because reactive VOCs emitted from the forest canopy are mixed with the residual and free tropospheric air masses, oxidized, and/or otherwise removed in this region. The characterization of diurnal variation of VOCs in the PBL is limited due to the lack of appropriate sampling platforms that are able to probe all the regions of interest: from the surface to the entrainment zone. Here we present the application of the Whole Air Sample Profiler (WASP) system during the 2013 Southeast Atmosphere Study (SAS) campaign.\nA total of 41 research flights (RFs) were carried out during the 2013 SAS campaign between June 1 and June 14 over the Alabama Aquatic Biodiversity Center (AABC) site and the SEARCH site. During each RF, ambient air sampling started from 50-100 m above the canopy top and stopped at ~1200 m above the mean sea level (a.m.s.l). The air samples were subsequently analyzed by using a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS). Here we analyze the vertical profiles and averaged diurnal variation of the mixing ratios of several reactive VOC species, including isoprene, the sum of monoterpenes, and first generation oxidation products of isoprene: methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein (MVK+MACR).\nA MiXed Layer Chemistry (MXLCH) model, guided by the meteorological and chemical observations during the SAS campaign, is used to study the influence of boundary layer dynamics and new isoprene oxidation mechanism on the diurnal variation of major biogenic VOCs emitted from the forest canopy. The new scheme includes OH recycling through two pathways under low-NOx regime: (1) hydroxyl peroxy radicals (HOC5H8OO∙; ISOPO2) unimolecular isomerization, and (2) ISOPO2+HO2. The model is able to reproduce the evolution of the boundary layer dynamics (including potential temperature, and boundary layer height) during the selected simulation dates. Based on the model results, budget analyses are performed to study the roles that the boundary layer dynamics and chemistry play in controlling the evolution of VOCs in the PBL. Chemical tendencies of important species, including organic peroxy radicals (RO2), HO2, and OH are calculated to evaluate the capacity of the new isoprene scheme in explaining the photooxidation processes in the PBL.",

Despite their importance in this respect they are heavily undersampled with only about 5 currently monitored glaciers out of more than 20000 distributed over complexly varying climatic regions. In 2012, Asiaq, Greenland Survey initiated therefore a glacier mass balance program at Qassinnguit glacier (64°9’N, 51°17’W), approx. 18 km East of Nuuk, Greenland’s capital. The glacier is a representative example for mountain glaciers in South-West Greenland both in terms of size (ca 1 km2) and orientation (N). A dense stake network gives the basis for the determination of the surface mass balance with the glaciological method as well as flow velocity measurements and the first two complete years are presented. An automated camera is used to monitor ablation patterns and the evolution of the snow line. In early 2014, a ground-penetrating radar campaign was performed to determine the glacier volume. Ice thicknesses up to 50 m were measured with a 100 MHz antenna and the glacier was found to be largely cold-based with some minor temperate parts. In addition to direct glaciological measurements at the site, the monitoring program complements a 7 year long time series of runoff, which allows for quantifying Qassinnguit glacier’s cryospheric contribution to the total catchment. In summer 2014 an on-glacier automated weather station was installed that measures parameters to determine the surface energy balance. Preliminary results will be presented and put into a larger spatial context by relating them to measurements with the same setup at an outlet glacier of the Greenland ice sheet approximately 100 km further East. Climate between these sites differs considerably with a marked negative West – East precipitation gradient.",

Res. Lett. 40, 1945-1949]. While the propagation of gravity wave from troposphere to ionosphere is complex and nonlinear, the propagation of infrasound wave is simpler and linear. Thus, the responsible source might be determined with an array of GPS TEC observations. Knowing the source in the thunderstorm for the infrasonic disturbance will help us understand the source mechanism and the upward coupling process. In this presentation we report a new technique that is capable of geolocating the infrasonic sources by using instantaneous phase information in the TEC variations between pairs of simultaneous, spatially separated TEC measurements. It is surprising that the sources for the ionospheric infrasound disturbances are commonly traced back to the stratiform regions of the storms, indicating that stratiform region electrical discharges and the consequent high-altitude discharges (e.g., sprites) might be responsible for these disturbances.",

            "abstract": "A challenge for mapping live fuels and their dynamics in rangeland ecosystems is separating fuel conditions and changes from background variation. Rangelands are characterized by seasonal and inter-annual spectral variation associated with phenology and other factors. Remote sensing systems for assessing these ecosystems, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), enable characterization of intra- and inter-annual spectral conditions across all seasons. Fuel conditions in rangelands are influenced by major disturbances such as fires, and phenological changes are strongly influenced by weather and climate. Fuel load data are key components to simulating areas that are more likely to burn and burn severity, and to provide regional estimates biomass burning emissions. We developed an approach for mapping live fuel load, biomass density, dynamics using enhanced MODIS (eMODIS) data at a spatial resolution of 250m. Generalized allometric models were developed to estimate branch biomass and aboveground biomass based on independent variables of maximum foliage biomass. Temporal leaf area index (LAI) data were converted from weekly eMODIS Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) data for various vegetation types and fitted to a vegetation growing model to reduce uncertainty. Results from the study area (Owyhee and Twin Falls) will be examined and validated by using high-resolution aerial photography (WorldView) and field data. Additionally, we analyzed and summarized the correlations among fire occurrence (frequency), burn severity, live fuel load, and climatic conditions. Our results demonstrate that mapping fuel load and its dynamics in shrubland and grassland with remotely sensed time series data can capture spatiotemporal heterogeneity in nonforest live fuel types relevant to fire disturbances and climate/weather variation. This work provides a useful and powerful mapping approach that can improve and augment existing LANDFIRE fuels data in shrubland and grassland. This approach can be used to monitor changing fuel conditions and meet the needs in response to management activities and climate change.",

            "abstract": "In subduction zones, spatial variations in pore fluid pressure are hypothesized to control the distribution and nature of slip behavior (e.g., “normal” earthquakes, slow slip events, non-volcanic tremor, very low frequency earthquakes) on the plate boundary fault. A primary control on the pore fluid pressure distribution in subduction zones is the distribution of fluid release from hydrous minerals in the subducting sediment and rock. The distributions of these diagenetic and metamorphic fluid sources are controlled by the pressure-temperature paths that the subducting material follows. Thus, constraining subduction zone thermal structure is required to inform conceptual models of seismic behavior. Here, we present results of thermal models for the Mexico subduction zone, a system that has received recent attention due to observations of slow-slip events and non-volcanic tremor. We model temperatures in five margin-perpendicular transects from 96 ˚W to 104 ˚W. In each transect, we examine the potential thermal effects of vigorous fluid circulation in a high permeability aquifer within the basaltic basement of the oceanic crust. In the transect at 100˚W, hydrothermal circulation cools the subducting material by up to 140 ˚C, shifting peak slab dehydration landward by ~100 km relative to previous estimates from models that do not include the effects of fluid circulation. The age of the subducting plate in the trench increases from ~3 Ma at 104 ˚W to ~18 Ma at 96 ˚W; hydrothermal circulation redistributes the most heat (and cools the system the most) where the subducting plate is youngest. For systems with <20 Ma subducting lithosphere, hydrothermal circulation in oceanic crust should be considered in estimating subduction zone temperatures and fluid source distributions.",

            "abstract": "Mountain glaciers play an important role in the water budget of many basins in western North America. Glacier storage and melt strongly control the seasonality of runoff and can modulate inter-annual variability in glaciarized basins. In particular, glacier runoff can provide a substantial source of streamflow during dry summer months. The importance of glacier runoff from an ecological and water resource perspective, coupled with observations of glacier retreat over recent decades, provides the impetus for accurately simulating runoff from glaciarized regions. The ultimate goal is to derive a greater understanding of the hydrologic response to both climate change and climate variability via improved representation of the cryosphere in hydrologic models. In an effort to more skilfully simulate the cryospheric component of the hydrologic cycle in the mountainous terrain of western North America, we have embarked on a process of updating the macro-scale Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrology model to include the ability to simulate glacier mass balance and glacier dynamics. This presentation, which deals with the first part of this effort, reveals progress to date in implementing a process-based representation of glacier accumulation, melt and runoff. We aim to describe the new VIC glacier mass balance model and to present results regarding the testing of the glacier mass balance, water storage and runoff algorithms. Model testing, calibration and validation will be accomplished by confronting the model with observed glacier mass balance and streamflow data collected from several monitoring sites within the western Canadian Cordillera. Challenges with respect to model calibration and application will also be discussed.",

We investigate the consequences of this excess snow for the upward heat fluxes throughout the year, and how this impacts forecast accuracy in a global ice-ocean prediction model (GIOPS).

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is a process of injecting high-pressure slurry into a rockmass to enhance its permeability. Variants of this process are used for unconventional oil and gas development, engineered geothermal systems and block-cave mining; similar processes occur within volcanic systems. Opening of hydraulic fractures is well documented by mineback trials and tiltmeter monitoring and is a physical requirement to accommodate the volume of injected fluid. Numerous microseismic monitoring investigations acquired in the audio-frequency band are interpreted to show a prevalence of shear-dominated failure mechanisms surrounding the tensile fracture. Moreover, the radiated seismic energy in the audio-frequency band appears to be a miniscule fraction (<< 1%) of the net injected energy, i.e., the integral of the product of fluid pressure and injection rate.\nWe use a simple penny-shaped crack model as a predictive framework to describe seismic characteristics of tensile opening during hydraulic fracturing. This model provides a useful scaling relation that links seismic moment to effective fluid pressure within the crack. Based on downhole recordings corrected for attenuation, a significant fraction of observed microseismic events are characterized by S/P amplitude ratio < 5. Despite the relatively small aperture of the monitoring arrays, which precludes both full moment-tensor analysis and definitive identification of nodal planes or axes, this ratio provides a strong indication that observed microseismic source mechanisms have a component of tensile failure. In addition, we find some instances of periodic spectral notches that can be explained by an opening/closing failure mechanism, in which fracture propagation outpaces fluid velocity within the crack. Finally, aseismic growth of tensile fractures may be indicative of a scenario in which injected energy is consumed to create new fracture surfaces. Taken together, our observations and modeling provide evidence that failure mechanisms documented by passive monitoring of hydraulic fractures may contain a significant component of tensile failure, including fracture opening and closing, although creation of extensive new fracture surfaces may be a seismically inefficient process that radiates at sub-audio frequencies.",

            "abstract": "Starting in the late 1990s, the seasonal hydrologic and thermal regimes of Earth's largest lake system have been characterized by very high surface water temperatures, below-average ice cover, persistent low water levels and extremely high over-lake evaporation rates. However, the harsh winter conditions of 2013-2014 led to very low surface water temperatures and an exceptionally broad and persistent areal extent of ice cover. The contrast between the extreme 2013-2014 winter conditions on the Great Lakes and the conditions from the preceding 15-year period raises compelling questions about the extent to which hydrometeorological conditions have changed in the Great Lakes region, how they might be expected to change in the future, and to what extent those changes are reflected in currrent regional research-oriented and operational forecasts.\nHere, we analyze historical intra-seasonal relationships between late winter and subsequent late fall thermal regimes on the Great Lakes and find that, for some of the lakes, memory of seasonal heat content is strong, but can be significantly impacted by hydrometeorological conditions including wind speed and solar radiation. In fact, we find that the late 1990s, a period coinciding with one of the strongest El Ninos on record, represent a shift in the hydrologic and thermal regimes of the Great Lakes, and that projections for the fall of 2014 suggest that the regime might be offset by the recent cold winter. Our findings also provide evidence that the transition in the Great Lakes' altered thermal regime in the late 1990s was triggered by abrupt increases not only in air and water temperatures associated with the coincident El Nino, but also by a combination of reduced cloud cover and above-average summer solar radiation. The extent to which these changes are explicitly represented in regional forecasting systems is critically important to regional water resource management planning.",

            "abstract": "The relative importance of heterogeneous and homogeneous ice nucleation for cirrus formation remains an active area of debate in the cloud physics community. From a theoretical perspective, a number of modeling studies have investigated the sensitivity of ice number concentration to the nucleation mechanism and the abundance of ice nuclei. However, these studies typically only addressed ice concentration immediately after ice nucleation. Recent modeling work has shown that the high ice concentrations produced by homogeneous freezing may not persist very long, which is consistent with the low frequency of occurrence of high ice concentrations indicated by cirrus measurements. Here, I use idealized simulations to investigate the impact of ice nucleation mechanism and ice nuclei abundance on the full lifecycle of cirrus clouds. The primary modeling framework used includes different modes of ice nucleation, deposition growth/sublimation, aggregation, sedimentation, and radiation. A limited number of cloud-resolving simulations that treat radiation/dynamics interactions will also been presented. I will show that for typical synoptic situations with mesoscale waves present, the time-averaged cirrus ice crystal size distributions and bulk cloud properties are less sensitive to ice nucleation processes than might be expected from the earlier simple ice nucleation calculations. I will evaluate the magnitude of the ice nuclei impact on cirrus for a range of temperatures and mesoscale wave specifications, and I will discuss the implications for cirrus aerosol indirect effects in general.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic motion, volcanic inflation or deflation, as well as oil, gas and water pumping can induce vertical motion. In southern California these signals are inter-mingled. In tectonics, properly identifying regions that are contaminated by other signals can be important when estimating fault slip rates. Until recently vertical deformation rates determined by high precision Global Positioning Systems (GPS) had large uncertainties compared to horizontal components and were rarely used to constrain tectonic models of fault motion. However, many continuously occupied GPS stations have been operating for ten or more years, often delivering uncertainties of ~1 mm/yr or less, providing better constraints for tectonic modeling. Various processing centers produced GPS time series and estimated vertical velocity fields, each with their own set of processing techniques and assumptions.\nWe compare vertical velocity solutions estimated by seven data processing groups as well as two combined solutions (Figure 1). These groups include: Central Washington University (CWU) and New Mexico Institute of Technology (NMT), and their combined solution provided by the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) through the UNAVCO website. Also compared are the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Scripps Orbit and Permanent Array Center (SOPAC) and their combined solution provided as part of the NASA MEaSUREs project. Smaller velocity fields included are from Amos et al., 2014, processed at the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory, Shen et al., 2011, processed by UCLA and called the Crustal Motion Map 4.0 (CMM4) dataset, and a new velocity field provided by the University of Miami (UM). Our analysis includes estimating and correcting for systematic vertical velocity and uncertainty differences between groups. Our final product is a unified velocity field that contains the median values of the adjusted velocity fields and their uncertainties. This product will be periodically updated when new velocity fields become available. A database and scripts to access the database will be available through the University of Miami (http://www.geodesy.miami.edu) website.\nFigure 1.

            "abstract": "Regional climate forecasts for the western United States predict slightly more snow accumulation during the winter but warmer springs and earlier spring snowmelt. Snowmelt will be further advanced by radiative forcing from dust and black carbon deposition on mountain snowpack. We expect earlier snowmelt to reduce regional water supplies (\nPainter et al., 2010\n) and suspect that it may also lead to drier soil conditions which could impact nutrient cycling and plant growth and reproduction in alpine and subalpine environments. Our snow manipulation experiment included 12 sites at two elevations in paired forest and meadow sites. We added dust to the snow surface during spring ablation. The dust treatment reduced snowpack by 20 to 40% and advanced the snowfree date by 9 to 14 days. Following snowmelt, there was a temporary difference in soil moisture in the upper 0-15 cm of soil between the treatment and control plots. Following snowmelt, the temporary differences in soil moisture quickly converged during soil drydown to a lower limit determined by the soil characteristics specific to each site. This brief window of differences in soil moisture may have temporary impacts on ecosystem processes; however, the impacts are mediated by plant and microbial phenology. Some of the plants and microbes in seasonally-snow-covered environments are adapted to take advantage of the early season environments which include low temperatures and frequent freezing, while other plants and microbes have evolved to avoid this transition period through prolonged dormancy. These adaptations, and the transient nature of environmental differences caused by early snowmelt, may limit the impacts of early snowmelt on carbon and nitrogen cycling and on plant growth and reproduction in subalpine forest and meadows.",

            "abstract": "Human society have altered terrestrial hydrological cycles by water management infrastructure, such as reservoirs and weirs for irrigation, in order to enable stable water use against natural variability. On the other hand, anthropogenic climate change is projected to alter the hydro-meteorological cycles, and it is projected that drought frequency and/or intensity will increase in some regions. Thus reliable projection is a critical issue for our society in order to adapt for the change. However, only few studies have investigated the effect of anthropogenic intervention on drought under climate change.\nThis study focuses on hydrological drought, particularly on stream flow, as stream flow is one of the most easy-to-access water resource. HiGW-MAT, a state of arts land surface model capable to reproduce energy and water cycle considering the anthropogenic water management, is used to simulate the historical and future terrestrial water cycles. The model includes reservoir operation, water withdrawal and irrigation process. Five CMIP5 GCM outputs with bias-correction provided by ISI-MIP for 1980-2099 are used to force a set of simulations. Time series data of global hydrological drought for 120 years, with and without human activity, is analyzed in order to estimate the impact of climate change and the adaptation capacity of anthropogenic water management. It is identified that Europe, Central and Eastern Asia, East and West part of USA, Chile, Amazon basin and Congo basin will have large increases of drought more than 90 days. According to uncertainty check particular increases in Central USA and Southern and Eastern South America have high robustness. Dividing global land into 26 regions, we characterized the variation of drought time series for each region. Drought does not show abrupt change and show almost linear increase in many regions. Also, it is found that human activity effectively reduces the increasing rate and suppresses the natural variability under projected warming climate. Nevertheless, the increasing trends are significant under RCP8.5 scenario. In the regions where large increase of drought is projected, drought will depart from historical condition to unexperienced phase in each region until 2050. It alarms human society has to consider countermeasures for the coming change promptly.",

            "abstract": "Urban valleys can experience serious air pollution problems of concern for public health. The venting of pollution out of an urban valley is limited by the topography and can be further restricted by low-level temperature inversions and/or local circulations such as those induced by the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. The combined effects of a temperature inversion and a UHI on the dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer and the associated mechanisms of air pollution transport in urban valleys were studied through idealized simulations performed with the EULAG model. Three different aspects were considered: the expansion of the urban area, variations in surface heating owing to topographic shading, and variations of the topography. The results show that different mechanisms of air pollution transport may arise in urban valleys as a result of the interplay between the temperature inversion, the slope flows, and the UHI. Three types of interrelated mechanisms of air pollution transport were identified. Type A describes the transport of pollutants by the slope winds, which can reduce pollution in the lower levels or reinforce the trapping of pollutants below the inversion layer depending on the UHI effect on weakening or reversing the upslope winds. Type B describes closed slope-flow circulations that are likely to occur below an inversion layer near the base of the sidewalls of valleys where an urban area is concentrated on the valley floor. These circulations can develop when upslope winds are detrained toward the center due to the inversion layer, or when the UHI forces downslope winds linked to ascending flows that are also restricted by the inversion layer. Pollutants can remain trapped within these circulation cells that have been termed smog traps. Type C describes a low-level UHI-induced circulation that tends to concentrate pollutants in the valley center and may cause the development of elevated polluted layers below the inversion layer. The persistence of these type of mechanisms could cause severe air pollution episodes in urban valleys. Despite the completely idealized framework adopted, this study provides evidence about a series of physical processes that are likely to occur in nature and agrees well with previous studies.",

            "abstract": "Martian sand ripples present a challenge for rover mobility, with drives over ripples often characterized by high wheel sinkage and slippage that can lead to incipient embedding. Since landing in Gale Crater, Curiosity has traversed multiple sand ripples, including the transverse aeolian ridge (TAR) straddling Dingo Gap on sols 533 and 535. On sol 672, Curiosity crossed backward over a series of sand ripples before ending its drive after high motor currents initiated visual odometry (VO) processing, which detected 77% slip, well in excess of the imposed 60% slip limit. At the end of the drive, the right front wheel was deeply embedded at the base of a ripple flank with >20 cm sinkage and the rear wheels were near a ripple crest. As Curiosity continues its approach to Mount Sharp it will have to cross multiple ripples, and thus it is important to understand Curiosity’s performance on sol 672 and over similar ripples. To this end the sol 672 drive was simulated in ARTEMIS (Adams-Based Rover Terramechanics Interaction Simulator), a software tool consisting of realistic rover mechanical models, a wheel-terrain interaction module for deformable and non-deformable surfaces, and realistic terrain models. ARTEMIS results, Dumont Dunes tests performed in the Mojave Desert using the Scarecrow test rover, and single wheel tests performed at MIT indicate that the high slip encountered on sol 672 likely occurred due to a combination of rover attack angle, ripple geometry, and soil properties. When ripple wavelength approaches vehicle length, the rover can reach orientations in which the leading wheels carry minimal normal loads and the trailing wheels sink deeply, resulting in high slippage and insufficient thrust to propel the rover over ripples. Even on relatively benign (i.e. low tilt) terrains, local morphology can impose high sinkage, thus impeding rover motion. Work is underway to quantify Curiosity’s drive performance over various ripple geometries to retrieve soil properties and to generate better driving practices across ripples.",

            "abstract": "Climate models predict a range of changes in the Amazonian region, including increased frequency of extreme climatic events, increased average temperatures, increased atmospheric CO2 and reduced rainfall intensity.\nUnderstanding tree growth response to climate is important because wood production is the main way carbon enters the forest ecosystem. The response of tropical tree growth to changing climate could drive a change in the direction of the flux from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere.\nRecently, in French Guiana, we have observed that the peak increase in biomass (early wet season), estimated by diameter growth, was not correlated with the peak in chlorophyll activity (early dry season) in French Guiana. This could reflect different timing in the use of photosynthesis products by the plant for primary growth, i.e. shoot growth and leaves production, and secondary growth, i.e. wood production.\nTo go further, we conducted an analysis combining information on monthly tree growth measurements from 13694 trees (73 pan-tropical forest sites) and monthly litterfall measurements (81 South American sites), with their correspondent monthly climate data and satellite derived vegetation indices (MODIS EVI and NDVI), to calibrate, parameterize and validate a pan-tropical model of biomass production.\nSpecifically, we aim to (i) analyze if there is a coherence between the biological mechanisms observed from field and from satellite measurements and (ii) determine the relative contribution of climate and environmental site characteristics on the seasonal biomass production.\nThe results of this work will provide a novel pantropical description of the carbon cycle in tropical forest ecosystems at a seasonal time scale as a function of site and climate characteristics and will be used to quantify changes in tropical forest functioning, in terms of the responses of carbon fluxes to climate change using the CMIP5 climate scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic limitations are known to control transpiration in forest ecosystems when the soil is drying or when the vapor pressure deficit between the air and stomata is very large, but they can also impact stomatal apertures under conditions of adequate soil moisture and lower evaporative demand. We use the NACP dataset of latent heat flux measurements and model observations for multiple sites and models to demonstrate models’ difficulties in capturing intra-daily hysteresis. We hypothesize that this is a result of un-resolved afternoon stomata closure due to hydrodynamic stresses. The current formulations for stomatal conductance and the empirical coupling between stomatal conductance and soil moisture used by these models does not resolve the hydrodynamic process of water movement from the soil to the leaves. This approach does not take advantage of advances in our understanding of water flow and storage in the trees, or of tree and canopy structure. A more thorough representation of the tree-hydrodynamic processes could potentially remedy this significant source of model error.\nIn a forest plot at the University of Michigan Biological Station, we use measurements of sap flux and leaf water potential to demonstrate that trees of similar type - late successional deciduous trees – have very different hydrodynamic strategies that lead to differences in their temporal patterns of stomatal conductance and thus hysteretic cycles of transpiration. These differences will lead to large differences in conductance and water use based on the species composition of the forest. We also demonstrate that the size and shape of the tree branching system leads to differences in extent of hydrodynamic stress, which may change the forest respiration patterns as the forest grows and ages. We propose a framework to resolve tree hydrodynamics in global and regional models based on the Finite-Elements Tree-Crown Hydrodynamics model (FETCH) –a hydrodynamic model that can resolve the fast dynamics of stomatal conductance. FETCH simulates water flow through a tree as a system of porous media conduits and calculates the amount of hydraulic limitation to stomatal conductance, given the atmospheric and biological variables from the global model, and could replace the current empirical formulation for stomatal adjustment based on soil moisture.",

            "abstract": "Seismology is an observational science. Hence, the effort to understand details of seismic signals from underground nuclear explosions requires analysis of waveforms recorded from past nuclear explosions. Of principal interest, are regional signals from explosions too small to be reliably identified via teleseismic recording.\nBut the great majority of stations operated today, even those in networks for nuclear explosion monitoring, have never recorded explosion signals at regional distances, because most stations were installed long after the period when most underground nuclear explosions were conducted; and the few nuclear explosions since the early 1990s were mostly recorded only at teleseismic distances. We have therefore gathered thousands of nuclear explosion regional seismograms from more than 200 analog stations operated in the former Soviet Union. Most of them lie in a region stretching approximately 6000 km East-West and 2000 km North-South and including much of Central Asia. We have digitized them and created a modern digital database, including significant metadata. Much of this work has been done in Kazakhstan. Most of the explosions were underground, but several were conducted in the atmosphere.\nThis presentation will characterize the content and overall quality of the new database for signals from nuclear explosions in Eurasia, which were conducted across substantial ranges of yield and shot-point depth, and under a great variety of different geological conditions.\nThis work complements a 20-year collaborative effort which made the original digital recordings of the Borovoye Geophysical Observatory, Kazakhstan, openly available in a modern format (see http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/pi/Monitoring/Data/).\nFor purposes of characterizing explosive sources, it would be of assistance to have seismogram archives from explosions conducted in all regions including the Pacific, North Africa, and the United States (including the Aleutians). Openly available seismogram archives for Eurasian explosions are in several respects now better than those for explosions conducted by the United States, France, and the UK, especially for the era from 1960 to about 1985. The opportunity to build and improve such archives will not last indefinitely.",

            "abstract": "To investigate on the differences and similarities of snow depth spatial variability over different watershed areas, five sites in Southern Sierra Nevada Critical Zone Observatory were selected for creating the snow depth maps using the snow-on and snow-off LiDAR datasets. The snow-on data were collected during the snow-peak time in 2010, while the snow-off data were collected during the summer in the same year. By subtracting the digital elevation models (DEM) of the snow-off data from the snow-on point clouds, snow-depth maps for these sites were created. Furthermore, canopy height, slope, and aspect are also appended with the snow-depth for digging out the impact on the snow distribution from these topography features. From the results, the snow depth in the open area increases at 14-15 cm/100 m elevation increasing is consistent across areas in the elevation range from 1850m to 2700m, while The results under the canopy presented an increasing rate about 2 cm/100 m higher but with around 20 cm lower of snow depth compared to that in the open area. Other than elevation, aspect also has a tremendous effect on snow distribution with the result showing that the ground facing to the northeast direction always having more snow accumulated than other areas regardless of vegetation existence.\nEven though the results reveal strong consistency of the vegetation impact on the snow depth across sites, only about 35% of total area is under canopy in forested areas and less than 30% of LiDAR beams could be returned from the ground under the canopy. The LiDAR might overestimate the snowpack volume but is still an important index for blending with ground data and data from remote-sensing satellites. Also, implied from the tight connection between snow depth and aspect, it is suggested that solar radiation, wind speed and direction, temperature, as well as other environmental factors are interacting with topography features and playing important roles in snowpack redistribution and ablation. Therefore, data blending research work will be necessary for people to have better understanding of snow dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater is a major natural resource, yet little is known about the contribution of microbial anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) activity to subsurface nitrogen cycling. During anammox, energy is generated as ammonium is oxidized under anaerobic conditions to dinitrogen gas, using nitrite as the final electron acceptor. This process is a global sink for fixed nitrogen. Only a narrow range of monophyletic bacteria within the Planctomycetes carries out anammox, and the full extent of their metabolism, and subsequent impact on nitrogen cycling and microbial community structure, is still unknown. Here, we employ a metatranscriptomic analysis on enriched mRNA to identify the abundance and activity of a population of anammox bacteria within an aquifer at Rifle, CO. Planktonic biomass was collected over a two-month period after injection of up to 1.5 mM nitrate. Illumina-generated sequences were mapped to a phylogenetically binned Rifle metagenome database.\nWe identified transcripts for genes with high protein sequence identities (81-98%) to those of anammox strain KSU-1 and to two of the five anammox bacteria genera, Brocadia and Kuenenia, suggesting an active, if not diverse, anammox population. Many of the most abundant anammox transcripts mapped to a single scaffold, indicative of a single dominant anammox species. Transcripts of the genes necessary for the anammox pathway were present, including an ammonium transporter (amtB), nitrite/formate transporter, nitrite reductase (nirK), and hydrazine oxidoreductase (hzoB). The form of nitrite reductase encoded by anammox is species-dependent, and we only identified nirK, with no evidence of anammox nirS. In addition to the anammox pathway we saw evidence of the anammox bacterial dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium pathway (narH, putative nrfA, and nrfB), which provides an alternate means of generating substrates for anammox from nitrate, rather than relying on an external pool. Transcripts for hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) were abundant and more similar to known anammox HAO genes than those used in aerobic ammonia oxidation. The elevated levels of anammox transcripts suggest that anammox may play a significant role in nitrogen cycling within groundwater systems.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations made in the Trinity River of East Texas reveal that systematic spatial changes in bedform geometry, coverage, and inferred activity correlate with documented shifts in the larger-scale geomorphology of the river. Acoustic imaging data was collected through the transition into the backwater zone, or the reach of river where flow is affected by hydraulic readjustment between quasi-uniform flow further upstream and gradually varying flow towards the river mouth. Measurements collected immediately following a minor flood record spatial changes in bedforms with dune height systematically decreasing from roughly 0.4 m to 0.2 m and dune length decreasing from 13.4 m to 7.3 m, maintaining a constant value of 29 for the ripple index over a 6 km reach that covers 7 river bends. It appears that bedform height is depth-limited within the quasi-uniform flow, and gradually shifts to occupy a smaller fraction of the increasing flow depth within the backwater zone. Over the same reach after a period of extended low river discharge, dune height decreases from 0.3 m to 0, while dune length decreases from 9.0 m to 4.4 m before dunes are completely absent. Ripple index stays relatively constant until the last two bends, a streamwise distance of 2 km, where it rapidly increases from a value of 30 to 44 in the 6th bend and then to infinity in the 7th most downstream bend. Accompanying the disappearance of the dune forms is a systematic reduction in the slopes of their lee faces until the bed is completely flat. The location of these shifts in bed-material load coincides nicely with and likely accounts for documented geomorphic changes to the river, including a reduction in point bar surface area and volume and a decrease in channel-bend migration rates (Smith, 2012). Results have obvious implications for understanding coastal fluvial geomorphology and can help elucidate relationships between bedforms, bed-material load, point bars, and river bend kinematics.",

            "abstract": "Strong motion accelerometers can record large amplitude shaking on-scale in the near-field of large earthquake ruptures; however, numerical integration of such records to determine displacement is typically unstable due to baseline changes (i.e., distortions in the zero value) that occur during strong shaking. We use datasets from the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake to assess whether a relatively simple empirical correction scheme (Boore et al., 2002) can return accurate displacement waveforms useful for constraining details of the fault slip. The coseismic deformation resulting from the Tohoku earthquake was recorded by the Kiban Kyoshin network (KiK-net) of strong motion instruments as well as by a dense network of high-rate (1 Hz) GPS instruments. After baseline correcting the KiK-net records and integrating to displacement, over 85% of the KiK-net borehole instrument waveforms and over 75% of the KiK-net surface instrument waveforms match collocated 1 Hz GPS displacement time series. Most of the records that do not match the GPS-derived displacements following the baseline correction have large, systematic drifts that can be automatically identified by examining the slopes in the first 5-10 seconds of the velocity time series.\nWe apply the same scheme to strong motion records from the 2014 Mw 8.2 Iquique earthquake. Close correspondence in both direction and amplitude between coseismic static offsets derived from the integrated strong motion time series and those predicted from a teleseismically-derived finite fault model, as well as displacement amplitudes consistent with InSAR-derived results, suggest that the correction scheme works successfully for the Iquique event. In the absence of GPS displacements, these strong motion-derived offsets provide constraints on the overall distribution of slip on the fault. In addition, the coseismic strong motion-derived displacement time series (50-100 s long) contain a near-field record of the temporal evolution of the rupture, supplementing teleseismic data and improving resolution of the location and timing of moment in finite fault models.",

            "abstract": "Unusually warm conditions during recent years in the Arctic have led to changes in the properties of the seasonal active layer and the uppermost permafrost. Deep thaw of the active layer in exceedingly warm years causes the emergence of pressurized sediment slurries at surface, called mudboils. An understanding of the processes driving mudboil formation is necessary as these features occur in proximity to and during periods when other forms of permafrost degradation and disturbance occur, particularly active layer detachments. To better improve our understanding of these features, systematic mapping of recent mudboils along with soil and water sampling was undertaken at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO), Melville Island, Nunavut in 2012 and 2013. Results indicate that these features only occur late in the melt season during especially warm years and in some cases closely follow major rainfall events. High-resolution satellite imagery for the study area was analyzed, and terrain characteristics were determined for areas with mapped mudboil activity. Notably, on a landscape scale, mudboils were significantly associated with polar semi-desert vegetation and bare soil settings, corresponding to increased active layer depth when compared to more vegetated areas. Further, fine-scale occurrence of mudboils appears to be related to differential soil moisture retention and spatially heterogeneous soil water pressurization due to thaw into the ice-rich transient layer in warm years. This research provides insights into the processes and landscape controls over these features to aid in understanding localized soil water response to deep summer thaw, with implications for surface water quality and patterns of permafrost-related degradation and disturbance.",

            "abstract": "The martian meteorite Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034 is a breccia containing a variety of igneous clasts and igneous derived mineral fragments suspended in a matrix of fine grained material. Igneous clasts were examined using electron probe microanalysis (major and minor element compositions), BSE images (modal mineralogy), and secondary ion mass spectrometry (REEs). The clasts contain minerals of similar composition to martian meteorites and surface rocks, although mineral abundances differ between these clasts and other martian rocks. The clasts vary in rock type and include basalt, andesite, trachyandesite, and an exotic phosphate and FeTi-oxide rich lithology that is more Fe-rich than Wishstone-class rocks analyzed by MER. Many of the basaltic clast compositions match those of Gusev Crater rocks, as well as the average composition of the martian crust determined from orbital data, providing a strong link between this meteorite and the martian crust. Furthermore, studies have shown the majority of igneous materials in this meteorite to be ~4.4 Ga (Yin et al., 2014; Nyquist et al., 2013, Tartèse et al., 2014); this suggests these clasts represent some of the earliest formed martian crust. The range in rock types contained within this meteorite suggest early Mars was capable of producing crust that was diverse in composition, chemically enriched, and oxidized (ΔFMQ +0.7 to +4), at least in local regions. The reason for the difference in chemistry between these ancient crustal rocks and the younger SNC meteorites remains to be determined, but the lithologic diversity recorded by NWA 7034 provides evidence for a petrologically diverse martian surface both spatially and temporally.",

            "abstract": "Two well-preserved core complexes at the Mid-Cayman Rise (MCR), Mt Dent and Mt Hudson, provide an opportunity to examine the deformation history and rheology of detachment faults at an ultra-slow spreading ridge. Samples from the CAYTROUGH (1976-77) project and the Nautilus NA034 cruise (2013) were selected for detailed petrographic and microstructural study. Surface samples from Mt. Dent (near the center of the MCR) provide insight into lateral variation in footwall rock type and deformation history across a core complex in both the across and down dip directions. In contrast, sampling of Mt. Hudson (SE corner of the MCR) focuses on a high-angle, crosscutting normal fault scarp, which provides a cross section of the detachment fault system. Sampling across Mt Dent reveals that the footwall is composed of heterogeneously-distributed gabbro (47%) and peridotite (20%) with basaltic cover (33%) dominating the top of the core complex. Sampling of Mt Hudson is restricted to the normal fault scarp cutting the core complex and suggests the interior is dominated by gabbro (85% gabbro, 11% peridotite, 4% basalt). At Mt. Dent, peridotite is exposed within ~4km of the breakaway indicating that the Mt. Dent detachment does not cut Penrose-style oceanic crust.\nThe sample set provides evidence of a full down-temperature sequence of detachment related-fault rocks, from possible granulite and clear amphibolite mylonitizatization to prehnite-pumpellyite brittle deformation. Both detachments show low-temperature brittle deformation overprinting higher temperature plastic fabrics. Fe-Ti oxide gabbro mylonites dominate the sample set, and plastic deformation of plagioclase is recorded in samples collected as near as ~4km from the inferred breakaway along the southern flank of Mt. Dent, suggesting the brittle-plastic transition was initially at ~3km depth. Recovered samples suggest strain associated with both detachment systems is localized into discrete mylonitic shear zones (~1-10cm thick), implying that the plastic portion of the fault consists of a broad zone of thin, anastomosing shear zones. Concentrations of Ti-rich magmatic hornblende and interstitial Fe-Ti oxides in the high strain horizons are consistent with the lowermost part of the fault(s) localizing in the margins of the mush zone of a shallow magma chamber.",

            "abstract": "We will report the abundance of 13CH3D, a clumped isotopologue of methane, in microbial methane sampled from natural environments. They yield some expected and some unexpected results reflecting both equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects controlling the abundance of 13CH3D in low temperature environments. The four isotopologues of methane (12CH4, 13CH4, 12CH3D and 13CH3D) were measured by a tunable infrared spectroscopy method at a precision of 0.2‰ and accuracy of 0.5‰ (Ono et al., 2014).\nSimilar to carbonate clumped isotope thermometry, clumped isotopologues of methane become more stable at lower temperatures. The equilibrium constant for the isotope exchange reaction 13CH4 + 12CH3D ⇌ 13CH3D + 12CH4 deviates from unity by +6.3 to +3.5 ‰ for methane equilibrated between 4 and 121 °C, a range expected for microbial methanogenesis. This would be measurably-distinct from a thermogenic methane signal, which typically have apparent 13CH3D-based temperatures ranging from 150 to 220 °C (+3.0 to +2.2 ‰ clumped isotope effect; Ono et al., 2014; Stolper et al. 2014). Marine samples, such as methane clathrates and porewater methane from the Cascadia margin, have 13CH3D-based temperatures that appear to be consistent with isotopic equilibration at in situ temperatures that are reasonable for deep sedimentary environments. In contrast, methane from freshwater environments, such as a lake and a swamp, yield apparent temperatures that are much higher than the known or inferred environmental temperature. Mixing of two or more distinct sources of methane could potentially generate this high temperature bias. We suggest, however, that this high-temperature bias likely reflects a kinetic isotope fractionation intrinsic to methanogenesis in fresh water environments. In contrast, the low-temperature signals from marine methane could be related to the slow metabolic rates and reversibility of microbial methanogenesis and methanotrophy in marine sedimentary environments. The 13CH3D signals do not always correlate with δD and δ13C signals, indicating that an understanding of the systematics controlling the abundance of 13CH3D in the environment will add another dimension to methane isotope fingerprinting.\n",

The role of the ESDSWG is to make recommendations relevant to NASA’s Earth science data systems from users experiences. Each group works independently focussing on a unique topic. Participation in ESDSWG groups comes from a variety of NASA-funded science and technology projects, NASA information technology experts, affiliated contractor staff and other interested community members from academia and industry. Recommendations from the ESDSWG groups will enhance NASA’s efforts to develop long term data products.\nThe ASCII for Science Data Working Group (WG) will define a minimum set of information that should be included in ASCII file headers so that the users will be able to access the data using only the header information. After reviewing various use cases, such as field data and ASCII data exported from software tools, and reviewing ASCII data guidelines documentation, this WG will deliver guidelines for creating ASCII files that contain enough header information to allow the user to access the science data.\nThe Airborne WG’s goal is to improve airborne data access and use for NASA science. The first step is to evaluate the state of airborne data and make recommendations focusing on data delivery to the DAACs (data centers). The long term goal is to improve airborne data use for Earth Science research. Many data aircraft observations are reported in ASCII format. The ASCII and Airborne WGs seem like the same group, but the Airborne WG is concerned with maintaining and using airborne for science research, not just the data format.\nThe Geospatial WG focus is on the interoperability issues of Geospatial Information System (GIS) and remotely sensed data, in particular, focusing on DAAC(s) data from NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise. This WG will provide a set of tools (GIS libraries) to use with training and/or cookbooks through the use of Open Source technologies.\nA progress report on these groups from the 2014 ESDSWG will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Ceres likely contains considerable water, has differentiated, and formed a hydrated silicate core and water mantle. There were major dimensional, thermal and chemical changes over its history, making it more a planet than an asteroid. These factors created the present day body, which the Dawn misson will visit next March. I will summarize our current understanding of Ceres and suggest what Dawn will find. A major uncertainty is how processes, such as aqueous mineralization, impact and cratering, infall of external material, mixing, and viscous relaxation of surface features have altered the formation materials and surface, hiding Ceres’ secrets. Ceres’ bulk density of 2100 kg/m3, suggest major water content. Modeling of Ceres’ thermodynamic evolution for different times of accretion, assuming several radioactive heating scenarios, produces results ranging from a dry Vestal-like object (earlier, hotter formation) to retention and melting of the ice and differentiation of silicates from liquid water. Mixing of liquid water and silicates leads to exothermic hydration reactions, formation of a core and a liquid mantle. Large dimensional changes are associated. A crust stays frozen but founders at times due to gravitational instability, dimensional changes and impacts. The liquid mantle freezes from top, down, but a layer of salty liquid water probably exists today near the core. Hydrated silicates from the initial differentiation would likely dehydrate near the core center due to temperature and pressure. From observations, only subdued spatial albedo and color variations are observed at UV and IR wavelengths on Ceres’ surface at the scale possible from Earth (~50-100 km) and an oblate spheroid shape is found, consistent with a differentiated body. Compositional evidence includes the long known similarity of Ceres’ albedo and visual-IR reflectance spectrum to those for carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Thus, the surface is likely made of carbon-bearing, hydroxolated materials, with spectral evidence of OH and maybe H2O molecules, consistent with the results of both the evolutionary thermodynamic models and infill of carbonaceous chondrite-like materials. Two reports of OH and H2O in the exosphere, apparently originating from localized sources, suggest present day cryovolcanism.",

DART/CAM-Chem is based on an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) framework which facilitates statistical estimation of error correlations between chemical states (CO and related species) and parameters (including sources) in the model using the ensemble statistics derived from dynamical and chemical perturbations in the model. Here, we estimate CO emissions within DART/CAM-Chem using a state augmentation approach where CO emissions are added to the CO state vector being analyzed. We compare these optimized emissions to estimates derived from a traditional Bayesian synthesis inversion using the CO analyses (assimilated CO states) as observational constraints. The spatio-temporal distribution of CO and other chemical species will be compared to profile measurements from aircraft and other satellite instruments (e.g., INTEX-B, ARCTAS).",

            "abstract": "High power HF radio waves interacting with the ionosphere provide aeronomers with a unique space-based laboratory capability. The High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) in Gakona, Alaksa is the world’s largest heating facility, producing effective radiated powers in the gigawatt range. Experiments performed at HAARP have allowed researchers to study many non-linear effects of wave-plasma interactions. Stimulated Electromagnetic Emissions (SEE) are of interest to the ionospheric community for its diagnostic purposes. Typical SEE experiments at HAARP have focused on characterizing the parametric decay of the electromagnetic pump wave into several different wave modes such as upper and lower hybrid, ion acoustic, ion-Bernstein and electron-Bernstein.\nRecent HAARP experiments have used both conventional and novel techniques to excite ionospheric disturbances at gyroharmonic frequencies. Stable layers of artificial ionization have been generated using a “twisted beam” pattern with the heating array. Compared to pencil beam techniques, these layers are long-lived and produce their own unique SEE patterns. The “downshifted mass” or DSM has shown to be a strong indicator of artificial ionization generation. Additionally, several other previously uncharacterized SEE features have been observed. These emissions are under study to be linked with other heating phenomena such as enhanced optical emissions, ion and plasma line generation, HF radar backscatter and enhanced electron acceleration.",

            "abstract": "Isoprene (C5H8) reacts with the nitrate radical (NO3) during the night to produce a peroxy nitrate radical (RO2). This RO2 can react with nitrogen oxides (i.e., NO, NO2, or NO3) and other RO2 radicals to form isoprene nitrates or with the hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) to form nitrooxyhydroperoxide (INP). Both model and field studies have found that in the ambient atmosphere much of the RO2 radical reacts with HO2. More specifically, during the 2013 SOAS field campaign, INP was one of the main species that increased at sunset suggesting the RO2 + HO2 pathway from NO3 oxidation is important in the southeastern US and similar areas. However, chamber studies so far have been run under conditions that optimize RO2 + NO3 reactions and/or RO2 + RO2 reactions. In this work, we present a new way to run NO3 oxidation chamber experiments that optimize for the RO2 + HO2 pathway creating a more atmospherically relevant product distribution. The gas phase formation of INP and subsequent oxidation products were monitored using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS). Because isoprene nitrates formed from NO3 oxidation react slowly with ozone (O3) and NO3, many of these nitrates will remain in the atmosphere until the sun rises and hydroxyl radical (OH) begins to form. Results from these chamber experiments suggest that OH will react with INP to form nitrooxyhydroxyepoxide (INHE), a newly identified product from INP. We suspect INHE could be important for Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA) production due to its similarity to isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX), a product from isoprene OH oxidation that has been shown to be a significant SOA precursor. We studied the uptake of INHE onto various seed types, and found that as expected INHE rapidly partitions to highly acidic seed aerosol due to an acid catalyzed ring opening. A time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (ToF-AMS) was used to understand the chemical composition of the aerosol produced from the various seed types.",

            "abstract": "We use an earthquake simulator to investigate the conditions that may result in tectonic tremor. Tremor comprises small seismic events often associated with slow slip earthquakes (SSEs) that were initially discovered in subduction zones, but have subsequently been observed along transform faults such as the San Andreas Fault. For this study, our primary region of interest is the Parkfield-Cholame segment of the San Andreas, which is located between the locked segment to the south and the creeping segment to the north. Due to Parkfield's unique history of successive earthquakes at quasi-regular intervals, deep borehole seismometers were installed in this region, enabling the discovery of low-amplitude tectonic tremor. To better understand the fault properties that result in SSEs and tremor, we utilize the earthquake simulator RSQSim to simulate multi-cycle SSEs and tremor along a planar strike-slip fault. RSQSim is a computationally efficient method that uses rate- and state- dependent friction to simulate a wide range of event sizes for long time histories of slip [Dieterich and Richards-Dinger, 2010; Richards-Dinger and Dieterich, 2012]. RSQSim has been previously used to investigate slow slip events in Cascadia [Colella et al., 2011; 2012]. Here, we examine a suite of parameters to understand the influence of normal stress, rate-and-state constants a and b, and slip speed as well as the distribution of tremor patches on tremor and SSE occurrence. We compare the simulation results to previous tremor observations.",

            "abstract": "The Indian River Inlet (IRI) on the east coast of Delaware, USA connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian River and Rehoboth Bays. Long-term and large-scale net alongshore sediment transport along this portion of coastline is from south to north. The north beach of IRI suffers from severe erosion due to interruption of the alongshore transport and current variability near the inlet. The magnitude of such erosion has increased over the past decade and questions have arisen as to the cause. The goal of this study is to quantify currents and wave patterns and estimate sediment transport rates at the north beach and near the inlet in an effort to determine the causes of persistent erosion. Data were obtained from October 2013 to March 2014 in the form of 3 separate 28-day deployments. Each deployment consisted of 4 proposed deployment sites. Data at each site were collected using a bottom mounted Nortek Aquadopp Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and 2 Campbell Scientific Optical Backscatter Sensors (OBS). Currents and OBS data were sampled every 120 s. Waves were sampled for approximately 17 minutes at the beginning of every hour.\nData analysis from the deployments indicates the presence of several interesting trends in currents that can be linked to the persistent erosion. Current data are filtered to quantify typical current speed and direction for a tidal cycle (peak flood to peak flood) at each deployment site. The typical currents off of the north beach and up to 800 m north of the north jetty are mostly directed southward over the entire tidal cycle. This consistent southward flow implies: 1) there is no flow reversal based on tide, contrary to what might be expected at an inlet adjacent beach, 2) the typical current direction is opposite of the expectations for the known long-term large-scale net alongshore transport and 3) the consistency of this atypical current may be responsible for transporting sediment southward and away from the north beach. Currents and waves will be further analyzed for storm and non-storm conditions in order to more completely quantify the hydrodynamics of the area. Sediment data will also be analyzed in conjunction with the hydrodynamic data in order to better understand the sediment transport process.",

            "abstract": "Infrared remote sensing is a vital tool for the study of volcanic plumes, and radiative transfer (RT) modeling is required to derive quantitative estimation of the sulfur dioxide (SO2), sulfate aerosol (SO4), and silicate ash (pulverized rock) content of these plumes. In the thermal infrared, we must account for the temperature, emissivity, and elevation of the surface beneath the plume, plume altitude and thickness, and local atmospheric temperature and humidity. Our knowledge of these parameters is never perfect, and interactive mapping allows us to evaluate the impact of these uncertainties on our estimates of plume composition.\nTo enable interactive mapping, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is collaborating with Spectral Sciences, Inc., (SSI) to develop the Plume Tracker toolkit. This project is funded by a NASA AIST Program Grant (AIST-11-0053) to SSI. Plume Tracker integrates (1) retrieval procedures for surface temperature and emissivity, SO2, NH3, or CH4 column abundance, and scaling factors for H2O vapor and O3 profiles, (2) a RT modeling engine based on MODTRAN, and (3) interactive visualization and analysis utilities under a single graphics user interface.\nThe principal obstacle to interactive mapping is the computational overhead of the RT modeling engine. Under AIST-11-0053 we have achieved a 300-fold increase in the performance of the retrieval procedures through the use of indexed caches of model spectra, optimization of the minimization procedures, and scaling of the effects of surface temperature and emissivity on model radiance spectra. In the final year of AIST-11-0053 we will implement parallel processing to exploit multi-core CPUs and cluster computing, and optimize the RT engine to eliminate redundant calculations when iterating over a range of gas concentrations. These enhancements will result in an additional 8 – 12X increase in performance. In addition to the improvements in performance, we have improved the accuracy of the Plume Tracker retrievals through refinements in the description of surface emissivity and use of vector projection to define the misfit between model and observed spectra.\nPortions of this research were conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",

Although water evaporation in actual field setting is a highly complex process, a nearly steady upward flow from a water table to a bare soil surface may be established if the daily evaporative demand is reasonably uniform for a long period of time. While the maximum potential rate of evaporation from the ground surface depends on atmospheric conditions, the actual flux across the soil surface is limited by the ability of the porous medium for transmitting water from the unsaturated zone.\nThe purpose of this study is to calculate the steady-state evaporation for an arbitrary matrix potential at bare soil surface above a shallow water table, while the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is a nonlinear function of water content or matrix potential. The Haverkamp function and the Brooks-Corey function for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity are used, and the study results are contrast among the solution developed from the two retention equation and HYDRUS simulation.",

Planners seek optimal portfolios of supply and demand management schemes but also when to activate assets whilst considering many system goals and plausible futures. Incorporation of scheduling into the planning under uncertainty problem strongly increases its complexity. We investigate some approaches to scheduling with many-objective heuristic search. We apply a multi-scenario many-objective scheduling approach to the Thames River basin water supply system planning problem in the UK. Decisions include which new supply and demand schemes to implement, at what capacity and when. The impact of different system uncertainties on scheme implementation schedules are explored, i.e. how the choice of future scenarios affects the search process and its outcomes. The activation of schemes is influenced by the occurrence of extreme hydrological events in the ensemble of plausible scenarios and other factors. The approach and results are compared with a previous study where only the portfolio problem is addressed (without scheduling).",

            "abstract": "The Permian Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt (DMOB) is an important marker terrane in New Zealand geology and is displaced by ~460 km by right lateral offset on the Alpine Fault that forms the Pacific-Australian plate boundary through the South Island. The DMOB contains a number of ultramafic massifs of partially serpentinized mantle peridotite and notwithstanding that much of this terrane is extremely remote, peridotite-hosted hyperalkaline springs are rare. The Cascade Spring issues ~17°C waters at ~13 L/min from the western slope of a steep harzburgite ridge close to the DMOB’s southern intersection with the Alpine Fault. High pH (11.1-11.6), Ca-OH type fluids with low concentrations of HCO3-, Mg and SiO2 continue to form a steep >500 m2 patch of hummocky calcium carbonate travertine. The spring fluids flow more than 50 m across the surface of a ~2 m-thick travertine blanket before it abruptly terminates. This gives the opportunity to study the evolution of the fluids and their precipitates as the waters flow down the travertine terrace.\nThe spring waters have meteoric oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios similar to local surface waters. 87Sr/86Sr of vent fluids are ~0.7042, higher than DMOB primary mantle values (0.7030-0.7035), indicating exchange with either hydrothermally altered ocean crustal rocks or mixing with fluids that have interacted with nearby tectonically juxtaposed metasediments. As waters flow over this steep terrace their chemistry changes; pH decreases from 11.5 to 9.7, and Ca concentrations decrease from 20 µg/g to 9.1 µg/g, corresponding to precipitation of 0.271 mmoles/L calcite and dissolution of 0.012 g/L CO2 across terrace. Considering spring flow rates this equates to precipitation of ~188 kg of calcite and drawdown of 83 kg of atmospheric CO2 from this vent per year. The fluid chemistry changes most in the first 17 m from the vent where pH decreases from 11.5 to 10.8 and Ca concentration almost halves from 20 to 10.9 µg/g, indicating calcite precipitation and CO2 uptake are most rapid when Ca concentration and pH are highest. Despite the clearly defined extent of the terrace, waters dripping from its termination remain saturated in calcite and under-saturated CO2 meaning a further 0.021 mmoles/L of calcite may be deposited beyond the end of the terrace.",

Another class of diagenetic reactions involves the breakdown of organic matter and trace element behaviour (Froelich et al., 1979). The translation of chemical gradients into fluxes requires estimates of pore water chemistry across the sea water - sediment surface boundary. Additionally, the use of the chemistry of benthic foraminiferal calcite for seawater paleochemistry requires estimation of the chemistry of pore waters which may differ from that of bottom seawater because of diagenetic reactions.\nIn this work we have collected multi core samples from 10 core sites on cruise RRS James Cook JC089 on the southwest Iberian continental margin. Pore waters were extracted from the core surface and at 1 cm depth intervals down core (typically to ~40 cm depth) using Rhizon samplers and analysed for Alkalinity, DIC, ∂13C and Na, K, Mg, Ca, Li, Mn, Fe, Ba, B, Sr by atomic emission spectrophotometry as well as O2 penetration and pH by microelectrodes. This has allowed us to inspect chemical behavior at the bottom water - sediment interface. Some examples of results are a large gradient in ∂13C of DIC, the similarity of zero O2 penetration followed by an increase in Mn concentration and then decrease to zero, the similarity of Li to Mn and, in contrast to much DSDP/ODP work, Ca2+ and Mg2+both decrease with depth in pore waters near the sediment surface.\n",

            "abstract": "Historic mining practices have left the Carson River and Lahontan Reservoir (CRLR) system contaminated with high levels of mercury (Hg). Hg levels in Lahontan Reservoir planktivorous and predatory fish exceed federal consumption limits. Inputs of Hg to the system are mainly a result of erosion during high flow and diffusion from sediment during low flow, and the relationships between streamflow and both mercury transport and bioaccumulation are non-linear. The United States Bureau of Reclamation has produced future streamflow estimates for 2000-2099 using 112 CMIP3 climate projections and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. VIC results suggest that the hydrology of the system is likely to experience higher frequencies of both high and low extreme flows, and the monthly averages of future flows are expected to be higher in the winter and lower in the summer compared to observed flows. VIC daily streamflow estimates are biased-corrected using an empirical cumulative distribution function to match observed data over the historic period of 1950-1999. Future reservoir stage and outflows are modeled assuming reservoir operations are a function of river/canal inflows, previous reservoir stage and downstream agricultural demands. VIC and reservoir flows drive the CRLR Hg transport model (RIVMOD, WASP5, and MERC4). Daily output for both total and dissolved inorganic Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) are averaged at the decadal timescale to assess changes and uncertainty in predicted spatial and temporal Hg species water column concentrations as a function of altered hydrology with respect to changing climate. Future research will use CRLR output in a bioenergetics and Hg mass balance model for Sacramento blackfish (Orthodon microlepidotus), a filter feeding cyprinid found in Lahontan Reservoir. These future simulations will help to assess possible changes in ecosystem health with respect to hydrologic conditions and associated changes to Hg transport.",

            "abstract": "The D\" discontinuity is typically observed as an increase in P- and S-wave velocity of 1-3% roughly 150-300 km above the CMB. The discontinuity shows strong laterally variability in spatial location and height above the CMB. Previous studies have revealed strong evidence for the existence of the discontinuity under North Central Asia, Alaska, the Arctic, Australasia, and Central America, but only a handful of observations have been made beneath the North Atlantic due to the limited numbers of deep earthquakes in Europe. We collected transverse component recordings from all available broadband stations in the USArray to examine the D\" discontinuity structure under the North Atlantic using array processing techniques. We searched for earthquakes in the European region between Jan. 2005 and Jun. 2014 with moment magnitudes between 5.5 and 7.5, event depths greater than 75 km, and epicentral distances from 55° to 90°. A total of five events were found matching these criteria. We collected a total of 2077 transverse component seismograms. We inspected each trace manually and removed traces without clear S and ScS arrivals. The remaining traces were aligned and normalized to unity on the S-wave arrival and collected into 3° geographic bins. We calculated velocity seismograms (vespagrams) for each geographic bin and screened vespagrams based on signal-to-noise ratio and slowness resolution of S and ScS. Only the 616 km deep M6.3 southern Spain event of April 11th, 2010 demonstrated high enough data quality. A total of 372 transverse traces from this event were collected into 39 3° geographic bins. Clear Scd arrivals indicative of the D\" discontinuity were identified on 20 out of 39 vespagrams. We calculated the height of the D\" discontinuity above the CMB for each Scd observation based on the travel time difference between S and Scd. The results indicate a D\" discontinuity with an average thickness of 261 km above the CMB beneath the North Atlantic between 45°-60° N and 45°-55° W. We present a new map with discontinuity location and the S-wave velocity structure for this region. We model waveforms for this event using the axi-symmetric finite-difference method SHaxi. The discovery of D\" discontinuity beneath North Atlantic is important to advance our understanding of the potential subduction history of the Farallon plate in the Mesozoic.",

            "abstract": "The Indonesian archipelago sits within the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and plays a crucial role in today’s global water vapor and heat transport. Despite the region’s importance in the global climate system, we understand relatively little of long-term patterns of convection and precipitation across Indonesia. To better characterize the regional precipitation response in Indonesia since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), we developed continuous high-resolution records of the carbon and hydrogen isotopic composition of terrestrial leaf waxes (long-chain n-alkanoic acids; δ13Cwax and δDwax respectively) from marine and lacustrine cores retrieved offshore and in central Sulawesi, in the heart of Indonesia. Present-day rainfall variability in central Sulawesi is strongly influenced by variations in topography and wind pattern, including land-sea breezes, orographically-forced winds, and monsoonal winds related to the seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Our terrestrial and marine records show excellent agreement. Together, our δ13Cwax records suggest that rainforests contracted and grasslands became more abundant during the LGM, indicating that the aridification and the likely increase of water stress during the dry season in central Indonesia are linked to high-latitude climate forcings (i.e. global cooling and Northern Hemisphere ice sheet expansion). However, our data also indicate that the highlands of Sulawesi remained relatively wet and might have become a refuge for rainforests during the LGM, suggesting that altitudinal gradients within the archipelago strongly influence local manifestations of hydrological changes at glacial-interglacial timescales. Despite evidence for regional drying, we observe depleted δDwax values during the LGM, demonstrating that the amount effect may not always be the most important factor controlling the δD of precipitation (δDprecip) in this region at orbital timescales. Instead, the presence of strong glacial boundary conditions might have resulted in “upstream” processes, such as adjustments in the Siberian High and the East Asian Winter Monsoon, modulating δDprecip over central Indonesia during the LGM.",

            "abstract": "South Asia faces a remarkably complex and diverse set of hydrologic stresses, including melting glaciers, variable snowpack, intensively utilized transboundary rivers, rapid groundwater depletion due to irrigation, flood and drought hazard, and rapidly changing land use/cover and climate conditions. The management and prediction challenges posed by these conditions are compounded by the sparseness of in situ monitoring sites, particularly in headwaters regions, and a lack of open sharing of hydrometeorological data across national boundaries. As a result, uncertainties in availability in a situation of rising demands are leading to increasing competing and exploitive use of a limited resource, being experienced at various scales. An open water information system for decision support is an absolute necessity. In order to provide an open and spatially complete water information system for decision support across the region, we are implementing a customized Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS) designed to provide best-available estimates of hydrologic states and fluxes across South Asia, both retrospectively and in near-real time. The LDAS merges advanced land surface models with satellite-derived and in situ observations. In the case of South Asia, multiple satellite-derived hydrological fields are relevant to complete water balance analysis, including precipitation from multiple sources (e.g., TRMM, CHIRPS, GPM), water storage anomalies from GRACE, thermal infrared evapotranspiration estimates, and snowpack characteristics from visible and microwave sensors. Each of these observation types can either be ingested to South Asia LDAS or used as an independent observation for comparison. Here we present the first results of this South Asian Land Data Assimilation System, with a focus on complete water balance analysis for selected river basins in South Asia.",

            "abstract": "National-scale water-quality data sets for the United States have been available for several decades; however, groundwater models to interpret these data are available for only a small percentage of the country. Generalized models may be adequate to explain and project groundwater-quality trends at the national scale by using regional scale models (defined as watersheds at or between the HUC-6 and HUC-8 levels). Coast-to-coast data such as the National Hydrologic Dataset Plus (NHD+) make it possible to extract the basic building blocks for a model anywhere in the country. IPython notebooks have been developed to automate the creation of generalized groundwater-flow models from the NHD+. The notebook format allows rapid testing of methods for model creation, calibration, and analysis. Capabilities within the Python ecosystem greatly speed up the development and testing of algorithms. GeoPandas is used for very efficient geospatial processing. Raster processing includes the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library and image processing tools. Model creation is made possible through Flopy, a versatile input and output writer for several MODFLOW-based flow and transport model codes. Interpolation, integration, and map plotting included in the standard Python tool stack also are used, making the notebook a comprehensive platform within on to build and evaluate general models. Models with alternative boundary conditions, number of layers, and cell spacing can be tested against one another and evaluated by using water-quality data. Novel calibration criteria were developed by comparing modeled heads to land-surface and surface-water elevations. Information, such as predicted age distributions, can be extracted from general models and tested for its ability to explain water-quality trends. Groundwater ages then can be correlated with horizontal and vertical hydrologic position, a relation that can be used for statistical assessment of likely groundwater-quality conditions. Convolution with age distributions can be used to quickly ascertain likely future water-quality conditions. Although these models are admittedly very general and are still being tested, the hope is that they will be useful for answering questions related to water quality at the regional scale.",

            "abstract": "Studies using global climate models have found evidence of strong land-atmosphere coupling in parts of Central America. This research extends those findings by using the regional climate model RegCM4 to perform GLACE-type experiments over the CORDEX Central America (CCA) domain at higher spatial resolution than used in global models. These experiments first perform a long-term simulation while saving predicted soil moisture every time step, then redoing the simulation using the same initial and boundary conditions but with soil moisture taken from the averaged output of the first simulation instead of being predicted by the model. Comparing results from the two simulations gives a measure of the strength of land-atmosphere coupling.\nResults over the CCA domain using ERA-interim boundary conditions for 1989-2009 show that land-atmosphere coupling has substantial influences on interannual variability of precipitation in the region, with coupling \"hot spots\" that differ from global model results. Diagnosed land-atmosphere coupling also appears important for regional circulation features such as the North American monsoon. Consistent with prior results it is also found that diagnosed coupling strength is model dependent, in the sense that locations and magnitudes of coupling hot spots differ when different convective parameterizations are used. Methodological aspects of using RegCM4 for GLACE-type experiments also are discussed. These include strategies for performing GLACE-type experiments more efficiently, along with advantages and disadvantages of using regional models compared to global models for such experiments.",

In addition, CWD makes an important contribution to forest biomass and fuel loads. Airborne or space based remote sensing instruments typically do not detect CWD beneath the forest canopy. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) provides a ground based method for three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of surface features and CWD.\nThis research produced a 3-D reconstruction of the ground surface and automatically classified coarse woody debris from registered TLS scans. The outputs will be used to inform the development of a site-based index for the assessment of forest condition, and quantitative assessments of biomass and fuel loads.\nA survey grade terrestrial laser scanner (Riegl VZ400) was used to scan 13 positions, in an open eucalypt woodland site at Karawatha Forest Park, near Brisbane, Australia. Scans were registered, and a digital surface model (DSM) produced using an intensity threshold and an iterative morphological filter. The DSMs produced from single scans were compared to the registered multi-scan point cloud using standard error metrics including: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), range, absolute error and signed error. In addition the DSM was compared to a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) produced from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS).\nCoarse woody debris was subsequently classified from the DSM using laser pulse properties, including: width and amplitude, as well as point spatial relationships (e.g. nearest neighbour slope vectors). Validation of the coarse woody debris classification was completed using true-colour photographs co-registered to the TLS point cloud. The volume and length of the coarse woody debris was calculated from the classified point cloud.\nA representative network of TLS sites will allow for up-scaling to large area assessment using airborne or space based sensors to monitor forest condition, biomass and fuel loads.",

The Joint Polar Satellite System will replace the afternoon orbit component and ground processing system of the current Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) managed by NOAA. The JPSS satellites will carry a suite of sensors designed to collect meteorological, oceanographic, climatological and geophysical observations of the Earth.\nThe ground processing system for JPSS is known as the JPSS Common Ground System (JPSS CGS). Developed and maintained by Raytheon Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS), the CGS is a multi-mission enterprise system serving NOAA, NASA and their national and international partners. The CGS provides a wide range of support to a number of missions. Originally designed to support S-NPP and JPSS, the CGS has demonstrated its scalability and flexibility to incorporate all of these other important missions efficiently and with minimal cost, schedule and risk, while strengthening global partnerships in weather and environmental monitoring.\nThe CGS architecture will be upgraded to Block 2.0 in 2015 to satisfy several key objectives, including: “operationalizing” S-NPP, which had originally been intended as a risk reduction mission; leveraging lessons learned to date in multi-mission support; taking advantage of newer, more reliable and efficient technologies; and satisfying new requirements and constraints due to the continually evolving budgetary environment. To ensure the CGS meets these needs, we have developed 48 Technical Performance Measures (TPMs) across 9 categories: Data Availability, Data Latency, Operational Availability, Margin, Scalability, Situational Awareness, Transition (between environments and sites), WAN Efficiency, and Data Recovery Processing.\nThis paper will provide an overview of the CGS Block 2.0 architecture, with particular focus on the 9 TPM categories listed above. We will describe how we ensure the deployed architecture meets these TPMs to satisfy our multi-mission objectives with the deployment of Block 2.0 in 2015.",

For MODIS, version of collection 051 AOD product including AOD data retrieved by Dark Target (DT) algorithm and Deep Blue (DB) algorithm and China collection 2.0 AOD dataset retrieved by synergetic retrieval of aerosol properties algorithm (SRAP) have good accuracy. However, AOD products from these different satellites and different algorithms are not consistent. The objective of this study is to merge multiple satellite AOD products to obtain a new consistent AOD dataset. For this purpose, five satellite AOD products are chosen as the source AOD maps, including three MODIS AOD products (Collection 051 MODIS DT and MODIS DB AOD product, China collection 2.0 AOD dataset), one SeaWiFS AOD product and one MISR AOD product. Because each source AOD product may have different biases for different surface albedo and AOD values, the biases and fusion weights were computed for different ranges of surface albedo and AOD values separately. Using the weight result, fused AOD dataset is produced based on maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) algorithm. The fused AOD dataset has been validated using AOD data from China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network (CARSNET) and Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET). The new AOD dataset shows significant improvement on the correlation with the AERONET and CARSNET derived AOD data with good accuracy.

            "abstract": "A number of recent studies have suggested that Arctic sea ice thickness is an important predictor of Arctic sea ice extent. However, coupled forecast systems do not currently use sea ice thickness observations in their initialization and are therefore missing a potentially important source of additional skill. A set of ensemble potential predictability experiments, with a global climate model, initialized with and without knowledge of the sea ice thickness initial state, have been run to investigate this. These experiments show that accurate knowledge of the sea ice thickness field is crucially important for sea ice concentration and extent forecasts up to eight months ahead. Perturbing sea ice thickness also has a significant impact on the forecast error in the 2m temperature and surface pressure fields a few months ahead. These results show that advancing capabilities to observe and assimilate sea ice thickness into coupled forecast systems could significantly increase skill.",

            "abstract": "Approximately 40% of global food production comes from irrigated agriculture. With the increasing demand for food even greater pressures will be placed on water resources within these systems. In this work we aimed to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture at the field-scale (~500 m) using the newly developed cosmic-ray neutron rover near Waco, NE. Here we mapped soil moisture of 144 quarter section fields (a mix of maize, soybean, and natural areas) each week during the 2014 growing season (May to September). The 11 x11 km study domain also contained 3 stationary cosmic-ray neutron probes for independent validation of the rover surveys. Basic statistical analysis of the domain indicated a strong inverted parabolic relationship between the mean and variance of soil moisture. The relationship between the mean and higher order moments were not as strong. Geostatistical analysis indicated the range of the soil moisture semi-variogram was significantly shorter during periods of heavy irrigation as compared to non-irrigated periods. Scaling analysis indicated strong power law behavior between the variance of soil moisture and averaging area with minimal dependence of mean soil moisture on the slope of the power law function. Statistical relationships derived from the rover dataset offer a novel set of observations that will be useful in: 1) calibrating and validating land surface models, 2) calibrating and validating crop models, 3) soil moisture covariance estimates for statistical downscaling of remote sensing products such as SMOS and SMAP, and 4) provide center-pivot scale mean soil moisture data for optimal irrigation timing and volume amounts.",

            "abstract": "Climate emulators can bridge spatial scales in integrated assessment in ways that allow us to take advantage of the evolving understanding of the impacts of climate change. The spatial scales at which climate impacts occur are much finer than those of the “damage functions” in integrated assessment models (IAMs), which incorporate reduced form climate models to project changes in global mean temperature, and estimate aggregate damages directly from that. Advancing the state of IA modeling requires methods to generate—in a flexible and computationally efficient manner—future changes in climate variables at the geographic scales at which individual impact endpoints can be resolved.\nThe state of the art uses outputs of global climate models (GCMs) forced by warming scenarios to drive impact calculations. However, downstream integrated assessments are perforce “locked-in\" to the particular GCM x warming scenario combinations that generated the meteorological fields of interest—it is not possible assess risk due to the absence of probabilities over warming scenarios or model uncertainty. The availability of reduced-form models which can efficiently simulate the envelope of the response of multiple GCMs to a given amount of warming provides us with capability to create probabilistic projections of fine-scale of meteorological changes conditional on global mean temperature change to drive impact calculations in ways that permit risk assessments.\nThis presentation documents a prototype probabilistic climate emulator for use as a GCM diagnostic tool and a driver of climate change impact assessments. We use a regression-based approach to construct multi-model global patterns for changes in temperature and precipitation from the CMIP3 archive. Crucially, regression residuals are used to derive a spatial covariance function of the model- and scenario-dependent deviations from the average pattern. By sampling from this manifold we can rapidly generate many realizations of spatially-coherent fields of temperature and precipitation, conditional on future global mean temperature change. We close by outlining the application of our emulator to characterizing climate change risk to global agriculture.",

The transient version of the problem, which occurs when these forces are not in equilibrium such as when the pressure gradients are changing in time, is solvable analytically only for a limited set of forcing variability modes, and the resulting solutions are not succinct nor easy to interpret. In this talk, we demonstrate that the problem can be reduced to a second-order ordinary differential equation that is very similar to the dynamical equation of a mass-spring-damper system. The evaluation of the proposed model is performed by comparing it to results from a suite of large-eddy simulations. The reduced model can be solved for a wider range of variable forcing conditions and serves to elucidate the physical origin of the inertia (mass), energy storage (spring), and energy dissipation (damper) attributes of the Ekman layer.",

            "abstract": "Innovative municipal stormwater management technologies are urgently required in urban centers. Inadequate stormwater management can lead to excessive flooding, channel erosion, decreased stream baseflows, and degraded water quality. A major source of urban stormwater is unused roof space. Green roofs can be used as a stormwater management tool to reduce roof generated stormwater and generally improve the quality of runoff. With recent legislation in some North American cities, including Toronto, requiring the installation of green roofs on large buildings, research on the effectiveness of green roofs for stormwater management is important. This study aims to assess the hydrologic response of an extensive sedum green roof in London, Ontario, with emphasis on the response to large precipitation events that stress municipal stormwater infrastructure. A green roof rapidly reaches field capacity during large storm events and can show significantly different behavior before and after field capacity. At field capacity a green roof has no capillary storage left for retention of stormwater, but may still be an effective tool to attenuate peak runoff rates by transport through the green roof substrate. The attenuation of green roofs after field capacity is linked to gravity storage, where gravity storage is the water that is temporarily stored and can drain freely over time after field capacity has been established. Stormwater attenuation of a modular experimental green roof is determined from water balance calculations at 1-minute intervals. Data is used to evaluate green roof attenuation and the impact of field capacity on peak flow rates and gravity storage. In addition, a numerical model is used to simulate event based stormwater attenuation. This model is based off of the Richards equation and supporting theory of multiphase flow through porous media.",

The signature of these two volatile gases has been measured by the Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) as sporadic short-lived signal increases above instrument background. Following the detection of these two species in the exosphere, a systematic measurement campaign with a cadence of few hours over four main lunar local time sectors (sunrise, midnight, sunset, and noon) was put in place and continued to the end of the mission. While this measurement campaign did not reveal any local time dependence for these sporadic signal events, it showed that they are globally correlated with predicted micrometeoroid streams. Moreover, a subset of these NMS observations were acquired at low altitudes when water and carbon dioxide signals were below instrumental background, and used to establish new upper limits of the background abundances of these two gases in the exosphere.",

High resolution near-field video recordings of the vents, taken from a distance of ~850 m from 8 – 10 May (during the second explosive phase), were used as a case study to describe the mechanism of such pulsating eruptions and their contribution to the total mass flux of ash injection in the atmosphere. The dynamics of discrete overpressured jets were quantified during the intial gas thrust stage, i.e. between discharge and the height of transition into a convective buoyant regime (at ~100 m above the vent). By applying a straight-forward volumetrical calculation model, the volume and pressure history of eruptive pulses could be reconstructed. Then the mass flux of individual pulses was determined by exploiting the fact that the pressure at the transition height is known to be at ambient pressure. Based on our results we examine how to link the eruption source parameters of multiple discrete expansive jets to the overall mass eruption rate deduced by “classical” continuous ash plume models (being ~4*104 kg/s). In addition we discuss the implications for a real-time assessment of eruption source parameters by using near-field monitoring systems under pulsatory eruption conditions.",

Within the Chesapeake watershed the Conowingo Reservoir has been filling in with sediment for almost a century, and is now in a state of near-full capacity called dynamic equilibrium. The development of the Chesapeake TMDL in 2010 was with the hydrology of a 1991-2000 simulation period, and carried with this simulation period the implicit model calibration assumption, based on the 1991-2000 nutrient and sediment observations, of a Conowingo Reservoir that was still effectively trapping sediment. In a TMDL, pollutant loads beyond the TMDL allocation, which are brought about by growth or other conditions, must be offset. Using the analysis tools of the Chesapeake TMDL for assessing the degree of attainment of living resource based water quality standards, the estimated nutrient and sediment loads from a simulated infill of the Conowingo Reservoir was determined. The influence on Chesapeake water quality by a large storm and scour event of January 1996 on the Susquehanna was estimated and the same storm and scour events were also evaluated in the more critical living resource periods of June and October. An analysis was also made on the estimated influence of more moderate but frequent high flow events. The infill of the Conowingo reservoir had estimated impairments of water quality at both the simulated high flow scour events and at the more frequent moderate storm flows. The estimated impairment was primarily on the deep water and deep channel dissolved oxygen because of increased scour and transport of dissolved particulate organic nutrients under conditions of Conowingo infill. Figure 1 describes the linked models used to assess the impact of Conowingo Reservoir infill on Chesapeake hypoxia.",

The variability of the main auroral emission was studied using latitudinal profiles of intensity. The main oval intensity was found to be reduced when bright patches of diffuse emission were present at lower latitudes. These low latitude emissions are interpreted as the signatures of hot plasma injections from the outer magnetosphere, a process which has previously been related to interchange between the flux tubes from the outer magnetosphere and outward-moving flux tubes loaded with iogenic plasma. The main emission was also observed to broaden and shift in latitude, and occasionally display a double peak structure. These observations are interpreted with reference to the expected changes in auroral field-aligned currents associated with the replacement of the radially-stretched, mass-loaded flux tubes in the middle magnetosphere by more dipolar flux tubes containing rarefied hot plasma.

            "abstract": "Human land use will increasingly contribute to habitat losses and water shortages in California, given future population projections and associated demand for agricultural land. Understanding how land-use change may impact future water use and where existing protected areas may be threatened by land-use conversion will be important if effective, sustainable management approaches are to be implemented. We used a state-and-transition simulation modeling (STSM) framework to simulate spatially-explicit (1 km2) historical (1992-2010) and future (2011-2060) land-use change for 52 California counties within the Mediterranean California ecoregion. Historical land use change estimates were derived from the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP) dataset and attributed with county-level agricultural water-use data from the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR). Six future alternative land-use scenarios were developed and modeled using the historical land-use change estimates and land-use projections based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B1 scenarios. Resulting spatial land-use scenario outputs were combined based on scenario agreement and a land conversion threat index developed to evaluate vulnerability of existing protected areas. Modeled scenario output of county-level agricultural water use data were also summarized, enabling examination of alternative water use futures. We present results of two separate applications of STSM of land-use change, demonstrating the utility of STSM in analyzing land-use related impacts on water resources as well as potential threats to existing protected land. Exploring a range of alternative, yet plausible, land-use change impacts will help to better inform resource management and mitigation strategies.",

            "abstract": "The Cascades magmatic arc lies mainly within the High Cascades graben system in the state of Oregon. Normal faults of the Klamath graben trend north into Mount Mazama, the volcano whose catastrophic eruption ~7700 cal y BP resulted in collapse of 8x10 km Crater Lake caldera. Geologic mapping of Mount Mazama (Bacon, USGS SIM 2832, 2008) delineated faults of the West Klamath Lake fault zone (WKLFZ) and their northern extensions through Crater Lake National Park west of the caldera. Outcrop patterns implied presence of normal faults farther west but dense conifer forest made discovery of subtle scarps impractical. Closer to the Cascades axis, successively decreasing offsets of mapped Mazama lava flows with decreasing age yielded a long-term vertical slip rate of ~0.3 mm/y on the principal fault segments of the WKLFZ near Crater Lake, where the youngest offset lavas are 35 ka in age. Other workers have found offset lateral moraine crests where Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) valley glaciers crossed the WKLFZ south of Crater Lake.\nA lidar survey of Crater Lake National Park in 2010 supported by the Oregon Lidar Consortium (Robinson, USGS Data Series 716, 2012) revealed meter-scale, dominantly N–S trending fault scarps with down-to-the-east displacement west of most previously mapped faults at the latitude of Crater Lake, increasing the known width of the fault zone there to as much as 11 km. Fault segments as long as 7–16 km form a semi-continuous system for virtually the entire 32 km N–S extent of lidar coverage. Along the western part of the fault zone, scarp height is as great as ~20 m. Scarp length and height imply that several M>6–7 earthquakes have occurred in late Pleistocene–Holocene time. Field observations show that the ignimbrite of the Mazama climactic eruption banks against or covers scarps. One fault vertically displaces a lateral moraine ~3 m. The moraine contains clasts of ~50 ka andesite and therefore likely dates from the LGM so that the most recent displacement occurred between ~16 ka ice retreat and the ~7700 cal y BP Mazama eruption. The question arises, exactly when was the last major earthquake on the newly documented fault? Did it occur hundreds or thousands of years earlier, or was that earthquake possibly the trigger for the Mazama climactic eruption?",

In SuperDARN data, MSTID signatures are manifested as quasi-periodic enhancements of ground\nscatter power moving through the radar FOV. High latitude SuperDARN MSTIDs have been studied for\nmany years and are generally attributed to atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) launched by auroral sources.\nRecent extension of the SuperDARN network to midlatitudes has revealed that MSTIDs are routinely\nobserved at midlatitudes as well.

However, there is also a population of MSTIDs that could be generated by\ntropospheric sources. This study extends this research by surveying multiple midlatitude radars in Oregon\n(CVW and CVE), Kansas (FHW and FHW) and Virginia (BKS and WAL) from 1 November 2012 through\n1 January 2013 for MSTID signatures in order understand the longitudinal distribution of midlatitude\nMSTID characteristics and understand possible influences of varied terrain on MSTID observations.\nMSTIDs observed by all radars had typical wavelengths between 250 to 500 km and horizontal velocities\nbetween 100 and 250 m/s.

            "abstract": "Modeling of multivariate time-series produced by complex systems requires efficient tools for compact data representation. In this report we consider this problem, relating to empirical modeling of climate, which implies an analysis of spatial-distributed time-series. The main goal is to establish the number of principal modes which have key contribution to data and actually governs the observed variability. Currently, the number of widely used methods based on PCA and factor analysis exists, which yield different data decompositions taking into consideration spatial/spatio-temporal correlations in observed dynamics: spatial empirical orthogonal functions, M-SSA, varimax rotation, empirical orthogonal teleconnections, and so on. However, the question about possibility of improving the decomposition by taking into account nonlinear couplings between variables often remains untouched.\nIn the report the method for construction of principal dynamic modes on the basis of low-dimensional nonlinear parametric representation of observed multivariate time-series is suggested. It is aimed to extracting the set of latent modes that both explains an essential part of variability, and obeys the simplest evolution law. Thus, this approach can be used for optimal reconstruction of the phase space for empirical prognostic modeling of observed dynamics. Criterion of evidence of the nonlinearity, which allows estimating optimal parameters of data representation (including the number of parameters in mode definition and the number of principal modes) is proposed.\nThe effectiveness of suggested method is firstly demonstrated on toy model example: two-dimensional strongly nonlinear problem of unknown dynamic mode retrieval from noisy data is considered. Next, the evidence of nonlinear couplings in SST space-distributed data covering the Globe is investigated by the proposed approach. It is demonstrated that the obtained principal modes capture more part of SST variability than principal components (PCs) constructed by EOF or spatio-temporal EOF expansions. In particular, the first nonlinear mode almost completely describes ENSO phenomenon by capturing three ENSO-related PCs obtained from EOF decomposition. The application of the approach to data-driven forecasting of ENSO dynamics is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Using 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of magnetotail dynamics, we investigate the onset of reconnection in realistic tail configurations. Reconnection onset is preceded by a driven phase, during which magnetic flux is added to the tail at the high-latitude boundaries, followed by a relaxation phase, during which the configuration continues to respond to the driving. We found a clear distinction between stable and unstable cases, dependent on deformation amplitude and ion/electron mass ratio. The threshold appears consistent with electron tearing. The evolution prior to onset as well as the evolution of stable cases, are largely independent of the mass ratio, governed by integral entropy conservation as imposed in MHD. This suggests that ballooning instability in the tail should not be expected prior to the onset of tearing and reconnection. The onset time and other onset properties depend on the mass ratio, consistent with expectations for electron tearing. At onset, we found electron anisotropies Tperp/Tparallel = 1.1-1.3, raising growth rates and wave numbers. Our simulations have provided a quantitative onset criterion that is easily evaluated in MHD simulations, provided the spatial resolution is sufficient.",

We quantify agricultural carbon fluxes associated with annual (starting in 1961) crop net primary productivity (NPP), harvested biomass, and human and livestock consumption and emissions, with estimates of uncertainty, by applying region- and species-specific carbon parameters to annual crop, livestock, food and trade inventory data, and generate downscaled, gridded (0.05 degree resolution) representations of these fluxes.\nIn 2011, global crop NPP was 5.25 ± 0.46 Pg carbon (excluding root exudates), of which 2.05 ± 0.051 Pg carbon was harvested as primary crops; an additional 0.54 Pg of crop residue carbon was collected for livestock fodder. In 2011, total livestock feed intake was 2.42 ± 0.21 Pg carbon, of which 2.31 ± 0.21 Pg carbon was emitted as carbon dioxide and 0.072 ± 0.005 Pg carbon was emitted as methane. We estimate that livestock grazed 1.18 Pg carbon from non-crop lands in 2011, representing 48.5 % of global total feed intake. In 2009, the latest available data year, we estimate global human food intake (excluding seafood and orchard fruits and nuts) at 0.52 ± 0.03 Pg carbon, with an additional 0.24 ± 0.01 Pg carbon of food supply chain losses. Trends in production and consumption of agricultural carbon between 1961 and recent years, such as increasing dominance of oilcrops and decreasing percent contribution of pasturage to total livestock feed intake, are discussed, and accounting of all agricultural carbon was done for the years 2005 and 2009. Gridded at 0.05 degree resolution, these quantities represent local uptake and release of agricultural biogenic carbon (e.g. biomass production and removal, residue and manure inputs to soils) and may be used with other gridded data to help estimate current and future changes in soil organic carbon.",

The first pipe with 0.6m diameter is located at 1.0m depth, the second pipe with 0.75m diameter is located at similar depth and the ditch is located at approximately 2.0m depth. P-and SH- data were acquired along a common profile with vertical and horizontal component geophones respectively using explosive point sources. Initial results from the P-wave FWI shows velocity updates with similar polarity at the pipe and backfilled locations. The S-wave full waveform inversion on the other hand shows velocity updates of reciprocal polarity at both locations. Results clearly show the utility of complementing routinely generated P-wave models with SH-wave acquisition.",

Quantitative analysis of the effects of these uncertainties on tracer distributions, radiative forcing, and other model responses is hindered by the “curse of dimensionality.” We describe efforts to overcome this curse using ensemble simulations and advanced statistical methods. Uncertainties from 95 photochemical parameters in the trop-MOZART scheme were sampled using a Monte Carlo method and propagated through 10,000 simulations of the single column version of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). The variance of the ensemble was represented as a network with nodes and edges, and the topology and connections in the network were analyzed using lasso regression, Bayesian compressive sensing, and centrality measures from the field of social network theory. Despite the limited sample size for this high dimensional problem, our methods determined the key sources of variation and co-variation in the ensemble and identified important clusters in the network topology. Our results can be used to better understand the flow of photochemical uncertainty in simulations using CAM and other climate models.

            "abstract": "Since spring equinox in 2009 Rhea and Dione’s northern hemisphere has been warming, potentially causing volatiles previously trapped on its surface to sublimate. Recently Cassini’s Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) discovered traces of molecular oxygen and carbon dioxide around Rhea and Dione (Teolis et al., 2010; Simon et al., 2011; Tokar et al, 2012). Follow up observations showed that the gas concentrations were higher over the northern hemispheres of both satellites (Teolis et al., 2012), possibly due to seasonal variability. A surface capable of trapping the quantity of volatiles needed to produce the observed density of the exosphere must be both porous and cold (< 50 K) (Teolis et al., 2010). Both of these requirements may be met in Dione and Rhea’s polar regions. The presence of volatiles on the surface of these satellites, depending on their particle size and composition, could introduce observable emissivity variations into the spectrum observed by Cassini’s Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS). A previous study (Carvano et al., 2007) found no evidence of emissivity variations in the CIRS spectrum of Saturn, Phoebe, Iapetus, Enceladus, Tethys or Hyperion, but did not consider Rhea or localized emissivity variations, and since then many more CIRS specta have been obtained. This work focuses on CIRS focal plane 1 (10 to 600 cm-1) north polar stare observations of Dione and Rhea, to obtain the high signal-to-noise required to observe subtle emissivity variations. The implications of both observed emissivity variations and null results will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Throughout the transition from the last Glacial to the current Interglacial, rising atmospheric CO2 levels were accompanied by declining atmospheric D14C values. A likely mechanism, influencing both components is the deglacial release of CO2, stored for millennia in the deep Ocean, to the atmosphere. Due to its long residence time within the oceans interior this CO2 rich water mass was considerably depleted in radiocarbon. Although a large number of studies address this topic, the extent, location and pathways of the glacial carbon pool are still subjects of an ongoing debate. As deep water masses are upwelled and new intermediate waters are formed around Antarctica, the Southern Ocean is a potential area for the deglacial release of stored CO2. Here we present radiocarbon and carbonate ion data from a Southwest Pacific transect of sediment cores covering the major water masses in this area, from AAIW down to AABW. During the Glacial, our data locate a significantly 14C depleted pool with apparent ventilation ages of up to ~8000 years at a water depth between 2000 and 4500 m in glacial Pacific Deep Water. Although the redistribution of old carbon from the deep- into the intermediate-water begins at ~22,000 years B.P., the major outgassing pulse from the deep Pacific parallels the rise in atmospheric CO2.",

            "abstract": "Stream power represents the rate of energy expenditure along a river and can be calculated using topographic data acquired via remote sensing. This study used remotely sensed data and field measurements to quantitatively relate temporal changes in the form of Soda Butte Creek, a gravel-bed river in northeastern Yellowstone National Park, to stream power gradients along an 8 km reach. Aerial photographs from 1994-2012 and cross-section surveys were used to assess lateral channel mobility and develop a morphologic sediment budget for quantifying net sediment flux for a series of budget cells. A drainage area-to-discharge relationship and digital elevation model (DEM) developed from LiDAR data were used to obtain the discharge and slope values, respectively, needed to calculate stream power. Local and lagged relationships between mean stream power gradient at median peak discharge and volumes of erosion, deposition, and net sediment flux were quantified via spatial cross-correlation analyses. Similarly, autocorrelations of locational probabilities and sediment fluxes were used to examine spatial patterns of channel mobility and sediment transfer. Energy expended above critical stream power was calculated for each time period to relate the magnitude and duration of peak flows to the total volume of sediment eroded or deposited during each time increment. Our results indicated a lack of strong correlation between stream power gradients and sediment flux, which we attributed to the geomorphic complexity of the Soda Butte Creek watershed and the inability of our relatively simple statistical approach to link sediment dynamics expressed at a sub-budget cell scale to larger-scale driving forces such as stream power gradients. Future studies should compare the moderate spatial resolution techniques used in this study to very-high resolution data acquired from new fluvial remote sensing technologies to better understand the amount of error associated with stream power, sediment transport, and channel change calculated from historical datasets.",

We use an iterative finite-frequency tomography methodology and a unique data set that combines empirical Green’s functions extracted from ambient noise and earthquake waveforms. The uniqueness and combination of datasets allow us to best exploit the limited station distribution in the Pacific and image wave speed structures between 35 km and greater than 250 km into the Earth.\nWe image a region of fast shear wave speeds, greater than 4.75 km/s, that extends to greater than 100 km beneath the plateau. The wave speeds are similar to as observed in cratonic environments and are consistent with a compositional anomaly likely a result of eclogite entrainment during the plateau's formation.",

            "abstract": "Arctic ice masses have lost mass rapidly during the past two decades and accelerated discharge through marine-terminating outlet glaciers has been a primary component of deficits from the Greenland Ice Sheet. However, previous studies have focused on individual glaciers or regions, meaning that little is known about broad-scale trends in outlet glacier retreat rates, their spatial variation across the Arctic and/or their differing response to forcing. Here we present the first pan-Atlantic-Arctic assessment of outlet glacier retreat rates and their relationship to forcing factors. During the past two decades (1992-2010) we demonstrate an almost ubiquitous trend of rapid and accelerating outlet glacier retreat trend across the Atlantic Arctic. Between 1992 and 2000, 77 % of our 321 study glaciers retreated, compared to 95 % between 2000 and 2010. Mean retreat rates increased five-fold between these two intervals, from 23.6 m a-1 in 1992-2000 to 107.2 m a-1 for 2000-2010. The highest retreat rates occurred in northern Greenland between 2000 and 2010 (mean ~ 400 m a-1), followed by central-west (168.0 m a-1), south-east (125.7 m a-1) and north-west (111.2 m a-1) Greenland. Retreat also increased dramatically on Novaya Zemlya and Spitzbergen, were rates were comparable to east Greenland for the period 2000-2010. Oceanic warming appears to be a widespread control on glacier retreat and the influence of sea ice is significant in several regions. Despite regional trends, we document large variations in retreat rates between individual glaciers, with the areas exhibiting the highest retreat rates also showing the greatest variability. We show a widespread statistical relationship between fjord width variability and outlet glacier retreat rate, particularly in areas where glaciers are constrained by mountainous topography.",

            "abstract": "Subduction initiation is key in understanding the dynamic evolution of the Earth. Despite the recent progress, the question about how a stiff, mostly stagnant planetary lid can break and become part in the global overturn of the mantle is still unresolved. Many mechanisms, externally or internally driven, are proposed in previous studies. In this abstract, we present results on subduction initiation obtained by dynamically self-consistent, time-dependent numerical modelling of mantle convection.\nWe show that subduction initiation induced by small-scale convection is favoured by a free surface compared to a free-slip surface in simple models applying a maximum yield strength. In addition, we present global, three-dimensional mantle convection experiments that employ basal heating and narrow mantle plumes, which facilitate subduction initiation. Finally, we present results from our model that self-consistently reproduces an episodic lid with a fast global overturn due to the hotter mantle developed below a former stagnant lid.\nThe models are calculated by the finite-volume code Stag-YY (e.g., Tackley 2008) using a multi-grid method on a fully staggered grid. Second, it applies the sticky-air method (Matsumoto and Tomoda 1983; Schmeling et al, 2008) and thus approximates a free surface when the sticky-air parameters are chosen carefully (Crameri et al., 2012).\nOverall, this study demonstrates the ability of small-scale convection and large-scale convection with hot mantle plumes to initiate subduction and it highlights the importance of an initial stagnant-lid phase as part of a global-overturn cycle that might be occurring on Venus.\nREFERENCES\nCrameri, F., et al.

The new approach used since ITRF2005 provides an opportunity to verify the intra-technique consistency and a comparison of internal procedures and adopted models. The ILRS contribution is based on the current IERS Conventions 2010 and our internal ILRS standards, with a few documented deviations. Since the Global Geodetic Observing System – GGOS identified the ITRF as its key project, the ILRS has taken a two-pronged approach in order to meet its stringent goals: modernizing the engineering components (ground and space segments), and revising the modeling standards taking advantage of recent improvements in system Earth modeling. The main concern in the case of SLR is monitoring systematic errors at individual stations, accounting for undocumented discontinuities, and improving the target signature models. The latter has been addressed with the adoption of mm-accurate models for all of our targets. As far as the station systematics, the AWG had already embarked on a major effort to improve the handling of such errors prior to the development of ITRF2008. The re-analysis for ITRF2013 extends from 1983 to the end of 2013. As in the case of ITRF2008, station engineers and analysts have worked together to determine the magnitude and cause of systematic errors that were noticed during the analysis, rationalize them based on events at the stations, and develop appropriate corrections whenever possible. With the completion of ITRF2013 the ILRS will next turn its attention to the development of new products that we can soon deliver to the community on a routine basis. This includes precise orbits, low-degree gravity field harmonics, and quality control of ground system systematics. This presentation will give an overview of the development and evaluation of the ILRS contribution to ITRF2013 and summarize the new future products, including sample results.",

Higher temperatures and associated evapotranspiration may decrease total annual baseflow, even as stormflow events increase in magnitude and intensity, leading to more frequent and larger nutrient and sediment fluxes to receiving waters. Development will create more impervious surfaces, thereby increasing the ratio of stormflow to baseflow volumes. The possibility of increasing riverine flow associated with climate change this century necessitates an evaluation of various best management practices (BMPs) in urban areas to develop and utilize BMPs that optimize reductions in nutrient and sediment fluxes, as well as determine the extent to which these BMPs should be implemented. The headwaters of the Patuxent watershed are located in a highly developed urban corridor between Washington DC and Baltimore thus making it an ideal setting to explore potential climate change impacts in urban areas. Scenarios generated from a system of linked watershed and estuarine models were used to determine climate and land use change effects on Patuxent River runoff and estuarine water quality. The uncertainties of climate predictions and their implications regarding proactive mitigation approaches to manage pollutant fluxes from urban areas are discussed.",

            "abstract": "NASA, ESA and various other agencies have been collecting laser, optical and RADAR altimetry data through various missions to study the elevation changes of the Cryosphere. The laser altimetry collected by various airborne and spaceborne missions provides multi-temporal coverage of Greenland and Antarctica since 1993 to now. Though these missions have increased the data coverage, considering the dynamic nature of the ice surface, it is still sparse both spatially and temporally for accurate elevation change detection studies. The temporal and spatial gaps are usually filled by interpolation techniques. This presentation will demonstrate a method to improve the temporal interpolation.\nConsidering the accuracy, repeat coverage and spatial distribution, the laser scanning data has been widely used to compute elevation change rate of Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets. A major problem with these approaches is non-consideration of ice sheet velocity dynamics into change rate computations. Though the correlation between velocity and elevation change rate have been noticed by Hurkmans et al., 2012, the corrections for velocity changes were applied after computing elevation change rates by assuming linear or higher polynomial relationship.\nThis research will discuss the possibilities of parameterizing ice sheet dynamics as unknowns (dX and dY) in the adjustment mathematical model that computes elevation change (dZ) rates. It is a simultaneous computation of changes in all three directions of the ice surface. Also, the laser points between two time epochs in a crossover area have different distribution and count. Therefore, a registration method that does not require point-to-point correspondence is required to recover the unknown elevation and velocity parameters. This research will experiment the possibilities of registering multi-temporal datasets using volume minimization algorithm, which determines the unknown dX, dY and dZ that minimizes the volume between two or more time-epoch point clouds. In order to make use of other existing data as well as to constrain the adjustment, InSAR velocity will be used as initial values for the parameters dX and dY. The presentation will discuss the results of analytical incorporation of parameters and the volume based registration method for a test site in Greenland.",

This application core functionality, designed and built into Tweb from the initial release, is the capability to selectively share tsunami event information for authorized users. These users, typically state-level Emergency Managers, can log into Tweb to view tsunami event products in a web browser. As a tsunami event evolves the forecasted information could change. Tweb allows a privileged user (tsunami forecaster) to change what the information view-only user can see for a specific event. This “live document” capability is important as it allows users, dependant on tsunami wave arrival and inundation information for their emergency management role, to always see the latest information the tsunami experts have the most confidence in. Components of this application are now being considered for use by NOAA’s Tsunami Warning Centers (TWCs).

            "abstract": "In order to deduce reliable information about the interaction of the oceans with the climate system as a whole in the past, the reconstruction of water mass circulation is crucial. The analysis of seawater-derived neodymium isotopes (143Nd/144Nd, expressed as εNd) in marine sediments provides a unique proxy for deep water provenance in particular in the Atlantic [1]. The εNd signature and thus the mixing proportion of the local bottom water masses is archived in authigenic phases in the sediment. Obtaining seawater εNd from authigenic accretions bound to foraminiferal tests has lately become the preferred since most reliable method [2]. Attempts have also been made to extract the Nd-rich authigenic metal fraction by leaching it off the bulk sediment and thereby use this proxy with less effort, in the highest possible resolution and in sediments where foraminifera are not sufficiently present. However, often other sedimentary components are also leached in the process and contaminate the extracted Nd [3,4].\nIn this project several core-top and older sediments across the Atlantic have been leached in ten consecutive steps with either dilute buffered acetic acid or an acid-reductive solution. The leachates were analysed on their elemental and Nd isotope compositions, as well as rare earth element (REE) distributions. By graduating the total leaching procedure into smaller stages the results display which processes take place in the course of sediment leaching in the laboratory and which components of the sediment are most reactive. Thus, they help to better evaluate the quality of sediment leaches for εNd analysis. Clearly, organic calcite acts as a fast reacting buffer and at the point where its amount is sufficiently reduced the leaching of other components commences and the Nd concentration peaks.

            "abstract": "South-Central United States is one of the fastest growing regions in the nation; however, it is experiencing water supply limitations. In response, multiple interests have focused on the Kiamichi River watershed in southeast Oklahoma as a future inter-basin water supply. The Kiamichi River provides many ecosystem services, including freshwater provision to 19 cities/towns, outdoor recreation hub for the South-Central U.S., cultural capital of the Choctaw Indian Nation, and a national biodiversity hotspot. With multiple recent stressors, these ecosystem services are highly threatened. Here we present how drought and water management have impacted these benefits over the past 20 years. First, we assessed the river’s sensitivity to drought (which is cyclical) and water regulation (which has increased over the past three decades). Second, we analyzed how these hydrologic changes have impacted freshwater habitat, focusing on mussels because of their sensitivity to flow alterations and because they provide additional ecosystem services such as biofiltration, nutrient recycling/storage, and cultural resources. Third, we performed a sociocultural valuation for a suite of ecosystem services provided by the Kiamichi River watershed, including 505 interviews of five different ecosystem services beneficiary (ESB) groups. We obtained ESB perceptions on how ecosystem services changed with different flow conditions and water management strategies. Analyses revealed that increased regulation (fewer dam releases) has caused the Kiamichi River to have long no flow periods during droughts (e.g. 176 days with no flow in 2006). These long dry periods have been the main culprit for a 60% decline in mussel biomass over the past 20 years, and subsequent large losses in biofiltration and nutrient recycling. Interestingly, ESBs perceived similar losses of ecosystem services. Without being provided any information on flow, more than half of the ESBs believed that water supply, freshwater habitat, and water quality had all declined over the past decade. Overall, we found strong relationships among river flow, mussel abundance, and social perception of watershed services, suggesting that water management is key in maximizing the product of ecosystem services for all stakeholders.",

This scale of stratigraphic heterogeneity is not represented in even relatively sophisticated static models. A 3D numerical study is conducted to investigate the controls, process and pattern for the fine deposits (mud deposits) over the point bars. The study covers the effect of river cross section, river planform shape, suspended load grain size, and the seasonal variation in river flow discharge. The distribution of the fine-grained deposits is found to be controlled by flow divergence. The river cross section is a major control on the presence of flow divergence as it controls the velocity patterns in the cross section and this acts as the major control in the sediment partitioning. Bend geometry also has a first order effect on the length scale of the divergence. Seasonal variation in river flow affects the deposition amount over the point bars. Higher flow discharge results in thicker deposits over point bars. Also, increasing the size of the suspended load grain size results in thicker deposits on the upstream part of the point bars.",

            "abstract": "Modeling frozen biogeochemistry in permafrost soils is a major challenge because using observed Q10 values from incubation studies results in unrealistically high carbon emissions from permafrost. Incubation studies of frozen soil show a rapid decline in respiration as temperature decreases below freezing. Permafrost soils contain 1700 Gt of carbon, most of it frozen in permafrost below the active layer. Models with permafrost carbon in the frozen soil layers show unrealistic losses during spinup with observed Q10 values. Greatly increasing the frozen Q10 eliminates the unrealistic emissions, but suppresses winter respiration below observed values. We used a more physical approach in the Simple Biosphere/Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (SiBCASA) model by separating the simulated soil carbon into three pools: thawed, thin film, and bulk frozen. Carbon transfers between thawed, thin film, and frozen pools are controlled by a curve fit of observed liquid water content in frozen soils as a function of temperature, eliminating the frozen Q10 function entirely. This restricts respiration only to the thawed pools while the frozen and thin film pools remain inactive. SiBCASA reproduces observed fluxes from incubation studies and observed winter fluxes. This new parameterization eliminated unrealistic fluxes of permafrost carbon during spinup and resulted in global total amount of frozen carbon much closer to observed values.",

            "abstract": "The Tibetan Plateau or Third Pole covers over 5 million km2, and has ~46,000 glaciers that collectively contain one of the Earth's largest stores of fresh water. The Guliya ice cap located in the western Kunlun Shan on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China, is the largest (> 200 km2) ice cap in the subtropical zone. In 1992, a 308.6 m ice core to bedrock was recovered from the Guliya ice cap. The deepest 20 meters yielded the first record extending back through the last glacial cycle found outside of the Polar Regions.\nBecause of its continental location on the northwestern side of the Tibetan Plateau, the atmospheric circulation over the Guliya ice cap is dominated by westerly air flow from the Eurasian region. Therefore the site is expected to be unaffected by the fallout of anthropogenic trace metals originating from the inner Asian continent and rather may serve to characterize trace metal emissions from the western countries.\nHere we present preliminary results of the determination of 29 trace elements, Rb, Sr, Nb, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Cs, Ba, Ta, Tl, Pb, Bi, U, Li, Al, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, and As, from Guliya ice core samples spanning the period 1500 – 1992 AD at seasonal (1750-1992 AD) and annual (1500-1750 AD) resolution. This Guliya trace element record will complement the developing records from the Dasuopu glacier, central Himalaya, and from the Puruogangri ice cap in the western Tanggula Shan in central Tibetan Plateau, which in contrast to Guliya are influenced by the monsoon. We investigate the possible sources both natural and anthropogenic of atmospheric trace elements and their fluxes over the Tibetan Plateau during the last 500 years.",

            "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) is a hazardous neurotoxic pollutant with complex atmospheric speciation and chemistry. It exists in the atmosphere primarily as gaseous elemental Hg (GEM), with a lifetime on the order of months, while oxidized Hg is more water soluble and deposits readily. Thus, Hg is considered both a local and a global pollutant. There are significant limitations in our understanding of global Hg cycling, including the sources and chemical mechanisms producing enhanced oxidized Hg in the free troposphere. Ground-based and airborne studies have associated free tropospheric oxidized Hg with GEM oxidation and atmospheric subsidence. Chemical transport models suggest that free tropospheric GEM oxidation is largely attributable to bromine (Br) atoms. During the 2013 Nitrogen Oxidants Mercury and Aerosol Distributions Sources and Sinks (NOMADSS) campaign, we sought to quantify the distribution and chemical transformation of Hg species in the free troposphere over the southeastern US. Enhanced oxidized Hg over North Texas was associated with long-range transport and subsidence from the sub-tropical Pacific free troposphere, where GEOS-Chem predicts air enriched in oxidized Hg. Bromine oxide (BrO) concentrations were also elevated over North Texas, perhaps supporting halogen oxidation as a source of free tropospheric oxidized Hg. Over the Atlantic Ocean, oxidized Hg up to 680 pg m-3 was associated with GEM oxidation and subsidence within the Atlantic high pressure system. The standard GEOS-Chem model underestimates free tropospheric oxidized Hg in these locations by a factor of three to ten, possibly due to underestimation of Br concentrations and/or uncertainty in the Hg+Br rate constant. We investigate GEOS-Chem’s improved ability to reproduce the observed concentrations by tripling free tropospheric Br in the tropics and implementing a faster Hg+Br oxidation mechanism. Results have important implications for our understanding of global-scale atmospheric Hg chemistry and transport.",

            "abstract": "The “bromine (Br) explosion” in the springtime Arctic region, associated with rapid ozone depletion events, is now a well-documented phenomenon. The source of Br appears to be sea salt but its cycling between the aerosol and gas phase is not well understood. In this study, we observed the occurrence of elevated aerosol-phase Br concentrations in springtime IMPROVE network PM2.5 measurements in the sub-Arctic Denali National Park (DNP; site elevation, 658 MASL). Episodic elevated aerosol Br levels were observed from February to May in all years in the data record, 1988 to 2013. Anti-correlation (R=-0.54) between O3 and Br for high-concentration Br samples (Br>2 ng/m3, 130 out of 730 springtime samples) implied its possible link to ozone depletion events in the Arctic region. To further identify the sources influencing aerosol observed at DNP, source apportionment using the EPA Positive Matrix Factorization 5.0 model was applied to the entire PM2.5 speciated data from the DNP site. Six sources were derived, including secondary sulfate, a factor containing both Br and NO3-, dust, sea salt, smelting, and a mixture of wildfire and other combustion sources. Concentration weighted trajectory analysis, which was employed to identify the possible source origins, suggested that the Br/NO3- factor originated from northern Alaska in the springtime, and the secondary sulfate was largely associated with Asian sources that included Russian Norilsk Nickel. Sea salt, also originating from northern and northwestern coastal Alaska, was highest in the wintertime when high surface winds and low surface temperatures are expected. Dust, generally enhanced in April, May and June, was traced back to Eurasian sources. The smelting factor had a decreasing trend from 1988 to 2013, consistent with other studies of aerosol metal concentrations in the Arctic. The combustion factor was usually highest in the summertime, originated from near the surface in central Alaska, and was linked to variations in PM2.5 wildfire emissions. Our study results suggested that Arctic haze (e.g., aerosol derived from secondary sulfate production and smelting activities) extends to sub-Arctic Alaska (~60°N) in the springtime, as do particles enriched in Br that appear to be associated with Arctic ozone depletion events.",

The purpose is to determine whether CO2 is associated to fractures and eruptions, and if it formed recently.\nCassini observed tectonic features and plumes on Enceladus, which could be caused by a warm subsurface ocean containing dissolved gases. CO2 should be one of these gases (Postberg F. et al., Nature, 2009), and some of it should be erupted and condensed onto the surface (Matson et al., Icarus, 2012). Validation of this hypothesis could be done by determining the amount, location and molecular state of the CO2.\nFree CO2 ice and complexed CO2 were reported on Enceladus (Brown et al., Science, 2006; Hansen, LPSC, 2010) from analysis of Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data, and on other Saturn icy satellites (Cruikshank et al., Icarus, 2010 ; Filacchione et al., Icarus, 2010). Complexed CO2 has also been found from Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) spectra on the icy Galilean satellites (McCord et al., Science, 1997 and JGR, 1998), apparently due to both interior outgassing and radiation processing.\nCO2 has an asymmetric stretching mode that creates an absorption band, the wavelength position of which is sensitive to the nature of molecular associations between CO2 and their neighbors. Free CO2 ice absorbs at 4.268 µm for (Sandford and Allamandola, 1990) and CO2 complexed with other molecules absorbs at shorter wavelengths, around 4.25 µm or shorter (Chaban et al., Icarus, 2007). In VIMS spectra of Enceladus, this stretching mode absorption band is near the instrument detection limit. We utilized all VIMS data sets available that had significant spatial resolution to increase the statistics of the observations for any given location and improve the signal to noise.\nCO2 has also a smaller absorption at 2.7 µm, although it occurs in a range of wavelength that has higher signal-to-noise ratio by several magnitudes, because the surface of Enceladus (mostly H2O ice) has higher albedo. We used both absorptions in the range 4.25-4.268 µm and at 2.7 µm to identify CO2.\nOur results confirm free CO2 is concentrated on the southern polar region, which is consistent with release from the eruptions, and is compatible with CO2 present in the interior.\nWe now focus on detecting variations of band position at 4.25-4.268 µm, in order to map free and complexed CO2.",

            "abstract": "Introductory courses in environmental science are challenging to teach effectively because instructors need to balance the breadth of content coverage with the depth needed to solve complex, interdisciplinary environmental problems. For three years, the Council on Science and Technology at Princeton University has been collaborating with faculty to enhance the introductory environmental science course as part of the Science and Engineering Education Initiative, which aims to ensure that all students, regardless of discipline, graduate with an appreciation for and literacy in science and engineering. Our primary aim in the course is to foster improved environmental citizenship by helping students develop a mechanistic understanding of our individual, societal, and global role as agents of environmental change; an ability to predict or forecast the potential impact that decisions may have on the future structure and function of Earth systems; and a sense of responsibility that leads to informed action and decision-making related to environmental issues. Toward those ends, we have 1) reframed the course curriculum to focus on the central theme of “planetary boundaries” (Rockstrom et al., 2009), including their scientific evidence and policy implications, 2) developed hands-on laboratory exercises that give students authentic research experiences, and 3) modified the assessment to ensure that the students have consistent and clear indications of their mastery of the material. Student feedback through course surveys has been positive, although challenges remain, including coordination across a large teaching staff (two lead instructors for lecture and three TAs for discussion sections, plus a lead lab instructor and one lab TA), optimizing learning activities across the course structure (lecture, precept, and an optional lab), and engaging students that have diverse academic interests.",

            "abstract": "The Kalkarindji Continental Flood Basalt Province (CFBP) is the oldest igneous province in the Phanerozoic. Erupted in the mid-Cambrian (505-510 Ma) [1], it is estimated volumes of lava up to 1.5 x 105 km3could have been erupted, making this similar in size to the better known Columbia River Basalts, USA.\nRelatively little is known about the province, due in part to its remote location, though large swathes remain well preserved (c. 50,000 km2). This study, based on rigorous field investigations, utilises 4 different analytical techniques to construct a volcanic architecture for the Kalkarindji basalts, drawing together these complimentary datasets to generate a series of detailed stratigraphies from around the province.\nMineralogy and petrography form the basis while geochemical data aides in defining lava flow stratigraphies and distinguishing individual flow packages in disparate locations around the province. 40Ar/39Ar dating of key stratigraphic marker horizons support stratigraphical correlation across the province whilst the use of palaeomagnetism and magnetostratigraphy has allowed for correlation on a broader scale.\nIndications from this study point towards an unusual eruption among CFBPs in the Phanerozoic; a lack of tumescence, immediate subsidence of the lava pile following cessation of eruption; and, in the main sub-province, we map a simple volcanic structure thinning to the east from a single source.\n1.

            "abstract": "Numerical cloud-resolving studies of cumulus clouds reveal the small-scale variability of convection that is not fully controlled by the large scale environment. From the parameterization point of view, this means that there is a whole distribution of the sub-grid convective states that can correspond to the same large scale forcing. Moreover, the stochastic variability becomes higher with the increasing model resolution. As the cloud sample within a model grid box becomes smaller, the most probable realization of the sub-grid convection deviates further away from the convective ensemble mean. Therefore, as the atmospheric models approach higher and higher resolution, it becomes more important to develop stochastic schemes that sub-sample the convective cloud ensemble and adapt to the model resolution.\nWe propose an approach to represent the stochastic variability of the unresolved shallow-convective states, and the dependence of the distribution of sub-grid states on the model horizontal resolution. We combine the theory of fluctuations in a convective ensemble based on a statistical mechanics approach and Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of shallow cumulus clouds of an idealized case over the ocean. Based on the empirical and theoretical findings, a stochastic cloud generator is developed and coupled to the EDMF-DualM cloud scheme in the ICON model as a stochastic process that runs simultaneously with the EDMF scheme. The stochastic scheme adds more complexity to the cloud parameterization in EDMF, but on the other side, the cloud mass flux profiles are locally sampled instead of using the buoyancy sorting closure for the bulk vertical profile. The scheme also relaxes the statistical equilibrium assumption by applying it only at the scale at which it is appropriate and by including the memory component. Preliminary results show that the variability is well reproduced and that the scheme is scale-adaptive. Impact on the mean profiles is small, except for a significant decrease in cloud liquid water due to the different treatment of cloud profiles, which improves the performance of the EDMF-DualM scheme for an idealized shallow cumulus case.",

            "abstract": "Submarine slope failures are a widespread phenomenon on continental margins and a potential geo-hazard. Numerous large submarine landslides shaped the northeast Atlantic glaciated margins during the Holocene and Pleistocene. The prevailing understanding is that submarine slides on the glaciated European continental margins are closely related to the extent of ice sheets and the resulting variation in sedimentation rate and type in front of cross shelf troughs during glacial-interglacial climate cycles. Here we report on a newly discovered large landslide complex off northwest Svalbard in the Fram Strait which we have named Fram Slide. There is evidence that this failure is not related to rapid glacigenic debris flow deposition, which is significantly different from many other large Holocene and Pleistocene submarine landslides on the glaciated margins off NW Europe. Our data suggest that it is more likely that a combination of unstable sediments due to contour currents, tectonic movement and/or fluid migration has played a major role in causing the landslide. High-resolution two-dimensional seismic data, multibeam, Parasound and sediment core data constrain the history of the different parts of the slide complex. The Fram Slide complex has been repeatedly active for several 100k years. Together with the observation that it was not directly related to glacial debris flow deposition, this means that the eastern continental margin of the Fram Strait may fail and cause tsunamis without the necessity of a new glaciation.",

The results showed that, during crop season, about 25% of net radiation was used for latent heat flux, 10% for sensible heat flux, and the rest (65%) was absorbed by the water and soil in the rice paddy. However, during fallow period, where there was no rice in the paddy, both water vapor and sensible heat fluxes occupied about 18% of the net radiation. Also, Penman-Monteith equation was found to reproduce the water vapor flux well with surface resistance close to 190 s m-1.\nWe also found that, under small Bowen ratio (< 0.2) conditions, water vapor and CO2 were transported more efficiently than heat. However, when Bowen ration was large (> 0.5), sensible heat was transported about 10% more efficiently than water vapor and CO2. During crop season the maximum CO2 uptake was about 22 micro mol m-2 s-1. In fallow period, the maximum CO2 emission rate from the soil-water surface was around 5 micro mol m-2 s-1, which was about the same as the growing season.",

            "abstract": "Observations from the North and South American Cordillera show that mean and maximum elevations decrease with increasing latitude. The trend in elevation follows the latitudinal dependence of snowline altitudes. This correlation between elevation and snowline altitude has been the impetus behind the glacial ‘buzzsaw’ hypothesis, which states that glaciers limit the elevation of mountain peaks. Underlying this hypothesis is an assumption that elevations prior to glaciation were either uniform, randomly distributed, or followed a pattern that is no longer present. However, there may be other factors that are responsible for these patterns, such as latitudinal trends in precipitation. Here, we address this assumption and the necessity of glacial erosion in explaining the latitudinal trend in elevation. We use the CHILD landscape evolution model parameterized by modern precipitation data along a latitudinal gradient in the Andes to predict the topography in the absence of glaciation. Using NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis precipitation data from 1981-2010, we derive storm duration, intensity, and frequency statistics for a series of locations along the Andean orogen. For each location, we run a model using a sequence of storms generated from these statistics. Erodibility and rock-uplift are held constant between the different locations and the models are run until topographic steady-state is achieved. We also present runs exploring the role of a threshold for bedrock detachment in the modeled results. For each run, we track the maximum and mean elevation as well as the time to steady-state. Preliminary results for all cases show that fluvial processes alone are sufficient to account for the latitudinal dependence of topography. For example, landscapes produced with precipitation statistics similar to the dry central Andes are more than an order of magnitude higher than landscapes from the southern, wetter, part of the orogen. Future analysis will use precipitation data from Pliocene climate models as well as link CHILD with a spatially-distributed hydrology model (TopoFlow). Although preliminary, our results potentially challenge the glacial ‘buzzsaw’ hypothesis and present fluvial erosion as a capable mechanism of generating latitudinal trends in topography.",

            "abstract": "Microwave radiative transfer model are valuable tool in understanding the complex land surface interactions. Past literature has largely focused on local sensitivity analysis for factor priotization and ignoring the interactions between the variables and uncertainties around them. Since land surface interactions are largely nonlinear, there always exist uncertainties, heterogeneities and interactions thus it is important to quantify them to draw accurate conclusions. In this effort, we used global sensitivity analysis to address the issues of variable uncertainty, higher order interactions, factor priotization and factor fixing for zero-order radiative transfer (ZRT) model. With the to-be-launched Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission of NASA, it is very important to have a complete understanding of ZRT for soil moisture retrieval to direct future research and cal/val field campaigns. This is a first attempt to use GSA technique to quantify first order and higher order effects on brightness temperature from ZRT model. Our analyses reflect conditions observed during the growing agricultural season for corn and soybeans in two different regions in - Iowa, U.S.A and Winnipeg, Canada. We found that for corn fields in Iowa, there exist significant second order interactions between soil moisture, surface roughness parameters (RMS height and correlation length) and vegetation parameters (vegetation water content, structure and scattering albedo), whereas in Winnipeg, second order interactions are mainly due to soil moisture and vegetation parameters. But for soybean fields in both Iowa and Winnipeg, we found significant interactions only to exist between soil moisture and surface roughness parameters.",

            "abstract": "The integrative nature of Earth System Science courses provides extensive opportunities to introduce students to geoethical inquiry focused on globally significant societal issues. Geoscience education has traditionally lagged in its efforts to increase student awareness of the significance of geologic knowledge to understanding and responsibly confronting causes and possible solutions for emergent, newly emerging, and future problems of anthropogenic cause and consequence. Developing an understanding of the human impact on the earth system requires early (lower division) and for geoscience majors, repeated (upper division) curricular emphasis on the interactions of the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, and pedosphere across space and through time. Capturing the interest of university students in globally relevant earth system issues and their ethical dimensions while first learning about the earth system is an important initial step in bringing geoethical deliberation and awareness to the next generation of geoscientists. Development of a new introductory Earth System Science course replacing a traditional introductory Physical Geology course at Montana State University has involved abandonment of concept-based content organization in favor of a place-based approach incorporating examination of the complex interactions of earth system components and emergent issues and dilemmas deriving from the unique component interactions that characterize each locale. Thirteen different place-based week-long modules (using web- and classroom-based instruction) were developed to ensure cumulative broad coverage across the earth geographically and earth system components conceptually. Each place-based instructional module contains content of societal relevance requiring synthesis, critical evaluation, and reflection by students. Examples include making linkages between deforestation driven by economics and increased seismicity in Haiti, agriculture and development of marine dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico, glacier melting and alpine ecotone migration due to global warming in Glacier National Park, USA, and destruction of Caribbean mangrove forests and its negative effects on coral reef biodiversity.",

            "abstract": "We present a spatially and temporally explicit analysis of burned area and fire carbon emissions in Alaska using a time series with ~500 m spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution between 2001 and 2012. Daily burned area was mapped using perimeter data from the Alaskan Large Fire Database, and imagery from MODIS. 33 % of the area within perimeters was mapped as unburned by differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) screening. We built a non-linear multiplicative model to predict carbon consumption as a response of different environmental variables based on relationships with field data. The environmental variables included in the model were elevation, time of burning, tree cover and dNBR. The interaction between elevation and time of burning was crucial in modelling belowground consumption. Higher consumption estimates occurred later in the season and at intermediate elevations. Additional explanatory power and better representation of the spatial heterogeneity was achieved by including tree cover and dNBR. We found a clear relationship between dNBR and depth of burn from field measurements. The relationships between belowground consumption, and dNBR and tree cover, suggest a direct relationship between the amount of consumption of below- and aboveground biomass, with the highest consumption occurring at plots with dense black spruce cover. In our spatio-temporal domain, we found an overall median consumption of 2.26 kg C m-2, which included significant amounts of burning in cover types other than black spruce, and 2.71 kg C m-2 when only pure black spruce pixels were considered. These values were lower than the median value observed in the field data and suggest that available field data is biased toward high consumption. Our analysis stresses the importance of accounting for the spatial heterogeneity within fuels and consumption when extrapolating emissions in space and time. Data on daily burned area and emissions could be of further use for assessing fire impacts on atmospheric trace gas composition and in characterizing environmental controls on fire growth. Emission estimates of the 2013 fire season were input into an aerosol transport model and modeled CO2 concentrations were compared with measurements from NASA’s CARVE mission during fire-affected days.",

Their distribution, vertical structure and variability provide information about emission sources and transport. Furthermore, the characterization of short-lived organic halogens defines the reactive halogen budget and the conditions for the stratospheric chemistry that affects ozone depletion rates. The chemical composition of the air masses entering the stratosphere depends on the chemical and physical processes that occur during their transitions through the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL). It is well known that convective systems effectively transport short-lived trace gases to the UT. However, the overall impact of these processes on the distribution and budget of trace gases is not well known since only high altitude aircraft can reach this region of the atmosphere (>13-14 Km)\nDuring the recent field campaign of the Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX) and the Convective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST), carried out in Guam during January-March 2014, the Whole Air Samplers (GWAS and AWAS) collected approximately 1200 samples to examine the tropical convection of the west pacific and its influence on the distribution of the short-lived species from the bottom of the TTL to the lower stratosphere. Measurement of a wide range of hydrocarbons, halocarbons, organic nitrates and solvents were carried out in the field using a combination of gas chromatography with mass selective, flame ionization, and electron capture detectors. In addition, model simulations of selected hydrocarbon and organic trace gases were performed with the chemistry climate model CAM-Chem to evaluate the chemical gradients and inter-hemispheric distributions. In this presentation we will show the gradients and inter-hemispheric distributions from the measurements and compare them with the model results.",

            "abstract": "During the DISCOVER-AQ Houston Texas 2013 campaign, optical black carbon (BC) characterization of particulate matter (PM) were carried out through multiple parameters based on three different instruments: two at surface-based sites and one flight-based. A seven-wavelength portable Aethalometer deployed at Moody Tower on the University of Houston campus, an urban site, was under continuous measurement from August 29 to September 30, 2013. A Photoacoustic Extinctiometer (PAX) deployed at Manvel Croix, a suburban site 25 km away from Moody Tower, was running continuously from September 14 to September 30. Finally, a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) was aboard the NASA’s P-3B aircraft for nine flight-days in September. Real-time BC concentrations from both of the ground sites have a sharp morning rush hour peak and a minor afternoon peak, indicating a pronounced contribution of morning rush hour traffic emission. The average hourly-averaged BC concentrations for the two surface-based instruments are correlated, for both their total measurement period (correlation coefficient R = 0.78) and their overlapped period (R = 0.7). The BC concentrations from the two surface-based instruments are less correlated with the BC concentration measured by SP2 (R = 0.4 for PAX with SP2 and R = 0.51 for Aethalometer with SP2) for their overlapped periods, due to the spatial variations. The morning rush hour peak for the urban site is earlier than the suburban location, suggesting a relatively more direct influence of high intensity traffic emission for the urban site and a transported influence of carbon particulate for the suburban site. Vertical gradient and spatial variation of the BC concentration based on SP2 measurement will be examined to understand source contributions and atmospheric transport of BC into the Houston area.",

            "abstract": "Two-phase flow is of interest in many fields including microfluidic devices, geological CO2 sequestration, agriculture, filtration and contaminated site remediation. Macroscopic flow equations are often used to describe two-phase displacement flows in such systems based on constitutive relationships (e.g., capillary pressure-saturation relationships) determined under equilibrium conditions. The potential limitations of such process representation were examined in experiments with direct observation of pore scale dynamics. Transparent sintered glass beads micro-models enabled quantification of the interplay of various phenomena governing fluid flow (e.g., capillary forces, viscous forces, inertial forces). Experiments systematically evaluated the impact of pore water velocity, grain size, surface tension, viscosity and wettability on water pressure and interfacial dynamics, both during flow and after flow cessation. Particular attention was placed on high-velocity conditions, when inertial forces that are not typically considerred in porous media applications can play a larger role. Liquid pressure was quantified at the base of the system and the displacement process was imaged using a high speed camera. Characteristics of pressure fluctuations were strongly linked with interfacial properties with fluctuations manifested during displacement and following flow cessation (pressure relaxation). The patterns of pressure fluctuations varied with boundary conditions and media properties reflecting complex interactions with fluid, surface and dynamics along the displacement front.",

            "abstract": "During subduction, the hydrated oceanic crust undergoes a series of metamorphic reactions and transform gradually to blueschists and eclogite at depths of 20-50 km. Detailed seismic observations of subduction zones suggest a complex layered structure with the presence of a Low Velocity Layer (LVL) related to the oceanic crust [1] persisting to considerable depths (100- 250 km).While the transformation from blueschist to eclogite [2] and the presence of glaucophane up to 90-100 km [3] could explain some of these observations, the presence of LVL at greater depths could be related to the presence of the hydrous mineral lawsonite (CaAl2(Si2O7)(OH)2 H2O). Its stability field extends to 8.5 GPa and 1100K corresponding to depths up to 250 km in cold hydrous part of subducting slabs [4]. Because these regions undergo large and heterogeneous deformation, lawsonite plasticity and crystal preferred orientation (CPOs) may strongly influence the dynamic of subduction zones and the seismic properties.\nWe present a deformation study at high presssure and high temperature on lawsonite. Six samples were deformed at 4-10 GPa and 600K to 1000K using a D-DIA apparatus [5] at 13-BMD at GSECARS beamline, APS, in axial compression up to 30% deformation with strain rates of 3.10-4s-1 to 6.10-6s-1. We measured in-situ lattice strains (a proxy for macroscopic stress), texture and strain using synchrotron radiations and calculated the macroscopic stress using lawsonite elastic properties [6]. Results from lattice strain analysis show a dependence of flow stress with temperature and strain rate. Texture analysis coupled with transmission electron microscopy showed that dislocation creep is the dominant deformation mechanism under our deformation conditions.\n[1] Abers, Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 176, 323-330, 2000\n[2] Helffrich et al., Journal of Geophysical Research, 94, 753-763, 1989\n[3] Bezacier et al., Tectonophysics, 494, 201-210, 2010\n[4] Schmidt & Poli, Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 163, 361-379,1998\n[5] Wang et al, Review for Scientific Instruments, 74(6), 3002-3011, 2003\n[6] Chantel et al., Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 349-350, 116-125, 2012",

            "abstract": "Smectite minerals in the rim of the Noachian aged Endeavour Crater demonstrate that aqueous alteration under relatively mild acidity and oxidation potential was a pervasive process, probably in early Martian history. Reflectance spectra retrieved from along-track oversampled Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) observations have been key in directing the Opportunity rover to relatively small outcrops with smectite signatures. CRISM I/F data were converted to single scattering albedo (SSA) using the radiative code package DISORT to best identify subtle smectite absorption features without dependence on column ratios or assumed atmospheric transmission spectra. Scattering and absorption by atmospheric dust and ice aerosols are modeled from first principles, and CO2, CO and water vapor absorptions are modeled as a function of atmospheric column mass. Surface scattering assumes a Hapke surface model with a modestly backscattering single particle phase function. Whereas SSA values are retrieved from 0.4 to 2.65 µm, we primarily consider the 2.1 and 2.5 µm region. Metal-OH combination absorptions are clearly evident on Mars at these wavelengths and are characteristic of smectites. Spectral noise in this region is minimized by both instrumental and physical factors. Shallow absorptions at 2.3 and 2.4 µm, indicating Fe and Mg bearing smectites, were detected in the floor of Marathon Valley, on the western edge of Endeavour Crater, and were evident in several overlapping CRISM observations. Exploration of these outcrops by Opportunity establishes the geologic context and paleoenvironmental conditions associated with the formation of the smectites. Al-bearing smectites are also detected in several scenes over the western rim of Endeavour, particularly in sun-facing and soil-free outcrops.",

            "abstract": "Science Data Systems (SDS) comprise an important class of data processing systems that support product generation from remote sensors and in-situ observations. These systems enable research into new science data products, replication of experiments and verification of results. NASA has been building ground systems for satellite data processing since the first Earth observing satellites launched and is continuing development of systems to support NASA science research, NOAA’s weather satellites and USGS's Earth observing satellite operations. The basic data processing workflows and scenarios continue to be valid for remote sensor observations research as well as for the complex multi-instrument operational satellite data systems being built today. System functions such as ingest, product generation and distribution need to be configured and performed in a consistent and repeatable way with an emphasis on scalability. This paper will examine the key architectural elements of several NASA satellite data processing systems currently in operation and under development that make them suitable for scaling and reuse. Examples of architectural elements that have become attractive include virtual machine environments, standard data product formats, metadata content and file naming, workflow and job management frameworks, data acquisition, search, and distribution protocols. By highlighting key elements and implementation experience the goal is to recognize architectures that will outlast their original application and be readily adaptable for new applications. Concepts and principles are explored that lead to sound guidance for SDS developers and strategists.",

            "abstract": "Splitting of shear waves is commonly used to infer anisotropy of the Earth’s interior. However, most data, such as SKS splitting, provide depth-integrated measure of anisotropy along the ray path, and it is difficult to separate contributions from different layers within the Earth. There have been efforts to focus on specific depth range by analyzing differences in splitting between two ray paths, but these studies only report observed differences or rely upon forward modeling with limited parameter-space search. We have developed a new approach to examine the P-to-S converted phases that allows one to construct depth-dependent multi-layer anisotropy models through combination of inversion and grid search.\nIn addition to the conventional fast splitting direction and delay time, the technique allows one to investigate the tilt of the symmetry axis and dip of the discontinuity associated with the P-to-S conversion. Furthermore, the formulation is such that it naturally extends to include and examine multiple layers with different anisotropic properties. With these flexibilities, we can address anisotropic contributions from different layers in two separate procedures. The first scheme takes advantage of data with similar ray paths (e.g., SKS and SKKS waves recorded at the same station). The rays sample different structure when their ray paths differ (e.g., near the core-mantle boundary), but they sample the same structure when the paths are similar (e.g., in the upper part of the mantle and crust). Using our new approach, we can set up the problem as a two-layer anisotropy model where the layer with ray paths sampling different regions (e.g., lowermost mantle) is allowed to vary laterally. The second type of problem that can be addressed by the new approach is layer-by-layer investigation of anisotropy from top to bottom. This procedure combines the new method with receiver function analysis to obtain anisotropic properties of each layer using P-to-S converted waves from different discontinuities such as the Moho, 410-km and 660-km discontinuities. The application of the methods to real data shows significant lateral variations in anisotropy, both in deep Earth and near the surface.",

            "abstract": "The formation and melting of methane hydrate and ice are intertwined in permafrost regions. A shortage of methane supply leads to formation of hydrate only at depth, below the base of permafrost. We consider a system with the ground surface initially at 0 oC with neither ice nor hydrate present. We abruptly decrease the temperature from 0 to -10 oC to simulate the effect of marine regression/ global cooling. A low methane supply rate of 0.005 kg m-2 yr-1 from depth leads to distinct ice and hydrate layers: a 100 m continuous hydrate layer is present beneath 850 m at 80 k.y.. However, a high methane supply rate of 0.1 kg m-2 yr-1 leads to 50 m ice-bonded methane hydrate at the base of permafrost, and the hydrate layer distributes between the depth of 350 and 700 m at 80 k.y..\nWe apply our model to illuminate future melting of hydrate at Mallik, a known Arctic hydrate accumulation. We assume a 600 m thick ice saturated (average 90%) layer extending downward from the ground surface. We increase the surface temperature linearly from -6 to 0 oC for 300 yr and then keep the surface temperature at 0 oC to reflect future climate warming caused by doubling of CO2. Hydrate melting is initiated at the base of the hydrate layer after 15 k.y.. Methane gas starts to vent to the atmosphere at 38 k.y. with an average flux of ~ 0.35 g m-2 yr-1. If the 600 m thick average ice saturation is decreased to half (45%) (or to zero), methane gas starts to vent to the atmosphere at 29 k.y. (or at 20 k.y.) with the same average flux. These results are found by a newly-developed fully-coupled multiphase multicomponent fluid flow and heat transport model. Our thermodynamic equilibrium-based model emphasizes the role of salinity in both ice and hydrate dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) campaign in the summer of 2012 provided an opportunity to study the impacts of deep convection on reactive and soluble precursors of ozone and HOx radicals, including CH2O, in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) over North America. Formaldehyde measurements were acquired in the inflow and outflow of numerous storms on the NASA DC-8 and NSF/NCAR GV-aircraft employing fast, sensitive, and accurate difference frequency generation infrared absorption spectrometers. Since our Fall 2013 AGU Meeting poster, we have developed an improved methodology based upon 3 independent approaches, to determine the amount of CH2O that is scavenged by deep convective storms. The first approach is based upon WRF-Chem model simulations, which provides greater confidence in the determination of CH2O scavenging efficiencies and allows the estimation of CH2O ice retention factors.The second approach is a modified mixing model employing 4 non-reactive passive tracers (n,i-butane, n,i-pentane) to estimate altitude-dependent lateral entrainment rates. This information is coupled with time-dependent measurements in the outflow of various storms, which when extrapolated to time zero in the storm core, results in estimates of CH2O scavenging efficiencies. This analysis includes estimates of photochemically produced CH2O in the storm core. A third approach is based upon CH2O/n-butane ratio comparisons in both the storm inflow and outflow.\nResults from various storms over Oklahoma, Colorado, and Alabama will be presented. However, the analysis will primarily focus on the May 29, 2012 supercell storm in Oklahoma. During this storm, the 4 passive tracers produced a very consistent lateral entrainment rate of 0.083 ± 0.008 km-1, a value that broadly agrees with entrainment rates determined previously from analyzing moist static energy profiles (Luo et al., Geophys. Res. Lett., 2010). For this storm, the 3-independent approaches give CH2O scavenging efficiencies in the 49-55% range. Although somewhat higher than previous determinations, there is still sufficient transport of CH2O to the UTLS, thus providing an important source to the HOx budget in convective outflow regions.",

            "abstract": "We highlight and address important challenges with parameter estimation in climate models. We focus on challenges with the estimation of input parameters with quantified uncertainties, specifically for the Community Land Model (CLM).\nThe CLM is moderately expensive from a computational perspective, rendering Monte-Carlo approaches of exploring the input parameter space prohibitive. Instead, we build inexpensive surrogates using uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods employing Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansions that approximate the input-output relationships using as few model evaluations as possible.\nFurther, climate models, generally include many uncertain input parameters and therefore UQ studies suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In particular, our implementation of the CLM includes about 70 parameters, calling for adaptive construction of PC basis terms. To this end, we employ Bayesian Compressive Sensing to learn the most important input parameter relationships for efficient, sparse PC surrogate construction.\nHaving constructed computationally inexpensive surrogates, one can proceed to build time- and space-resolved representations for CLM outputs of interest. The surrogates are employed for forward uncertainty propagation and variance-based sensitivity analysis, as well as to greatly accelerate statistical methods for parameter estimation, where one relies on observational data to estimate input parameters with quantified uncertainty, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling.",

            "abstract": "Improved understanding of the link between atmospheric deposition and surface water quality is critical to assessing the degree to which forested watersheds have recovered from acidification. This presentation draws upon long-term (1982-2013) atmospheric wet deposition and stream chemistry time series to study how changes in atmospheric chemical inputs have been propagated to stream waters. We used autocorrelation and lagged cross-correlation techniques to analyze monthly time series describing variations of chloride, sulfate and inorganic nitrogen concentrations for four pairs of stream/deposition monitoring sites. Autocorrelation analysis revealed that individual atmospheric input time series of sulfate and inorganic nitrogen were strongly seasonal, while chloride inputs exhibited little seasonality. Stream chemistry time series exhibited gradually declining autocorrelation trends with increasing lag times suggesting that atmospheric input signals were variably damped by the forest ecosystems . Lagged cross-correlation between raw atmospheric and stream chemistry time series indicated gradual decreases in correlation within superimposed regular annual cycles of correlation over 10- 15 years of lag time. Pre-whitening of each atmospheric and stream time series using regression or ARIMA models removed the influence of long-term trends, seasonal cycles and other factors and revealed occurrence of relatively few and highly variable lag times with significant correlations. While lagged cross-correlation of raw time series data provided some useful insights into the long-term trend and seasonal nature of the linkages between atmospheric deposition and stream chemistry, cross-correlation of shorter-term residual variations after prewhitening did not produce a consistent pattern of lag times with significant correlations in our monthly time series data.",

            "abstract": "As an emerging industry, Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) is expected to play a major contributory role if the UK is to successfully reach its desired target of renewable energy production by 2020. However, due to the competing objectives and priorities of MRE and other industries, for example fisheries, and in the delivering of conservation measures, the demand for space within our marine landscape is increasing, and interactions are inevitable.\nIn order to promote better understanding of the challenges in resolving interactions between these industries, a Fisheries and Marine Renewable Energy Working Group was set up under the Natural Environment Research Council Marine Renewable Energy Knowledge Exchange Programme (NERC MREKEP). The Working Group carried out an initial scoping survey in order to summarise recent and current research activities and identify key issues and topics in the fields of fisheries and MRE interactions. Mixed stakeholder groups discussed four primary topics: priority issues; barriers to progress; problem mitigation; and thoughts on the consultation process. Points of discussion were categorized into themes to aid analysis and protocol development. These themes were: culture, community and economy; legislation and rights; data and information; and collaboration and communication.\nSubsequent invited stakeholder and expert panel workshops were held to facilitate knowledge exchange between fisheries and development of MRE in order to identify priority research issues, knowledge gaps and collaboration needs. Four group sessions identified: practical steps to aid interaction between industries; barriers, opportunities and solutions; an agenda for action, timescales and partners; and action points carried forward by each stakeholder group.\nThis Working Group, guided under the MREKEP banner, is the first of its kind in the UK, bringing together individuals from a nationally diverse group of academics, regulators, policy makers and representatives from fisheries, MRE sectors and conservation bodies. Therefore, it has the potential, for the first time, to develop effective guidelines and protocols for both mitigation and assessment of displacement of fishing effort, for the entire life cycle of MRE projects.",

            "abstract": "The thermal conductivity properties of the minerals comprising the Earth’s lowermost mantle control the core-mantle boundary heat flux, and are therefore critical properties for determining the thermal state and evolution of the Earth’s interior. Here we present measurements of the thermal conductivity of lower mantle oxides and silicates as a function of pressure, temperature, and iron content determined in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell using a combination of measurements and 3-D modeling. Our models and measurements demonstrate that the measured steady-state temperature and its increase with increasing laser power depend on the sample thermal conductivity as well as the experimental geometry, enabling measurements of the pressure- and temperature- dependence of lattice thermal conductivity in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell. We applied this technique to iron-bearing silicate perovskites and MgO at lower mantle pressure and temperature conditions. For MgO, we determine the increase in thermal conductivity k with density ρ to be ∂lnk/∂lnρ=4.7±0.6, which is in agreement with results obtained using other experimental and computational techniques. For (Mg0.8,Fe0.2)SiO3 perovskite, we find ∂lnk/∂lnρ=2.9±0.6. We use these values in combination with independent computational and experimental results to determine thermal conductivity of lower mantle minerals up to core-mantle boundary conditions. We combine the mineralogical thermal conductivity estimates in a composite model and include an estimate for the radiative contribution to thermal conductivity. Our new value of the thermal conductivity of the lowermost mantle is ~5-6 W/m/K and is sensitive to the details of the lower mantle assemblage, but is relatively insensitive to pressure and temperature. We combine our mantle thermal conductivity with models for the lower mantle boundary layer to generate a series of two-dimensional maps of core-mantle boundary heat flux, which emphasize the importance of lateral variations in phase and boundary layer thickness. Our values imply a total core-mantle boundary heat flow of 6-8 TW, which is sufficient to drive plumes and convection, is consistent with current geochemical estimates for mantle heat content, and permits a slow growth rate for the inner core.",

We compare ULF wave power from the EFW electric field instrument on the Van Allen Probes from for the October 8 2013 storm with ULF wave power simulated using the Lyon–Fedder–Mobarry (LFM) global MHD magnetospheric simulation code. The model is driven by upstream solar wind conditions measured at the ARTEMIS spacecraft for the October 8 2013 storm to obtain global spatial and temporal structure of ULF waves. We show that the global MHD model provides a good estimate of field topology and the frequency range along the Van Allen Probes orbit, comparable to electron drift periods affecting radial transport.",

            "abstract": "Vigorous circulation of seawater at the ocean ridges is required to cool and crystallize magma to form new ocean crust. Axial and ridge flank hydrothermal fluid circulation is accompanied by seawater-basalt exchanges over a spectrum of temperatures that buffer the chemistry of seawater, provide unique microbial niches, alter the chemistry and mineralogy of the ocean crust, and through subduction return surface-derived geochemical tracers to the interior of our planet. In many models of axial and ridge flank hydrothermal circulation, most fluid-rock interaction occurs in the upper oceanic crust. Hence inventories of seawater exchange should be captured by relatively shallow (<2 km) boreholes. However, after 45+ years of ocean drilling we have just two deep drill holes that sample the lava and dike layers of intact upper oceanic crust. DSDP Hole 504B on 6.9 Ma ocean crust produced at the intermediate spreading rate Costa Rica Rift penetrates 1836 m into basement through a complete sequence of lavas to near the base of the sheeted dike complex. In isolation, Hole 504B became the ‘reference section’ for upper oceanic crust from which hydrothermal contributions to global geochemical cycles were determined. The recent drilling of Hole 1256D in 15 Ma superfast spreading rate Pacific crust penetrated through the complete volcanic and sheeted dike layers into the underlying gabbroic rocks in intact ocean crust for the first time. These boreholes are complemented by observations from seafloor tectonic windows, fracture zones, and ophiolites, but these are imperfect analogs.\nAlthough Holes 504B and 1256D formed at different spreading rates, crust from both sites is expected to conform to textbook Penrose-type layering, albeit with different thicknesses of lavas and dikes. However, what was not anticipated was the contrasting distribution and nature of elemental and isotopic hydrothermal exchanges. Differences reflect the influence of local crustal structure, such as lava morphology and flow thicknesses, and thermal gradients on hydrothermal processes. These contrasts highlight the importance of further deep drilling to at least the upper gabbros in a range of spreading rates and ages to robustly extrapolate the results from what will always be a limited number of bore holes to quantify global hydrothermal exchanges.",

            "abstract": "Field work carried out on the Piton des Neiges volcano (Réunion Island) suggests that the injection of magma along detachments could trigger flank failure by conjugate opening and shear displacement [Famin and Michon, 2010]. We use 3D numerical models to compare the ability of purely opened sheet intrusions, sheared sheet intrusions, and normal faults to induce flank displacement on basaltic volcanoes (Figure). We assume that shear stress change on fractures which are not normal to a principal stress results from stress anisotropy of the host rock under gravity. Exploring a large range of stress anisotropies, fracture dips, and fracture depth over length ratios, we determine that the amount of shear displacement is independent of the proximity to the ground surface. Sheared sheet intrusions are the most efficient slip medium on volcanoes. Using our model in a forward way, we provide shear and normal displacements for buried fractures. Applying the model to a pile of sills at the Piton des Neiges volcano, we determine that the mean shear displacement caused by each intrusion was 3.7 m, leading to a total of a 180-260 m of lateral displacement for the 50 m high pile of sills. Using our model in an inverse way, we formulate a decision tree to determine some fracture characteristics and the host rock stress anisotropy from ratios of maximum surface displacements. This procedure provides a priori models, thus limits to the parameter space which can be further explored through a formal inversion. Applying this procedure to the 1.4 m co-eruptive flank displacement recorded at Piton de la Fournaise in 2007, we find that it probably originated from a shallow eastward-dipping sub-horizontal normal fault.",

            "abstract": "We utilize high-resolution numerical simulations to understand the interaction between heat waves and urban heat islands in the North Eastern United States. Urban areas, due to their dense built-surface cover that efficiently stores and dissipate heat and reduced evapotranspiration, experience elevated near surface temperatures compared to surrounding rural areas. This difference between urban and nearby rural temperature is commonly known as the Urban Heat island Intensity (UHI), which amplifies the effects of heat waves in cities. In this work, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is significantly modified in two major ways to study two heat wave episodes in the North East during the Summer of 2006. First, the single layer urban canopy model in WRF is replaced by the Princeton Urban Canopy Model (PUCM), which includes representation for sub-facet scale heterogeneity. Second, the dominant land use approach used in the default land surface scheme is substituted with a tile-based approach to suitably capture the variability in the urban surface cover. Our preliminary results show that the magnitude of the UHI increased in New York City by more than 1°C during both the nighttime and daytime periods during the heat wave episodes. In Baltimore and Washington D. C, while the UHI increased during the nighttime period, the daytime UHI was mostly unchanged. This ongoing work will further focus on the role played by moisture availability, available energy, wind direction and magnitude and urban characteristics like population density and urban cover in modulating the UHI during these intense heat wave periods.",

            "abstract": "Positioned between the Sierra Nevada microplate and Basin and Range in western North America, the Walker Lane (WL) accommodates ~20% of the dextral motion between the North American and Pacific plates on predominately NW-striking\ndextral and ENE to E-W-striking sinistral fault systems. The Terrill Mountains (TM) lie at the northern terminus of a domain of dextral faults accommodating translation of crustal-blocks in the central WL and at the southeast edge of sinistral faults accommodating oroclinal flexure and CW rotation of blocks in the northern WL. As the mechanisms of strain transfer between these disparate fault systems are poorly understood, the thick Oligocene to Pliocene volcanic strata of the TM area make it an ideal site for studying the transfer of strain between regions undergoing differing styles of deformation and yet both accommodating dextral shear. Detailed geologic mapping and paleomagnetic study of ash-flow tuffs in the TM region has been conducted to elucidate Neogene strain accommodation for this transitional region of the WL. Strain at the northernmost TM appears to be transferred from a system of NW-striking dextral faults to a system of ~E-W striking sinistral faults with associated CW flexure. A distinct ~23 Ma paleosol is locally preserved below the tuff of Toiyabe and provides an important marker bed. This paleosol is offset with ~6 km of dextral separation across the fault bounding the NE flank of the TM. This fault is inferred as the northernmost strand of the NW-striking, dextral Benton Spring fault system, with offset consistent with minimums constrained to the south (6.4-9.6 km, Gabbs Valley Range). Paleomagnetic results suggest counter-intuitive CCW vertical-axis rotation of crustal blocks south of the domain boundary in the system of NW-striking dextral faults, similar to some other domains of NW-striking dextral faults in the northern WL. This may result from coeval dextral shear and WNW-directed extension within the left-stepping system of dextral fault. The left steps are analogous to Riedel shears developing above a more through-going shear zone at depth. However, a site directly adjacent to the Benton Springs fault is rotated ~30° CW, likely due to fault drag. These results show the complex and important contribution of vertical-axis rotations in accommodation of dextral shear.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition can potentially alter soil biogeochemistry in alpine tundra ecosystems by soil acidification, resulting in accelerated nutrient leaching as well as reduced microbial and plant diversity. Several field studies have simulated various atmospheric nitrogen loading rates and observed changes in above ground biomass, species diversity, and soil buffering capacity. Few studies to date have examined the biogeochemical behavior and transport of nitrogen in alpine tundra soil. The objective of this study is to evaluate nitrate transport in soil and the chemical behavior of associated leached ionic species. To accomplish this, a soil leaching study was conducted using both composite soil columns and intact soil cores collected in Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, USA (3,658 m). Soil columns were leached in a temperature controlled environmental chamber with DI water adjusted for pH and ionic strength. Leachates were collected using a fraction collector and analyzed using IC and ICP-MS. Analysis of collected leachates for intact soil cores indicated a complex mixture of inorganic and organic anions moving in the soil wetting front, with elevated NO3- concentration > 15 mg/L. Nitrate concentration decreased rapidly after initial column breakthrough. Leaching of individual soil horizons indicated high NO3- concentrations > 15 mg/L in collected pore volumes for both the organic and subsurface horizons. Elevated concentrations of both inorganic (SO42-, F-) and organic anions (acetate, oxalate) were found in these horizons.

            "abstract": "The Great Lakes Integrated Sciences + Assessments (GLISA) is one of eleven NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISAs) and is a co-hosted by the University of Michigan and Michigan State University. The Great Lakes region falls between areas that are typically defined as the Midwest and Northeast in the United States and also includes portions of Ontario in Canada. This unique and complex region holds approximately 21% of global surface fresh water and is home to 23 million people on the United States side of the basin alone. GLISA functions as a bridge between climate science researchers and boundary organizations in the Great Lakes region, with the goals of contributing to the long-term sustainability of the region in face of a changing climate and to facilitate smart decision-making backed by sound scientific knowledge. Faculty and staff associated with GLISA implement physical and social science practices in daily operations, which includes but is not limited to: activating the boundary chain model to facilitate the transfer of knowledge through the community, integrating local and historical climate data into decision-making processes, addressing uncertainty and the downscaling of climate information, and implementing network analyses to find key access points to information networks across the Great Lakes region. GLISA also provides funding for projects related to climate and climate change adaptation in the Great Lakes region, as well as expertise to partner organizations through collaborations. Information from boundary organizations, stakeholders, and collaborators also flows back to GLISA to aid in the determination of the physical and social science needs of the region. Recent findings point to GLISA playing a crucial role in the scaling information across scales of government and ensuring that federal agencies and local stakeholders are able to learn from one another and share experiences and knowledge to continue building climate ready sectors and communities across the Great Lakes region.",

            "abstract": "The South Asian continents are densely populated and their economy is largely dependent on agriculture which primarily depends on the summer monsoon (June-September). The region is highly vulnerable to climate variability and change. It has been well established that the SST anomalies in the Indian and the Pacific Ocean attributes to the monsoon interannual as well as intraseasonal variability. Most of the CMIP3 and CMIP5 climate models have difficulty in simulating the mean climate over South Asia. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) however simulate orographic induced precipitation better, but show limited ability to simulate mean precipitation over land and an overestimation over ocean more generally. These systematic differences between climate models and observation's may be related to poorly represented ocean dynamics and SST.\nFor the first time a regional coupled atmosphere–ocean model is developed to study the monsoon climatology over the CORDEX South Asia domain. The REgional atmosphere MOdel REMO with 50km horizontal resolution is coupled via Oasis coupler to the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology global ocean – sea ice model MPIOM with increased resolution over the Indian Ocean (up to 20 km). Hereafter this coupled system will be called as ROM. For this study, four simulations for the period 1958-2001 are performed (i) REMO forced with ECMWF ERA40 reanalysis (ii) ROM forced with ECMWF ERA40 reanalysis (iii) REMO forced with MPI-ESM-LR CMIP5 historical simulation (iv) ROM forced with MPI-ESM-LR CMIP5 historical simulation. Differences in coupled and un-coupled RCM simulations are analyzed to investigate the effect of coupling on simulated climate, especially precipitation daily annual cycles and monthly spatial patterns. It has been observed that simulated feedback of ocean SST has positive influence on precipitation simulation of ROM both over land and ocean. The intensity of tropical cyclone is well simulated by the model ROM which improves the monsoon intraseasonal variability. Detail possible mechanisms responsible for such an improvement will be presented at conference.",

The very strong high frequency (HF) radio absorption associated with the X-class flares creates black-out conditions making ionosonde observations impossible. Similarly incoherent scatter radar (ISR) observations have generated only a few X-class flare impact observations because of limited duty cycle of these radars.\nWith the advent of the NSF Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) technology it has become possible to operate 24/7 with better than 10 minute cadence. The PFISR, located at Poker Flat, Alaska, has operated in such a mode since March 2007. This has provide a data base that has captured many X-class flares. The irradiance from a subset of these were also observed by the Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) on the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite. Hence we are in a position to evaluate modeling approaches that describes E-region ionization via energetic photons as well as the subsequent ionization caused by these photoelectrons. A key issue remains, that associated with the Auger ionization process. This latter topic’s relevance will be described from the modeling and future observational needs point of view. The extension of this study into the central polar cap using Resolute Bay, Canada, AMISRs will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Ion heating is a process that may allow low energy ions within the Martian ionosphere to be accelerated and escape. Ion heating can be especially efficient if the ions stay in the heating region for long time durations. With this in mind, the magnetic crustal field regions on Mars are particularly interesting. We focus on ions present within these regions, where changes in magnetic field strength and direction can heat these ions. Since crustal magnetic fields can maintain a trapped particle population it is unclear how efficiently plasma can be built up that can later escape to space. We investigate here two drivers: rotation of the planet and the solar wind pressure. As crustal fields rotate from the wake of the planet to the sub solar point and back, they experience compression and expansion over time scales of ~24 hours. The solar wind pressure on the other hand can cause variations over much shorter time scales (minutes).\nThe effect of these two drivers using a particle tracing simulation that solves the Lorentz force is presented. O+ ions are seeded within the simulation box. The magnetic environment is a linear sum of a dipole field and a solar wind magnetic field. The dipole field represents the magnetic crustal field and the dipole strength is chosen to be consistent with MGS magnetometer observations of Martian crustal field regions. By increasing the solar wind strength the magnetic dipole is compressed. Decreasing solar wind strength allows the dipole to expand. Small magnitude, short time scale variations can be imposed over the top of this larger variation to represent short time scale solar wind variations. Since the purpose of this analysis is to understand the changes of the ion distribution inside the crustal field, simplistic assumptions of the field outside the crustal field can be made.\nInitial results are presented, with the focus on two main questions: (a) can low energy ions be heated and escape the closed dipole field lines as a result of varying magnetic fields; (b) is the compression and relaxation of the crustal field due to rotation important for the oxygen escape rates when compared to the particle evolution due to high frequency changes in magnetic field and the lifetimes of these ions.",

            "abstract": "Teleseismic data recorded by broadband stations located along the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau adjacent to the Sichuan Basin are employed to characterize crustal anisotropy based upon systematic back-azimuthal arrival time variations of the P-to-S conversions (Ps) at the Moho. Stacking of radial receiver functions (RFs) along candidate cosine moveout curves of the Ps phase is used to retrieve the splitting parameters (fast orientations and delay times). A total of 68 stations possess high quality RFs with adequate azimuthal coverage for reliable determination of the splitting parameters. The resulting fast orientations are generally parallel to the surface features with delay times ranging from 0.3 to 0.87 s. Previous studies using upper crustal local earthquakes suggested that the delay times resulting from upper crustal anisotropy are dominantly less than 0.2 s. Thus, the observed crustal anisotropy indicates a highly anisotropic lower crust, with a fast orientation that is parallel to the major surface faults. This hypothesis is consistent with P wave and surface wave velocity anomalies observed in the study area. The anisotropic structure beneath the study area is further explored by using shear wave splitting analysis of the XKS phases (including PKS, SKKS and SKS). Many of the stations display a systematic azimuthal variation of the resulting XKS splitting parameters with a 90-degree periodicity, suggesting complex or two-layer anisotropy. We searched for the 2 pairs of splitting parameters and found that the upper layer parameters are mostly consistent with those obtained using Ps phases from the Moho. The optimal depth of the lower layer estimated based on spatial coherency of XKS splitting parameters is centered at about 200-250 km, indicating an asthenospheric origin.",

Like many alpine lakes, Island Lake is highly transparent with a deep chlorophyll maximum. Alpine settings may be more susceptible to small perturbations in climate and thus good sensors for investigating climate change. It is hypothesized that this low-nutrient alpine lake has shifted from a nitrogen-limiting system to one that is limited by phosphorus (P) availability. In summer 2013, a 1.54-m sediment core was collected for diatom and geochemical analyses, including P and metals. Detailed P geochemistry can be used to elucidate landscape evolution and P burial fluxes can provide insight into biogeochemical cycling over time. Changes in landscape due to fire, zonal shifts in vegetation, and shifts in climatological factors such as precipitation can impact the bioavailability of P entering the lake as well as burial fluxes. The sediment record will clarify the role of P in lake biogeochemical cycling at Island Lake through the Holocene. Planktonic diatom abundances have been used to reconstruct a history of Holocene lake stratification, and ongoing detailed P geochemistry using a sequential extraction technique (SEDEX) will be used to identify the role of P fluxes on productivity within the lake. SEDEX can differentiate between P associated with oxides/oxyhydroxides, mineral fractions, and organic matter, and the relative changes in these fractions provide insight into landscape dynamics. Coupled with diatom proxies, P geochemistry can also provide a better understanding of biogeochemical cycling within the lake. This multiproxy approach should provide insight into the responses within the catchment to environmental changes over the Holocene.",

The CoopEUS project involves IRIS and UNAVCO as part of the EarthScope project and the European collaborators are all members of the European Plate Observing System (EPOS). CoopEUS includes one work package that attempts to coordinate data access between EarthScope and EPOS facilities.\nIRIS has worked with its partners in the FDSN to develop and adopt three key international service standards within seismology. These include 1) fdsn-dataselect, a service that returns time series data in a variety of standard formats, 2) fdsn-station, a service that returns related metadata about a seismic station in stationXML format, and 3) fdsn-event, a service that returns information about earthquakes and other seismic events in QuakeML format. Currently the 5 European data centers supporting these services include the ORFEUS Data Centre in the Netherlands, the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, Germany, ETH Zurich in Switzerland, INGV in Rome, Italy, and the RESIF Data Centre in Grenoble France.\nPresently these seven centres can all be accessed using standardized web services with identical service calls and returns results in standardized ways.

Impact of the drought was detected in optical/NIR vegetation indices (e.g., MODIS EVI), but interpretation of this data has been mixed. A significant positive anomaly in MODIS land surface temperature (LST), and a decline in morning-overpass microwave (Ku-band) backscatter have also been reported. It has been shown that the regional aggregate dry season morning-overpass microwave backscatter had a negative anomaly that persisted for several years. To refine and focus the analysis of microwave backscatter data associated with this drought, we examine spatial and temporal correlations between QuikSCAT microwave backscatter data and MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data – MOD11A1 (Terra) and MYD11A1 (Aqua), daily 1-km, altogether 4 LST observations per day. We use the MODIS LST anomaly as an ‘impact classifier’ and evaluate the strength and persistence of the microwave backscatter anomaly for different degrees of ‘drought thermal impact’, after masking for deforestation, which also causes a significant decrease in microwave backscatter. To explore potential crown mortality, we also evaluate changes in MODIS-derived surface composition, expressed as a change in green vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation in drought-impacted areas.",

            "abstract": "The plasma environment of Venus, including its magnetotail up to 3 Venus radii distance has been studied by the Venus Express spacecraft since 2006. We use the ASPERA/IMA instrument that measures protons and oxygen ions in the eV to keV range. Oxygen ions deriving from Venus’ atmosphere and flowing down the magnetotail have been reported and contribute to atmospheric escape (Barabash et al. 2007). There have also been ions observed that flow Venusward in the tail (Dubinin et al. 2014). Signatures of magnetic reconnection have been found (Zhang et al. 2012), which might contribute to these flows.\nWe have numerically calculated flow velocities and densities of protons and oxygen ions in the tail. Since the IMA instrument cannot cover all directions during one scan, we manually identified hundreds of cases of clear and mostly unbiased plasma flows. This approach avoids cases that lead to incorrect results.\nWe find that the Venusward fluxes of both protons and oxygen ions are on average smaller but on the same order of magnitude as the tailward escape fluxes. Venusward fluxes are commonly quasi-steady i.e. observed throughout most of a tail passage, which takes several ten minutes.\nThe instantaneous flow directions can differ by more than 100 degrees in the tail. Their net tailward or Venusward direction is opposite in about half of the cases. Comparison with magnetic field data shows that tailward and Venusward bulk flows are roughly field-aligned.\nThe calculation of plasma moments does not imply that the underlying distributions are thermal and described well with a Maxwellian distribution. About a third of the proton spectra show a suprathermal component. Such cases are more common for Venusward fluxes and can be observed over longer periods. In some cases the additional component is a clearly separated second peak but most of the time it fits well with a flat power law (exponents 0 to 3).",

            "abstract": "The vertical loading deformation in the Pacific mountain system is observed with GPS to be large. The mountains subside up to more than 1 cm in the fall and winter due to the load of snow and rain, and then rise during the spring and summer when the snow melts, rainwater runs off, and soil moisture evaporates. In this study, we invert such GPS measurements of loading deformation for surface water variations in Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT), and study seasonal, interannual and long-term trend water storage variations in Washington, Oregon and California.\nThe resulting GPS determination of the total water thickness change is compared with GRACE and hydrology results. The GPS inversed seasonal mass variation mimics different physiographic provinces of western U.S. The inferred seasonal change in water thickness from April to October is large (up to a half meter in EWT) in the Cascade, Klamath, and Sierra Nevada Mountains. Seasonal water storage decreases sharply east into the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau and west toward the Pacific coast.\nWith GPS monthly time series, we infer surface water variation at higher temporal (monthly) interval. The current California drought since 2011 is precisely quantified with GPS inversed surface water change. In the Sierra Nevada Mountains, our GPS results indicate ~14 Gigaton/year water loss between 2011 to 2014, and this rate is much larger than that of the previous drought event (~9 Gigaton/year) between 2006 to 2009. Our results inferred from GPS show that rapid near-surface water decrease is occurring in Sierra Nevada Mountain, Klamath Mountain. In the Cascade Range of Washington and Oregon, there is no significant water loss there.\nBecause the GPS network in the western U.S. is dense enough and GPS position solutions can be derived very quickly, we conclude that GPS provides an independent determination of water storage in the Pacific mountains system at high spatial resolution in near real time.",

            "abstract": "Wildland fires and open burning can be substantial sources of ozone precursors and particulate matter. An increase in future drought frequency under changing climatic conditions may have complex and profound effects on the occurrence of fires. The Fire INventory from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (FINN) is a global fire emissions model that provides estimates from the open burning of biomass, including wildfires, agricultural fires, and prescribed burning, at a resolution of approximately 1 km2. FINN is especially applicable for use in global and regional chemical transport models because of its high spatial and temporal resolution necessary for capturing daily and diurnal variations in emissions and chemistry, consistency across geopolitical boundaries, and chemical speciation profiles for volatile organic compound emissions associated with fires. Land cover characterization is an essential component of the model, which determines the applied emission factors and fuel loadings. In the default FINN configuration, the type of vegetation burned at each fire pixel is determined by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Type (LCT) product. The MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) product is used to identify the density of the vegetation at each active fire location. This study considers the effects of using alternative global or regional land cover databases in FINN on emissions estimates. These include GlobCover, which is a global land cover data product derived from observations by the MERIS sensor aboard the ENVISAT satellite mission, and a high-resolution regional land cover database for Texas and its neighboring states. The current representations of croplands in FINN and other global fire models lack specificity in distinguishing crop types. Cropland characterization and assignment of crop-specific emissions factors and fuel loadings in FINN are explored.",

            "abstract": "In California, groundwater is the swing resource for agriculture during drought. The availability of groundwater will drive some inevitable changes in the state’s water management, including more competition for water with ecosystem and urban water uses, continuous overdraft during dry years and the continued lowering of water tables which increase pumping costs and reduce groundwater pumping capacity. In this study we connect SWAP, an economic model for agricultural production and water use in California and C2VISIM the California Department of Water Resources groundwater model for the California's Central Valley. We examine dynamically the economic costs of pumping groundwater replacement during drought and the potential loss of pumping capacity as groundwater levels drop. We consider a three year drought continuing from 2014. Some areas in the California's Central Valley may suffer from a deeper water table and loss of some pumping capacity. Places without access to groundwater and uncertain surface water deliveries during drought are the most economically vulnerable in terms of crop revenues, household income and employment. This is the case of the Tulare Lake Basin that heavily relies on water imported from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Use of remote sensing information to estimate agricultural idle land between 2014 and 2014 confirms this finding. Results also point to the potential of a portfolio approach for agriculture, in which the crop mix and conservation practices may play a substantial role.",

Much of these trends are displayed in detail in AGI’s Status of the Geoscience Workforce reports. In May, AGI released the Status of the Geoscience Workforce 2014, which updates these trends since the 2011 edition of this report. These updates highlight areas of change in the education of future geoscientists from K-12 through graduate school, the transition of geoscience graduates into early-career geoscientists, the dynamics of the current geoscience workforce, and the future predictions of the changes in the availability of geoscience jobs.\nSome examples of these changes include the increase in the number of states that will allow a high school course of earth sciences as a credit for graduation and the increasing importance of two-year college students as a talent pool for the geosciences, with over 25% of geoscience bachelor’s graduates attending a two-year college for at least a semester. The continued increase in field camp hinted that these programs are at or reaching capacity. The overall number of faculty and research staff at four-year institutions increased slightly, but the percentages of academics in tenure-track positions continued to slowly decrease since 2009. However, the percentage of female faculty rose in 2013 for all tenure-track positions. Major geoscience industries, such as petroleum and mining, have seen an influx of early-career geoscientists. Demographic trends in the various industries in the geoscience workforce forecasted a shortage of approximately 135,000 geoscientists in the next decade—a decrease from the previously predicted shortage of 150,000 geoscientists. These changes and other changes identified in the Status of the Geoscience Workforce will be addressed in this talk.",

We investigate the radiative effect of incorporating two additional CO2 bands centered at 960 cm-1 and 1060 cm-1 (commonly referred to as the 10 micron bands) into a new version of the GFDL longwave radiation algorithm. We find good agreement between the impact of the 10 micron bands predicted by our new parameterization and that predicted by a line-by-line calculation. The 10 micron bands increase the global instantaneous longwave radiative forcing due to a quadrupling of CO2 by ~16% at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and by ~45% at the surface. Calculations with an prescribed sea surface temperature version of the GFDL atmospheric GCM show that the global TOA radiative forcing due to quadrupling of CO2 increases from ~7.1 to ~7.8 W/m2 when the 10 micron bands are included. However, no major differences in the fast radiative feedbacks are seen, as the tropospheric divergence changes only slightly. These results highlight the importance of including the effects of the CO2 10 micron bands in coupled models in the prediction of 21st Century climate change.",

The peak latitude of this feature slowly migrates poleward from 50° to 60°S. Wave amplitudes are much weaker across the midlatitude Pacific Ocean. These features of the wave field are in striking agreement with diagnostics of baroclinic growth rates in the troposphere associated with midlatitude winter storm tracks and the climatology of the midlatitude jet. This correlation suggests that these features of the stratospheric gravity wave field are controlled by geographical variations of tropospheric nonorographic gravity wave sources in winter storm tracks: spontaneous adjustment emission from the midlatitude winter jet, frontogenesis, and convection.",

Ground penetration radar (GPR) is a promising technique that enables a non-invasive imaging of tree roots. Due to the polarisation-dependent reflection coefficients and complicated three-dimensional root structure, accurate measurements with perpendicularly polarized antennas are needed. In this study, we show GPR data from two planes and one chestnut at two locations with different soil conditions. Perpendicular 10 x 10 cm grid measurements were made with a shielded 250 MHz antenna in combination with a high precision self-tracking laser theodolite that provides geo-referenced traces with a spatial resolution of ~ 2 cm. After selecting potential root hyperbolas within the perpendicular GPR profiles, the corresponding three-dimensional coordinates were extracted and visualized in planar view to reveal any linear structure that indicates a possible tree root. The coordinates of the selected linear structures were projected back to the surface by means of the laser-theodolite to indicate the locations for groundtruthing. Additionally, we interpolated the measured data into a 3D cube where time slices confirmed the locations of linear reflection events.\nWe validated the indicated predictions by excavation of the soil with a suction dredge. Subsequent georeferencing of the true root distribution and comparison with the selected linear events showed that the approach was able to identify the precise position of roots with a diameter between 3 and 10 cm and a depth of up to 70 cm. However, not all linear events were roots; also mouse channels were found in these depths, since they also generate GPR hyperbolas aligned in linear structures. Roots at a second location at depths of 1 to 1.20 m did not generate identifiable hyperboles, which was probably due to an increased electrical conductivity below 86 cm depth. The demonstrated approach is a promising tool for semi-linear root detection, whereas advanced 3D processing and migration is needed for more complicated root structures.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic models of Earth’s convecting mantle usually implement flow laws with constant grain size, stress-independent viscosity and a limited treatment of variations associated with changes in mineral assemblage. These simplifications greatly reduce computational requirements but preclude effects such as shear localisation and transient changes in rheology associated with phase transitions, which have the potential to fundamentally change flow patterns in the mantle.\nHere we use the finite-element code ASPECT (Bangerth et al., 2013) to model grain size evolution and the interplay between grain size, stress and strain rate in the convecting mantle. We include the simultaneous and competing effects of dynamic recrystallisation resulting from work done by dislocation creep, grain growth and recrystallisation at phase transitions. Further expressions account for slow growth in multiphase assemblages resulting from pinning.\nGrain size variations also affect seismic properties of mantle materials. We use several formulations from the literature to relate intrinsic variables (P, T, and grain size) from our numerical models to seismic velocity (Vs) and attenuation (Q). Our calculations use thermodynamically self-consistent anharmonic elastic moduli determined for the mineral assemblages in the mantle using HeFESTo (Stixrude and Lithgow-Bertelloni, 2013). We investigate the effect of realistically heterogeneous grain sizes by computing seismic observables such as body wave travel times, ray paths, and attenuation (t*) as well as mode eigenfrequencies and quality factors at different frequencies. We highlight the frequency-dependent sensitivity of seismic waves to grain size, which is important when interpreting Vs and Q observations in terms of mineral assemblage and temperature.\nThis work is based on a project started at the CIDER 2014 summer program.\n",

Climate variability and change over the Amazon basin pose significant challenges for society. This is the case when uncertainties in projections of regional climate changes exist. To assess the climate projections and possible changes in the dry season (strength and duration) over Amazon, we have conducted a suite of experiments using the PRECIS regional climate modeling system driven by four members of an ensemble of the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Coupled climate model HadCM3. The global model ensemble was run over the twenty-first century according to the SRES A1B emissions scenario, but with each member having different climate sensitivity. The four members selected to drive the PRECIS model span the sensitivity range in the global model ensemble. Results presented here focus on austral summer and winter climate of 2011–2040, 2041–2070 and 2071–2100 periods. In additional, we have used one of the new LU scenarios (for 2050) developed within AMAZALERT Project to assess its effects on climate over the Amazon basin relative to the standard PRECIS simulation.",

            "abstract": "Closure is the main component of a mass flux-based convective parameterization scheme and it determines the amount of convection under a given large-scale condition. In this study, we use cloud-resolving model output from simulations of both tropical and midlatitude convection to evaluate commonly used closures for a range of global climate model (GCM) horizontal resolutions, taking convective precipitation and mass flux at 600 hPa as measures for deep convection. To mimic different GCM horizontal resolutions, we use high resolution CRM data to create domain averages representing GCM horizontal resolutions of 128 km, 64 km, 32 km, 16 km, 8 km and 4 km. Lead-lag correlation analysis shows that except moisture convergence and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), none of the other closure variables evaluated in this study show any relationship with convection for the six subdomain sizes. It is found that the correlation between moisture convergence and convective precipitation is largest when moisture convergence leads convection. This correlation weakens as the subdomain size decreases to 8 km or smaller. Although convective precipitation and mass flux increase with moisture convergence, as the subdomain size increases the rate at which they increase becomes smaller. This suggests that moisture convergence-based closure should scale down the predicted mass flux for given moisture convergence as GCM resolution increases. Lead-lag correlation and composite analysis show that TKE is largely a result of convection and therefore its use in a closure variable is not supported.",

            "abstract": "The global age distribution of detrital zircons (DZ) tracks the supercontinent cycle. Abundance of zircon ages in modern sands fluctuates through an order of magnitude, with maxima at ca. 2.7, 1.9, 1.0, and 0.45 Ga and minima at ca. 2.3, 1.6, 0.9, 0.7, 0.40, and 0.21 Ga. The age distribution is shaped by differences in zircon production at rifts, arcs, and collisional orogens; by preservation, exhumation, destruction, and recycling of zircons; and by methodological and regional sampling biases. The first-order age maxima and minima have been explained by two largely incompatible models. Model 1 holds that global subduction flux (area subducted per unit time) is constant, that DZ minima reflect destruction of intraoceanic arcs by subduction erosion, and that maxima correspond to times of greater preservation of zircon sources leading up to and during collision. In contrast, Model 2 holds that stepwise changes in global subduction flux—and thus in zircon production at convergent boundaries—are intrinsic to supercontinent cycles. This follows because convergent boundaries are extinguished during collision; hence supercontinent tenures correspond to zircon minima.\nExamination of >80 geologic secular trends reveals little empirical evidence bearing on these alternatives. The most telling evidence is provided by reconstructed sea levels. Model 1 implies no particular changes in sea level during supercontinent assembly. If plate motion were to cease across a collisional orogen, the same amount of convergence would begin elsewhere and the world population of ridges and ridge volume would be unaffected. In contrast, Model 2 predicts a drop in sea level triggered by supercontinent assembly because death of a collisional plate boundary would mean death of the corresponding ridge and consequent increase in room for seawater in the ocean basins. Reconstructions of global sea level show a major low centered in the Triassic, one that is not linked to glaciation. The sea level low overlaps with the 0.21 Ga DZ minimum and with Pangea's final assembly when convergence ceased across 1000s of kms of plate boundary. Sea level trends thus are consistent with Model 2. A carefully chosen global DZ dataset will eventually yield a quantitative record of global subduction flux, subject to proper accounting for other effects.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) storage in deep geologic formations is gaining ground as a potential measure for climate change mitigation. Such storage projects typically operate at large scales (~km), but their performance is often governed by smaller-scale (~m) heterogeneities. The large domain sizes prohibit detailed site characterization and dense monitoring networks, leading to predictions of CO2 migration and trapping based on rough geologic models that cannot capture preferential flow. Kalman Filtering can be used to improve these prior models by assimilating available monitoring data, thereby tracking system performance and reducing prediction uncertainty. However, for large systems with fine discretization, the number of unknowns is in the order of tens of thousands or more, in which case the textbook version of the Kalman Filter has prohibitively expensive computation and storage costs. We present the Compressed State Kalman Filter (CSKF) that can be effectively used for systems with a large number of unknowns to estimate the underlying heterogeneity and to predict the state of interest (e.g., pressure and CO2 saturation). The algorithm’s computational efficiency is achieved by using a low-rank approximation of the covariance matrix, as well as a Jacobian-free approach. We demonstrate the estimation and computational performance of our method in a typical CO2 storage scenario with a spatially sparse monitoring network, but with multiple datasets obtained before and during CO2 injection. Our data assimilation framework provides an efficient and practical way to characterize geological formations intended for CO2 injection and storage using monitoring data commonly collected in field applications, as well as to quantify the reduction in uncertainty brought by different types of monitoring data.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental characteristic of plate tectonics is the contrast between strong plate interiors and weak plate boundaries. The weakness has both a structural aspect, as deformation zones can be reactivated during different tectonic episodes, and a dynamic aspect, as there is no major compositional difference between the lithosphere at active and inactive regions. These characteristics point to a structural origin of the weakness of plate boundaries, as deformation affect structures but structures do not heal rapidly.\nThis presentation summarizes recent advances made in estimating the rheology of polymineralic aggregates under conditions appropriate for various levels of the lithosphere. We construct a new generation of strength profiles that take into consideration the differences in microstructure that are observed in continental shear zones: reduced grain size, metamorphism, and weak phase interconnection/layering. For each lithosphere stratigraphy, two strength profiles can be constructed, one for the undeformed material, the other for a high-strain material.\nThe low-strain profile assumes a reference strain rate, constant with depth, an untextured mixture of plagioclase and biotite in the upper and middle crust (biotite being unstable in the lower crust, and an olivine-pyroxene untextured mixture in the mantle. As deformation proceeds, the fabric evolves until the phases become interconnected, and olivine grain size is reduced in the upper mantle.\nA high-strain strength profile can be derived for constant strain rate for reference. However, strain rate is likely higher in the high-strain state, but the degree of this enhancement is poorly constrained. We can follow two hypotheses. In the first, stress at each depth is the same as in the initial state. The strength profile is unmodified, but we can solve at each depth for a new strain rate. Alternatively, we can impose that the stress integrated over a lithospheric column is the same and solve for a depth-independent strain rate after the structural changes are in place. In both approaches, the enhancement of strain rate corresponds to a measure of localization achieved by the structural change.",

            "abstract": "Fire frequency and severity have been increasing across the Arctic, and fires are expected to intensify as the climate becomes warmer and dryer. Fire plays a prominent role in global carbon cycling through direct emissions of greenhouse gases from organic matter combustion as well as through indirect effects of vegetation changes and permafrost thaw, both of which can impact ecosystem carbon exchange over timescales ranging from years to centuries. We examined the indirect effects of fire (i.e., years to decades timescales) on ecosystem carbon exchange in Siberian larch (Larix cajanderi) forests underlain by continuous permafrost and carbon-rich yedoma deposits. We measured understory net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) from experimental burns, and from larch stands of varying stand densities occurring within a 75-yr burn scar in the vicinity of Cherskiy, Russia. The plot-level (4 m2) experimental burns were conducted in 2012 and comprise four burn treatments based on residual soil organic layer (SOL) depths: control, low severity (> 8 cm), moderate severity (5-8 cm), and high severity (2-5 cm). After three growing seasons, thaw depth was 6%, 11% and 30% deeper in the low, mid, and high severity burn plots compared to control. Immediately following the burns, Reco declined and was related to burn severity; Reco in the mid and high severity plots was fourfold lower than in low severity and control. In the second and third growing seasons, understory Reco continued to be lower in the burn plots relative to control, but effects of burn severity varied across measurement years. While Reco declined as a result of fire, there was a greater net release of CO2 (i.e., NEE) from the burn plots compared to control because there was limited carbon uptake by the regenerating plant community. In the 75-yr burn, we found that variation in stand density, which was likely related to fire severity, significantly impacted understory CO2 exchange through changes in light, SOL depth, and thaw depth. These results highlight the consequences of shifting fire regimes in boreal ecosystems for permafrost carbon vulnerability and the importance of understanding the responses of boreal ecosystems to fire for determining the long-term trajectory of ecosystem carbon exchange in the Arctic.",

Important sub-regional variations in the data are subsumed in the aggregate, potentially leading to an improper handling of water resources. A combination of stream discharge characteristics and remotely sensed data can provide information that is responsive at local scales, such as watershed vulnerability to anomalous moisture conditions. We conducted an exploratory analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data (500 m2 resolution, 16 day) obtained from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and USGS stream discharge (Q) records from over 100 unregulated streams in Tennessee for the years 2001-2012. The data sets were compiled to evaluate the vegetation response during a historical drought (Aug/Sept of 2007) within different streamflow recession index (SRI) regions. SRI can be applied as a metric for watershed storage and the ability of underlying aquifers to sustain streamflow through prolonged dry periods. The time series were filtered to remove seasonal trends, and bimonthly anomalies were calculated. Each of the three NDVI and Q time series (raw, filtered, and anomaly) were analyzed using cross-correlation analysis, cross-wavelet, and wavelet coherence analyses. Four SRI regions with similar land cover were chosen to spatially analyze NDVI anomalies during drought. The results from the cross-correlation analysis reveal strong biannual and annual correlations between raw NDVI and raw discharge values. Correlations between NDVI anomalies and discharge anomalies peak at lag periods of 1 to 1.5 months with NDVI leading. The wavelet coherence analysis suggests that drought dampens the monthly signal correlation between the raw values, and potentially removes a strong 2 year correlation between the anomalies. The spatial analysis shows regions with a higher SRI value tend to have higher NDVI values throughout a drought.",

There are some important turning points of ice conditions in the annual cycle.\nSummer Arctic sea decreasing and summer minimum has the largest interannual variability. Satellite data focuses summer ice reduction and the minimum area is strong concern. Although Arctic summer sea ice minimum is strong concern, other important timing or inflections are in the other season has been not well evaluated. Figure 1 shows seasonal cycle of sea ice area in the northern hemisphere. Arctic and sub-Arctic Sea ice area are indicated here. Winter sea ice shows also large variability, however this is due to sea ice variability in the sub-Arctic sea. Sea ice fluctuation in the Sea of Okhotsk influences winter sea ice variation in the sea ice variation in the northern hemisphere, and produces the decreasing trend in winter maximum of sea ice area. There are two timing of small deviations, appearing as tie points. These timings appear in May and November. Although winter and summer standard deviations are large, the standard deviations in these two timings are small. This indicates strong control of sea ice extent in these seasons.\nRecent studies focused sea ice decrease in summer minimum in September. However, the summer surface melting is already ended in August and atmosphere and ice surface shifted to the freezing process in the end of August. Surface sea ice melt in the Arctic Ocean starts in June in the lower latitudes.\nWe tried to summaries resent understanding and unsolved problems, and discussed again the fundamental seasonal cycle.

Geophys., 42, RG2001, 2004). The CRISP 3D seismic reflection study of the southern part of the Costa Rica subduction zone shows quite the opposite. Here the slope is underlain by a series of fault-cored anticlines, with faults dipping both landward and seaward that root into the plate boundary. Deformation intensity increases with depth, and young, near-surface deformation follows that of the deeper structures but with basin inversions indicating a dynamic evolution (Edwards et al., this meeting). Fold wavelength increases landward, consistent with the folding of a landward-thickening wedge. Offscraping in accretion is minimal because incoming sediments on the lower plate are very thin. Within the wedge, thrust faulting dominates at depth in the wedge, whereas normal faulting dominates close to the surface, possibly reflecting uplift of the deforming anticlines. Normal faults form a mesh of NNW and ENE-trending structures, whereas thrust faults are oriented approximately parallel to the dominant fold orientation, which in turn follows the direction of roughness on the subducting plate. Rapid subduction erosion just prior to 2 Ma is inferred from IODP Expedition 334 (Vannucchi et al., 2013, Geology, 49:995-998). Crystalline basement may have been largely removed from the slope region during this rapid erosional event, and the modern wedge may consist of rapidly redeposited material (Expedition 344 Scientists, 2013) that has been undergoing deformation since its inception, producing a structure quite different from that expected of an eroding subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "The long-term, repeated applications of animal wastes can lead to the build-up of legacy sources of nutrients within agroecosystems. However, the land-application of these wastes also introduces other contaminants of interest into agroecosystems, including hormones. These emerging contaminants have been detected in surface water bodies around the world and are known to cause endocrine disruption in sensitive aquatic species even at trace concentrations. In this research, we explore the potential for long-term, high-frequency applications of animal waste (effluent irrigation) to cause legacy build-up of hormones. We sampled tile drains and a receiving ditch on a working farm in north-central Indiana for hormones (estradiol, E2; estrone, E1; and estriol, E3) and nutrients (nitrate, N; orthophosphate, P) at a high temporal resolution for a one-year period. Repeated animal waste applications led to high frequency of detection of hormones (> 50% in the tile drain; > 90% in the ditch) and nutrients (> 70% for P and 100% for N). We used several techniques in order to assess the roles that hydrologic and biogeochemical factors played in controlling their fate and transport, including: concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships, load-discharge (L-Q) relationships, comparison of concentration variability to hydrologic variability (CVC/CVQ), and a quantification of the importance of high-flow events to total annual loads. Hydrologic variability was found to be the dominant factor controlling export of N, P, and E1 to the tile drain and ditch, lending strong evidence that high-frequency applications of animal waste can cause hydrologic controls to overwhelm biogeochemical controls in the export of not only nutrients, but hormones as well. The vast majority of export of nutrients and hormones occurred when flowrates exceeded the 80th percentile, demonstrating the importance of high-flow events to their fate and transport. These findings have important implications for best management practices (BMPs), and suggest that BMPs must be effective during large flow events to significantly reduce transport to downstream locations.",

            "abstract": "Sakura-jima volcano, on Kyushu Island, is one of Japan’s most active volcanic centers. It has been in an eruptive phase since 1955, primarily in the Vulcanian style. Prior to its current activity, Sakura-jima had 11 prehistoric and 4 historic lava-producing events, after its initiation 12-13,000 years ago (Moriwaki, 1992). We present geochemical analyses of a suite of lavas collected from all the mapped historic eruptions and a representative suite of pre-historic eruptions. Lavas vary from andesite to dacite (60.6-66.7 wt.% SiO2), with typical phenocryst assemblages of 20% plagioclase, 5% pyroxenes, and <5% magnetite. Major and trace element studies of historic eruptions indicate that Sakura-jima lavas have become steadily more mafic since 1475 (Yanagi et al., 1991; Arakawa et al., 1998). Consideration of prehistoric lavas, however, suggests that the variations are cyclic, shifting from more felsic to more mafic compositions at least twice during this period of activity. Previous researchers hypothesized a cumulate plug in the magma chamber that gradually sinks, allowing basaltic magma to ascend into a shallower chamber where it fractionates (Yanagi et al., 1991). Alternatively, Arakawa et al. (1998) propose a model in which magmas from two chambers, one basaltic and one dacitic, are injected into a third, shallower chamber where they mix. To test these models, we performed Sr and Pb isotopic analysis on a subset of prehistoric and historic Sakura-jima lavas. The 87Sr/86Sr, 206Pb/204Pb, and 207Pb/204Pb ratios decrease steadily from the oldest prehistoric lavas to the youngest historic lavas, in direct contrast to the cyclic variations of the major and trace elements. None of the isotopic ratios correlate strongly with major element compositions. Thus it appears that the simple AFC mechanisms to which the major and trace element variations were originally attributed are not the only process responsible for the cyclic behavior. One of the simplest alternative hypotheses is that early magmas experienced greater extents of assimilation than more recently erupted material, and that the sub-volcanic magma chamber has been refilled steadily by progressively less contaminated, mantle-derived material. The chamber then undergoes cooling and fractionation that is not directly related to the replenishment process.",

            "abstract": "Water distribution and flow within porous media are mainly controlled by the pore space structure. Well established methods for the determination of pore sizes like multistep outflow and gas adsorption isotherms (BET) are often time consuming, expensive, or produce toxic waste. As an alternative fast and non-destructive technique, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is used because it probes hydrogen and therefore the dynamics and interactions of water.\nPore space is most easily characterized by NMR relaxometry where the total relaxation rate is controlled by the surface relaxivity ρ of the porous medium in combination with the surface-to-volume ratio (S/V) [1]. Furthermore, there are contributions of molecular diffusion through local magnetic field gradients which are created by susceptibility differences between solid and liquid phases [2] as well as by paramagnetic impurities [3]. Hence, surface to volume ratios and surface relaxivities of porous media cannot be measured individually with NMR relaxometry. Therefore, NMR diffusion measurements are applied to probe the S/V of pores without other contributions.\nIn this study, we demonstrate that NMR diffusion measurements are feasible to determine the S/V ratio of the pore space of quartz sand coated with goethite (α-FeOOH) as paramagnetic impurity. Our findings were compared to BET measurements and we found no dependence of the S/V on the coating density with NMR diffusion and a clear dependence between coating density and S/V with krypton BET measurements. Possible explanations are the different characteristic length scales on which the pore space is probed, and the intrinsic fractal nature of porous media [4] together with the roughness of the pore surface on a nm-scale due to the coating process. After isolating the additional contribution of the paramagnetic impurities to the NMR relaxation and the calibration of the NMR relaxation signal for each coating density it was possible to use fast relaxometry experiments to obtain information about the pore size distribution.\n[1] Grunewald E. and Knight R., Geophysics, Volume 76(4), G73-G83, (2011)\n[2] Stingaciu L.

            "abstract": "Quantifying the impacts of droughts on the U.S National Forests (NFs) is necessary to develop sound forest management plans to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This study applied a water balance model (WaSSI) to 170 National Forests (NFs) over the conterminous U.S to examine how long-term climatic change and extreme climate events impacted forest water yield and productivity. Our model predicted that mean water yield decreased by 5% while mean productivity increased by 10% between 1961-2012 across the NFs. Overall 32% of NFs showed a significant increasing trend in forest gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), while 5% of the NFs had a significant decreasing trend. This study also suggested that the extent and severity of drought events occurring in the NFs had an increasing trend during the past 50 years. Taking the 170 NFs as a whole, the top-five droughts were characterized by a 261 mm/yr (or 30%) reduction in precipitation, that resulted in reductions in evapotranspiration by 55 mm/yr (or 10%), water yield by 154 mm/yr (or 49%) and GEP by 121 gC/m2/yr (or 10%). However, distribution of these changes varied spatially due to differences in vegetation types, weather, and geography. Overall, this study provided an assessment of historical impacts of droughts on forest watershed hydrology and productivity across diverse geographic regions using a consistent database. The study also identified forest watersheds that were severely influenced by historical drought, and provided a reference to develop appropriate adaptation strategies for potential future extreme droughts on the forest ecosystem services of NFs.",

            "abstract": "The thermal dissipation technique (TD) is one of the most commonly adopted methods for sap flow measurements. However, underestimations of up to 60% of the tree transpiration have been reported with this technique, although the causes are not certainly known. The insertion of TD sensors within the stems causes damage of the wood tissue and subsequent healing reactions, changing wood anatomy and likely the sap flow path. However, the anatomical changes in response to the insertion of sap flow sensors and the effects on the measured flow have not been assessed yet.\nIn this study, we investigate the alteration of vessel anatomy on wounds formed around TD sensors. Our main objectives were to elucidate the anatomical causes of sap flow underestimation for ring-porous and diffuse-porous species, and relate these changes to sap flow underestimations. Successive sets of TD probes were installed in early, mid and end of the growing season in Fagus sylvatica (diffuse-porous) and Quercus petraea (ring-porous) trees. They were logged after the growing season and additional sets of sensors were installed in the logged stems with presumably no healing reaction. The wood tissue surrounding each sensor was then excised and analysed by X-ray computed microtomography (X-ray micro CT). This technique allowed the quantification of vessel anatomical characteristics and the reconstruction of the 3-D internal microstructure of the xylem vessels so that extension and shape of the altered area could be determined.\nGels and tyloses clogged the conductive vessels around the sensors in both beech and oak. The extension of the affected area was larger for beech although these anatomical changes led to similar sap flow underestimations in both species. The higher vessel size in oak may explain this result and, therefore, larger sap flow underestimation per area of affected conductive tissue. The wound healing reaction likely occurred within the first weeks after sensor installation, which impeded the observation of differences in the extension or density of tyloses among 5, 11 and 22 weeks old wounds. This was also consistent with sap flow measured with the corresponding sensors. These results will help to improve the accuracy of sap flow measurements with thermal dissipation TD probes.",

Such uncertainties affect the impact studies, mainly when associated to extreme events and difficult the decision-making process aimed at mitigation and adaptation. We carried out a study of the dispersion in hydrological projections using climate change projections from several climate models to feed the Distributed Hydrological Model of the National Institute for Spatial Research, MHD-INPE, applied in Amazonian sub-basins. We evaluate the dispersion in high, average and low discharges. Based on this approach we compare the effect of dispersion due to climate projections, bias correction approaches, non-stationary assumptions and available topographic data on the assessment of the estimation of number of affected people due to flood discharges. In addition to the uncertainties of climate change scenarios generated from different models, it is clear that the need of bias correction, the approach used to correct the bias and the absence of an accurate digital elevation model could introduce similar or bigger uncertainty than climate scenarios in the results.",

            "abstract": "During Late Oligocene-Early Miocene different domains formed in the region between Iberia and Africa in the westernmost Mediterranean, including thinned continental crust and Flysch Trough turbiditic deposits. At this time, the Ronda peridotite likely constituted the subcontinental lithospheric mantle of the Alboran domain, which was undergoing strong thinning and melting coevally with Early Miocene extension in the overlying Alpujárride-Maláguide stacked crust.\nIntrusive Cr- rich pyroxenites in the Ronda massif record the geochemical processes occurring in the subcontinental mantle of the Alboran domain during the Late Oligocene. Recent isotopic studies of these pyroxenites indicate that their mantle source was contaminated by a subduction component released by detrital crustal sediments. This data is consistent with a subduction setting for the late evolution of the Alboran lithospheric mantle. Further structural studies of the Ronda peridotites have led to Hidas et al. 2013 to propose a geodynamic model where folding and shearing of an attenuated mantle lithosphere occurred by backarc basin inversion followed by failed subduction initiation that ended into the intracrustal emplacement of peridotite into the Alboran wedge in the earliest Miocene. This hypothesis implies that the crustal component recorded in late, Cr-rich websterite dykes, might come from underthrusted crustal rocks from the Flysch and/or Alpujárrides units that might have been involved in the earliest stages of this subduction stage.\nTo investigate the origin of this crustal component, we have carried out a detailed Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic study of a variety of Betic-Rif cordillera crustal rocks that might have been potentially subducted beneath the Alborán domain before the emplacement of Ronda peridotites. Crustal rocks from the Jubrique Unit overlying the Ronda peridotite are the only crustal samples that may account for the isotopic characteristics of the crustal contaminant added to the mantle source of late Cr-pyroxenites. These data strongly support Alboran geodynamic models that envisage slab roll-back as the tectonic mechanism responsable for Miocene lithospheric thinning, and provides a scenario where back-arc inversion leading to self-subduction of crustal units at the front of the Alboran wedge.

At this time, a careful review of the conditions in which the surveys were made is the main challenge so as to assign proper weight to each observation.

Developing techniques to extract more information, such as flow depth, from paleotsunami deposits will improve understanding of the tsunami history in vulnerable areas and provide data for tsunami hazard assessment and planning. The analysis of deposits from recent tsunamis enables the comparison between deposit characteristics and event processes because data on the source and hydrodynamics of the tsunami can be collected.\nWe compile and analyze data on tsunami hydrodynamics, deposits, and depositional environments collected in field studies over the last 16 years from 50 study sites from 7 tsunami events, including Papua New Guinea 1998, Peru 2001, Indian Ocean 2004, Sumatra 2005, Samoa 2009, Chile 2010, and Japan 2011. This approach allows comparisons of tsunami deposit characteristics across events and depositional environments. We find a moderate positive correlation between the mean grain size of a deposit and the flow depth of the tsunami, likely because more coarse material is transported by faster tsunami flows that are typical of greater flow depths. We also find that the local deposit thickness is not primarily controlled by flow depth and is strongly influenced by the contributions of bedload, variations in sediment supply, and local topography. We find that deposits often thicken when local topographic slope decreases and vice versa.\nFurther study will investigate if the thicknesses of individual suspension graded layers within deposits are controlled by tsunami flow depth. By ignoring the portions of the deposit formed by bedload transport or spatial flow deceleration, the parts of the deposit formed from sediment falling out of suspension during the temporal flow deceleration of each tsunami wave may be identified. Focusing on individual layers of tsunami deposits, hypothetically formed by a single process and wave, may reveal relationships between deposit characteristics and hydrodynamic conditions that are not apparent when analyzing deposits as a whole.

The motivation for the work stems from the CINDY/DYNAMO hypothesis III which states: “The barrier-layer, wind- and shear-driven mixing, shallow thermocline, and mixing-layer entrainment all play essential roles in the MJO initiation over the Indian Ocean by controlling the upper-ocean heat content and sea surface temperature, and thereby surface flux feedback”. An idealized Coupled Ocean/Atmospheric Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) framework is used to study the sensitivity of the barrier layer influence on the transition of post MJO dry phase to the pre-MJO moist phase. We will discuss results from the idealized coupled simulations that are initialized either with or without the barrier layer. The sensitivity of the atmospheric boundary moisture recovery due to the presence of barrier layer as well as the sensitivity to the convective initiation will be presented. ",

The Persistent Scatters (PS) InSAR and Small baseline (SBAS) methods are used widely by the InSAR community. However, it is still challenging to recover low deformation rates in highly vegetated mountainous areas.\nOur goal is to explore different approaches to identifying PS or stable Distributed Scatterers (DS) for multi-temporal InSAR processing. We are investigating the following methods: 1) amplitude dispersion (Ferretti et al., 2001); 2) average correlation; 3) spatial correlation of phase (Hooper et al., 2004); 4) comparison of phase against a known mathematical model (Shanker and Zebker, 2007); 5) statistical analysis of the coherence matrix (Ferretti et al., 2011); 6) polarimetric bounce characteristics. We first align the SAR images to form a stack of Single Look Complex (SLC) using “batch processing”. We work with this 3-dimensional SLC stack to identify high-quality PS and DS using the aforementioned methods. Next we design a filter based on the characteristics of the scatterers to form interferograms. This comparative study on identifying and filtering PS and DS can be integrated with interferogram stacking or time-series approaches like PSInSAR, SBAS or wavelet-based methods.\nWe are working with the ERS-1, ERS-2 and ALOS-1 SAR data to study landslides and volcano deformation over various terrains in the Cascade Range. From these observations we will be able to construct better physical models to explain various deformation processes.",

We present the results of synchrotron in-situ deformation experiments of bridgmanite (Mg,Fe)SiO3 + ferropericlase (Mg,Fe)O aggregates using RDA (rotational Drickamer apparatus) under the shallow lower mantle conditions. Some modifications to the cell assembly have been made that allow us to conduct large strain deformation experiments under lower mantle conditions. Pressure and temperature in the sample were estimated using the equation of states of bridgmanite and ferropericlase (26-27 GPa and 2100-2200 K). Stress and strain were measured in-situ by X-ray diffraction and radiography respectively at the Brookhaven NSLS synchrotron beamline. Experiments were conducted for strains of γ=0.5 and 1. The shear stresses were estimated to be of about 3.5±0.7 GPa for bridgmanite and 0.5±0.9 GPa for ferropericlase indicating a large strength contrast between these two phases. An SEM micrograph of deformed sample (Fig.1) shows that both bridgmanite and ferropericlase have undergone substantial flattening, but flattening seems to be larger for ferropericlase than for bridgmanite. The large rheological contrast between these phases will promote shear localization in the lower mantle. Interestingly, substantial grain-growth was observed only in the outer regions of the sample possibly caused by strain-induced grain coarsening. If confirmed this would imply the operation of superplastic deformation under these conditions. Deformation-induced grain-growth and strain partitioning will compete in controlling the nature of shear localization.",

            "abstract": "An oriented clast of basaltic andesite collected from the B horizon of a soil developed in a late Quaternary volcanoclastic debris flow on the eastern, windward side of Basse Terre Island, Guadeloupe exhibits weathering patterns like that observed in many clasts from tropical settings. The sample consists of unweathered core material overlain by a ~19 mm thick weathering rind and a narrow ≤ 2mm thick indurated horizon separating the outer portion of the rind from the overlying >10mm of soil matrix material. Elemental variations are constrained by a seven point bulk ICP-AES vertical transect extending from the core, across the rind and ~15 mm into the overlying soil matix and six parallel electron microprobe transections. The porous-hydrated fraction increases from the core to the rind to the surrounding soil from 7±4% to 45±18% to 60±15%, respectively. Like the well-studied clast from the nearby Bras David watershed (Sak et al., 2010) the isovolumetric transformation from core to rind material is marked by a narrow (< 1500 mm) reaction front and elemental depletion. The hierarchy of elemental loss across the core-rind boundary as characterized by open system mass balances varies in order Ca≈Na>Ba>K≈Mn>Mg>Si>Al≈P>Fe»Ti, consistent with the relative reactivity of phases in the clast from plagioclasepyroxeneglass>apatite>ilmenite. Unlike previously studied clasts, the preservation of the rind-soil interface permits characterization of weathering reactions between the weathering clast and surrounding soil matrix. The abrupt (<1000 μm wide) reaction front at the rind-soil interface is marked by the enrichment of Mn, Ba, Al, Mg and K. The enrichment trends may result from soil waters percolating through atmospherically depositioned dust within the upper few meters of the soil profile, as documented in a deep soil profile in the Bras David watershed. The lack of an enrichment signal within the weathering rind suggests that weathering processes active within clasts are distinct from surrounding soil formation processes.",

            "abstract": "The widely-accepted NEO risk assessments published in the 1990s concluded that the largest asteroids (> 1 km) dominated the hazard. Even though large NEOs represent only a tiny fraction of the population because of a power-law size distribution, the potential for global catastrophe means that the contribution from these low-probability, high-consequence events is large. This conclusion led to the Spaceguard survey, which has now catalogued about 90% of these objects, none of which is on a collision course. The survey has reduced the assessed risk from this size range by more than an order of magnitude because completion is highest for the largest and most dangerous. The relative risk from objects tens of meters in diameter is therefore increasing.\nThe absolute assessed risk from airbursts caused by objects of this size is also higher for two reasons. First, they may be more frequent than previously thought because of an underestimated population. Second, they are significantly more damaging than assumed in the original assessment because (in most cases) they more efficiently couple energy to the surface than nuclear explosions. Last year’s half-megaton airburst over Chelyabinsk, Russia, appears to challenge the notion that such events are extremely rare—especially when also considering the 1908 Tunguska event along with decades of infrasound bolide data showing higher-than-expected numbers of large airbursts.\nWe will present a new analysis of the risk based on updated estimates for the population of undiscovered NEOs, taking into account the enhanced damage potential of collisional airbursts. Merging the survey population estimates with the bolide frequency estimates suggests a population of tens-of-meters sized bodies that may be a factor of three or so greater than estimated from surveys alone. Uncertainty in the population of airburst-class NEOs remains quite large, and can only be unambiguously reduced by expanded surveys focused on objects in the tens-of-meters size range.\nSandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energy under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

            "abstract": "Floodplain management is a complex portfolio problem that can be analyzed from an integrated perspective incorporating traditionally structural and nonstructural options. One method to identify effective strategies for preparing, responding to, and recovering from floods is to optimize for a portfolio of temporary (emergency) and permanent floodplain management options. A risk-based optimization approach to this problem assigns probabilities to specific flood events and calculates the associated expected damages. This approach is currently limited by: (1) the assumption of perfect flood forecast information, i.e. implementing temporary management activities according to the actual flood event may differ from optimizing based on forecasted information and (2) the inability to assess system resilience across a range of possible future events (risk-centric approach). Resilience is defined here as the ability of a system to absorb and recover from a severe disturbance or extreme event. In our analysis, resilience is a system property that requires integration of physical, social, and information domains. This work employs a 3-stage linear program to identify the optimal mix of floodplain management options using conditional probabilities to represent perfect and imperfect flood stages (forecast vs. actual events). We assess the value of information in terms of minimizing damage costs for two theoretical cases – urban and rural systems. We use portfolio analysis to explore how the set of optimal management options differs depending on whether the goal is for the system to be risk-adverse to a specified event or resilient over a range of events.",

Here we present a fully nonlinear inverse method to extract the rock uplift history of the Central Andean Plateau from the Cotahuasi River and its tributaries. Our approach is based on an analytical solution to the stream power model that relates elevation to rock uplift history. We use a Bayesian inverse method, which allows us to quantify the complete posterior probability distribution of model parameters. However, an “erosional efficiency” defines the landscape response time, which must be determined using independent data. Therefore, we use thermochronometric data from the Cotahuasi Canyon, which record rapid fluvial incision at approximately 13-10 Ma, to calibrate our results and infer a rock uplift history for the north Central Andean Plateau. We find that rock uplift occurred between 25 and 10 Ma at rates as high as 0.25 km/Ma. The rock uplift rates inferred during this time are not as high as is predicted if the Central Andean Plateau grew in response to loss of unstable lithospheric mantle. Therefore, our results are more consistent with models that require gradual uplift of the Central Andean Plateau.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of lithosphere necking is a fundamental parameter controlling the structural architecture and thermal state of rifted margins. Despite a large number of analogue and numerical modelling studies on lithosphere extension are available in the literature, a quantitative experimental description of lithosphere necking evolution is still lacking. Extensional strain rate and thermal layering of the lithosphere exert a fundamental control on necking shape and evolution. We focused our experimental work on the former parameter and simulated the progression of lithosphere thinning and necking during asymmetric orthogonal rifting at different plate divergence rates. Our models involve a 4-layer mechanical continental lithosphere, which rests on a glucose syrup asthenosphere. Both the topography and the base of the lithosphere were monitored by time-lapse laser scanning. This technical approach allowed us to quantify the evolution in space and time of the thinning factors for the crust, mantle, and lithosphere as a whole. Laser-scanning monitoring provided also a detailed picture of the evolving neck shape, which shows a strong dependency on the strain-rate. At low strain-rates, necking is “boxed” with steep flanks and a flat-lying roof, and few deep basins develop at surface. At high strain-rates, more distributed thinning occurs and isolates portions of less deformed mantle. More distributed deformation affects the model topography. Despite large differences in shape, the aspect ratio (amplitude/wavelength) of the cross-sectional neck shapes converges towards very similar values at the end of the experiments.\nThe significant differences and evolutionary pathways produced by the plate divergence rate on the lithosphere necking profile, suggest that this parameter exert a fundamental control on localization vs. distribution of deformation in the crust as in the whole mechanical lithosphere. Furthermore, it can exert a fundamental control on the time and space distribution of heat flow during rifting. Following up on this we can speculate on the location and timing of synrift magmatism, which is expected to be preferentially produced on one shoulder for slow plate divergence rates, and more widely distributed and delayed at fast divergence rates.",

The TCAT approach provides advantages that include a firm connection between the microscale, or pore scale, and the macroscale; a thermodynamically consistent basis; explicit inclusion of factors such as interfacial areas, contact angles, interfacial tension, and curvatures; and dynamics of interface movement and relaxation to an equilibrium state. In order to render the TCAT model solvable, certain closure relations are needed to relate fluid pressure, interfacial areas, curvatures, and relaxation rates. In this work, we formulate and solve a TCAT-based two-fluid-phase flow model. We detail the formulation of the model, which is a specific instance from a hierarchy of two-fluid-phase flow models that emerge from the theory. We show the closure problem that must be solved. Using recent results from high-resolution microscale simulations, we advance a set of closure relations that produce a closed model. Lastly, we use locally conservative spatial discretization and higher order temporal discretization methods to approximate the solution to this new model and compare the solution to the traditional model.",

Improving our understanding of the sources and fate of DOM at varying spatial and temporal patterns is crucial for land management decisions.

In the Willamette River Basin (WRB), which is home to Oregon’s major cities including Portland and Salem, forested headwaters transition to agricultural and urban land. The climate of WRB has a distinctive seasonal pattern with dry warm summers and wet winters driven by winter precipitation and snowmelt runoff between November and March. This study examined DOM fluorescence characteristic in stream water from 21 locations collected monthly and 16 locations collected seasonally to identify the sources and fate of DOM in the upper WRB in contrasting land uses.\nDOC and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations increased as the flow rate increased during winter precipitation at all sites. This indicates that increased flow rate increased the connectivity between land and nearby water bodies. DOM fluorescent properties varied among land use types. During the first precipitation event after a long dry summer, a microbial DOM signature in agricultural areas increased along with nitrate concentrations. This may be because accumulated nutrients on land during the dry season flowed to nearby streams during the first rain event and promoted microbial growth in the streams. During the month of the highest flow rate in 2014, sampling sites near forest showed evidence of a greater terrestrial DOM signature compared to its signature during the dry season. This indicates fluorescent DOM characteristics in streams vary as the flow connectivity changes even within the same land type.",

            "abstract": "Where will the food for the 9 billion people we expect on Earth by 2050 come from? The answer to this question depends on where the water and the energy for agriculture will come from. This assumes of course, that our primary food source will continue to be based on production on land, and that irrigation and the use of fertilizers to improve production are needed to address climate shocks and deteriorating soil health. Given this, establishing an economically, environmentally and physically feasible pathway to achieve water, energy and food security in the face of a changing climate is crucial to planetary well-being. A central hypothesis of the proposed paper is that innovation towards agricultural sustainability in countries such as India and China, that have large populations relative to their water, energy and arable land endowment, and yet have opportunity for improvement in productivity metrics such as crop yield per unit water or energy use, can show us the way to achieve global water-food-energy sustainability. These countries experience a monsoonal climate, which has a high frequency of climate extremes (more floods and droughts, and a short rainy season) relative to the developed countries in temperate climates. Global climate change projections indicate that the frequency and severity of extremes may pose a challenge in the future. Thus, strategies that are resilient to such extremes in monsoonal climates may be of global value in a warmer, more variable world. Much of the future population growth is expected to occur in Africa, S. America and S. Asia. Targeting these regions for higher productivity and resilience is consequently important from a national security perspective as well. Through this paper, we propose to (a) layout in detail, the challenges faced by the water, energy and food sectors in emerging countries, with specific focus on India and China and (b) provide the scientific background for an integrated systems analytic approach to formulate solutions at varying scales that can be employed globally. Such coordinated analyses is important for an examination of the future water sustainability in the face of changing climate, agricultural trends, environmental impacts and new energy choices.",

            "abstract": "Discrete element method (DEM) is a useful technique in dealing with discontinuum. By calculating the behavior of the particle system, DEM can simulate behavior of the object such as faulting and creeping. On the other hand, topography and anisotropy adaptation, which can be challenging for numerical algorithms, is of great significance in seismic wave modeling. During our research on DEM, we discovered that due to its special scheme of discretization, DEM is a highly flexible numerical method which can realize this adaptation. In our study, we conduct a proper modification to traditional discrete element method and apply this modified DEM to elastic seismic wave modeling. The accuracy of this numerical method is proven by comparing the displacement field obtained by our DEM and that from a finite difference method. Besides, we manage to develop a theory which enables us to simulate wave propagation in transverse isotropy (TI) media using our DEM. In addition, a simple mechanism is also established, making the modified DEM much more convenient to adapt complex free surface topography than other numerical methods, such as finite difference. Therefore, our research provides a new numerical method in seismic wave modeling that can handle both anisotropy and irregular topography.",

            "abstract": "Defining zones of high and low hydraulic conductivity within aquifers is vital to hydrogeologic research and groundwater management. Carbonate aquifers are particularly difficult to characterize due to dissolution and dolomitization. We investigated a new imaging technique for aquifer characterization that uses cross-correlation of ambient seismic noise to determine seismic velocity structure. Differences in densities between confining units and high permeability flow zones can produce distinct seismic velocities in the correlated signals. We deployed an array of 9 short period geophones from 11/2013 to 3/2014 in Indian Lake State Forest, Florida, to determine if the high frequency diffusive seismic wavefield can be used for imaging hydrostratigraphy. Here, a thin surficial layer of siliciclastic deposits overlie a ~ 0.6 km sequence of Cenozoic limestone and dolomite units that comprise the Floridan Aquifer System (FAS). A low permeability dolomite unit vertically divides the FAS throughout most of Florida. Deep boreholes surrounding the site constrain hydrostratigraphy, however the horizontal continuity of the middle dolomite unit as well as its effectiveness as a confining unit in the study area are not well known. The stations were spaced at distances ranging from 0.18 to 2.6 km, and yielded 72 cross-correlation Green’s functions for Rayleigh wave propagation at frequencies between 0.2 and 40 Hz, with dominant peaks around 0.8 Hz, 3 Hz and 13 Hz. Local vehicle traffic did interfere to a degree with the correlation of the diffuse waves, but was minimized by using only nighttime data. At the lowest frequencies (greatest depths) investigated, velocities increase with depth; however, correlations become less coherent at higher frequencies, perhaps due to shallow complex scattering. Comparison of cross-correlations for all station pairs also indicates spatial variations in velocity. Thus, the method shows promise for characterization of the heterogeneity of the Floridan Aquifer System.",

            "abstract": "High-frequency sea level oscillations along the United States East Coast have been linked to atmospheric pressure disturbances observed during large storm events. These oscillations have periods similar to tsunami events generated by earthquakes and submarine landslides, but are created by moving surface pressure anomalies within storm systems such as mesoscale convective systems or mid-latitude cyclones. Meteotsunamis form as in-situ waves, directly underneath a moving surface pressure anomaly. As the pressure disturbances move off the east coast of North America and over the continental shelf in the Atlantic Ocean, Proudman resonance, which is known to enhance the amplitude of the meteotsunami, may occur when the propagation speed of the pressure disturbance is equal to that of the shallow water wave speed. At the continental shelf break, some of the meteotsunami waves are reflected back towards the coast. The events we studied date from 2007 to 2014, most of which were identified using an atmospheric pressure anomaly detection method applied to atmospheric data from two National Data Buoy Center stations: Cape May, New Jersey and Newport, Rhode Island. The coastal tidal records used to observe the meteotsunami amplitudes include Montauk, New York; Atlantic City, New Jersey; and Duck, North Carolina. On average, meteotsunamis ranging from 0.1m to 1m in amplitude occurred roughly twice per month, with meteotsunamis larger than 0.4m occurring approximately 4 times per year, a rate much higher than previously reported. For each event, the amplitude of the recorded pressure disturbance was compared to the meteotsunami amplitude, while radar and bathymetry data were analyzed to observe the influence of Proudman resonance on the reflected meteotsunami waves. In-situ meteotsunami amplitudes showed a direct correlation with the amplitude of pressure disturbances. Meteotsunamis reflected off the continental shelf break were generally higher in amplitude when the average storm speed was closer to that of the shallow water wave speed, which suggests that Proudman resonance has a significant influence on meteotsunami amplitude over the continental shelf. Through the application of these findings the frequency and severity of future meteotsunamis can be better predicted along the east coast of the United States.",

Two Parsivel disdrometers were used to collect raindrop sizes during the storm events: one instrument is collocated with one of the towers, while the second is placed about 1 mile to the East of the towers. Direct measurements of rain DSDs were taken between June 1 and September 30, 2014.\nThe goal of this study is to identify significant temporal variations of the estimated DSDs gamma parameters and rainfall rates before and after the lightning flash when using disdrometer data. The modified maximum likelihood (ML) method developed at SDSM&T is applied to determine such parameters of the fitted gamma functions. A previous study (Moore et al, 1964) reported “the gush of rain at the ground” following cloud-to-ground lightning discharge nearby based on radar and raingauge observations. During the summer 2014, we collected not only the radar observations and lightning data, but also the disdrometer and raingauge readings. Preliminary results of these findings are presented.",

We found a prevailing increase in daily precipitation intensity associated with increasing air temperature at an inter-decadal time scale for all seasons, including summer when precipitation total decreases. These relationships are independent of the impacts of Arctic Oscillation over the region.

An ideal microphysical parameterization should be “unified” in the sense of being suitable across MBL cloud regimes that include stratocumulus, cumulus rising into stratocumulus, and shallow trade cumulus. The recent parameterization of Kogan (2013, “K2013”) was formulated for shallow cumulus but has been shown in a large-eddy simulation environment to work quite well for stratocumulus as well. We report on our efforts to implement and test this parameterization into a regional forecast model (NRL COAMPS). Results from K2013 and KK2000 are compared with the operational Kessler parameterization for a 5-day period of the VOCALS–REx field campaign, which took place over the southeast Pacific. We focus on both the relative performance of the three parameterizations and also on how they compare to the VOCALS–REx observations from the NOAA R/V Ronald H.

In coastal California’s Mediterranean climate, fog is the predominant precipitation source during the summer months. Here we report initial results of a study utilizing stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of water to investigate the role of fog in the hydrology of two ecosystems in Sonoma County, CA. The two study sites were the Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML) at 13 m elevation at the coast, and the Pepperwood Preserve at 375 m elevation in the North Coast Range, 44 km inland to the northeast. During a 1-week period in July 2014, fog samples were collected at 30-minute intervals using small active-strand cloudwater collectors (mini-CASCCs) and automated precipitation samplers. Four overnight fog events were collected at the Pepperwood site, while at the BML site, the liquid water content of the fog was very low, and only one cumulative sample was obtained. Groundwater samples from five wells and seven springs, and surface water samples from two streams were collected in and around the Pepperwood Preserve and on Bodega Head near BML. Droplet size distribution of the fog at BML was monitored, and at both sites, air temperature was measured at 10-minute intervals to assess variation in the δ 18O and δ 2H values of fog related to temperature. Relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction were obtained from weather stations at each site. Previous work in this area (Coplen et al., in prep) documented the isotopic signatures of winter precipitation from frontal systems and landfalling Pacific storms. These results will be combined with the isotopic signature of summer fog water to determine whether fog contributes to shallow groundwater recharge or streamflow at the two sites.",

            "abstract": "The frictional coefficient of fractures, a fundamental parameter needed to analyze a variety of geomechanical problems for microseismicity, is normally determined from laboratory shear tests. However, recovered rock cores are rarely available because of difficulties and high cost in getting undisturbed core samples. In that case, the frictional coefficient should be either assumed or estimated indirectly. We investigate the frictional property of fractures of various sandstones in laboratory tests and attempt to correlate that with other properties measureable relatively readily even without cores. We use various sandstones obtained from different depths of a 1 km deep borehole drilled for coal bed methane development in a Paleozoic sedimentary basin, South Korea. The sandstones have various physical properties (e.g. P-wave velocity (VP) of 2253-5038 m/s) and chemical compositions in terms of clay content (5-31%). We conduct direct shear tests in an artificial saw-cut fracture in the sandstones and determined frictional coefficients in a range of 0.36-0.57. The frictional coefficients have an inverse-linear correlation with clay contents measured from XRD analysis. These results are also quite consistent with those from previous clay gouge experiments (Takahashi et al., 2007; Tembe et al., 2010; Kohli & Zoback, 2013). They also have a linear correlation with VP. Our study demonstrates that frictional coefficients can be estimated empirically from such properties. To check feasibility of such an approach, we apply the obtained empirical relation to the borehole where cores were recovered. The clay contents in sandstone formations are estimated from the borehole gamma ray log calibrated using the XRD clay content data. Clay content estimated from gamma ray varies significantly with depth in a range of 0-45%. This range of clay content corresponds to frictional coefficients of 0.25-0.58. Comparison between estimated and measured frictional coefficients shows a reasonable (but quite scattered within ±20%) agreement. Estimation of frictional coefficients is further constrained using a dual variable regression analysis of both clay content and VP of the rocks (within ±10%). We believe that calibration of frictional coefficient-properties relation is necessary to apply this approach to other regions.",

            "abstract": "The skill of the global climate models (GCMs) to realistically simulate theMonsoon Intraseasonal Oscillations (MISOs) is related to the sensitivity of their convective parameterization schemes. Here, we show that by coupling a simple multicloud parameterization to a coarse resolution aquaplanet GCM,realistic MISOs can be simulated. We conduct three di fferent simulations with a fi xed non-homogeneous Sea-Surface Temperature (SST) mimicking the Indian Ocean/Western Paci c warm pool centered at the three latitudes 5\u000e°N,10\u000e°N and 15\u000e°N, respectively, to replicate the seasonal migration of the Tropical Convergence Zone (TCZ). This results in the generation of mean circulation resembling the monsoonal flow pattern in boreal summer. Successionof eastward propagating Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) disturbances with phase speed, amplitude and structure similar to summer MJOs are simulated when the WP is at 5\u000e°N. When the WP is located over 10\u000e°N, northward and eastward propagating MISOs are simulated. This case captures the meridional seesaw of convection between continental and oceanic TCZ observed during boreal summer over south Asia. Westward propagating Rossby-wave like disturbances are simulated when the WP is over 15\u000e°N congruous with the synoptic disturbances seen over the monsoon trough. The initiation of intraseasonal oscillations in the model can occur internally through organization of convective events above the WP associated with internal dynamics.",

            "abstract": "During the New Horizons flyby of the Pluto system on July 14, 2015 a number of observations will be made to determine the structure, composition, and variability of Pluto’s atmosphere. A key observation of this type is the Alice solar occultation, which will measure the full disk ultraviolet (52-187 nm) spectral flux from the Sun through ingress and egress behind Pluto, about one hour after closest approach. This observation will be used to determine the temperature and vertical density profiles of N2, CH4, and various minor species above two regions of very different surface albedo. Nearly simultaneous Earth ingress and egress occultations observed in X-band uplink will provide profiles of temperature and pressure in Pluto’s lower atmosphere, and electron densities in the ionosphere. Wave structures in both the solar and radio occultation data will provide constraints on atmospheric dynamics. In order to interpret and understand these data sets, we have modified a 1-D Titan photochemical model to Pluto, for the epoch of the New Horizons flyby. The model uses a similar, but updated reaction list to that of Krasnopolsky and Cruikshank [1999] and Wong et al. [2014], and adopts the results of Zhu et al. [2014] for the background atmosphere.

Tangential RFs show waveform variations in timing and polarity, both in the Moho and the slab Ps phases in function of its backazimuth; also, radial RFs show arrivals timing variation; all of which suggests a non-homogeneous horizontal layer medium. Using a particle motion analysis and a cross-correlation procedure, we are able to quantify the shear wave splitting in the continental crust, the subducted oceanic crust and the mantle below each station of the array in terms of a time delay, and a fast azimuth direction. From these variations, we distinguish between three major regions: 1) dipping subducted slab, 2) horizontal subducted slab, 3) absence of subducted slab. Results for region 1 are consistent with the geometry of the Cocos plate previously determined by other studies, showing a minimum energy content in the tangential RFs for the NE-SW geographic quadrants. In region 2, we identify a strong azimuthal dependence with a variable periodicity of 180° and 360° as well as the existence of “split” Ps phases in our data, possibly related to the presence of fluids and the ultra low velocity layer (ULVL) localized between the continental and oceanic crust. We compare these results with previous silent earthquakes (SSE) and non-volcanic tremors (NVT) studies in the area.",

            "abstract": "Forests of the western United States are in a period of rapid change, due in part to climate driven changes in life history processes of trees such as growth, establishment, and mortality. These changes in forest condition are of particular concern in the American Southwest where climate conditions are projected to become increasingly hot and dry throughout the next century. While lower elevation trees of the American Southwest are already experiencing decreased radial growth in response to moisture stress, the response of high elevation trees to future climate is highly uncertain. Here we use dendro-climatological techniques to explore the climate-mediated changes in radial tree growth over time in the high elevation forests of southwestern Colorado by sampling 450 Engelmann Spruce and 350 Subalpine Fir from 22 sites across varying aspect, elevation, slope and soil type. Our results indicate variable and frequently opposing growth responses of individuals of the same species to climate variables; 52% of Engelmann Spruce sampled (233 individuals) exhibited positive growth responses to warm summer monthly mean temperatures with the remaining 48% exhibiting negative growth response to warm summer temperatures. We found similarly opposing results for growth response to monthly precipitation and vapor pressure deficit. In this presentation we explore the physiological factors responsible for variable climate-growth relationships within these species. Our results suggest a complex response of high elevation forest growth to climate change, and indicate that efforts to constrain future growth in this region will be contingent on both climatic and local physiographic factors.",

            "abstract": "Climate change may affect ecologically relevant aspects of the streamflow regime. We used TOPNET, a physically based semi-distributed hydrologic model, to model 16 ecologically important aspects of the flow regime at eight watersheds that represented the range of streamflow regimes within the conterminous USA. The physical-based modeling was conducted to determine if previously developed statistical models could be used to predict shifts in flow regimes associated with climate change (stationarity is dead). TOPNET inputs were derived from Daymet climate data, SSURGO soil data, and National Land Cover (NLCD) data. USGS streamflow data were used to calibrate and validate each model for a separate period of record. The models were then driven by downscaled future climate data to project near (2046-65) and far (2076-95) future changes in the 16 streamflow regime variables. For most of the watersheds, the model performed well in calibration and validation and streamflow regime variables derived from calibrated flow compared well with those from the observed flow. A number of flow regime variables quantified magnitude aspects of the streamflow regime, and magnitude tended to increase with future climate change. Watersheds that exhibited increases in precipitation also exhibited increases in the number of high-flow events. We also found changes in timing quantified by the time of the water year by which 50% of the total flow has occurred. Snow-fed streams had earlier timing, whereas rainfall-driven systems had little change of time of 50% flow. These predictions of changes in streamflow regime variables due to climate change help understand how climate change may impact stream flows and hence stream ecosystems. Such considerations are important for water management and mitigation of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems .",

            "abstract": "Natural faults separate rocks with contrasting (and heterogeneous) material properties, and it is still unclear how these heterogeneities affect earthquake nucleation and rupture. Both laboratory studies and dynamic rupture simulations on a bimaterial fault interface show that material contrast can cause rupture to take a \"preferred\" direction, defined by propagation in the direction of particle motion of the side of the fault with slower shear wave velocity. Predicted asymmetries are model dependent, but have included partially or strictly unilateral rupture, asymmetric off-fault damage, and asymmetric aftershock distributions. The possibility that rupture direction may be to some extent predictable is of interest to seismic hazard analysis because ground motion intensity and the occurrence of triggered seismicity are both enhanced in the forward direction of rupture.\nMuch of the understanding of the bimaterial effect is based on single-event dynamic rupture simulations triggered by artificially perturbing some assumed initial stress state. In order to include nucleation effects in bimaterial rupture simulations, we have developed a computational method for studying nucleation and propagation of earthquakes over multiple event cycles, on faults separating heterogeneous materials. As a first step we consider the bimaterial problem on planar, vertical strike slip fault governed by rate-and-state friction with a strong rate-weakening response. The system is loaded at the remote boundaries at a slow plate rate and quasi-dynamic events nucleate spontaneously on the fault. We find that the nucleation site migrates in the preferred direction and rupture propagates with asymmetric properties, the strength of which increases with greater material mismatch. We are currently studying the long term behavior of the earthquake cycle and under what conditions rupture in the non-preferred direction (occasionally observed on natural faults) is possible.",

This work studies the operation of an intermediate temperature steam electrolyzer (ITSE) and its incorporation into hybrid power plants that include biomass combustion and photovoltaic panels (PV). The plants generate both electricity and hydrogen.\nThe reference –biomass– power plant and four variations of a hybrid biomass-PV incorporating the reference biomass plant and the ITSE are simulated and evaluated using exergetic analysis. The variations of the hybrid power plants are associated with (1) the air recirculation from the electrolyzer to the biomass power plant, (2) the elimination of the sweep gas of the electrolyzer, (3) the replacement of two electric heaters with gas/gas heat exchangers, and (4) the replacement two heat exchangers of the reference electrolyzer unit with one heat exchanger that uses steam from the biomass power plant. In all cases, 60% of the electricity required in the electrolyzer is covered by the biomass plant and 40% by the photovoltaic panels.\nWhen comparing the hybrid plants with the reference biomass power plant that has identical operation and structure as that incorporated in the hybrid plants, we observe an efficiency decrease that varies depending on the scenario. The efficiency decrease stems mainly from the low effectiveness of the photovoltaic panels (14.4%). When comparing the hybrid scenarios, we see that the elimination of the sweep gas decreases the power consumption due to the elimination of the compressor used to cover the pressure losses of the filter, the heat exchangers and the electrolyzer. Nevertheless, if the sweep gas is used to preheat the air entering the boiler of the biomass power plant, the efficiency of the plant increases. When replacing the electric heaters with gas-gas heat exchangers, the efficiency of the plant increases, although the higher pressure losses of the flue-gas path increase the requirements of the air compressor. Finally, replacing the two heat exchangers of the electrolyzer unit with one that uses extracted steam from the biomass power plant can lead to an overall decrease in the operating and investment costs of the plant.",

            "abstract": "The California Coastal Basin (CCB) aquifers are representative of many coastal aquifers that are vulnerable to nonpoint-source (NPS) contamination from intense agriculture and increased urbanization combined with historical groundwater use and overdraft conditions. Overdraft has led to seawater intrusion along parts of the central California coast, which negatively affects food production because of high salinity concentrations in groundwater used for irrigation. Recent drought conditions in California have led to an increased need to further understand freshwater sustainability and resilience within the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus. Assessing the vulnerability of NPS contamination in groundwater provides valuable information for optimal resource management and policy. Vulnerability models of nitrate contamination in the CCB were developed as one of many indicators to evaluate risk in terms of susceptibility of the physical environment at local and regional scales. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed to predict the probability of NPS nitrate contamination in recently recharged groundwater and to identify significant explanatory variables as controlling factors in the CCB. Different factors were found to be significant in the sub-regions of the CCB and issues of scale are important. For example, land use is scale dependent because of the difference in land management practices between the CCB sub-regions. However, dissolved oxygen concentrations in groundwater, farm fertilizer, and soil thickness are scale invariant because they are significant both regionally and sub-regionally. Thus, the vulnerability models for the CCB show that different explanatory variables are scale invariant. This finding has important implications for accurately quantifying linkages between vulnerability and consequences within the WEF nexus, including inherent tradeoffs in water and food production in California and associated impacts on the local and regional economy, governance, environment, and society at multiple scales.",

            "abstract": "Static stress transfer from an earthquake to a magma reservoir could promote volcanic eruption. Here we examine effects of four large historical earthquakes in Northern Rockies, two mainshocks (Mb 6.3 and Mb 7.0) and the largest aftershock (Mb 6.5) of the 1959 Hebgen Lake sequence, and the 1983 Borah Peak (MW 6.9), on the Yellowstone volcanic system. The two mainshocks of the 1959 Hebgen Lake sequence, five seconds apart from each other, occurred 50 km northwest of the center of the youngest caldera of Yellowstone at 10-15 km depths and possibly reactivated one or more E-W striking Laramide thrust faults in a dextral normal sense. The largest aftershock of the sequence is a normal faulting event that occurred 30 km north of the center of the caldera at 10 km depth. The 1983 Borah Peak earthquake ruptured a SE striking fault plane in a normal sense at 13.7 km depth 280 km east of the Yellowstone caldera. We model normal stress change imparted on the Yellowstone magma reservoir due to each earthquake to determine whether these mechanisms enhanced or inhibited the potential for eruption. An elastic dislocation model is used for calculation. In our model, the magma reservoir is approximated as a 60 km long, NE-SW striking vertical plane extending from 4 km to 14 km depths, based on a recent tomographic model. Our results show that the first mainshock of the Hebgen sequence had virtually no effect on the magma reservoir, and the second mainshock decreased the normal stress on the center of the model reservoir by ~0.20 bar (0.02 MPa). The aftershock, on the other hand, increased the normal stress on the center of the magma reservoir by ~0.19 bar, which could clamp the reservoir. The effect of the 1983 Borah Peak event did not reach the Yellowstone area. We also simulate events as large as the 1983 Borah Peak in each seismic zone in Northern Rockies with mechanisms typical to each zone, determined by known active faults and past earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Scientific discoveries are often preceded by missteps that lengthen the road to discovery. Here I recount missteps on my journey that found a strong link between high radium concentrations in coastal waters and the discharge of submarine groundwater (SGD). In 1968 Wally Broecker suggested to me that groundwater could be a source of Ra to the ocean. That summer Wally measured Ra in wells on Martha’s Vineyard; I measured wells on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Neither of us found significant Ra concentrations; all of the water we measured was fresh. In 1977 Telu Li and others reported the desorption of Ra from riverine particles entering the ocean. I did not think to translate this observation to the release of Ra as salt water intruded into coastal aquifers; instead when Bob Elsinger and I could not balance the Ra budget for the Pee Dee River estuary, we called on upstream migration of the salt wedge during low river flow to release Ra from sediments. Similar budget problems in the Chesapeake Bay led me to propose cliff erosion as a source of Ra. JoLynn Carroll and I used the erosion mechanism to explain Ra budget problems at the mouth of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Rivers. Working with Tom Church, Marsha Bollinger measured significant activities of Ra in groundwater entering Canary Creek, DE. However, we did not consider groundwater a significant source of Ra to Delaware Bay. In 1993, after Marsha and I developed a robust data set for North Inlet, SC, I realized the upstream migration and erosion mechanisms were not adequate. Fortunately Rama, one of my post-doc advisors, was visiting my lab. I presented him with the dilemma of excess 226Ra fluxes. After digesting the data for a few days, he stated: “It must be groundwater”. We confirmed this by measuring salty groundwater samples from North Inlet that were loaded with 226Ra. Extending this concept to the coastal ocean was simple. We had recently completed a cruise to use Ra isotopes to study mixing rates and water ages. Upon inspection I found these coastal waters contained high 226Ra activities that could not be explained by riverine or sedimentary inputs. Taking the line from Rama, I proposed that brackish groundwater must be the answer. Tom Church reviewed the paper for Nature and wrote a news article, “An underground route for the water cycle”. It tool 25 years, but we finally completed the journey.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the meltwater discharge from retreating glaciers, and understanding the ocean processes that influence that discharge is a key step to improve projections of sea level rise. Here, oceanographic observations collected near Jorge Montt, a rapidly retreating glacier in the Southern Patagonian Ice field, are used to (i) quantify the seasonal changes in the freshwater discharge from the glacier and the relative contribution of meltwater and runoff to it; (ii) to understand the relative role that un- or underresolved circulation processes, including tides, have on estimates of the freshwater discharge components; and (iii) to characterize the mixing processes which help explain the spatial distribution of the freshwater discharge components along the fjord. In order to quantify the freshwater discharge from the glacier, we conducted tidally-resolving, cross-channel surveys of current velocity and hydrographic profiles during summer 2013 and winter 2014. The current velocity observations were collected using a dual Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler system designed to resolve, simultaneously, the surface fresh layer and the deep, warm ocean inflow. Concurrent microstructure profiles were collected during the surveys to characterize the intensity and spatial structure of the mixing in the fjord. Additionally, along-shelf fjord surveys of water properties were conducted to provide context for the cross-channel surveys. In the context of recent idealized theoretical and numerical model work, the results highlight the importance of including ambient stratification as well the far field temperature and subsurface runoff as key parameters to understand the structure and magnitude of the freshwater outflow. They also show that freshwater (and therefore, meltwater) discharge estimates can have large biases or errors when using observations that are not tidally-resolving or that exclude the often relatively thin, fresh surface layer present in these systems.",

            "abstract": "We present a timing analysis of the Sun with the NuSTAR hard X-ray (HXR) telescope, searching for transient brightenings / nanoflares in the quiet Sun and active regions. A substantial amount of flare energy goes into accelerating electrons. HXR observations are a crucial tool for understanding this non-thermal emission and the energy release in flares. RHESSI is able to study this emission over many orders of magnitude (active region flares from X-class to A-class microflares), but it cannot detect the emission from smaller events. Such “nanoflares” have been postulated as a possible source of coronal heating and their existence and relationship to larger flares is still uncertain. In order to detect these events in HXRs, instruments more sensitive than RHESSI are required. Launched in 2012, the astrophysics mission NuSTAR uses focusing optics to directly image X-rays between ~2-80 keV. Although not optimized for solar observations, NuSTAR’s highly sensitive imaging spectroscopy will be used to search for the faintest X-ray emission from the Sun. These solar observations will begin in September 2014; here we present the first results of our search for transient brightenings that could relate to nanoflares.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake sequencing studies allow us to investigate empirical relationships among spatio-temporal parameters describing the complexity of earthquake properties. We have recently studied the relevance of Markov chain models to draw information from global earthquake catalogues. In these studies, we have considered directed graphs as graph theoretic representation of the Markov chain model, and their properties. Here, we look at earthquake sequencing itself as a directed graph. In general, earthquakes are occurrences resulting from significant stress-interactions among faults. As a result, stress-field fluctuations evolve continuously. We propose that they are akin to the dynamics of the collective behaviour of weakly-coupled non-linear oscillators. Since mapping of global stress-field fluctuations in real time at all scales is an impossible task, we consider an earthquake zone as a proxy for a collection of weakly-coupled oscillators the dynamics of which would befit the ubiquitous Kuramoto model. In the present work, we apply the Kuramoto model to understand the non-linear dynamics on a directed graph of a sequence of earthquakes. For directed graphs with certain properties, the Kuramoto model yields synchronization and inclusion of non-local effects evokes the occurrence of chimera states or the co-existence of synchronous and asynchronous behaviour of oscillators. In this presentation, we show how we build the model for both synthetic networks honouring different orders and average degrees, differing asymmetries and network heterogeneity and directed graphs derived from global seismicity data. Then, we present conditions under which chimera states could occur and subsequently, point out the role of Kuramoto model in understanding the evolution of synchronous and asynchronous regions. We interpret our results using spectral properties of directed graphs.",

Meteorological data provided by the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset was dynamically downscaled to 3km horizontal resolution using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Wildfire fuel parameters within this dataset include Live Fuel Moisture (LFM), Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), Energy Release Component (ERC), and both the ten hour and one hundred hour dead fuel moisture time-lags (F10 and F100 respectfully). NDVI and LFM were calculated using statistical models with predictors derived from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS). Dead fuel moistures were calculated using the Nelson Dead Fuel Moisture model forced by the WRF output with an appropriate initial spin-up period for longer time-lag fuels. ERC was calculated using the National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) algorithm with dead fuel moisture input supplied from the Nelson model, and meteorology from WRF. This historical dataset was used to guide and develop the multiple fuel and weather inputs into the Santa Ana Wildfire Threat index (SAWT), which is now operational. Additionally, current SAWT forecasts can now be placed into historical perspective with the use of this dataset.

            "abstract": "We have installed short period network in order to monitor the crustal seismicity in the Tarapacá region. The main task is to try to understand the stress transference from the interplate contact to the upper crustal. The network consisted in a total of 21 short period stations, which were installed in the Coastal Cordillera (around Salar Grande) and the Precordillera (around Quebrada Blanca). The processing of the records in this network permitted the analysis of ~5000 events occurred during 2005-2012, each were localized using the NonLinLoc software. A part of this catalog, specifically the data collected during 2010, were processed in order to obtain some parameters associated to the stress as stress tensor, b-value and the maximum horizontal stress (σHMAX). The results of the σHMAX and the stress tensor show that the direction of shortening in the upper crust is NS, which is clearly deviated from the direction of convergence. This pattern, found in the Salar Grande, is practically the same that we observed in the Mw6.7 earthquake occurred on March 16th -event that triggered the sequence of foreshock associated to the Mw8.1 Pisagua earthquake (ca. 170 km to the NW of the Salar Grande area). The NS direction of shortening is also seen in several upper crustal events occurred in the first days, before Mw8.1 Pisagua earthquake. On the other hand, the b-value > 0.9, calculated for the Salar Grande area, coincides with places where the seismic activity is associated to EW reverse faults mapped in the surface by geological studies -these structures are a common feature in the Atacama Fault System at these latitudes. They are also an indication of a NS direction of shortening, being in agreement with our seismological observations. The NS direction of shortening is not restricted to shallow depth, but it is extended to the interplate contact between the deeper part of the couple zone and the transitional zone. The last indicates that the NS shortening is a characteristic pattern associated to entire crustal plate in the zone of the Salar Grande and its possible origin would be linked to the northward gradient in the parallel to the trench component of the convergence velocity, which is zero when the convergence is perpendicular to the trench. Thus, as we observed in the Mw8.1 Pisagua sequence, these forces are able to trigger a Mega-thrust event.",

            "abstract": "GOSAT-2, the successor to Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), is a Japanese earth observation satellite to be launched in FY2017. It will measure atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4, CO, and black carbon by a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS-2) and a multispectral imager(CAI-2). GOSAT-2 related activities being conducted at National Institute for Environmental Studies(NIES) are as follows:\nPreliminary sensitivity tests have been conducted to understand the relationship between GOSAT-2 design parameters and retrieved gas concentration precisions. Due to the SNR improvement in some FTS-2 bands, random errors of GOSAT-2 will be smaller about 30% for XCO2 and 40% for XCH4 than GOSAT.\nOne of important challenges of GOSAT-2 is to provide global CO2 and CH4 flux products with higher spatial and temporal resolutions and less uncertainty than GOSAT. Development of a new system on an atmospheric transport model and an atmospheric inversion, as well as development of a terrestrial biosphere model, have been attempted to meet this challenge.\nThe GOSAT-2 validation plan is being discussed. Its basic idea is based on GOSAT experience. But various recently developed instruments will be considered. In addition, a new TCCON site in Southeast Asia and more gas measurement equipments for commercial airliners are being investigated.\nNIES is responsible for the generation of GOSAT-2 Level 2 and 4 products as well as the distribution of GOSAT-2 standard products to public. For these purposes, a dedicated system, GOSAT-2 Data Processing System (G2DPS), will be established in NIES. The preliminary design of G2DPS has already started.\nIt is expected that GOSAT-2 will contribute not only to carbon cycle science but also to the early detection of carbon cycle changes and the assessment of carbon emission reducing activities such as REDD+ and JCM. Several projects which include satellite and in-situ data and various models are being conducted in NIES as preparations for GOSAT-2.",

            "abstract": "High-latitude headwater catchments commonly contain permafrost soils and are subject to disturbance by wildfire. Processes governing transport of organic and inorganic carbon from headwater catchments to surface waters, and the influence of permafrost and disturbance on those processes, remain poorly characterized. We conducted a two-year field study of a headwater catchment in interior Alaska to better understand terrestrial-aquatic linkages of carbon (C) in these systems. The 4.1 km2 catchment is underlain by permafrost, and is drained by a first-order stream. Portions of the catchment burned in 2003, resulting in localized removal of organic soils and subsequent permafrost thaw. During May – September of 2010 and 2011, we sampled stream and soil pore waters throughout the catchment on a weekly to bi-weekly basis for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), specific UV absorbance (SUVA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Stream discharge and water chemistry were measured at two locations, reflecting drainage from the upper catchment (2.6 km2) and the entire catchment. Soil pore water sampling sites located between the two stream sampling stations included unburned hillslopes with permafrost depths ranging from 0.6 m to 0.75 m, burned hillslopes with permafrost depths to 1m, and riparian wetland with permafrost > 1m depth. Seasonal, interannual, and spatial differences in delivery of C constituents to the stream were evident over the two study years. Mean seasonal C loads and flow-weighted mean C concentrations (FWMC) for each stream reach showed that DOC and CH4 increased, and DIC and CO2 decreased in the downstream direction. Comparing stream FWMC to mean concentrations in soil pore waters, we determined that stream DOC, SUVA, and CH4 at the downstream location matched closely with values measured in the riparian wetland and burned hillslope locations, whereas DIC concentration was most similar to unburned hillslopes. This suggests a decoupling of organic and inorganic C sources, perhaps mediated by reactivity. We use an end-member mixing model, soil hydrologic properties, and measures of DOC biodegradation to explore sources of water and C from the distinct catchment landcover types to the stream and the role of permafrost and wildfire in C delivery to streams.",

            "abstract": "The Salton Seismic Imaging Project (SSIP) was undertaken, in part, to provide more accurate information on the plate-boundary faults and basin geometry in the Salton Trough region. One of these faults, the southernmost San Andreas Fault (SAF) zone in the northern Salton Trough (Coachella Valley), is considered by many to be likely to produce a large-magnitude earthquake in the near future. We report here on the geometry of the SAF and the adjacent sedimentary basin beneath the Coachella Valley.\nWe interpret two seismic profiles in the northern Salton Trough that are orthogonal to the axis of the Coachella Valley. Seismic imaging, potential-field studies, and (or) earthquake hypocentral relocations along these profiles indicate that the active strand of the SAF dips NE. On a southern profile, through the Mecca Hills, we obtain a reflection image of the SAF zone in the depth range of 6-12 km that coincides with the microearthquake pattern reported by Hauksson et al. (2012), dipping ~ 60° NE. Steeply dipping reflectors above 6 km emerge at the surface at mapped secondary fault traces in the Mecca Hills, clearly defining a “flower structure” for the upper SAF. On the second profile, from Palm Springs to Landers, two alternative interpretations of SAF structure are possible. By one interpretation, which is based on earthquakes alone, the Banning and Garnet Hill Faults are two closely spaced faults, dipping ~ 60° NNE that pass through two aftershock clusters of the 1986 M 5.9 North Palm Springs earthquake. By the second interpretation, which is based on our reflection imaging on this line, the Banning and Garnet Hills faults converge at 10-km depth; below that depth, a single SAF dips ~ 60° NNE. In the second interpretation, the faults above 10 km resemble the flower structure interpreted beneath the Mecca Hills on our southern profile. The deeper fault in the second interpretation is subparallel to the closely spaced faults of the first interpretation but a few km deeper.\nSedimentary basin depth (Vp < 5.5 km/s, estimated) ranges from 3-4 km in the northern Coachella Valley to a maximum of 5 km in the southern Coachella Valley. Because of the generally flat magnetic field, basement beneath the Coachella Valley southwest of the SAF is interpreted to be similar to that in the Peninsular Ranges.",

            "abstract": "Observations of auroras and auroral currents have shown that these phenomena can present significant asymmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres. The causes of the hemispheric asymmetry are often associated with the seasonal differences in ionospheric conductivity, the effects of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation, and interhemispheric currents. Despite their importance to the specification of space weather, the quantitative understanding of how these factors control hemispheric asymmetry of auroral currents has not been well established. Only in certain longitudinal ranges can magnetically conjugate ground-based magnetometers be placed on land. Such placement allows investigation of hemispheric asymmetry of auroral electrojets and other types of magnetic perturbations at auroral latitudes. Quebec, Canada, has in the past had sparse coverage by magnetometers, yet large parts of it are conjugate to Antarctica. Athabasca University’s AUTUMNX project, funded by the Canadian Space Agency, is emplacing 10 magnetometer stations across Quebec. Six conjugate magnetometer stations in West Antarctica at L-values between 3.9 and 10.1 are proposed by the U. S. Polar Region and Inter-hemispheric Magnetic Observations (PRIMO) project. The AUTUMNX and PRIMO arrays will provide conjugate magnetic field observations over the entire range of auroral latitudes for the first time. We will present initial measurements from the AUTUMNX stations, with electrojets determined by an inversion routine, and with comparison to measurements at existing somewhat conjugate stations. Full resolution 2 Hz cadence AUTUMNX data is openly available in near real time at http://autumn.athabascau.ca. By comparing with solar wind, magnetospheric, and ionospheric measurements, the conjugate AUTUMNX and PRIMO observations can allow us to assess the controlling factors for auroral electrojets and other magnetic activity in the two hemispheres.",

            "abstract": "The increase in the natural gas component of the energy sector has led many state and local municipalities to begin regulation of emissions from the oil and natural gas operators with air quality (AQ) as a concern. “Top-down” measurements of trace gases in the air above wells complement \"bottom-up\" inventories, used by EPA and AQ stakeholders, through a more accurate depiction of regional variability of methane and other species near and downwind of oil and gas operations. Satellite observations of methane, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, ozone, and other carbon gases enhance the spatial and temporal coverage of the data needed to demonstrate any long-term impacts from shale gas development. As part of a NASA AQAST (Air Quality Applied Sciences Team) project, we are evaluating satellite measurements of trace gases in regions with oil and gas operations for their application as a “top-down” constraint. For validation of the satellite instruments’ sensitivities to emitted gases, we focus on regions where the DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality) campaign deployed with ground and aircraft measurements, including, Maryland (2011), California and Texas (2013), and Colorado (2014). We compare vertical distributions of methane and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) nearby and downwind of oil and gas wells to locate any regional differences during the campaign time periods. This allows for better characterization of the satellite observations and their limitations for application in air quality studies in similar environments. Taking advantage of current EOS-era satellites’ data records, we also analyze methane anomalies and gas correlations in the free troposphere from 2005 to present to identify trends for basins with oil and gas extraction sites and their influence on background concentrations downwind of wells. In most regions with oil and gas activity, we see continually increasing methane concentrations and about a 5-10 percent enhancement above background tropospheric concentrations. With this ongoing effort, we aim to demonstrate the benefits of satellite-derived “top-down” constraints for emissions estimates associated with oil and natural gas operations.",

            "abstract": "Sundaland is the continental core of southeast Asia bounded by subduction zones since early Mesozoic. Many Sundaland basins, extensional in origin, have formed since Late Eocene. These rift basins experienced extensive inversion since early Miocene. The basins and the adjacent continental crust subsided with a regional sea level rise during a period of basin inversion and falling global sea level, suggesting control beyond eustasy and lithospheric deformation. The mechanism of this large-scale synchronous inversion and subsidence is not well understood. We use four dimensional dynamic models that explicitly assimilate the plate tectonic history and additional geological and geophysical data to investigate the underlying causes for the enigmatic evolution of Cenozoic Sundaland basins. The assimilation method honors both empirical data at the surface (including the seafloor age, plate motion velocity, subduction history) and mantle dynamics at depth and predicts mantle structure, surface topography and intraplate stress. These later expressions are compared against independent observations. With continuously closing plates, we embed deforming plates into the conventional rigid plate models in GPlates, thus enabling us to model continental deformation and mantle dynamics jointly. Models are initiated in the early Eocene with the temperature field derived from the backward integration of the present temperature field synthesized from seismic models. The velocity-temperature perturbation scaling ratio and depth and temperature dependent viscosity are derived by fitting the geoid. Our models are consistent with a slab avalanche occurring beneath Sundaland in the early Miocene. The slab avalanche induced large scale subsidence and compression across the southern Sundaland region, which correspond to the synchronous marine inundation and basin inversion since early to middle Miocene regionally. The model results suggest that the evolution of Sundaland basins is dominated by both surface lithospheric deformation and deep mantle dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Successful industrial scale carbon dioxide injection into deep saline aquifers will be dependent on the ability to model the flow of the fluid and to quantify the impact of various trapping mechanisms. The effectiveness of the models is in turn dependent on high quality laboratory measurements of basic multiphase flow properties such as relative permeability and residual trapping at reservoir conditions. Compared with typical oil-brine systems, however, a unique defining characteristic of the CO2-brine system is its combination of high viscosity ratio and low density ratio. This combination of properties results in unique complications for experiments with CO2 and brine and unique flow conditions must be used to achieve the combined goals of observations across a large saturation range and the avoidance of the effects of heterogeneity as well as capillary forces and gravity segregation. We have simulated the corefloods experiments at various conditions and calculated with different interpretation techniques: Steady state method, JBN-type method and history matching. As one of the essential mechanisms for CO2 storage underground, residual trapping refers to the trapping of CO2 through capillary forces within the pore space of a permeable aquifer. There are few studies that have observed the trapping characteristics for CO2-brine systems in permeable rocks, including the impact of reservoir conditions, and this remains a major uncertainty for geologic CO2 storage. This work presents results from a core-flooding laboratory that has been recently developed at Imperial College dedicated to observations of CO2-brine systems. The apparatus includes high precision pumps, accurate temperature control and a rotating X-ray CT scanner that allows experiments to be performed in both vertical and horizontal directions. The proper approach to measuring relative permeability for CO2-brine system is proposed and demonstrated. The changes in residual trapping correlated to pressure, temperature, brine salinity, interfacial tension, and contact angle are also reported. The application of measured data has been demonstrated in the simulation of reservoir-scale CO2 sequestration model.",

Observations include those with large viewing zenith angles (up to 83.1), making the measurements very sensitive to aerosol scattering. A previous study by the authors shows the ratioing of CO2 and O2 slant column densities (SCDs) can largely cancel the effect of aerosol scattering, but biases still exist due to the wavelength dependence of aerosol scattering.\nIn this study, biases caused by different types of aerosols are analyzed. Preliminary results indicate that the information from CLARS-FTS spectra is not sufficient to constrain all the free parameters, including the aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA), aerosol optical depth, surface albedo, etc. In order to mitigate the influence of aerosol scattering, a few effective aerosol parameters are retrieved simultaneously with absorbing gas abundances. The corrected SCDs show reasonable variabilities from the morning to the afternoon in the presence of aerosols. The column-averaged dry air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) products are compared to measurements from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) at Caltech. By retrieving aerosol parameters in the CO2 and O2 absorption bands, biases in XCO2 caused by wavelength dependence of aerosol scattering can be considerably reduced.",

            "abstract": "Previous experiments show that parallel-laminated deposits are emplaced under upper plane bed regime by the migration of small-amplitude, long-wavelength bedforms. The present research focuses on how sediment is sorted under upper plane bed and sheet flow transport regimes, and whether parallel-lamination is inhibited during sheet flow transport. The problem of studying the sorting of sediment under so intense transport conditions is plagued by the uncertainties related to flow resistances and bedload transport rates. We simplify the problem by first running the experiments with uniform sediment, to establish a baseline that will aid in the design of the experiments with poorly sorted material. We are running experiments at the Hydraulics Laboratory of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, in a unidirectional sediment-feed flume, 9 meters long by 0.2 meters wide, of which 7 meters are used as test section. During the experiments, water surface and bed elevations are periodically measured to characterize the global parameters of the flow, e.g. mean flow velocity and bed shear stress. When the flow and the sediment transport reach conditions of mobile bed equilibrium, bed elevation fluctuations are measured with ultrasonic transducer systems at six fixed locations. Channel bed aggradation is then induced by slowly raising the tail gate of the flume such that there is no change in transport regime, as confirmed by additional measurements of water surface and bed elevation and bed elevation fluctuations. Preliminary observations under upper plane bed regime show the formation of the small-amplitude and long-wavelength bedforms, as well as hints of parallel lamination in the deposits. In the near future we aim to achieve sheet flow transport conditions with both uniform and non-uniform grain size distributions to look at the internal structure of the emplaced deposit.",

The debate over whether the volcanism was caused by a superplume, plate reorganizations, or other tectonic controlled events is still going on. We address the necessity of a superplume in Pacific Ocean with mantle convection simulations. We use time-dependent convection calculations using the finite element code CitcomS with a temperature-dependent Newtonian rheology and a layered viscosity structure. In order to couple the interplay of plate tectonics and mantle convection, we introduce plate velocities from 170 Ma to ``present day'' generated using GPlates as a time-dependent surface boundary condition. In calculations with a thermal superplume rising from core mantle boundary (CMB), we introduce tracers in the initial thermal perturbations just above the CMB to track the location of plume material.\nApplying the plate reconstruction model of Seton (2012), the initial large melt region formed at\n∼120\nMa in our mantle convection simulations is broken up into pieces, which end up close to the ``present day'' locations of Manihiki, Hukurangi, Ontong-Java and Caribbean plateaus. We get similar results using different initial-perturbations at the CMB located within 500 km of the projection of the triple junction at the surface onto the CMB, which implies that the location of initial thermal perturbations is somewhat flexible. We repeat the simulation with no initial thermal perturbation at the CMB to see if the plate evolution alone will allow for a large pulse of magma at the triple junction. While the simulation with plume rising from CMB produce significant melt in the upper mantle, the non-plume simulation controlled by plate tectonics alone does not generate melt in the upper mantle. We also compare geoid and dynamic topographic maps for non-plume and plume simulations.",

            "abstract": "This study presents an investigation of the impact of burned areas on the surface energy balance and monthly precipitation in the northern Africa as simulated by a state-of-the-art regional model. Mean burned area fraction derived from MODIS approximate date of burning product were implemented in a set of 1-year long WRF/NMM/SSiB2 model simulations. Vegetation cover fraction and LAI were degraded daily based on mean burned area fraction and on the survival rate for each vegetation land cover type. Additionally, ground darkening associated with wildfire-induced ash and charcoal deposition was temporarily imposed through lower ground albedo for a period of 10 days after burning.\nIn general, wildfire-induced vegetation and ground degradation increased surface albedo by exposing the brighter bare ground of the region, which in turn caused a decrease in surface net radiation and evapotranspiration in northern sub-saharan Africa. A decrease in atmospheric moisture flux convergence was simulated in the burned area experiments, which plays a dominant role in reducing precipitation over the area, especially in the months preceding the West African monsoon onset. The areas with largest impacts were those covered by forests and savanna, where annual precipitation decreased by 4.2% and 3.6%, respectively.\nThis study suggests the cooling and drying of atmosphere induced by burned areas led to strengthening of subsidence during pre-onset and weakening of upward motion during onset and mature stages of the monsoon leading to a waning of convective instability and precipitation. Monthly vertical wind over the area showed a strengthening of downward motion in winter and spring seasons, and weakening of upward movement during the rainy months. Furthermore, precipitation energy analysis revealed that most of precipitation decrease originated from convective events, especially for those with daily precipitation rates above 2.0 mm day-1, which substantiates the hypothesis of convective instability decreasing resultant from burned-area-induced land degradation.",

            "abstract": "The MICA sounding rocket launched on 19 Feb. 2012 into several discrete, localized arcs in the wake of a westward traveling surge. In situ and ground-based observations provide a measured response of the ionosphere to preflight and localized auroral drivers. Initial analysis of the in situ thermal ion data indicate possible measurement of an ion conic at low altitude (< 325 km). In the low-energy regime, the response of the instrument varies from the ideal because the measured thermal ion population is sensitive to the presence of the instrument. The plasma is accelerated in the frame of the instrument due to flows, ram, and acceleration through the sheath which forms around the spacecraft. The energies associated with these processes are large compared to the thermal energy. Correct interpretation of thermal plasma measurements requires accounting for all of these plasma processes and the non-ideal response of the instrument in the low-energy regime. This is an experimental and modeling project which involves thorough analysis of ionospheric thermal ion data from the MICA campaign. Analysis includes modeling and measuring the instrument response in the low-energy regime as well as accounting for the complex sheath formed around the instrument. This results in a forward model in which plasma parameters of the thermal plasma are propagated through the sheath and instrument models, resulting in an output which matches the in situ measurement. In the case of MICA, we are working toward answering the question of the initiating source processes that result, at higher altitudes, in well-developed conics and outflow on auroral field lines.",

Forty-two warm springs and warm shallow groundwater occurrences have been recorded in Ireland; water temperatures in the springs (approx. 12-25 °C) are elevated with respect to average Irish groundwater temperatures (10-11 °C). This study focuses on warm springs in east-central Ireland found in the Carboniferous limestone of the Dublin Basin. Electromagnetic geophysical methods (CSEM and AMT) have been used in conjunction with time-lapse hydrogeological and hydrochemical analyses to determine the source of the heated waters at depth and the nature of the geological structures that facilitate the upward movement of the water. High-resolution AMT surveys at three warm spring locations in Leinster consisted of a grid of 40 soundings recorded at approximately 200 m intervals centred on each spring. A CSEM survey (25 sounding localities with 100 m spacings along two profiles) was carried out at one spring location to provide superior resolution of near-surface features. The aim of these surveys was to identify any (electrically conductive) fluid conduit systems associated with the springs and to provide an understanding of the observed association of the springs with major structural lineaments, e.g. the Iapetus Suture Zone that bisects Ireland. We present subsurface models derived from new AMT data collected at St. Gorman’s Well, Co. Meath in 2013.\nSeasonal hydrochemical sampling of six warm spring locations commenced in July 2013. Data loggers installed at each location will measure temperature and electrical conductivity (15-minute sampling intervals) throughout the sampling period (July 2013 – early 2015). The hydrochemical results and the data from the logger at St. Gorman’s Well are examined here in conjunction with regional rainfall and available hydrogeological information in order to establish the nature of the relationship between the hydrological cycle and fluctuations in the hydrochemistry of the spring.",

We analyze magnetometer data from Mars Global Surveyor to search for evidence of Schumann resonances associated with electric discharges oscillating between the surface of the planet and the ionosphere. These resonances, which could plausibly originate in dust storm or dust devils, are expected to manifest as signals from 8 to 14 Hz and be present at altitudes below the ionopause at 400 kilometers. We organize the data and perform fast Fourier transforms and wavelet analysis to determine which frequencies are most prominent in various data sets. In particular, we examine and categorize features that appear under the aforementioned conditions. These features could be associated with lightning, spacecraft noise, solar wind fluctuations, ionospheric currents, or other magnetic activity.

            "abstract": "The new NGSS provide an important opportunity for scientists to develop curriculum that links the practice of science to research-based data in order to improve understanding in areas of science that are both complex and confusing. Our curriculum focuses in particular on the fate and transport of anthropogenic radionuclides. Radioactivity, both naturally occurring and anthropogenic, is highly debated and largely misunderstood, and for large sections of the population is a source of scientific misunderstanding. Developed as part of the international GEOTRACES project which focuses on identifying ocean processes and quantifying fluxes that control the distributions of selected trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and on establishing the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions, the curriculum topic fits nicely into the applied focus of NGSS with both environmental and topical relevance. \nOur curriculum design focuses on small group discussion driven by questions, yet unlike more traditional curriculum pieces these are not questions posed to the students, rather they are questions posed by the students to facilitate their deeper understanding. Our curriculum design challenges the traditional question/answer memorization approach to instruction as we strive to develop an educational approach that supports the practice of science as well as the NGSS Cross Cutting Concepts and the Science & Engineering Practices. Our goal is for students to develop a methodology they can employ when faced with a complex scientific issue. Through background readings and team discussions they identify what type of information is important for them to know and where to find a reliable source for that information. Framing their discovery around key questions such as “What type of radioactive decay are we dealing with?”, “What is the potential half-life of the isotope?”, and “What are the pathways of transport of radioactivity?” allows students to evaluate a given condition, to predict an outcome and to better judge the seriousness of an overall situation.\nWhile the problem solving skills students are taught are built around a specific case study, they can be broadly applied to a much wider range of topics, areas of study, and other aspects of their lives as new challenges arise, fitting the goals of NGSS.",

Each of these three examples and all other earth science projects are strongly in need of having GIS and geoprocessing capabilities to process, visualize, manage and store GeoSpatial data.\nBeside some open source GIS libraries and some software like ArcGIS there are comparatively few open source, web-based and easy to use application that are capable of doing GIS processing and visualization. To address this, we present GISCube, an open source web-based GIS application that can store, visualize and process GIS and GeoSpatial data. GISCube is powered by Geothon, an open source python GIS cookbook. Geothon has a variety of Geoprocessing tools such data conversion, processing, spatial analysis and data management tools. GISCube has the capability of supporting a variety of well known GIS data formats in both vector and raster formats, and the system is being expanded to support NASA’s and scientific data formats such as netCDF and HDF files.

We have reproduced slow and fast slip in the laboratory to gain insight into physical differences that may aid in our interpretation of these phenomena in the Earth. Here we present results for slow and fast slip on simulated faults in the laboratory under static normal stresses of 1-8 MPa and shearing rates of 0.1-100 µm/second. We apply shear to a central block bounded by two gouge layers, held in place by the static load. Simultaneous to shearing we measure acoustical time-of-flight across the gouge layers to quantify the evolution of gouge wavespeed preceding, during and following slip events. At the fixed static stresses studied, we find that stick-slip may occur over a spectrum of grain sizes ranging from order 5-150 micron at least (Mimusil or glass beads of varying dimension); in contrast slow-slip only occurs for fine grain materials such as Minusil (fine-grained white crystalline silica of order 5 micron in diameter). In both cases the gouge compacts at the time of slip associated with a gouge material increase in velocity. Following slip, the gouge material progressively dilates and the material velocity progressively decreases up to slip time, when the process repeats. Numerical simulation will help us understand the fast (stick-slip) and slow (slow-slip) processes. It is plausible that grain sizes influence slow and fast slip in faults in the earth, and the velocity changes observed in the laboratory fault gouge may also exist in fault zones.",

            "abstract": "Maug volcano consists of 3 islands that define the perimeter of a submerged caldera that was formed by an explosive eruption. The caldera reaches a depth of ~225 meters, and has a prominent central cone or pinnacle that ascends within 20 meters of the sea surface. Our exploration of Maug began in 2003, when a single hydrocast in the caldera detected a strong suspended particle and helium plume reaching a maximum of δ3He = 250% at ~180 meters depth, clearly indicating hydrothermal activity within the caldera. In 2004 we returned armed with the ROPOS ROV, and two ROPOS dives discovered and sampled low temperature (~4 °C) diffuse venting associated with bacterial mats on the NE flank of the central pinnacle at 145 m depth. Samples collected with titanium gas tight bottles were badly diluted with ambient seawater but allowed an estimate of end-member 3He/4He of 7.3 Ra. Four vertical casts lowered into the caldera in 2004 all had a strong 3He signal (δ3He = 190%) at 150-190 meters depth.\nA recent expedition in 2014 focused on the shallow (~10 m) gas venting along the caldera interior. Scuba divers were able to collect samples of the gas bubbles using evacuated SS bottles fitted with plastic funnels. The gas samples had a consistent ~170 ppm He, 8 ppmNe, 60% CO2, 40%N2, and 0.8% Ar, and an end-member 3He/4He ratio of 6.9 Ra. This 3He/4He ratio falls within the range for typical arc volcanoes. The rather high atmospheric component (N2, Ar, Ne) in these samples is not contamination but appears to be derived from subsurface exchange between the ascending CO2 bubbles and air saturated seawater. A single vertical cast in 2014 had a maximum δ3He = 55% at 140 m depth, much lower than in 2003 and 2004. This decrease is possibly due to recent flushing of the caldera by a storm event, or may reflect a decrease in the deep hydrothermal activity. This area of shallow CO2 venting in Maug caldera is of particular interest as a natural laboratory for studying the effects of ocean acidification on corals.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol radiative forcing is an important parameter in the Earth’s radiation budget and can be an important driver of atmospheric circulation and the hydrological cycle. Accurate estimation of aerosol radiative forcing requires measurement of both the extensive and intensive optical properties of aerosols. While the intensive optical properties are independent of aerosol mass or number, they are critical inputs when calculating radiative forcing with applications to climate research, satellite remote sensing and model validations. The key aerosol intensive properties that need to be evaluated include single scattering albedo (SSA), the angstrom exponent, the asymmetry parameter, the radiative forcing efficiency, and the hygroscopic scattering factor. We report here on values of these variables over the Cape Cod and nearby northwest Atlantic Ocean during the Two Column Aerosol Project (TCAP). The average SSA shows a distinct profile having higher SSA values below the top of well-mixed residual layer (RL) and lower SSA above it. Aerosol in the free troposphere (FT) were found to have less spectral dependence in their optical properties, lower back scatter fraction and higher hygroscopic growth relative to aerosols found in the RL. Analysis of individual particle composition suggests that that ratio of aged to fresh aerosol numbers in the FT is 70% higher compared to aerosols measured in the RL, and that smoke from biomass burning contributed ~10% to this number. Single particle analysis also reveals that the fraction and variability of coated black carbon (BC) aerosol is higher in the FT relative to that measured in the residual layer. The daily radiative forcing efficiency of these aerosols in the FT is factor 2 higher than below RL. Seven years (2007-2013) of CALIPSO satellite observations show that the mean altitude of the top of smoke layers (~3.3 km) consistent with these in situ observations from TCAP. Overall, the long term CALIPSO observations characterizes 13% of aerosol layers as smoke over TCAP region and indicate that these smoke layers have been present over this area every year. The aircraft and satellite observations both suggest that while smoke contributes around 10% of total aerosol, it must be taken into account, as the radiative forcing estimates are sensitive to the amount of absorbing aerosol.",

            "abstract": "River systems play an integral role in the global carbon cycle by connecting the terrestrial biosphere, the atmosphere and the oceans. Extensive tropical wetland systems, such as those found in the Amazon region, have been shown to export significant amounts of carbon to river waters as dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) that can be transported and emitted hundreds of km downstream. The assessment of both regional and global carbon budgets could therefore be improved by quantifying these lateral carbon fluxes, especially from highly productive temporarily or permanently flooded areas where substantial CO2 evasion from inland waters can occur.\nThe Nile is the longest river in the world and the headwaters are located in the extensive Papyrus dominated wetlands in central Africa that are associated with Lake Victoria. From its source the White Nile flows northwards through wetlands in Uganda and Sudan before it joins the Blue Nile. Papyrus wetlands have been shown to be some of the most productive global ecosystems, with recorded rates of aerial net primary productivity of up to 3.09 kg C m-2 yr-1. In addition, where anaerobic conditions occur they also accumulate large amounts of carbon in the form of peat, and under these circumstances they represent a significant carbon sink. However, as water moves through these wetlands and is exchanged with surrounding rivers and lakes significant quantities of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon as well as suspended particulate organic matter are exported, which are either released further downstream by degassing, decomposition or deposition.\nWe describe here our attempts to constrain the carbon cycle of wetlands at the Nile headwaters and provide more information on the regional scale carbon budget.",

The summers of 2010 and 2012 were both exceptionally warm, but only 2012 resulted in negative surface mass budget (SMB) and surface runoff. The observed runoff was due to a large ice fraction in the upper 10 m of firn that prevented melt water from percolating to available pore space below. Analysis of the in situ data reveals a relatively low 2012 summer albedo of ~0.7 as melt water was present at the surface. Consequently, during the 2012 melt season the surface absorbed 30% (213 MJ m–2) more solar radiation than in 2010.\nWe drive a surface energy balance model with the AWS data to evaluate the seasonal and interannual variability of all surface energy fluxes. The model is able to reproduce the observed melt rates as well as the SMB for each season. While the drive for melt is solar radiation, year-to-year differences are controlled by terrestrial radiation, apart from 2012 when solar radiation dominated melt. Sensitivity tests reveal that 72% of the excess solar energy in 2012 was used for melt, corresponding to 40% (0.67 m) of the 2012 surface ablation. The remaining ablation (0.99 m) was primarily due to the relatively high atmospheric temperatures up to +2.6 °C daily average, indicating that 2012 would have been a negative SMB year in the lower accumulation area even without the melt-albedo feedback.\nLonger time series of SMB, regional temperature and remotely sensed albedo (MODIS) suggest that 2012 was the first negative SMB year with the lowest albedo at this elevation on record. The warming conditions of the last years resulted in enhanced melt and reduction of the refreezing capacity of the lower accumulation area. If the warming continues the lower accumulation area will be transformed into superimposed ice.",

            "abstract": "The terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) is considered the largest CO2 flux (123±8 petagrams) and responsible for driving several ecosystem functions globally. However, estimates of magnitude and regional variations of this flux remain uncertain in humid tropical forests, particularly in Amazonia where limited ground data have caused gross assumptions about seasonality and heterogeneity of these forests. Empirical upscaling of the in situ observations or refined process-based modeling using remote sensing inputs have improved estimates of carbon exchange, but the seasonal variation of this exchange in Amazonia remains a challenge and has been the subject of recent scientific debates. Here, we used satellite observations of canopy structure, skin temperature, water content, and optical properties over 10 years (2000-2009) to quantify spatial patterns of seasonality of Amazonian forests. We found 9 pheno-regions with distinct seasonal cycles in Amazonia, among them 3 regions showing strong seasonal variations with maximized GPP in the wet season; another 3 exhibiting rising GPP in the dry season; and the remaining 3 with low seasonality. These patterns were verified by direct measurements of photosynthetic activity using florescence from GOSAT satellite. Our results suggest that water and radiation represented by canopy water content and skin temperature regulate photosynthetic activities over Amazonia that can be captured by spatial variations of Near Infrared Reflectance. Our detection of patterns of seasonality in Amazonia will improve modeling global exchange of carbon and predicting future impacts of climate change on tropical forests.",

Internal fields of crustal origin have been subject to extensive studies, whereas the focus of our work deals with average spatial structure and time variability in the martian external magnetic field. We use the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) vector magnetic field data to investigate the large-scale geometry and magnitude of such external fields. We analyze the day-time and night-time magnetic signature for the duration of the MGS mission in mapping orbit (2000-2006). We use along-track vector field measurements to estimate the day-time and night-time external fields after the subtraction of predicted crustal magnetic fields at spacecraft altitudes. We also examine day/night differences (i.e., the daily variation) in external fields; these are independent of crustal fields. Because the external fields are modified by the crustal fields, we investigate their structure as a function of latitude in the local time frame and as a function of both latitude and longitude in the body-fixed frame. In the body-fixed-frame BΘis generally dominant in magnitude with a day/night variation described to first order by a zonal degree-2 spherical harmonic structure. Br is strongly correlated with the crustal magnetic field. BΦ shows variable spatial behaviour during both night and day. Seasonal variations are observed as stronger average magnetic fields in the hemisphere pointing towards the sun. Additional shorter time scale variations in the global external field structure are observed.",

            "abstract": "Prior field and theoretical work has suggested that bedrock channels adjust to lower stream power when encountering highly soluble strata, exhibiting an increase in channel width and/or a decrease in channel slope. However, in apparent contradiction to this expectation, many channels within the Buffalo River Basin, Arkansas, contain knickpoints, in the form of waterfalls and slot canyons, that are developed at the contact between the Mississippian Batesville Sandstone and the underlying Boone Limestone. To improve understanding of bedrock channel response to contrasts in rock solubility, longitudinal surveys were conducted in three channels that cross the Boone Limestone. Additionally, channel widths and a profile were obtained for the main stem of the Buffalo River using aerial photography and a digital elevation model. Schmidt scores for the Boone and Batesville suggest that the two strata have similar compressive strengths, which is a measure of relative resistance to mechanical erosion. Two of the four studied reaches show significant knickpoint development, and in both cases the basin area above the knickpoint is less than 3 km2. One possible explanation is that these knickpoints have been arrested at a critical threshold basin area. However, at least four other such knickpoints are known from the area, and in all cases the knickpoint is highly correlated to the contact rather than a specific basin area, suggesting that the properties of the strata are an important factor. We identify three potential mechanisms that may often act in concert to develop knickpoints at contacts with underlying soluble rocks. (1) If chemical erosion in the soluble reach outpaces uplift, and knickpoint retreat through the overlying layer is sufficiently slow, then a knickpoint will develop. (2) Karstification can divert geomorphic work to the subsurface, resulting in a steep surface channel and possible stalling of upstream knickpoint migration within the soluble strata. (3) The formation and collapse of caves may generate steep, narrow canyons. Within larger basins, increases in erosive capacity and sediment supply, and reduction of slope, would act to reduce the importance these mechanisms.",

This is an interesting and important chapter of climate history for understanding the sensitivity of large ice sheets to perturbations in the climate system on glacial-interglacial and much longer timescales. Of possible priming mechanisms (incl. closure of Panama seaway, orographic uplift), the decline of atmospheric carbon dioxide is considered to have a strong connection with the late Pliocene cooling and ice sheet inception, although the causal mechanism for its decline remains relatively unknown. High-resolution, long term climate records are necessary to further constrain the timings of ice volume evolution and the associated driving factors during the Plio-Pleistocene, however such records are presently limited.\nODP Site 1123 (Chatham Rise, southwest Pacific, 3290m) records the evolution of the deep western boundary current of the southwest Pacific, a primary feeder of Antarctic Bottom Water to the global deep ocean. By calculating the oxygen stable isotope composition of past seawater, a proxy calculation combining Mg/Ca-palaeothermometry and δ18O from benthic foraminifera, we present a high-resolution record of global ice volume as a measure of climate change, extending the existing 0-1.5 Ma record (Elderfield et al., 2012) at ODP 1123 to the Plio-Pleistocene (1.5-3.0 Ma). We use this measure of global ice volume evolution to assess the relative timing and magnitude of northern hemisphere glaciation and concomitant deep ocean temperature decline, which aids to infer temperatures around Antarctica during this time. Deep ocean temperature results show high frequency glacial-cycles, approaching near-freezing temperatures at peak glacials.\n",

Shear stress was estimated using (i) a roughness relation and (ii) the uniform flow approximation. Riverbed grain size distributions were estimated using pebble counts upstream, and Ponar grab samples within and downstream of the transition zone. Four different gravel and sand transport equations (Engelund-Hansen, Ackers-White, Wilcock-Crowe, and Yang) were applied to estimate transport rates at each flow level analyzed. The resulting rates were integrated over a 50 year period to compute total load entering and exiting each analysis segment to evaluate long term trends in bed elevation profiles.

            "abstract": "Flux pileup from fast flows and dipolarization, physical processes in the magnetotail, cause auroral evolution (brightening, poleward expansion, and equatorward motion) in the ionosphere during substorms. Although such flows have been shown to produce auroral brightening, the causes of auroral poleward expansion and equatorward motion remain unclear. Two mechanisms, tailward movement of the pileup region and dipolarization of the substorm current wedge (SCW), are thought to contribute to auroral poleward expansion, but no study has addressed which mechanism makes the dominant contribution. The hypothesis that auroral poleward expansion is caused by the tailward-moving pileup region is based on the assumption of a steady magnetosphere. This assumption is not necessarily true during substorms, however, because dipolarization of the SCW changes magnetospheric configuration and thus ionospheric footprints (and mapping) of the flows. Because they lack a dynamic SCW, previous magnetospheric models are statistical and static.\nWe evaluated the dynamic effect of the SCW using a dynamic magnetospheric model in which the SCW is superimposed on Tsyganenko model. The current wedge is obtained from a recently developed inversion model using only ground magnetic field data as input, and model parameters are updated every minute. Applying our dynamic magnetospheric model to data from an isolated substorm observed by THEMIS and GOES 10 spacecraft and ground ASIs on 13 February 2008, we found that 1) our model predicts dipolarization at GOES 10 (it can predict near-Earth magnetic variations with ground data alone); 2) there is a good temporal correlation between successive auroral brightenings and flows; 3) flow footprints from our model are collocated with auroral poleward expansion and equatorward motion. These results suggest that in this event, auroral poleward expansion and equatorward motion are mainly caused by mapping changes in the dynamic magnetosphere by the SCW.",

Two methods for estimating initial crater depths on the icy satellites of Saturn have been previously discussed. White and Schenk (2013) present the craters of Iapetus as relatively unrelaxed in modeling the relaxation of craters of Rhea. Phillips et al. (2013) assume that Herschel crater on Saturn’s satellite Mimas is unrelaxed in relaxation calculations and models of Rhea and Dione. In the second method, the depth of Herschel crater is scaled based on the different crater diameters and the difference in surface gravity on the large moons to predict the initial crater depths for Rhea and Dione. In the first method, since Iapetus is of similar size to Dione and Rhea, no gravity scaling is necessary; craters of similar size on Iapetus were chosen and their depths measured to determine the appropriate initial crater depths for Rhea.\nWe test these methods by first extracting topographic profiles of impact craters on Iapetus from digital elevation models (DEMs) constructed from stereo images from the Cassini ISS instrument. We determined depths from these profiles and used them to calculate initial crater depths and relaxation percentages for Rhea and Dione craters using the methods described above. We first assumed that craters on Iapetus were relaxed, and compared the results to previously calculated relaxation percentages for Rhea and Dione relative to Herschel crater (with appropriate scaling for gravity and crater diameter). We then tested the assumption that craters on Iapetus were unrelaxed and used our new measurements of crater depth to determine relaxation percentages for Dione and Rhea. We will present results and conclusions from both methods and discuss their efficacy for determining initial crater depth.\n",

            "abstract": "Silicic ignimbrites and lavas are sometimes very difficult to distinguish from one another in the field. Their accurate identification provides the basis for a better understanding of the origin of these deposits, including processes related to magma extraction, fragmentation and eruption style. We are studying the silicic volcanics in the Paraná Rift Basin in southern Brazil (the ~130 to 135 Ma Palmas member of the Serra Geral Formation), the counterpart to the Etendeka silicic volcanics in Africa. We present new field evidence for the identification of tabular-shaped ignimbrite-like packages, which contrast with dome-shaped proximal viscous lavas and domes.\nThe tabular-shaped packages are highly welded and devitrified, but primary feldspar and pyroxene crystals can still be identified in outcrops. Flow/cooling unit boundaries can be seen at outcrop scale as well as at the kilometer scale where successive flat-topped terraces have been cut into the volcanic landscape. These packages bear conspicuous swarms of vesicle-poor black lens-shaped features set in a light colored matrix. The lenses range in their aspect ratio (2D height vs. length) and can be > 2 m long. Horizontal jointing is superimposed on the black lens-bearing outcrops and their spacing appears to coincide with the aspect ratio of the lenses, i.e. thinner lenses have a narrower joint spacing. Locally wider lenses grade down into completely stretched and/or flattened lenses that resemble conventional flow banding. We interpret these tabular packages as ignimbrites and the vesicle-poor black lenses as juvenile magma blobs (distinct from typical pumice or fiamme).\nA notably different flow-banded, irregularly deformed, and sometimes obsidian-bearing lithology appears in a number of locations. It supports topography characterized by rolling hills that contrasts markedly with the tilted plateaus supported by ignimbrites. The difference in morphology between ignimbrites and lavas is most readily observed in the north-south trending southern Brazil escarpment, where up to ~700 m of tabular-shaped packages are juxtaposed against domical features.\nFuture work will include detailing the genetic relationships between these two different lithologies, as well as the study of the magmatic conditions that led to their eruption.",

            "abstract": "Building on previous environmental flow discussions and a growing recognition that geomorphic and ecological processes are inherent to river functionality and biodiversity, we propose a functional flows approach to managing rivers in contemporary modified riverscapes. The approach focuses on retaining specific functional flows or process-based components of the hydrograph in managed systems, including: peak magnitude flows, recession (seasonal transition) flows, dry season low flows, wet season initiation flows, and interannual variability based on climate. Using a series of case studies and specific examples, we illustrate the importance of each key functional flow. In order to maximize the functionality of these flows and thereby maximize aquatic diversity, restoration of channel-floodplain connectivity and sediment transport processes must be enhanced in both space and time. We further provide considerations for managers that include five guiding principles for developing a functional flows approach or incorporating functional flows into existing environmental flow frameworks. We suggest this approach allows for the development of flow regimes that encompass ecosystem processes alongside varied human needs and can be applied in an adaptive management framework allowing for adjustment in non-stationary river environments.",

More recently, there has been interest in modeling transport with irreversible reactions, and Lagrangian CTRW-based numerical models have been successfully applied to these problems. However, a corresponding Eulerian theory has been lacking. We recently developed Eulerian governing equations in the presence of irreversible bimolecular reactions, via the device of upscaling transport and treating reactions at a finer scale. The technique is generally valid, even in porous media that do not have an obvious division of length scales, subject to certain smoothness assumptions on the solution. We show that the governing equations we develop simplify, under appropriate circumstances, to both the generalized master equation for the unreactive CTRW and to the advection-dispersion-reaction equation. We also present a numerical corroboration of our development and its underlying smoothness assumptions obtained using a novel, indirect particle-tracking / partial differential equation hybrid technique. We discuss the implications of the new governing equations for practical reactive transport modeling and for conceptualization of subsurface processes, and highlight connections to other approaches. As applicable, we will also discuss aspects of numerical implementation.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale meteorological patterns associated with extreme temperatures are evaluated across a suite of regional climate model (RCM) simulations produced as a part of the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARRCAP). Evaluation is performed on six hindcast simulations and eleven simulations driven by four global climate models (GCMs). In places removed from the influence of complex topography in the winter, such as the Midwest of the United States, extremes and associated patterns are generally simulated with high fidelity. In other cases, such as for much of the Gulf of Mexico Coast in summer, the RCMs have notable difficulty in reproducing temperature extremes and associated meteorological patterns. In some cases, the temperature extremes appear to be well reproduced, but for the wrong reasons, making this analysis particularly valuable for diagnosing and interpreting RCM skill in making future projections of temperature extremes. An RCM skill score is developed, based on pattern agreement at all grid cells, to identify the RCM-GCM combinations that may be best suited for making future projections of temperature extremes. Cases identified as having low RCM skill will be the subject of further investigations with a focus on understanding key processes that are contributing to model error and helping to guide future model development. It is anticipated that this work will be implemented as part of a framework for evaluating temperature extremes in RCMs, providing generalized performance metrics based on mechanistic and process-oriented diagnostics.",

This is particularly true for the geosciences because over 25% of recent geoscience graduates with a bachelor’s degree attended a 2YC for at least one semester (AGI, 2013). However, it is difficult to successfully track 2YC transfers because many 2YC students do not complete an associate’s degree and very few institutions offer a geoscience-specific associate’s degree. In order to recruit future geoscientists from this pool of students, researchers need to better understand the barriers these students face when trying to transfer and how they are able to successfully navigate these barriers.\nDuring spring 2014 graduation, AGI surveyed students completing their bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees about their educational background, experiences and future plans after graduation. Those graduates who attended a 2YC for at least one semester provided insight into their enrollment decisions as they transferred into a four-year university. The sample from this survey represents 154 responses from a total of 596 responses. General demographics reveal an older population (average age: 30, median: 27), a higher percent of male students (54% male, 40% female) and Caucasians (76%, 10% non Caucasian) than a traditional 2YC student. Students attending 2YC nationally are on average 28 years old (median: 24), are 57% women, and are 51% Caucasian (AACC Fast Facts, 2014).

Even with very long records, however, the resulting Green’s functions still have noise in the sense of energy that cannot be simply modeled as the impulse response of a virtual source at the location of one station recorded at the other. Thanks to the extremely high quality and densely-spaced deployment of broadband sensors by the IDaho-ORegion (IDOR) flexible array deployment from 2011-2013 in western Idaho and eastern Oregon, we have identified signals in ambient noise cross-correlograms consistent with cross-correlated energy from persistent seismic scatterers near or within the seismic array. By using cross-correlograms from all available pairs of the 86 broadband sensors of the IDOR array and the permanent stations within the footprint of the array, BMO and HLID, we employ a Kirchoff-like stacking technique to image likely locations for such persistent scattering, which we call scattering intensity. The resulting scattering intensity maps show the highest scattering intensity correlated with the distribution of feeder dikes for the Columbia River Basalts, while the lowest scattering intensity is correlated with relatively undeformed regions of the Idaho Batholith. Overall, patterns of scattering intensity are clearly related with the surface geology and tectonic history of the region. This technique represents a new tool for extracting yet more information from the apparent noise in the signals extracted from ambient noise.",

Leaf waxes hold potential to inform our understanding of dust entrainment and cycling because their chain-length distributions, concentrations, and stable isotope ratios contain information on environmental parameters in dust source regions. We present a 220 kyr record of paired leaf wax n-alkane δ13C and 232Th fluxes from Tasman Sea Core Fr1/GC03. Leaf wax δ13C values are 7-9‰ more depleted during glacial periods, when there are also 3-4 times higher dust fluxes than during the Holocene. The δ13C shifts likely represent a combination of vegetation changes, moisture availability, and changes in the source area of the leaf waxes. By comparing the magnitude and timing of δ13C and dust flux changes, we will evaluate the relative influence of vegetation changes, hydrologic shifts, and wind speed increases on the observed changes in dustiness during glacial times.",

            "abstract": "Southern Nevada records two recent periods of deformation; the Laramide orogeny and Basin and Range extension. Our research focuses on these events to understand the history of faulting in this area and the resulting landscape.\nFirst, we have advanced an on-going research project in the Lake Mead region of Nevada, which was deformed by extension that began around 17 Ma. We are currently working in the White Basin, near Lake Mead. The White Basin is comprised of the Lovell Wash Member, ~14-12 Ma, of the Horse Spring Formation. The Lovell Wash Member contains siliciclastic and carbonate units that vary laterally and vertically throughout this area. This is a change from the fairly homogenous Bitter Ridge Limestone Member below and suggests a change in the style of faulting. To determine the faulting history, we mapped out marker beds, focusing on tuffs and limestone beds that form continuous, well-exposed outcrops in the area. We found abrupt stratigraphic thickening of ~50% across faults, documenting syndepositional faulting. We used dated tuffs to determine that this faulting developed from ~13.7-13.2 Ma.\nSecondly, we are working on a Laramide uplift project. We are testing the hypothesis that an area in the Kingman Uplift region was deformed by a Laramide age fault, prior to Miocene extensional deformation. We are using U-Th/He Apatite and K-Spar Multiple Diffusion Domain thermochronology, to determine the cooling histories of rocks on either side of the proposed fault.\nBoth of these on-going research projects highlight the complex geology that is found in the Basin and Range province in the United States. Understanding this complex geology will help answer questions about the timing, driving forces, and processes associated with extensional and compressional events.",

The method attempts to constrain uncertainty due to both anthropogenic and natural influences, providing a measure of how these effects may combine during specified future decades. Seasonal climate fields are downscaled to the daily time step by resampling the AgMERRA dataset, providing a full suite of agriculturally relevant variables and enabling the propagation of climate uncertainty to agricultural outputs.

This depression, the Uspallata-Callingasta-Iglesia Valley, is divided into three catchments based on drainage divides between three large, transverse rivers. These catchments have their headwaters in the western Precordillera, Frontal Cordillera and Principal Cordillera ranges. Deformation is thought to have ceased near the core of the range (Frontal and Principal Cordilleras) and propagated to the east during the Miocene to present. In this study, river profiles and knickpoint topographic data are assessed to determine the distribution of active rock uplift and amount of fluvial incision in the Calingasta and Iglesia valleys. Slope-area data extracted from a digital elevation model consistently show slope-break knickpoints separating distinct sections of river profiles, which suggests relative bedrock uplift. Catchment-wide, normalized steepness indices (ksn) - using a concavity index of 0.45 (common in steady state profiles in the study area) - for both basins revealed consistently high ksn signals (>300) in the main stems and tributaries draining the Frontal Cordillera and the western Precordillera. The highest ksn values are situated in an elevation range of 2500 to 4000 m, west of the fold and thrust belt in the Principal and Frontal Cordilleras. Slope-break knickpoints are not clustered in elevation and there is no obvious correlation between upstream drainage area at knickpoints and respective distance from the tributaries' mouths, which suggests that they are not part of an upstream migrating wave of knickpoints. The data presented here indicate active rock uplift in the eastern edge of the Frontal Cordillera, which was previously considered inactive.",

            "abstract": "Observations of the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet in recent decades have shown significant losses at the coastal margins through the thinning, speed-up and retreat of tidewater glaciers. Ocean forcing, via melting of submerged ice at the calving fronts of tidewater glaciers, has been identified as a possible driver of this behaviour. Such submarine melting may provide a significant direct contribution to the negative mass balance of the glacier and could also amplify calving rates. Quantification of submarine melting remains uncertain however since modelling of fjord circulation and submarine melting is challenging, hydrographic data from pro-glacial fjords are sparse and direct observation of submarine melting at a tidewater glacier has so far proved impossible.\nHere, we compare submarine melt rates obtained using buoyant plume theory to those from a numerical model (MITgcm), finding reasonable agreement between the two methods. We then use buoyant plume theory, due to its faster computational speed, to investigate the dependence of melt rate on subglacial discharge, subglacial channel size (and thus emerging flow velocity) and fjord-water temperature. Finally we apply the theory to real tidewater glaciers, finding significant gaps between modelled melt rates and those estimated from hydrographic data. We discuss possible reasons for such disagreements and their implications for constraining the importance of submarine melting to tidewater glacier mass balance.",

            "abstract": "Accurate orbit prediction of space objects critically relies on modeling of thermospheric neutral density that determines drag force. In a trade study we have investigated a methodology to assess performances of neutral density models in predicting orbit against a baseline orbit trajectory. We use a metric defined as along-track error in a day a satellite is predicted to have for a given neutral density model when compared to its GPS positions. A set of ground truth data including Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) accelerometer and GPS data, solar radio F10.7 proxy and magnetic activity measurements are used to calculate the baseline orbit. This approach is applied to compare the daily along-track errors among HASDM, JB08, MSISE-00 and DTM-2012 neutral density models. The dynamically calibrated HASDM model yields a daily along-track error close to the baseline error and lower than the other empirical models. Among the three empirical models (JB08, MSISE-00 and DTM-2012) the MSISE-00 model has produced the smallest daily along-track error. The results suggest that the developed metric and methodology could be used to assess overall errors in orbit prediction expected from empirical density models. They have also been adapted in an analysis tool Satellite Orbital Drag Error Estimator (SODEE) to estimate orbit prediction errors.",

            "abstract": "Observations show complex structures deep in ice sheets. Folds and accretion ice have been reported for both Greenland and Antarctica. Mismatched stratigraphy in the nearby GRIP and GISP2 cores in Greenland as well as overturning in the NEEM ice core suggest variable behavior within the ice sheet. Furthermore, ice penetrating radar data taken across both ice sheets shows folding at scales up to half the ice thickness. Because individual strata can be traced through the folds, it is clear that ice flow dynamics play an important role. Here we consider the possible formation of recirculation eddies in subglacial mountain valleys. Modeling the ice as a creeping homogeneous power-law shear-thinning viscous fluid, recirculation eddies are shown to form in valleys when the angle of the wall is steep enough that fluid inside the valley cannot return to the main flow. This is analogous to Moffatt eddies for a Newtonian viscous fluid. Using a no-slip boundary condition at the valley wall, ice can recirculate in these valleys indefinitely. We examine eddies in the basal ice using theory and simulations based on topography of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains in central East Antarctica. The Gamburtsevs are a large mountain range (~750km×250km) with steep relief typical of an alpine glacier system. Analytic results point to a necessary critical angle, and for a power-law shear-thinning fluid such as ice, these eddies occur at lower angles than in a Newtonian viscous fluid. We further develop metrics for determining valleys that are likely to contain eddies based on flow velocity and the total relief of the valley. Our simulations show that in some valleys eddies of order one hundred meters form. We then compare our simulations to radar observations to show potential for near-bed stratigraphic disturbances.",

            "abstract": "Deforestation fires in the Amazon Basin abound during the dry season (July to October) and are mostly associated with “slash and burn” agricultural practices. Understory fires occur when fires escape from deforested areas into neighboring standing forests; they spread slowly below the canopy, affecting areas that may be comparable or even larger than clear-cut areas. The interannual variabilities of understory fires and deforestation rates appear to be uncorrelated. Areas burned in understory fires are particularly extensive during droughts. Because they progress below a canopy of living trees, understory fires and their effects are not as easily identifiable from space as deforestation fires.\nHere we analyze satellite remote sensing products for CO and fire to investigate differences between deforestation fires and understory fires in the Amazon Basin under varying climatic conditions. The MOPITT (Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere) instrument on board NASA's Terra satellite has been measuring tropospheric CO since 2000, providing the longest global CO record to date. IASI (the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) A and B are two instruments on board METOP-A and -B, respectively, measuring, among others, CO since 2006 and 2012. MODIS (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instruments on board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites provide, among other products, a daily record of fires and their effects since 2000 and 2002, respectively. The temporal extent of all these datasets allows for the detailed analysis of drought versus non-drought years. Initial results indicate that MOPITT CO emissions during the dry season peaked in 2005, 2007, and 2010. Those were draught years and coincide with peaks in area affected by understory fires.",

            "abstract": "The hodograph transformation solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear shallow-water wave (NSW) equations are usually obtained through integral transform techniques such as Fourier-Bessel transforms. However, the original formulation of Carrier and Greenspan (1958 J Fluid Mech) and its variant Carrier et al. (2003 J Fluid Mech) involve evaluation integrals. Since elliptic integrals are highly singular as discussed in Carrier et al. (2003), this solution methodology requires either approximation of the associated integrands by smooth functions or selection of regular initial/boundary data. It should be noted that Kanoglu (2004 J Fluid Mech) partly resolves this issue by simplifying the resulting integrals in closed form.\nHere, the hodograph transform approach is coupled with the classical eigenfunction expansion method rather than integral transform techniques and a new analytical model for nonlinear long wave propagation over a plane beach is derived. This approach is based on the solution methodology used in Aydın & Kanoglu (2007 CMES-Comp Model Eng) for wind set-down relaxation problem.\nIn contrast to classical initial- or boundary-value problem solutions, here, the NSW equations are formulated to yield an initial-boundary value problem (IBVP) solution. In general, initial wave proﬁle with nonzero initial velocity distribution is assumed and the ﬂow variables are given in the form of Fourier-Bessel series. The results reveal that the developed method allows accurate estimation of the spatial and temporal variation of the ﬂow quantities, i.e., free-surface height and depth-averaged velocity, with much less computational effort compared to the integral transform techniques such as Carrier et al. (2003), Kanoglu (2004), Tinti & Tonini (2005 J Fluid Mech), and Kanoglu & Synolakis (2006 Phys Rev Lett).\nAcknowledgments: This work is funded by project ASTARTE- Assessment, STrategy And Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe.

For example, the study of solar radio bursts, which have been shown to cause serious disruptions of technologies at Earth, are essential for advancing our knowledge and understanding of solar flares and their relationship to coronal mass ejections and solar energetic particles, as well as the underlying particle acceleration mechanisms associated with these processes. In addition, radio coverage of the solar atmosphere could yield completely new insights into the variations of output solar energy, including Alfven wave propagation through the solar atmosphere and into the solar wind, which can potentially modulate and disturb the solar wind and Earth’s geospace environment. In this presentation we discuss the development, construction, and testing of the South Pole, Antarctica, Solar Radio Telescope that is planned for installation at South Pole. The system will allow for 24-hour continuous, long-term observations of the sun across the 1-18 GHz frequency band and allow for truly continuous solar observations. We show that this system will enable unique scientific investigations of the solar atmosphere.",

The UVIS HSP (High Speed Photometer) collects photons with an effective wavelength λeff = 0.15 μm within a 6.4 mrad x 6.0 mrad field of view while, when operating in occultation mode, the VIMS instrument collects photons with λeff = 2.9 μm incident on a single pixel of angular dimensions 0.5 mrad x 0.25 mrad. Starlight is diffracted through an angle of θ ~ 1.22λeff/2a by ring particles of radius a. Due to the smaller angular dimensions of the VIMS pixel and longer measured wavelength, starlight can be diffracted out of its field of view by small particles (a~ 9 mm) and not replaced by diffraction from neighboring ring particles. This reduction in the measured intensity of starlight can lead to higher optical depths in VIMS occultations than in UVIS occultations. Because self-gravity wakes introduce additional differences in measured optical depths due to differences in viewing geometry, here we compare measurements in the C ring and Cassini Division where self-gravity wakes are not present. We find evidence of sub-cm particles in both the C Ring and Cassini Division. Minimum particles in the C Ring are relatively constant with radial distance from Saturn, with a mean of ~6mm. There is an increasing trend in minimum particle size outward through the Cassini Division.",

            "abstract": "The Strait of Georgia is a strongly stratified, deep body of water located between Vancouver Island and the mainland of British Columbia and is connected to the Pacific Ocean via the Strait of Juan de Fuca to the south and Johnstone Strait to the north. It is on average 220 km in length and 30 km wide and its maximum depth is 420 m. During the winter months, coastal communities in the Strait of Georgia are at risk to flooding caused by storm surges, a natural hazard that occurs when a strong wind storm with low atmospheric pressure coincides with an unusually high tide. This study presents storm surge hindcasts of significant events between 2006 and 2009 using a numerical model of the Straits of Georgia, Juan de Fuca, Johnstone and Puget Sound (together the Salish Sea). The model is based on the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) in a regional configuration. Realistic stratification is produced by including input from the surrounding rivers. A discussion on the sensitivity of modelled surge amplitude to open boundary conditions and atmospheric forcing will be presented. As barotropic models have previously shown, the surge entering the domain from the Pacific Ocean contributes most significantly. Surge amplitudes are found to be greater within the Strait of Georgia than those in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Local wind patterns cause spatial variations in the strength of the surge in the Strait of Georgia, generally leading to stronger surges on the Mainland side of the Strait.",

            "abstract": "In the field, fractures may be isolated or connected to fluid reservoirs anywhere along the perimeter of a fracture. These boundaries affect fluid circulation, flow paths and communication with external reservoirs. The transport of drop like collections of colloidal-sized particles (particle swarms) in open and partially closed systems was studied.\nA uniform aperture synthetic fracture was constructed using two blocks (100 x 100 x 50 mm) of transparent acrylic placed parallel to each other. The fracture was fully submerged a tank filled with 100cSt silicone oil. Fracture apertures were varied from 5-80 mm. Partially closed systems were created by sealing the sides of the fracture with plastic film. The four boundary conditions study were: (Case 1) open, (Case 2) closed on the sides, (Case 3) closed on the bottom, and (Case 4) closed on both the sides and bottom of the fracture. A 15 µL dilute suspension of soda-lime glass particles in oil (2% by mass) were released into the fracture. Particle swarms were illuminated using a green (525 nm) LED array and imaged with a CCD camera.\nThe presence of the additional boundaries modified the speed of the particle swarms (see figure). In Case 1, enhanced swarm transport was observed for a range of apertures, traveling faster than either very small or very large apertures. In Case 2, swarm velocities were enhanced over a larger range of fracture apertures than in any of the other cases. Case 3 shifted the enhanced transport regime to lower apertures and also reduced swarm speed when compared to Case 2. Finally, Case 4 eliminated the enhanced transport regime entirely.\nCommunication between the fluid in the fracture and an external fluid reservoir resulted in enhanced swarm transport in Cases 1-3. The non-rigid nature of a swarm enables drag from the fracture walls to modify the swarm geometry. The particles composing a swarm reorganize in response to the fracture, elongating the swarm and maintaining its density. Unlike a drop or solid sphere, fracture boundaries do not exclusively decelerate swarm motion but instead produce enhanced swarm transport.\nAcknowledgments: This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Geosciences Research Program under Award Number (DE-FG02-09ER16022).",

            "abstract": "Bay-head deltas (BHD), along with their adjacent floodplains serve as storage sites for lithogenic and organic material on millennial time scales and are biogeochemically active sites on daily to decadal time scales, contributing to global nutrient and carbon cycles. BHD host unique, highly diverse ecosystems such as the pristine swamp forest and hardwood bottomlands, of the Lower Roanoke River, NC. The global value of ecosystem services provided by wetlands within natural BHD is 2.5 to 2.8 mln 2007$/km2/year. BHD are very sensitive to changes in sedimentation and to changes in the rate of sea-level rise.\nCore descriptions, 14C geo-chronologies and grain-size analyses show that the Roanoke BHD in North Carolina, USA experienced two episodes of retreat in late Holocene. The first event occurred around ca 3500 cal. yr. BC and is recognized as a prominent flooding surface separating the delta plain environment, below, from interdistributary bay, above. Across the flooding surface rates of sediment accumulation decreased from 1.8-3.3 mm/year to 0.5-0.6 mm/year. That change was associated with increased sediment accommodation. Sedimentation rates were keeping up with the low rates of sea-level rise until 1600-1700 AD. During that time, the delta started to rapidly accrete and the interdistributary bay was buried with delta plain and prodelta sediment. This occurred in response to the low rates of sea-level rise at that time (-0.1 to 0.47 mm/year) and the release of large quantities of sediments associated with the initiation of agriculture by European settlers in the drainage basin. The second episode of retreat was initiated during the 19th century when the rate of sea-level rose to 2.1 mm/year. During that time, agricultural practices improved, decreasing the amount of sediments delivered to the mouth of the Roanoke River. Under these conditions, the delta started backstepping. Analyses of historical maps, aerial photography, and side-scan sonar data show that between 1860 and 1954, 0.49 km2 of delta plain in the study area was lost. Following the construction of a series of dams, between 1947 and 1963 AD, the BHD decreased in size by another 0.12 km2. Furthermore, studies of bathymetry maps revealed changes in water depth from 0 to -2.25 m between 1860 and 2013, which indicate additional vertical erosion.",

            "abstract": "El-Nino is the most important climate scale oscillation in the tropical atmosphere and earlier studies have shown that it impacts weather in different parts of the world. Since the long-term stability of wind resource is a primary requirement for the reliability of wind power generation, any modulation of the wind resource by the El-Nino constitutes valuable information for efficient harvesting of wind.\nIn this study, we construct the global wind resource as described in Gunturu & Schlosser (2012) and use the method of composites to understand the impact of the El-Nino on the global wind resource. The results show that the impact of the El-Nino is to decrease the wind resource in the central United States, southern Australia and north central Africa. Further, interestingly, the wind resource increases in the Nordic sea and the continental areas around it. The Deccan plateau region of India also has reduced WPD due to the El-Nino as shown by the composites. On the other hand, the central US and southern Australia have increased WPD due to La-Nina and the resource decreases in India. The statistically significant results will be further discussed for their implications to the long term stability of the wind resource in the different regions of the world. We also substantiate the results with other suitable metrics.",

            "abstract": "Significant oxidation chemistry occurs in the atmosphere in and above forests. In forests where levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) are low, this chemistry is influenced primarily by the emissions and chemistry of highly reactive Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs), which both destroy hydroxyl (OH, the main oxidant), and may produce it. Quantifying OH in forest environments is crucial to a proper understanding of the specific oxidation mechanisms taking place. In some other low-NOx / high-BVOC environments, OH measurements have been found to be several times higher than predicted by models, leading to concern that perhaps the current BVOC oxidation mechanisms are missing some OH-producing chemistry. The Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) presents an excellent opportunity to closely examine these mechanisms as well as the recycling of OH thanks to its extensive suite of measurements taken in an Alabama forest during summer 2013. OH and HO2 measurements made with the Ground-based Tropospheric Hydrogen Oxides Sensor (GTHOS) are compared to the results of a photochemical box model constrained by the other measurements taken at SOAS. For this presentation, we examine the discrepancy between the measurements and the model output and discuss potential sources for this discrepancy.",

            "abstract": "The Uintah Basin, an oil and natural gas extraction field in Utah, experienced extremely high levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ozone during the winter of 2013 – up to 100 ppmv carbon and 150 ppbv O3. Here we interpret VOCs measured during an ozone formation event from 31 Jan 2013 to 8 Feb 2013. Ratios of VOCs show strong diurnal cycles and week-long trends.\nA simple analysis was applied to ratios of aromatic VOCs measured by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) to explain these trends and to estimate emission rates of aromatic VOCs from oil and natural gas extraction, VOC emission ratios relative to benzene, and ambient [OH]. The analysis incorporates the following assumptions: (1) the source composition of emitted VOCs and their emission rates were temporally and spatially constant, and (2) the removal of VOCs was governed by reaction with OH, diurnal profile of which is constrained by measured photolysis rates. The main findings are (1) the emission rate of methane, extrapolated from the emission rate of benzene, is on the same order as an independent estimate from aircraft measurements of methane in 2012, (2) the derived aromatic emission ratios are consistent with source contributions from both oil and gas producing wells, and (3) calculated daily OH concentrations are low, peaking at 1x106 molecules cm-3.\nThe analysis was extended to investigate secondary production of oxygenated VOCs measured by PTR-MS. The analysis is able to explain daytime production, but it does not adequately explain nighttime behavior, which may be affected by complex deposition to snow and ice surfaces. The relative carbon mass of primary and secondary compounds was calculated and compared to observations. At the end of the ozone formation event (day 6), our analysis predicts that secondary (oxidized) VOCs should comprise about 40% of total carbon mass. However, only 12% of these compounds are accounted for by measured oxygenated VOCs and organic aerosol. Additionally, formation rates of measured oxygenated VOCs did not sum to the total primary compound oxidation rate. The disparity is likely due to both incomplete measurements of oxygenated products and VOC loss to deposition.",

Discharge to surface water will occur through a groundwater-surface water interaction zone with complex hydrogeology and biogeochemistry that is stimulated by the overlapping nutrient regimes of groundwater and surface water. The reactivity of pertechnetate in reduced sediments from this zone was investigated to determine effects of biogenic ferrous-Fe and sulfide-S on Tc(VII) reduction rate; and the resulting speciation, mineral association, and physical location of Tc(IV).\n99Tc(VII) was reduced to near detection (<10-9 Mol/L) over periods of days to months. Tc(VII) reduction rate was first order in [Tc(VII)]aq and sediment mass, but correlations with specific biogenic reductant concentrations [(Fe(II), ferrous mono-sulfide] were not found. Tc(IV) was isolated to fine-grained aggregates (0.1 to 0.5 mm) of “mud”, consisting of primary mineral material embedded within a phyllosilicate or clay matrix. EXAFS revealed that product Tc(IV) existed as combinations of a Tc(IV)O2-like phase ,Tc(IV)-Fe surface clusters, and/or TcSx. Ferrous mono-sulfide was implicated as a more selective reductant. Migration of Tc(VII) through the interaction zone will be controlled by water residence time and the density and spatial distribution of fine-grained aggregates that host reductive biogeochemical processes in otherwise coarse-textured, partially oxygenated sediments.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dynamics of natural ecosystems are influenced by disturbance regimes of various frequencies and magnitudes. With global change, these disturbances are projected to increase in frequency and/or magnitude and may have significant effects on future net carbon balance, especially in high latitude ecosystems where carbon stocks are among the largest on Earth and climate change is substantial. In Alaska, permafrost degradation and fire in the boreal and arctic regions and logging in the southern coastal region are the main disturbances that affect ecosystems. Large uncertainties related to the effects of these disturbances on the capacity of these regions to store carbon still exist mainly due to difficulty in representing permafrost degradation in current ecosystem models. We ran the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM), which explicitly simulates the carbon cycle and permafrost dynamics, coupled with a disturbance model (the Alaska Frame Based Ecosystem Code, ALFRESCO) to assess the relative importance of permafrost thaw, wildfire, and forest management on historical and projected carbon balance and carbon stocks in Alaska, from 1950 to 2100, at a 1-km resolution. Our simulations showed that the increase in plant productivity in response to warming in boreal and arctic regions is offset by soil carbon loss due to permafrost degradation and wildfire combustion during both historical and future simulations. Fire disturbances act as a catalyst accelerating permafrost degradation and associated soil carbon loss. In addition, our preliminary results for south coastal regions of Alaska indicate that logging of second growth forests could influence carbon dynamics in that region. Overall, these results have implications for land management strategies and illustrate the importance of taking into account multiple types of disturbance regimes in ecosystem models for Alaska.",

            "abstract": "Arid Central Asia is roughly bisected at the Tianshan Mountains (a northern offshoot of the Tibetan Plateau) into an eastern and western area, each with unique climatological characteristics. The eastern desert (~75-115E, 35-55N) has a summer precipitation maximum, and the western desert (~50-75E, 35-55N) has a winter precipitation maximum. A new high-resolution (50 km atmosphere/land) global coupled climate model is run with the Tianshan Mountains removed to determine whether these mountains are responsible for the climatological east-west differentiation of Arid Central Asia. Multi-centennial simulations for the control and no Tianshan runs highlight statistically significant effects of the Tianshan. The Tianshan are found to fully explain the spatial separation of the deserts, but only partially explain their differences in precipitation climatology. The Tianshan also create a few unexpected remote effects: 1) enhancement of the east Asian monsoon due to the Tianshan's stationary wave train, and 2) remote warming of mountains farther east due to reduction of snow cover and corresponding albedo decrease. Arid Central Asia comprises the only significant midlatitude deserts, and is the site of widespread grassland degradation in recent years. This study helps clarify the basic climate of this unique region, and hopefully paves the way for better understanding and prediction of how it will respond to future climate and land-use change.",

            "abstract": "Drought is an ever growing concern within the United States and Mexico. Extended periods of below-average precipitation can adversely affect agricultural production and ecosystems, impact local water resources and create conditions prime for wildfire. DroughtView (www.droughtview.arizona.edu) is a new on-line resource for scientists, natural resource managers, and the public that brings a new perspective to remote-sensing based drought impact assessment that is not currently available. DroughtView allows users to monitor the impact of drought on vegetation cover for the entire continental United States and the northern regions of Mexico. As a spatially and temporally dynamic geospatial decision support tool, DroughtView is an excellent educational introduction to the relationship between remotely sensed vegetation condition and drought. The system serves up Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data generated from 250 meter 16-day composite Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from 2000 to the present. Calculation of difference from average, previous period and previous year greenness products provide the user with a proxy for drought conditions and insight on the secondary impacts of drought, such as wildfire. The various image products and overlays are served up via the ArcGIS Server platform. DroughtView serves as a useful tool to introduce and teach vegetation time series analysis to those unfamiliar with the science. High spatial resolution imagery is available as a reference layer to locate points of interest, zoom in and export images for implementation in reports and presentations. Animation of vegetation time series allows users to examine ecosystem disturbances and climate data is also available to examine the relationship between precipitation, temperature and vegetation. The tool is mobile friendly allowing users to access the system while in the field. The systems capabilities and applications will be demonstrated live during the poster session. Expansion of DroughtView includes future plans to add snow products, phenology data and climate scenarios. Extension of the spatial coverage of the data to other parts of the world is also planned.",

            "abstract": "Carbon fluxes in subarctic peatlands could change significantly in response to high-latitude warming. To examine the sensitivity of peatland carbon storage to changes in regional climate, moisture, and disturbance, we measured carbon accumulation and peat characteristics in cores through the transition from the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM, ~6-4 ka cal. yr. BP) to the Neoglacial cooling (NGC, ~4-0 ka) as possible analogs to future climate change. We sampled six cores from northern Manitoba and seven cores across southeast Labrador, Canada. These regional contrasts permitted analysis of net moisture regimes on carbon accumulation. We used calibrated 14C dates, percent carbon, and bulk density measurements to determine long-term carbon accumulation rates for the Holocene. Areal charcoal concentrations were measured as a proxy for historic fire severity, which may mediate the climate-carbon accumulation relationship. Carbon accumulation rates in Labrador showed a clear increase of 29.6 ± 2.4 g C m-2 yr-1 during the local HTM and a subsequent decrease of 15.9 ± 2.9 g C m-2 yr-1 during the NGC indicating possible influence of regional temperature on carbon dynamics in eastern Canada. In contrast, the Manitoba peatlands did not show a clear relationship between climate and carbon accumulation. Fires were common and severe in Manitoba and often slowed sedimentation rate and C storage, but were rarely present in Labrador. Local variables, including peatland development and fire, may therefore play a larger role in controlling carbon accumulation in the continental interior. The results from these two subaratic regions complicate general hypotheses that high latitude peatlands will be either carbon sinks or sources in the upcoming decades.",

The network is a multi-national collaboration consisting of 46 newly constructed continuous Global Positioning Systems (cGPS) and 21 refurbished existing GPS stations, all co-located with meteorological sensors. One recommendation of the COCONet working group was to improve the vertical reference frame for long-term sea level monitoring. A COCONet supplement was awarded by the NSF to further address this particular objective through the co-location of GPS and tide gauges. This COCOnet infrastructure, along with the new tide gauges, will have broad scientific implications for hazards mitigation, solid earth, and atmospheric science research.\nUNAVCO engineers have meet with members of the Caribbean tide gauge community to establish target locations and design station layout. Allocated NSF funds allow for the construction of two complete new tide gauge systems each with two complimentary cGPS. Following the recommendations of NOAA and the sea level monitoring community, the two “new” locales will be Port Royal, Jamaica and Puerto Morelos, Mexico. Both locations had previously existing, but currently non-operational tide gauges. UNAVCO engineers will install a Sutron Radar Level Recorder and a backup pressure sensor tide gauge with GOES satellite telemetry. Tide data will be freely available by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (www.ioc-sealevelmonitoring.org).\nThe NSF supplement also provided funds for adding cGPS to two additional locations where currently functioning tide gauge systems exist. Proposed locations for this additional infrastructure are Barahona, Dominican Republic and Bocas del Toro, Panama. All four locations will feature two standard COCONet cGPS systems consisting of a Trimble Choke Ring GNSS antenna, Trimble NetR9 GPS receiver, and a Vaisala meteorological sensor. All GPS data will be collected, processed and distributed via standard COCONet archiving and processing along with raw meteorological data at coconet.unavco.org.",

We use a combination of remote sensing data from ground-based radar observations (Arecibo and Green Bank Telescope at wavelengths of 12.6 cm and 70 cm) and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft (Diviner, Mini-RF) to determine how the regolith structure varies across volcanic terrains and possible future landing sites. Radar can detect buried units and provide a measure of roughness, while thermal infrared data provides complimentary information on the surface and near-surface rock abundance in the upper centimeters. Radar and infrared wavelengths are also sensitive to different sized rocks, which can be used to determine where there are increased numbers centimeter-sized rocks. A comparison of these data sets reveals significant differences in regolith stratigraphy across targets. For example, small rilles on the Aristarchus Plateau to the northeast of the Constellation Aristarchus 2 site are surrounded by rock-poor deposits and are likely a secondary source of pyroclastic materials. Some rilles, such as Rima Birt, are surrounded by pyroclastics that change in depth and/or embedded rock abundance along the length of the rille. We will present results from our data analysis and subsequent mapping, focusing on rilles, pyroclastic deposits, and Constellation Region of Interest targets including the Apollo sites.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the surface radiation budget is important for several reasons. At the global and large temporal scales, it should balance with the sum of surface latent and sensible heat fluxes and ocean heating. At regional scales, it is an indispensable boundary condition for ocean or snow models or any other models that need energy input to the surface. NASA’s Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project provides surface irradiance data products for a range of temporal and spatial scales computed using a radiative transfer model initialized using satellite-derived cloud and aerosol properties. Other inputs to the radiative transfer model include temperature and humidity profiles from NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office’s (GMAO) reanalysis. The CERES team uses more than 80 surface observation sites located over land and ocean to evaluate computed irradiances. When computed monthly 1° by 1° gridded mean downward irradiances are compared with 10 years of observed irradiances, the bias averaged over all land and ocean sites are, respectively, -1.7 Wm-2 and 4.7 Wm-2 for shortwave and -1.0 Wm-2 and -2.0 Wm-2 for longwave. The shortwave agreement is significantly better than other satellite-based surface irradiance products. One of reasons for the better agreement is careful treatment of diurnal cycle of clouds by merging 3-hourly geostationary satellite-derived cloud properties. In addition, computed surface irradiance variability shows a remarkable agreement with observed variability. However, these data sets have their shortcomings. The uncertainty in nighttime surface longwave irradiance over polar regions is larger than that of other regions primarily due to the difficulty of cloud detection and large uncertainties in skin temperature and near-surface temperature and humidity. The large uncertainty in polar region surface irradiances hampers, for example, investigation of surface radiation budget changes in response to changes in sea ice extent. In this presentation, we present an evaluation of the current CERES products and discuss ways these products can be improved in the future.",

The idea is that the effects of data compression on the\noriginal data should not be statistically distinguishable from the\nnatural variability of the climate system as demonstrated by an\nensemble. Ultimately, to convince climate scientists that it is\nacceptable to use lossy data compression, direct experience is\nnecessary. Therefore, output from the CESM-LE project is an ideal\nvenue for further evaluating data compression.\nWe report on the results of a blind experiment evaluating the impact\nof data compression on output from the CESM-LE project.

            "abstract": "The recovery of the critical zone following disturbances such as wildfire is not fully understood. Wildfires have increased in size and intensity in western US forests in recent years and these fires influence soil microbial communities, both in composition and overall biomass. Studies have typically shown a 50% post-fire decline in overall microbial biomass (µg per g soil) that can persist for years. There is however, some variability in the severity of biomass decline, and its relationship with burn severity and landscape position have not yet been studied. Since microbial biomass has a cascade of impacts in soil systems, from helping control the rate and diversity the biogeochemical processes occurring, to promoting soil fertility, to impacting the nature and structure of soil carbon (C), fire’s lasting impact on it is one mechanistic determinant of the overall post-fire recovery of impacted ecosystems. Additionally, microbial biomass measurements hold potential for testing and incorporation into land surface models (NoahMP, CLM, etc.) in order to improve estimates of long-term effects of climate change and disturbances such as fire on the C cycle. In order to refine our understanding of the impact of fire on microbial biomass and then relate that to biogeochemical processes and ecosystem recovery, we used chloroform fumigation extraction to quantify total microbial biomass C (Cmic ). One year after the June 2013 Thompson Ridge fire in the Jemez River Basin Critical Zone Observatory, we are measuring the Cmic of 22 sites across a gradient of burn severities and 4 control unburned sites, from six depth intervals at each site (0-2, 2-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, and 30-40 cm). We hypothesize that the decrease in microbial biomass in burned sites relative to control sites will correlate with changes in soil biogeochemistry related to burn severity; and that the extent of the impact on biomass will be inversely related to depth in the soil column. Additionally, as the project progresses, we will relate microbial biomass to microbial functional assays as proxy for biogeochemical activity, and test variation by landscape position and aspect.",

            "abstract": "Forest age and local valley morphometry strongly influence the form and function of mountain streams in Colorado. Streams in valleys with old growth forest (>350 years) have extensive log jam complexes that create multi-thread channel reaches with extensive pool habitat and large depositional areas. Streams in younger unmanaged forests (e.g., 120 years old) and intensively managed forests have much fewer log jams and lower wood loads. These are single-thread streams dominated by riffles and with little depositional habitat. We hypothesized that log jam streams would retain more organic matter and have higher metabolism, leading to greater production of stream macroinvertebrates and trout. Log jam reaches should also have greater emergence of adult aquatic insects, and consequently have higher densities of riparian spiders taking advantage of these prey. Surficial organic matter was 3-fold higher in old-growth streams, and these streams had much higher ecosystem respiration. Insect production (g m2 y-1) was similar among forest types, but fish density was four times higher in old-growth streams with copious log jams. However, at the valley scale, insect production (g m-1 valley-1) and trout density (number m-1 valley-1) was 2-fold and 10-fold higher, respectively, in old growth streams. This finding is because multi-thread reaches created by log jams have much greater stream area and stream length per meter of valley than single-thread channels. The more limited response of macroinvertebrates may be related to fish predation. Trout in old growth streams had similar growth rates and higher fat content than fish in other streams in spite of occurring at higher densities and higher elevation/colder temperatures. This suggests that the positive fish effect observed in old growth streams is related to greater availability of invertebrate prey, which is consistent with our original hypothesis. Preliminary analyses suggest that spider densities do not respond strongly to differences in stream morphology, but rather to changes in elevation and associated air temperatures. These results demonstrate strong indirect effects of forest age and valley morphometry on organic matter storage and animal secondary production in streams that is mediated by direct effects associated with the presence or absence of logjams.",

            "abstract": "The Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) mission has provided for the first time solar spectral irradiance (SSI) observations over a full solar cycle time period with wavelength coverage from the X-ray through the near infrared. This paper will discuss the lessons-learned from SORCE including the need to develop more effective methods to track on-orbit spectroscopic response and sensitivity degradation. This is especially important in using these data products as input to modern day chemistry-climate models that require very broad spectral coverage with moderate-to-high spectral and temporal resolution to constrain the solar component to the atmospheric response. A basic requirement to obtain this essential climate record is to 1) perform preflight radiometric calibrations that are traceable SI standards along with a complete specification of the instruments spectroscopic response, and 2) design the instrument to have the ability to perform instrument-only sensitivity corrections to objectively account for on-orbit degradation. The development of the NIST SIRCUS (National Institute of Science and Technology, Sources for Irradiance and Radiance Calibration with Uniform Sources) now permits the full characterization of the spectral radiometer’s response, and on-orbit degradation characterization through comparisons of redundant detectors and spectrometers appears to be the most practical method to perform these corrections for the near ultraviolet through the near infrared. Going forward, we discuss a compact spectral radiometer development that will couple with advances in CubeSat technology to allow for shorter mission lengths, relatively inexpensive development and launch costs, and reduce the risk of data gaps between successive missions without compromising measurement accuracy. We also discuss the development of a radiometric solar imager that will both greatly improve the interpretation of existing Sun-as-a-star irradiance observations and provide a bridge from our current irradiance capabilities to future high spatial/temporal resolution solar physics assets such as the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST).",

The cratonic mantle beneath Lac de Gras is stratified with shallow (<145 km) oxidized ultradepleted peridotites and pyroxenites with evidence for carbonatitic metasomatism, underlain by reduced and less depleted peridotites metasomatized by kimberlite melts [3,4]. Peridotites analyzed so far have H2O contents in ppm weight of 7-100 in their olivines, 58 to 255 in their orthopyroxenes (opx), 11 to 84 in their garnet, and 139 in one clinopyroxene. A pyroxenite contains 58 ppm H2O in opx and 5 ppm H2O in its olivine and garnet. Olivine and garnet from the deep peridotites have a range of water contents extending to higher values than those from the shallow ones. The FTIR spectra of olivines from the shallow samples have more prominent Group II OH bands compared to the olivines from the deep samples, consistent with a more oxidized mantle environment [5]. The range of olivine water content is similar to that observed in Kaapvaal craton peridotites at the same depths (129-184 km [1]) but does not extend to as high values as those from Udachnaya (Siberian craton [6]). The Slave, Kaapvaal and Siberian cratons will be compared in terms of water content distribution, controls and role in cratonic root longevity.\n[1] Peslier et al. 2010 Nature 467, 78-81.\n[2] Aulbach et al. 2007 CMP 154, 409-427.\n[3] Creighton et al. 2009 CMP 157, 491-504.\n[4] Aulbach et al. 2013 CG 352, 153-169.\n[5] Bai & Kohlstedt 1993 PCM 19, 460-471.\n[6] Doucet et al. 2014 GCA 137, 159-187.",

            "abstract": "Solar irradiance – both total irradiance and spectral irradiance— are primary climate data variables. Because of absorption and scattering by our intervening atmosphere accurate measurements of the Sun are only realized from space observations beginning in about 1978. The long-term accuracies of the resulting data sets are limited by unidentified and uncertain on-orbit instrument degradation. Nevertheless, from numerous observing programs solar variability has been well established for short and intermediate times scales, with additional clear indications of decadal variability associated with the 11-year solar cycle.\nHow can today’s solar irradiance measurements be reliably compared with those made in the future, and how will the resulting comparison stand the test of time? There is one technique that shows great promise. The Sun is a star — more or less variable like any and all other stars. Stellar astronomers have a technique of establishing a star’s variability with precision of 0.01%, and over arbitrarily long periods of time. From the ground and from space they have success by simply comparing the irradiance of a target star to that of a number of standard stars. (The key here is that there exist many standard stars, and outliers are easily identified and removed from the ensemble.) For stellar comparisons it is straightforward to use a single instrument — same optics and detectors — to observe stars differing by several orders of magnitude in brightness. To observe the Sun and stars with a single instrument is far more problematic as there are easily eight to twelve orders of magnitude differences in brightness.\nThe SOLSTICE (Solar Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment) has now been flown twice — on UARS from 1991 to 2005 and on SORCE from 2003 to the present. The SOLSTICE is an ultraviolet spectral instrument measuring irradiance from 115 nm to 300 nm, and it is intentionally designed to observe both the Sun and selected standard stars. In addition to accommodating more than eight orders of magnitude dynamic range, the SOLSTICE optical design and data analyses must account for subtle differences in the solar and stellar observations. This paper will consider the success and limitations of the SOLSTICE UV irradiance data record.",

            "abstract": "Soils within the McMurdo Dry Valleys are known to respire carbon dioxide (CO2), but considerable debate surrounds the contributing sources and mechanisms that drive temporal variability. While some of the CO2 is of biological origin, other known contributors to variability include geochemical sources within, or beneath, the soil column. The relative contribution from each of these sources will depend on seasonal and environmental drivers such as temperature and wind that exert influence on temporal dynamics. To supplement a long term CO2­ surface flux monitoring station that has now recorded fluxes over three full annual cycles, in January 2014 an automated flux and depth concentration monitoring system was installed in the Spaulding Pond area of Taylor Valley, along with standard meteorological sensors, to assist in defining source contributions through time. During two weeks of data we observed marked diel variability in CO2 concentrations within the profile (~100 ppm CO2 above or below atmospheric), and of CO2 moving across the soil surface. The pattern at many depths suggested an alternating diel-scale transition from source to sink that seemed clearly correlated with temperature-driven changes in the solubility of CO2 in water films. This CO2 solution storage flux was very highly coupled to soil temperature. A small depth source of unknown origin also appeared to be present. A controlled laboratory soil experiment was conducted to confirm the magnitude of fluxes into and out of soil water films, and confirmed the field results and temperature dependence. Ultimately, this solution storage flux needs to be well understood if the small biological fluxes from these soils are to be properly quantified and monitored for change. Here, we present results from the 2013/2014 field season and these supplementary experiments, placed in the context of 3 year long term continuous measurement of soil CO2 flux within the Dry Valleys.",

            "abstract": "A goal of Cassini’s extended mission is to examine the seasonal variations of Saturn’s magnetosphere, moons, and rings. Recently we showed that the thermal plasma between the main rings and Enceladus exhibited a time dependence that we attributed to a seasonally variable source of oxygen from the main rings (Elrod et al., 2012). Such a temporal variation was subsequently seen in the energetic ion composition (Christon et al., 2013; 2014). Here we incorporate the most recent measurements by the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) into our earlier analysis (Elrod et al., 2012) and our modeling (Tseng et al., 2013a) of the thermal plasma in the region between the main rings and the orbit of Enceladus. Data taken in 2012, well past equinox for which the northern side of the main rings were illuminated, appear consistent with a seasonal variation. Although the thermal plasma in this region comes from two sources that have very different radial and temporal trends, the extended ring atmosphere and the Enceladus torus, the heavy ion density is found to exhibit a steep radial dependence that is similar for the years examined. Using our chemical model, we show that this dependence requires either a radial dependence for Enceladus torus that differs significantly from recent models or, as we suggest here, enhanced heavy ion quenching/neutralization with decreasing distance from the edge of the main rings. We examine the possible physical processes and suggest that the presence of small grains and the precipitation of the inward diffusing high-energy background radiation onto the edge of the main rings play important roles.",

            "abstract": "Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a heterogeneous mixture of components that are not equally biologically available, including light, plant derived material, dissolved organic carbon, and mineral-associated organic matter (MOM). Radiocarbon ages of bulk SOC average across this heterogeneity. Of particular interest is whether there are small amounts of very old OC (the so-called ‘passive’ pool) that can mask the fact that much of the OM is much younger. MOM has been shown to be older than the light fraction and DOC, but MOM is also a mixture of old and young material. This study seeks to clarify the quantity of C persisting on millennial time scales at different depths in the soil profile, and what factors allow this fraction to be more persistent than other fractions.\nWe studied the fraction and age of C of the most chemically and physically stable fraction we could isolate from five European soils with differing land use, parent material, and soil type. First we isolated the MOM fraction by density, and then oxidized the MOM fraction with H2O2 to remove the labile C. The oxidation resistant residue was analyzed for C content and radiocarbon signature.\nThe oxidation procedure removed 70-95% of the MOM fraction; the residue had a consistently older radiocarbon signature than the initial MOM, indicating that the C removed was younger than the bulk average. This stable fraction ranged from 100 radiocarbon years Before Present (BP) in the top 5 cm, to 10,000 years BP at the 30-40 cm depth. Non-crystalline iron concentrations were correlated with the absolute amount of SOC protected from oxidation, but not its proportion or age. With the exception of a tilled cropland site, all examined profiles exhibited a nearly linear depletion in radiocarbon signature with depth in both the protected and oxidizable MOM, confirming that the most chemically and physically stable C is oldest at the deepest point in a 50 cm profile. Ongoing work on this study will further elucidate how the origin of the MOM (microbe-, plant-, or parent material-derived) relates to the radiocarbon age along the soil depth profile.",

Since mature trees can live in excess of 2000 years, using the interannual variability in the oxygen and carbon stable isotope composition of tree rings obtained from trees growing in different parts of the redwood range holds the potential for obtaining a long-term record of California’s coastal climate, including the history of temperatures, low cloud / fog, rainfall and associated climatic drivers of their variation. We analyzed the oxygen and carbon stable isotope composition of tree ring cellulose from both tree cores and whole cross-sectional slabs and compared these data to several regional climate indicies and to published growth chronologies to obtain the long-view on California’s coastal climate.\nSeveral highlights will be presented and discussed. These include: (1) redwoods faithfully record water sources they use in the oxygen stable isotope composition of their tree ring cellulose; (2) these is both strong watershed- and regional-scale coherence; (3) redwood tree ring carbon isotope composition shows its strongest correlations to tree water status, stand-scale humidity, and at the regional scale to what we term “summer precipitation” anomalies (lack of rain with presence of fog); also (4) that carbon stable isotope composition is very sensitive to within tree and stand microclimate while oxygen stable isotope composition seems to be sensitive to topographic site factors like slope position and proximity to riparian / gully habitats; (5) multivariate climatic analyses reveal that summertime drought recorded in the isotope excursions are most strongly linked to atmospheric circulation anomalies; and (6) that redwood tree rings and their isotope composition provide great potential for reconstructing high-resolution paleo-climate along the California coast.",

Charge exchange introduces Rayleigh Taylor (RT) like instability in the nose region of HP, the strong flow shear excites Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) like instability in the flanks while mixed RT-KH modes are unstable in the shoulder region in between. ENA are found to be essential for the instability of flanks in the presence of magnetic field stabilization. Further, the mixing of the LISM plasma with solar wind (SW) plasma is across the HP caused by these instabilities is examined. The magnetic field in the OHS and IHS are oriented approximately parallel to each (on either side of HP). Such field lines normally do not experience reconnection However, we show that in the nonlinear phase, local mushroom like structures of RT and RT-KH mode will drag the OHS field lines across HP into the inner heliosheath. Driven by local plasma flows, these field lines will reconnect with magnetic field lines in the HIS. This reconnection of fields in OHS and IHS will greatly enhance the mixing of plasma across the HP. This scenario is examined using Sweet-Parker and Petscheck models of driven reconnection. The reconnection rates and mixing rates with collisional resistivity and anomalous resistivity are evaluated and compared with other mechanisms of mixing to assess the importance of reconnection in plasma mixing across HP.",

Numerous studies have analyzed the effects of parametric and/or structural uncertainties in IAMs, but uncertainties regarding the problem formulation are often overlooked. Here we use the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE) to analyze the effects of uncertainty surrounding the problem formulation. The standard DICE model adopts a single objective to maximize a weighted sum of utilities of per-capita consumption. Decisionmakers, however, may be concerned with a broader range of values and preferences that are not captured by this a priori definition of utility. We reformulate the problem by introducing three additional objectives that represent values such as (i) reliably limiting global average warming to two degrees Celsius and minimizing both (ii) the costs of abatement and (iii) the damages due to climate change. We derive a set of Pareto-optimal solutions over which decisionmakers can trade-off and assess performance criteria a posteriori. We illustrate the potential for myopia in the traditional problem formulation and discuss the capability of this multiobjective formulation to provide decision support.",

The PRVD presents considerable longitudinal variation (with scale size 15°) across the sunset terminator and this variation may act as a seeding perturbation as proposed by Woodman (1994) and Huang and Kelley (1996b). In the present work, we examine the efficiency of this longitudinal variation of the PRVD to act as a seeding for the CII and to give rise to EPB in the absence of any other kind of initial perturbation. To do so, we carried out the CII simulation at the equator in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. We consider a few simplified cases choosing a Gaussian-shaped longitudinal variation of PRVD with various possible minimum and peak values and finally consider a realistic case with a spatial-temporal configuration of PRVD obtained using SAMI2 model. Simulations with simplified cases show that the EPB develops only for minimum value greater than 20 m/s and amplitude (difference between the peak-to-minimum values) greater than 40 m/s. Simulation with a realistic case shows that the PRVD during high solar flux summer satisfies these threshold conditions and with the seeding scale 15°, the EPB of longitudinal size 2° is developed toward east of the PRVD peak.",

            "abstract": "We assess potential changes in crop water requirements and corresponding yields relative to the late 20th century in major crop producing regions of the world by using the Community Land Model (CLM) driven with 21st century meteorology from RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 Community Earth System Model (CESM) simulations. The RCP4.5 simulation allows us to explore the potential for averted societal impacts when compared to the RCP8.5 simulation. We consider the possibility for increased yields and improved water use efficiency under conditions of elevated atmospheric CO2 due to the CO2 fertilization effect (also known as concentration-carbon feedback). We address uncertainty in the current understanding of plant CO2 fertilization by repeating the simulations with and without the CO2 fertilization effect. Simulations without CO2 fertilization represent the radiative effect of elevated CO2 (i.e., warming) without representing the physiological effect of elevated CO2 (enhanced carbon uptake and increased water use efficiency by plants during photosynthesis). Preliminary results suggest that some plants may suffer from increasing heat and drought in much of the world without the CO2 fertilization effect. On the other hand plants (especially C3) tend to grow more with less water when models include the CO2 fertilization effect. Performing 21st century simulations with and without the CO2 fertilization effect brackets the potential range of outcomes. In this work we use the CLM crop model, which includes specific crop types that differ from the model’s default plant functional types in that the crops get planted, harvested, and potentially fertilized and irrigated according to algorithms that attempt to capture human management decisions. We use an updated version of the CLM4.5 that includes cotton, rice, and sugarcane, spring wheat, spring barley, and spring rye, as well as temperate and tropical maize and soybean.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed more than 800 deep and intermediate depth earthquakes (depth>50km and M>5.5), by stacking broadband P-wave pulses recorded globally. By a carefully applied processing we finally obtained more than 600 source time functions, and the associated rupture durations, robustly measured by comparing alternative versions of the same waveform. The obtained durations are used to study the depth dependence and the moment scaling properties for deep seismicity. Given the large number of estimated durations, magnitude scaling, depth-dependence and along-strike variations are analyzed globally and within subduction zones.\nThe global analysis of the dataset shows how, beyond the scatter in the scaled durations, the observed reduction in duration with depth can be explained by increasing wave speed with depth. Furthermore, the self-similar scaling of duration to seismic moment to the 1/3 power is not valid for deep seismicity, suggesting a different behavior from shallow earthquakes.\nWhen comparing different subduction zones, coherent variation of the scaled durations is observed, suggesting a large diversity of intermediate-depth and deep earthquakes exists. The variations are correlated with geometry of the subduction and not to thermal state of the subducting plates.\nWe are in the process of estimating the radiated energy for our dataset as well in order to better constrain the mechanism of deep earthquakes, using the static and dynamic measures of earthquake behavior. Comparison of these and other measures with independent geophysical properties of slabs such as plate age, thermal parameter and convergence rate will be shown, in order to unravel any possible relation between the subduction zone style and earthquake rupture behavior.",

            "abstract": "The ocean contributes approximately one third of global sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere. While nitrification is thought to be the dominant pathway for marine N2O production, mechanisms remain unresolved. Previous studies have carried the implicit assumption that marine N2O originates directly from enzymatic sources. However, abiotic production of N2O is possible via chemical reactions between nitrogenous intermediates and redox active trace metals in seawater. In this study, we investigated N2O production and isotopic composition in treatments with and without added hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and nitric oxide (NO), intermediates in microbial oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, and Fe(III). Addition of substrates to sterile artificial seawater was compared with filtered and unfiltered seawater from Sapelo Island, coastal Georgia, USA. N2O production was observed immediately after addition of Fe(III) in the presence of NH2OH at pH 8 in sterile artificial seawater. Highest N2O production was observed in the presence of Fe(III), NO, and NH2OH. The isotopomer site preference of abiotically produced N2O was consistent with previous studies (31 ± 2 ‰). Higher abiotic N2O production was observed in sterile artificial seawater (salinity: 35 ppt) than filtered Sapelo Island seawater (salinity: 25 ppt) whereas diluted sterile artificial seawater (18 ppt) showed lowest N2O production, suggesting that higher salinity promotes enhanced abiotic N2O production. Addition of Fe(III) to unfiltered Sapelo Island seawater stimulated N2O production. The presence of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), which lack known N2O producing enzymes, in Sapelo Island seawater was confirmed by successful amplification of the archaeal amoA gene, whereas ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), which contain N2O-producing enzymes were undetected. Given the few Fe-containing proteins present in AOA, it is likely that Fe(III) addition promoted N2O production via an abiotic vs. enzymatic N2O mechanism. Overall, this study suggests that abiotic N2O production may be occurring in marine environments where microbial ammonia oxidation occurs in the presence of elevated Fe and/or other redox-active metals, such as coastal areas, oxygen minimum zones, and near the sediment-water interface.",

            "abstract": "In the upper Colorado River basin (UCRB), cool season (October-April) precipitation in the form of snowpack is the most critical factor determining water year runoff, but other climatic factors can also play an important role. In this study, we examine how antecedent soil moisture conditions, spring temperatures, and total cool season precipitation can influence upper Colorado River streamflow, particularly during periods of low flow. First, we evaluate the contributions of these three variables during six major droughts in the UCRB, contrasting the relationships between precipitation, temperature and antecedent soil moisture over these periods. Next, we assess relationships between annual natural flow and cool season precipitation to identify anomalous years when flow is low, but precipitation is above average and when precipitation is low, but flow is above average to determine if temperatures or antecedent soil moisture could influencing these anomalies. Finally, we calibrate a multiple linear regression model to assess the contributions of the three variables in explaining water year streamflow. Models with and without the soil moisture variable are compared to better understand under what conditions this variable may be most influential to streamflow. Preliminary results indicate that spring temperatures are an important factor contributing to low flows, and this may have been most important during the 2000s drought. In a small number of years, it appears that spring temperature and/or antecedent soil moisture can ameliorate the influence a dry winter, or conversely, override wet conditions to result in below average streamflow. In the regression, cool season precipitation explains 66% of the variance in water year runoff. March-July temperature adds 8%, and November soil moisture just 2% explained variance. The contribution of soil moisture appears to be most important to streamflow in years with moist antecedent conditions.",

            "abstract": "Both the ocean circulation and overlying sea ice cover of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas have experienced significant change in recent decades. We use sea ice drift estimates from satellite feature tracking (NSIDC/CERSAT), wind forcing from atmospheric reanalysis products (NCEP-R2/ERA-I/JRA-55), and ice type information from satellite and direct ship-based observations (obtained during the Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project), to investigate the role of wind forcing and ice mechanics in driving these changes.\nAn assessment of ice drift shows reasonable agreement across the different products, revealing interannual variability in the ice flux around the Beaufort Sea. However, clear uncertainties remain in determining the magnitude of these fluxes, especially in regions of low ice concentration. We find an increase in ice export out of the southern Beaufort Sea (into the Chukchi Sea) across all seasons. We find slight differences in the strength of the decadal (1980-2013) trends in the mean seasonal wind curl over the Beaufort Sea, although all reanalysis products indicate a strong and significant increase in anti-cyclonic winds in summer. Analysis of ice drift curl suggests increasing anti-cyclonic drift across all seasons, despite the wind curl showing a similar trend in summer only. The strongest trend in ice drift curl appears to be in autumn, however recent years have seen a strong reduction in this anti-cyclonic drift, likely due to a combination of changes in the wind forcing and sea ice state. The implication of this finding is an enhanced response of the ocean circulation to shifts in atmospheric circulation compared to that experienced prior to 2000.",

We use measurements from the CONTRAST field campaign in the tropical western Pacific to constrain a box model to examine the oxidative capacity of the troposphere in this region. Measurements reveal a background, unpolluted state of the troposphere, with pervasive high O3/low H2O filamentary structures existing in the mid-troposphere; we focus on modeling OH in these distinct chemical environments and investigating the resulting impact on instantaneous lifetimes of species of interest.",

This has substantial influence on groundwater quality. However, identification of potentially mobile fractions of metals like Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn, Fe, Mn and Ti requires for the sustainable land and groundwater development and pollution management. 44 sediment and pore water samples at 1 m interval were analyzed from a vertical profile beneath the Naka river at the bottom of Central Kanto plain, Japan. Sequential extraction method was applied to determine potentially mobile forms of metals such as water soluble, ion exchangeable, acid soluble and Fe-Mn oxide bound. Metals were determined using X-Ray Fluorescence, Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission and mass spectrometer. Analyses show that potential mobility is high in river bed, volcanic ash mix, marine and transitional clayey silt. Metal mobility was higher in lower gravelly aquifer than upper sandy aquifer. Potential mobility and bioavailability of Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb and Mn are very high in river bed sediment which may pose threat to river bottom aquatic system. Zn, Cu and Ni concentration in pore water is high in river bed and peat bearing sediment. In pore water of marine and transitional sediment ion concentration such as Ca2+ and SO42- is very high indicating high mobility of Calcium and Sulfur from sediment as no significant variation observed in total content. In vertical profile, potential mobility tendency of metal in sediment trends to be Zn > Cu > Ni > Cr > Pb > Mn > Fe > Ti. Current study indicates low potential mobility and pollution risk to groundwater due to overall low metal concentration in pore water and high portion of metals attached with sediment as Fe-Mn oxide bound.

            "abstract": "We present a travel time formulation of water and energy transport at sub-catchment scale, resulting in a closed form solution for water temperature evolution in the subsoil compartment. The derived equations are implemented in Alpine3D, a physically-based model of snow processes, which provides the necessary boundary conditions to perform hydro-thermal response simulations of Alpine catchments. The model set-up accounts for advective and non-advective energy fluxes to perform spatially distributed simulations of streamflow and temperature in river networks having an arbitrary degree of geomorphological complexity. The model performance is illustrated comparing modeled and measured hydrographs and thermographs at the outlet of the Dischma catchment (45 km2) in the Swiss Alps. The model gives reliable predictions of streamflow and temperature. Our results suggest that the advective energy fluxes provide a large contribution to the thermal regime of the study catchment. The non-advective energy fluxes are also influential, as they contribute to cool the water in the winter and to warm it in the summer. The analysis of the distributed model results shows a notable streamflow spatial variability during a snowmelt event, as opposed to a more homogeneous response during a rainfall event. The stream temperature, instead, progressively increases from headwater streams to the outlet both during the snowmelt and the rainfall events. The proposed model completes the surface processes simulation framework of Alpine3D. The relevance of the work stems from the increasing scientific interest concerning the impacts of the warming climate on water resources management and temperature-influenced ecological processes.",

            "abstract": "It is well know that the standard finite element methods, in general, do not satisfy element-wise mass/species balance properties. It is, however, desirable to have element-wide mass balance property in subsurface modeling. Several studies over the years have aimed to overcome this drawback of finite element formulations. Currently, a post-processing optimization-based methodology is commonly employed to recover the local mass balance for porous media models. However, such a post-processing technique does not respect the underlying variational structure that the finite element formulation may enjoy. Motivated by this, a consistent methodology to satisfy element-wise local mass balance for porous media models is constructed using convex optimization techniques. The assembled system of global equations is reconstructed into a quadratic programming problem subjected to bounded equality constraints that ensure conservation at the element level. The proposed methodology can be applied to any computational mesh and to any non-locally conservative nodal-based finite element method. Herein, we integrate our proposed methodology into the framework of the classical mixed Galerkin formulation using Taylor-Hood elements and the least-squares finite element formulation. Our numerical studies will include computational cost, numerical convergence, and comparision with popular methods. In particular, it will be shown that the accuracy of the solutions is comparable with that of several popular locally conservative finite element formulations like the lowest order Raviart-Thomas formulation. We believe the proposed optimization-based approach is a viable approach to preserve local mass balance on general computational grids and is amenable for large-scale parallel implementation.",

            "abstract": "A continuation of riser drilling at IODP Site C0002 resulted in deepening of the borehole to >3000 mbsf and intersection of several apparent fault horizons, including a fault zone cored at ~2205 mbsf. To obtain interstitial water chemistry data we attempted the GRIND method (Wheat et al., 1994) on five core samples from 2172 to 2217 mbsf. Only two core samples yielded data comparable to typical values obtained previously in shallower cores from the overlying slope basin. Chlorinity values in these two prism samples averaged 407 mM. If these deeper chlorinity values truly reflect in situ IW chemistry, then substantial freshening in the deep prism by input from mineral dehydration reactions is required. IW chemistry from the deep core samples might be partially controlled by reactions between IW and clay minerals during diagenesis (see companion abstract by Brown et al.), but also by sample retrieval and shipboard processing.\nCarbonate veins are present in cores and cuttings. Vein fragments in the cuttings commonly exhibit slickenlines and slickenfibers associated with faulting. The carbonate-carbon data show two relative maxima in CaCO3 abundance, a first maximum of 7.9 wt% centered at ~1925 mbsf, and a second one of 5.8 wt% at ~2625 mbsf. Aside from these maxima there is a steady decrease of background carbonate abundance from 4 wt% to <2 wt% from 900 to 3000 mbsf, respectively. Preliminary analyses of veins from 11 cuttings samples distributed over a depth range of 1440 to 2720 mbsf give values of δ13C from -8.59‰ to -1.45‰ and δ18O from -10.13‰ to -0.15‰. The highest carbon and oxygen isotope values are concentrated above the cored fault interval. The two lightest carbon isotope values are from samples just above this fault zone, indicating possible input of carbon from light hydrocarbons in this interval. Oxygen isotopes show a general decreasing trend below 2180 mbsf. Inferred paleotemperatures imply carbonate formation at shallower burial depths or a low prism geothermal gradient. Observations of abundant carbonate cements and veins in core section C0002P-348-5R-4, and concentrations of carbonate in discrete intervals of up to 100 m in thickness, indicate that faults serve as fluid conduits, resulting in carbonate cementation. Additional data from the cored fault interval will be presented.",

The large number of seasonal realizations with the observed time varying CO2 affords a unique opportunity to explore the role of greenhouse gas changes on 3-month seasonal mean temperature increases, and specifically, whether they are the result of a shift in the mean temperature distribution or an increase in its variability.\nIt is found that significant positive shifts in the temperature Probability Density Function (PDF) occurs primarily as the result of the time varying CO2 included in the historical model runs, although a contribution from natural climate variability modes cannot be categorically excluded. The temperature PDF comparison further indicates that the increasing global and U.S. temperatures over the last 30 years are predominantly the result of shifts in the mean temperature distribution and not increasing temperature variability. As such, the likelihood of increases in the occurrence of warm temperature extremes will likely continue to increase worldwide, leading to significant impacts on many socioeconomic sectors such as agriculture and public health.",

This is particularly true in the case of polar regions where the enhancement of auroral electrojet current system is responsible for the observed geomagnetic perturbations. Here, using the DMA-technique we evaluate the local Hurst exponent (H\\“older exponent) for a set of 46 geomagnetic observatories, widely distributed in the northern hemisphere, during one of the most famous and strong geomagnetic storm, the Bastille event, and reconstruct a sequence of polar maps showing the dinamical changes of the topology of the local Hurst exponent with the geomagnetic activity level. The topological evolution of local Hurst exponent maps is discussed in relation to the dinamical changes of the current systems flowing in the polar ionosphere.\nG.

            "abstract": "The tropical reservoirs of hydroeletric plants have an important role in greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Due to the large extension of the reservoirs, the lake breeze or land breeze can influence the transport and dispersion of gases. The Balbina reservoir (59° 28’ 50’’ W, 1° 53’ 25’’; S), located near Manaus-AM in central Amazonia, is the second biggest hydroeletric plant resevoir in the Amazon basin and has a flooded area of 1770 km2 with an average depth of 10 m, which is enough to produce a dynamic land-lake breeze. In this reservoir, we measured wind direction and velocity from a meteorological buoy and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations at 2 m above the lake surface with a high frequency sensor, from 18th to 19th July/2013. The CO2 concentrations were measured at 10 Hz and data were averaged every 5 min during 32 hours. The lake breeze and land breeze from the forest around the lake showed a well-defined behavior, the lake breeze being predominantly from south (S) and the land breeze predominantly from north (N). The CO2 concentration averages were 392 and 426 ppm for daytime and nighttime, respectively. During daytime the atmosphere above the lake was well mixed due to unstable stratification and moderately strong wind speeds. The accumulation of CO2 concentration above the lake at night may have been affected by low wind speeds and enhanced CO2 flux from the water surface due to buoyancy-induced turbulence and physical processes that brought high-CO2 water to the surface. Advection of CO2 from the adjacent forest (land breeze) was also possible.",

            "abstract": "As new scientific challenges demand more comprehensive and multidisciplinary investigations, laboratory experiments are not expected to become simpler and/or faster. Experimental investigation is an indispensable element of scientific inquiry and must play a central role in the way current and future generations of scientist make decisions. To turn the complexity of laboratory work (and that of rocks!) into dexterity, engagement, and expanded learning opportunities, we are building an interactive, virtual laboratory reproducing in form and function the Stanford Rock Physics Laboratory, at Stanford University. The objective is to combine lectures on laboratory techniques and an online repository of visualized experiments consisting of interactive, 3-D renderings of equipment used to measure properties central to the study of rock physics (e.g., how to saturate rocks, how to measure porosity, permeability, and elastic wave velocity). We use a game creation system together with 3-D computer graphics, and a narrative voice to guide the user through the different phases of the experimental protocol. The main advantage gained in employing computer graphics over video footage is that students can virtually open the instrument, single out its components, and assemble it. Most importantly, it helps describe the processes occurring within the rock. These latter cannot be tracked while simply recording the physical experiment, but computer animation can efficiently illustrate what happens inside rock samples (e.g., describing acoustic waves, and/or fluid flow through a porous rock under pressure within an opaque core-holder – Figure 1). The repository of visualized experiments will complement lectures on laboratory techniques and constitute an on-line course offered through the EdX platform at Stanford. This will provide a virtual laboratory for anyone, anywhere to facilitate teaching/learning of introductory laboratory classes in Geophysics and expand the number of courses that can be offered for curricula in Earth Sciences. The primary goal is to open up a research laboratory such as the one available at Stanford to promising students worldwide who are currently left out of such educational resources.",

            "abstract": "Although beaches appear to consist of uniform sands, upon closer inspection, a broad range of sizes can exist on a beach. Recent studies have shown that not only does grain size vary on the surface of beaches, it is also correlated with the morphology and the grain size surface patterns change as the morphology changes. XBeach is now being used, with a multi grain size module, to predict transport of different grain sizes, their sorting and separation and to determine the importance of grain size variation on the beach. However, only surface grain sizes have been measured and compared with model results.\nIn March and April of 2014, a pilot experiment was performed at the Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility. During the experiment, 36 stratigraphic cores were collected along a cross-shore profile from the dune to the lowest extent of the swash. These cores are being sampled with a digital imaging system (DIS) to estimate grain size. The DIS can streamline the process of collecting grain size information. Errors associated with the technique and with coring (and compaction) will be discussed. Grain size stratigraphy in the beach and its variations with location and in time are being examined at this time. These data will be used, together with observations from a large trench (see related abstract by Wadman et al.), to interpret layering in the beach owing to storms, rising and falling tides and wave-by-wave transport mechanism. In addition, the data will be used to drive model predictions to assess the importance of grain size variation, differential grain transport and layering on the morphodynamics of beaches (see related abstract by Reniers et al.).",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is a physical process enabling for the conversion of so-called free (non-potential) magnetic energy into kinetic and thermal energy by breaking the flux conservation law that exists for ideal (i.e. perfectly conducting) plasmas. This ubiquitous phenomenon in magnetized plasma plays an important role in the Sun’s chromosphere as likely being responsible for transient plasma phenomena such as solar flares, spicules and chromospheric jets.\nIn this work, we present a computational model that simulates magnetic reconnection under low chromospheric conditions using a two-fluid (plasma + neutrals) approach introduced by Leake et al. (2012). This model considers non-equilibrium partial ionization effects including ionization, recombination reactions and scattering collisions while simulating the interplay between the charged particles with the electromagnetic field. Previous 2D simulations showed that the dynamics of ions and neutrals are decoupled during the reconnection process. Also, the effect of the chemical non-equilibrium in the reconnection region plays a crucial role, yielding faster reconnection rates.\nWe extended these simulations to study different 3D configurations in order to analyze the impact of non-equilibrium partial ionization effects on the neutral sheet configuration(s) and the reconnection rate of more realistic geometries. The results are compared with the two-dimensional simulations.",

The first, to be able to discover likely sites where relevant data and data services might be found, the second, to be able to deeply crawl the sites discovered to find any data and services which might be present. Lastly, to leverage the use of semantic technologies to characterize the services and data found, and to filter out everything but those relevant to the geosciences.\nTo address the first two challenges BCube uses an adapted version of Apache Nutch (which originated Hadoop), a web scale crawler, and Amazon’s ElasticMapReduce service for flexibility and cost effectiveness. For characterization of the services found, BCube is examining existing web service ontologies for their applicability to our needs and will re-use and/or extend these in order to query for services with specific well-defined characteristics in scientific datasets such as the use of geospatial namespaces.\nThe original proposal for the crawler won a grant from Amazon’s academic program, which allowed us to become operational; we successfully tested the Bcube Crawler at web scale obtaining a significant corpus, sizeable enough to enable work on characterization of the services and data found. There is still plenty of work to be done, doing “smart crawls” by managing the frontier, developing and enhancing our scoring algorithms and fully implementing the semantic characterization technologies. We describe the current status of the project, our successes and issues encountered.\nThe final goal of the BCube crawler project is to provide relevant data services to other projects on the EarthCube stack and third party partners so they can be brokered and used by a wider scientific community.",

It is estimated that 95% of carbon in peatlands is stored in the peat soil, while less than 5% occurs in the vegetation. The majority of studies related to C stocks in peatlands have taken place in northern latitudes leaving the tropical and subtropical latitudes clearly understudied. In this study we use a combination of indirect non-invasive geophysical methods (mainly ground penetrating radar, GPR) as well as direct measurements (direct coring) to calculate total C stocks within subtropical depressional wetlands in the Disney Wilderness Preserve (DWP, Orlando, FL). A set of three-dimensional (3D) GPR surveys were used to detect variability of the peat layer thickness and the underlying peat-sand mix layer across several depressional wetlands. Direct samples collected at selected locations were used to confirm depth of each interface and to estimate C content in the laboratory. Layer thickness estimated from GPR and direct C content were used to estimate total peat volume and C content for the entire depressional wetland. Through the use of aerial photos a relationship between surface area along the depressional wetlands and total peat thickness (and thus C content) was established for the depressions surveyed and applied throughout the entire preserve. This work shows the importance of depressional wetlands as critical contributors of the C budget at the DWP.",

So far, transcriptomics has been the most comprehensive proxy for the whole metabolisms of these organisms, but this approach is limited because it only represents the physiological poise of the cells, and is not linearly correlated to the rates and activity of the metabolic pathways. Using thermodynamics calculations and isotopic analyses can provide constraints on activity, but there are often discrepancies between available energy and calculated active biomass. A further understanding of metabolism both at the species and community level is necessary and metabolomics provides a means of capturing a “snapshot” of cell’s metabolite pools, or of following labelled substrates as they move through metabolic pathways. We present our method development and initial results from our studies of the model organism Photobacterium profundum, and the benefits and challenges in meaningfully applying these methods to natural communities. These methods open the way to better understanding deep-sea metabolism on a more comprehensive level, including reserves compounds, alternate and secondary metabolism and potentially new metabolic pathways, and moreover the response of metabolism to changes in experimental conditions and carbon source can be readily followed. These will allow a better understanding of the carbon cycling pathways and their rate in natural communities.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid expansion of natural gas exploitation from unconventional reservoirs including coalbed methane and shale gas plays, there is significant public concern about potential future contamination of shallow potable groundwater with stray gases, formation waters or chemicals used during hydraulic fracturing. In order to enable a scientifically sound assessment of potential future deterioration of freshwater resources in shallow aquifers, it is essential to first establish and understand the current baseline of groundwater quality including its dissolved or free gases. Since 2006, we have conducted monitoring programs determining the chemical and isotopic compositions of water, its dissolved constituents, and of gases obtained from shallow groundwater and formation fluids collected from coalbed methane and shale gas plays in Western Canada. For groundwater samples, we placed special emphasis on determining the sources of dissolved and free gases using isotope techniques to assess whether gases produced from shale gas plays or potentially leaking from the intermediate zone are isotopically distinct from those in shallow aquifers. Methane and ethane in free gas samples obtained from shallow aquifers (n = 24) were found to have mean δ13C values of -72.4 ‰ and -50.2 ‰, respectively. These values are markedly different from the much higher δ13C values of methane and ethane in deeper portions of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin and in shale gas plays. Therefore, it appears highly feasible to identify potential gas leakage from unconventional gas plays provided that baseline data for shallow groundwater have been determined. Repeat baseline sampling of free gas from selected wells revealed a comparatively low variability of δ13C values of methane and ethane of usually < 2 ‰ over periods of several years, suggesting that it is not necessary to conduct baseline analyses more than three times. Also, δ13C values of methane in free gas samples and dissolved gas samples typically agreed within 1 ‰ suggesting that both sampling approaches are suitable for determining baseline carbon isotope ratios in case that methane occurs in shallow aquifers.",

            "abstract": "Lagrangian air mass tracking programs in back cast mode are a powerful tool for estimating the water vapor source of precipitation events. The altitudes above the precipitation site where particle’s back trajectories begin influences the source estimation. We assume that precipitation comes from water vapor in condensing regions of the air column, so particles are placed in proportion to an estimated condensation profile. We compare two methods for estimating where condensation occurs and the resulting evaporation sites for 63 events at Barrow, AK. The first method (M1) uses measurements from a 35 GHz vertically resolved cloud radar (MMCR), and algorithms developed by Zhao and Garrett1 to calculate precipitation rate. The second method (M2) uses the Global Data Assimilation System reanalysis data in a lofting model. We assess how accurately M2, developed for global coverage, will perform in absence of direct cloud observations. Results from the two methods are statistically similar. The mean particle height estimated by M2 is, on average, 695 m (s.d. = 1800 m) higher than M1. The corresponding average vapor source estimated by M2 is 1.5⁰ (s.d. = 5.4⁰) south of M1. In addition, vapor sources for M2 relative to M1 have ocean surface temperatures averaging 1.1⁰C (s.d. = 3.5⁰C) warmer, and reported ocean surface relative humidities 0.31% (s.d. = 6.1%) drier. All biases except the latter are statistically significant (p = 0.02 for each). Results were skewed by events where M2 estimated very high altitudes of condensation. When M2 produced an average particle height less than 5000 m (89% of events), M2 estimated mean particle heights 76 m (s.d. = 741 m) higher than M1, corresponding to a vapor source 0.54⁰ (s.d. = 4.2⁰) south of M1. The ocean surface at the vapor source was an average of 0.35⁰C (s.d. = 2.35⁰C) warmer and ocean surface relative humidities were 0.02% (s.d. = 5.5%) wetter. None of the biases was statistically significant. If the vapor source meteorology estimated by M2 is used to determine vapor isotopic properties it would produce results similar to M1 in all cases except the occasional very high cloud. The methods strive to balance a sufficient number of tracked air masses for meaningful vapor source estimation with minimal computational time.\nZhao, C and Garrett, T.J. 2008, J. Geophys. Res. ",

            "abstract": "Numerous empirical studies have indicated that a global longitudinal asymmetry of Saturn’s magnetospheric plasma population (the m=1 term in a Fourier expansion, where m is the azimuthal wavenumber) is required to explain observed spin-periodic modulations (~ 10.7 hr) of magnetospheric behavior (e.g., Carbary and Mitchell [2013], Rev. Geophys., 51, doi:10.1029/2012RG000416, and references therein). This is true in spite of the fact that Saturn’s intrinsic magnetic field is well described by a perfectly spin-aligned dipole. The Rice Convection Model (RCM) has been used previously to simulate plasma transport in Saturn’s magnetosphere with a spin-aligned dipole field and a longitudinally symmetric plasma source that is largely confined to the radial range L ~ 5 - 8 (e.g., Liu et al. [2010], J. Geophys. Res., 115, doi:10.1029/2010JA015859; Liu and Hill [2012], J. Geophys. Res., 117, doi:10.1029/2012JA017827). We have begun to explore the consequences of a global-scale longitudinal asymmetry of the plasma source. Preliminary results indicate that a small (~1%) asymmetry of the imposed plasma source produces a magnetospherically significant (factor ~2) m=1 asymmetry of the resultant plasma distribution in the middle magnetosphere (L ~ 8-15). Our objective is not to explain the (still mysterious) underlying cause of the source asymmetry, but rather to investigate the effects of a given source asymmetry on the plasma distribution in the more distant magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Opportunity rover is traversing the western rim segments of the 22 km diameter Endeavour crater in Meridiani Planum, with resultant data enabling evaluation of the craters’s degradation state. The crater is Noachian in age, complex in morphology, and largely buried by younger sulfate-rich rocks. Nevertheless, exposed rim segments dubbed Cape York (CY) and Solander Point/Murray Ridge (S/M) ~1500 m to the south reveal breccias interpreted as remnants of the ejecta deposit (Shoemaker Formation or SF) that at CY overlie the pre-impact country rocks (Matijevic Formation or MF).\nAt CY, relief is ~10 m and consists of 6-7 m of SF over at least several m of MF. By contrast, the MF/SF contact is not visible at S/M despite outcrops some 20 m below and 60 m above the elevation of the contact at CY. This implies some structural offset between the rim segments and suggests up to 70 m section is preserved at S/M. The lack of information about the orientation of the SF at S/M makes the true thickness difficult to establish, though it appears to be 10’s of m more than at CY.\nComparison to similar sized, fresh, complex craters on Mars and the Moon suggests there was originally 100-200 m of ejecta at Endeavour’s rim. Ejecta comprise only 20-25% of the rim relief around lunar craters of similar size, thereby implying an original rim height of up to 500-1000 m at Endeavour. If accurate, then ~400-800 m of the rim remains buried; the higher end of this range is close to the 800-900 m section interpreted elsewhere. If 200 m ejecta were present, then CY and S/M experienced ~190 m and over 100 m erosional lowering, respectively. If 100 m ejecta were present then rim lowering was ~90 m and 10’s of m, respectively. Such differences between rim segments likely relate to changing efficiency of responsible processes and/or varying characteristics of the rocks and indicate portions of Endeavour crater experienced significant degradation.\nA paucity of exposed debris shed from SF and MT around the CY and S/M rim segments relegates most erosion to before the surrounding plains deposits were emplaced. Endeavour ranges between 250-500 m deep. By contrast, recent studies of pristine complex craters on Mars suggest the original depth was probably closer to 2000 m, though it is unclear how much older fill may occur beneath exposed sulfate-rich rocks.",

            "abstract": "Magmatic assimilation of felsic continental crust is a well-documented, relatively common phenomenon. The extent to which basaltic crust is assimilated by magmas, on the other hand, is not well known. Basaltic cannibalism, or the wholesale incorporation of basaltic crustal material into a basaltic magma, is thought to be uncommon because basalt requires more energy than higher silica rocks to melt. Basaltic materials that are unconsolidated, poorly crystalline, or palagonitized may be more easily ingested than fully crystallized massive basalt, thus allowing basaltic cannibalism to occur. Thrihnukagigur volcano, SW Iceland, offers a unique exposure of a buried cinder cone within its evacuated conduit, 100 m below the main vent. The unconsolidated tephra is cross-cut by a NNE-trending dike, which runs across the ceiling of this cave to a vent that produced lava and tephra during the ~4 Ka fissure eruption. Preliminary petrographic and laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses indicate that there are two populations of plagioclase present in the system – Population One is stubby (aspect ratio < 1.7) with disequilibrium textures and low Ba/Sr ratios while Population Two is elongate (aspect ratio > 2.1), subhedral to euhedral, and has much higher Ba/Sr ratios. Population One crystals are observed in the cinder cone, dike, and surface lavas, whereas Population Two crystals are observed only in the dike and surface lavas. This suggests that a magma crystallizing a single elongate population of plagioclase intruded the cinder cone and rapidly assimilated the tephra, incorporating the stubbier population of phenocrysts. This conceptual model for basaltic cannibalism is supported by field observations of large-scale erosion upward into the tephra, which is coated by magma flow-back indicating that magma was involved in the thermal etching. While the unique exposure at Thrihnukagigur makes it an exceptional place to investigate basaltic cannibalism, we suggest that it is not limited to this volcanic system. Rather it is a process that likely occurs throughout Iceland and may contribute to the evolution of the crust in other predominately basaltic settings.",

            "abstract": "Stratus clouds provide summer moisture and shade for ecological and human systems in coastal Southern California (CSCA). Subtropical marine clouds such as those in CSCA also regulate earth’s energy budget. Uncertainties in how these clouds respond to global warming contribute to uncertain projections of local and global climate. We use hourly cloud-height observations from 22 airfields in CSCA to develop records of summer stratus cloudiness (cloud base <1000 m) since 1948. We dissect these records by hour, altitude, and location to diagnose interannual variability and multi-decade trends. We find that low and high stratus clouds are promoted by distinct climate processes. Low stratus, including fog, is promoted by a cool surface and warmth aloft, enhancing stability above the marine layer. High stratus (cloud base: 600–1000 m) is promoted by synoptic frontal systems that reduce stability throughout the atmosphere. Additionally, fog (very low stratus clouds) frequency has declined during the past ~60 years by over 50% at night and in early morning at some sites, but has not changed at others. Fog reductions appear linked to urbanization. Among the 22 airfields, trends in fogginess correlate negatively (r = -0.84) with the percent of urban cover within 10 km. The mechanism linking urban cover to fog reduction is nighttime warming. Relatively urban sites experienced more rapid nighttime warming since 1948 (r = 0.90) and have lower relative humidity as a result (r = -0.71). Decreased relative humidity causes condensation level to lift, increasing cloud height and reducing fog frequency. Intriguingly, fog frequency increased by 50–75% on the nearby, non-urbanized Channel Islands. Increased fogginess is consistent with secular warming above the marine layer, which has thus far occurred without local sea-surface warming. We conclude that trends toward a potentially foggier climate have been counteracted, and overwhelmed, by artificial nighttime warming in much of CSCA.",

            "abstract": "Risk management in water resources has relied on reducing randomness and smoothing variability. Watersheds are engineered to avoid small but frequent flood events or water shortages - this is the hallmark of a robust system. However, the artificial reduction of natural variability in hydrology creates an increasingly fragile watershed. Invisible risk accumulates each year that the system performs within its design capacity, as development expands into hazard areas and community preparedness and consciousness for the hazard is reduced in its absence. While the benefits of these behaviors are immediate and visible, exposure to catastrophic risk grows invisibly under the surface.\nWe consider risk as the probability of an adverse event and its consequence. Increasing exposure to risk in engineered watersheds is typically driven by increasing the consequences for equally probable events, as the same magnitude flood causes more damage. However, changing climate and land use alters hydrology such that large flooding is more probable. Uncertainty in assessing the probability or consequence of these events is increased by anthropogenic change.\nRobust systems with a fixed capacity become less reliable in a changing environment. Communities will require resilient, adaptable measures for reducing current and future potential risk exposure. Resilient measures – such as floodplain management and integrated water resources management - will require some amount of concession to damage from small but frequent detrimental events in order to reduce the risk of catastrophe.",

            "abstract": "Exceptionally large biogenic magnetite crystals, including spearhead-like and spindle-like ones up to 4 microns, have been reported in clay-rich sediments recording the ~56 Ma Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) and carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in a borehole at Ancora, NJ and along with magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) chains, were suggested [Schumann et al. 2008 PNAS; Kopp et al. 2009 Paleoceanography] to account for the distinctive single domain (SD) rock magnetic properties of these sediments [Lanci et al. 2002 JGR]. However, because uncalibrated magnetic extraction techniques were used to provide material for TEM imaging of the biogenic magnetite, it is difficult to quantitatively analyze their concentration in the bulk clay. In this study, we use a synchrotron transmission X-ray microscope to image bulk CIE clay. We first take mosaic images of sub-millimeter-sized bulk clay samples, in which we can identify many of the various types of giant biogenic magnetite crystals, as well as several other types of iron minerals, such as pyrite framboids, siderite, and detrital magnetite. However, limited by the instrument resolution (~50 nm), we are not able to identify MTB chains let alone isolated magnetic nanoparticles that may be abundant the clay. To quantitatively estimate the concentration of the giant biogenic magnetite, we re-deposited the bulk clay sample in an alcohol solution on a silicon nitride membrane for 2D X-ray scans. After scanning a total area of 0.55 mm2 with average clay thickness of 4 µm, we identified ~40 spearheads, ~5 spindles and a few elongated rods and estimated their total magnetization as SD particles to be less than about 10% of the mass normalized clay for the scanned area. This result suggests that the giant biogenic magnetite is not a major source of the SD signal for the clay and is in good agreement with rock magnetic analyses using high-resolution first-order reversal curves and thermal fluctuation tomography on bulk CIE clay showing that most of the magnetite occurs as isolated, near-equant SD particles [Wang et al. 2013 PNAS]. This would also exclude a significant contribution from MTB chains and points to a non-biogenic origin, such as a comet impact plume condensate, for the magnetic nanoparticles [Kent et al. 2003 EPSL] in the very rapidly deposited CIE clays [Wright & Schaller 2014 PNAS].",

            "abstract": "Litter decomposition links terrestrial primary productivity to soil organic matter (OM) dynamics, by determining the quantity and chemical characteristics of plant-derived material entering the soil system. The controls on and products of litter decomposition form a foundation for the role of terrestrial ecosystems in global C cycling (i.e. as sinks or sources), by determining the contribution of plant productivity to atmospheric CO2 through respiration versus to soil OM as direct plant or biologically processed material. We identified two areas in need of theoretical development in litter decomposition models. First, current litter decomposition models are generally based on litter mass loss and CO2 flux, an approach which does not consider leaching and the generation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from litter decomposition. Second, new hypotheses for the role of variable microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) have important implications for the form and quantity of litter decomposition products- specifically, respiration of CO2 versus the formation of microbes, microbial products, and DOM. We propose the Litter Decomposition and Leaching (LIDEL) model as a new theoretical approach to litter decomposition that 1) includes explicit modeling of DOM as a litter decomposition product, and 2) dynamically links substrate chemistry with variable CUE and the generation of DOM and other litter decomposition products. We parameterized the model using Bayesian calibration, based on a random-walk Metropolis Hastings within Gibbs Sampling Markov Chain-Monte Carlo algorithm. This Bayesian analysis uses litter decomposition and leaching experimental data for five litter types that vary by lignin and nitrogen content. By separating the dynamics of lignin versus microbial products as well as CO2 versus DOM partitioning during litter decomposition, the LIDEL model clarifies the linkage between litter chemistry, microbial CUE, and SOM inputs from litter. We suggest the LIDEL model can be implemented in ecosystem models such as DAYCENT, as a better representation of above and below ground litter decomposition.",

            "abstract": "Currently implemented Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) algorithms based on seismic data alone should provide the most robust warnings for most M<6 earthquakes, since real-time GPS positions are too noisy to aid in EEW. However, for larger events, which generate larger fault offsets, GPS data can provide a direct on-scale displacement measurements and has sufficient precision. In such situations, the GPS observations may enable more accurate estimation of magnitude and rupture extent than seismic data.\nThe USGS Earthquake Science Center in Menlo Park currently obtains real-time data from approximately 100 GNSS stations in northern California. These stations, which span the San Andreas fault system from the Mendocino Triple Junction to San Juan Bautista, are operated by USGS-Menlo Park, UC Berkeley, and UNAVCO. We have developed software tools for monitoring and troubleshooting data acquisition and quality. We have evaluated the latency and precision of position estimates obtained through real-time processing and we have found these results satisfactory for EEW.\nWe are now implementing the BEFORES algorithm (Minson et al., 2014) that uses Bayesian analysis to determine the best-fitting coseismic fault orientation and finite fault slip distribution (from which moment and rupture extent are obtained) in real-time. BEFORES has been tested extensively on both simulated and real data (retrospectively) for a variety of earthquakes. We are now focusing on three aspects of its implementation: 1) receiving real-time earthquake locations from independent seismic EEW algorithms, that are obtained through multiple TCP/IP connections, and 3) optimizing the computation of elastic Green’s functions. Completion of these tasks plus additional tests using simulated waveforms of earthquakes displacements superimposed on actual data will prepare the algorithm for implementation in the West Coast EEW system.",

            "abstract": "Gnamma pit is an Australian aboriginal term for weathering pit, and its formation is controlled by a mix of mineral decay and eolian processes. Prior literature suggests that two processes limit pit growth: decay along grain boundaries sufficient to allow mineral detachment; and eolian events sufficient to deflate accumulate minerals. However, prior literature contains little empirical data on the nature of these processes. Our research focuses on developing a better understanding of wind thresholds that deflate particles from pits. A set of wind-tunnel tests with a range of weathering pit shapes and grus particle sizes explored the wind threshold needed to deflate particles in different situations. An empirical equation expresses the way to estimate wind the speed threshold via pit depth and particle size. With this equation, the threshold for evacuating particles in the pit can be estimated by measuring the pit depth and smallest particles in the weathering pit, that indicates that the wind speed would not exceed this value when this pit is still active. We also developed a computational fluid dynamics model to investigate the distribution of wall shear stress. Ultimately, there exists some potential to utilize our refined understanding of gnamma pits as an indicator of paleo-wind intensity in pit locations where the accumulated sediment can be dated (e.g., by OSL) and such filled pits excavated to understand the paleo-wind conditions that would have once allowed the growth of such a pit.",

            "abstract": "The recent discovery of significant variation in 238U/235U caused by redox change at the surface Earth has led to its use to extract information on the oxygenation state of ancient oceans from marine sediments [e.g. 1]. Recent studies have focused on improving the understanding of the 238U/235U signature in modern marine carbonates [2] and black shales [3] to improve the robustness of this tracer. To further advance its use we have focused on improving our understanding of 238U/235U systematics in modern dolomite, another commonly occurring rock-type in the geological record, before turning to 238U/235U signatures in ancient sediments.\nThe measured dolomite samples, precipitated in modern environments of coastal hypersaline lagoons in Brazil, all exhibit 238U/235U values that deviate from the seawater composition [3]. Observed values are both lighter (ca. 130 ppm; as also observed in dolomite from tidal-ponds on Bahamas [2]) and heavier (50-180 ppm). These distinct 238U/235U values for different dolomite-precipitates likely attest to the particular formation style, as well as early diagenetic processes. We use such modern settings to discuss the utility of 238U/235U in ancient sediments, the singularity of any observed 238U/235U signal, its relation to global ocean chemistry and potential diagenetic overprinting. These constraints are then used to evaluate a well-preserved marine carbonate section [4] and published black shale 238U/235U data [1], both deposited during the Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (93 Ma). We discuss the capabilities of both the carbonate and black shale section for retaining information on the 238U/235U composition in the ocean during OAE 2.\n[1] Montoya-Pino et al.

            "abstract": "The most commonly used method of delta classification is to interpret formation processes from observation of the resulting geomorphic features, and to place the delta on a ternary diagram based on the relative dominance of the associated wave, tidal, or fluvial influences. This system has worked well and has been in use for more than 40 years - but it suffers from the subjectivity inherent to visual interpretation techniques. We aim to establish an alternative classification method that is both objective and reliable for the classification of deltaic systems. At the corner stone of our current approach, we use the statistic of lacunarity to quantitatively describe the variability of deltaic footprints across a wide range of spatial scales. Lacunarity has been used for more than 20 years to identify and characterize stratigraphic patterns, and is currently in use in such diverse fields as urban planning and medicine to characterize spatial distribution of properties. Here, we apply lacunarity to satellite images of modern deltas in order to quantitatively describe the distribution of land and water at scales ranging from the data resolution to that of the entire system. The results of our lacunarity analyses provide the basis for a new, objective, system of delta classification.",

To capture these phenomena, a suite of advanced instrumentation was used, which could characterize the upstream unmodified synoptic approach flow and identify the synoptic flow / mountain interactions. In addition to meteorological towers, Doppler LiDARs, placed at two locations to the east and in the lee of Granite Mountain were particularly useful, showing the horizontal spatial pattern and temporal evolution of the synoptic generated phenomena.

            "abstract": "Data assimilation (DA) is a popular method for merging information from multiple sources (i.e. models and remotely sensing), leading to improved hydrologic prediction. With the increasing availability of satellite observations (such as soil moisture) in recent years, DA is emerging in operational forecast systems. Although these techniques have seen widespread application, developmental research has continued to further refine their effectiveness. This presentation will examine potential improvements to the Particle Filter (PF) through the inclusion of multivariate correlation structures. Applications of the PF typically rely on univariate DA schemes (such as assimilating the outlet observed discharge), and multivariate schemes generally ignore the spatial correlation of the observations. In this study, a multivariate DA scheme is proposed by introducing geostatistics into the newly developed particle filter with Markov chain Monte Carlo (PF-MCMC) method. This new method is assessed by a case study over one of the basin with natural hydrologic process in Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX), located in Arizona. The multivariate PF-MCMC method is used to assimilate the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) grid (12.5 km) soil moisture retrievals and the observed streamflow in five gages (four inlet and one outlet gages) into the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model for the same scale (12.5 km), leading to greater skill in hydrologic predictions.",

To explore these effects at ultraslow spreading rates, major and trace element concentrations in pyroxene minerals are presented for 14 dredged Gakkel abyssal peridotites. Samples from the same dredge and among dredges reveal wide compositional variation. Trace element compositions of lherzolites reflect 4-6% non-modal fractional mantle melting. However, these high degrees of melting without a corresponding amount of oceanic crust suggest the occurrence of infertile mantle due to ancient melting event(s). In addition, high degrees of melt depletion at short length-scales (<60 km) cannot be thermally driven and must instead reflect inherited small length-scale variability. Harzburgite samples exhibit low concentrations in heavy rare earth elements that can be fit by 6 to ≥13% non-modal melting, but this results in modeled light rare earth element contents that are too low relative to observed concentrations. Instead, harzburgite trace element patterns require open-system melting involving interaction with a percolating melt. Extreme enrichments in highly incompatible elements also suggest the occurrence of late-stage refertilization and melt entrapment. Modeling of several different source melt compositions indicates that the trapped melt was generated from garnet field-equilibrated peridotite. Overall, the compositional variability in Gakkel peridotite samples reflects a heterogeneous mantle resulting from inherited depletion and recent melt percolation and entrapment.",

            "abstract": "The Holocene evolution of the upper ocean in the Nordic Seas is assessed based on the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of 16 dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) records retrieved from the warm and saline Atlantic Domain in the east, across the seasonally sea-ice covered Arctic Domain, to the Arctic-outflow influenced Polar Domain in the west. First signs of interglacial conditions are observed from ~11.5 ka BP onwards in the Atlantic Domain, and expanded time-transgressively westward, with deglacial processes appearing to have persisted ~2 kyr longer in the west. No clear peak warming can be observed in the dinocyst data during the interval that is generally considered to correspond to the Holocene climatic optimum, and the disparity between the dinocyst and other phytoplankton records suggests a pronounced seasonality at that time. A slightly freshened upper ocean appears to have facilitated seasonal sea ice formation even at the Vøring Plateau. Despite the strongly contrasting environmental conditions across the Nordic Seas, a basin-wide uniform change in the assemblage compositions is seen between ~7 and 6.1 ka BP, and appears to be linked to the establishment of the modern surface circulation pattern. Potential density estimates for the surface water close to modern convection sites reveals values that would imply an increased likeliness of dense enough surface waters to permit sinking from that time onwards. The changes in the Nordic Seas appear to follow a similar reorganisation in the Labrador Sea and the onset of strong winter convection there. Finally, a gradual eastward expansion of the Arctic Domain can be observed from ~4.5 ka BP onwards, with a delayed consequent reaction of the Atlantic-sourced water inflow at the Vøring Plateau showing a slight recovery of cool taxa from ~2.4 ka BP onwards.",

            "abstract": "It has long been considered that the inner edge of the Earth’s outer radiation belt is closely correlated with the minimum plasmapause location. However, recent discoveries by Baker et al. [1] show that it is not the case for ultra-relativistic electrons (2-10 MeV) in the radiation belt. Based on almost two years of Van Allen Probes/REPT data, they find that the inner edge of highly relativistic electrons is rarely collocated with the plasmapause; and more interestingly, there is a clear, persistent, and nearly impenetrable barrier to inward transport of high energy electrons, observed to locate at L~2.8. The presence of such an impenetrable barrier at this very specific location poses a significant puzzle. Using our DREAM3D diffusion model, which includes radial, pitch angle, and momentum diffusion, we are able to simulate the observed impenetrable barrier of ultra-relativistic electrons. The simulation demonstrates that during strong geomagnetic storms the plasmapause can be compressed to very low L region (sometimes as low as L~3), then strong chorus waves just outside the plasmapause can locally accelerate electrons up to multiple-MeV; when storm recovers, plasmapause moves back to large L, while the highly-relativistic electrons generated at low L continue to diffuse inward and slow decay by pitch angle diffusion from plasmaspheric hiss. The delicate balance between slow inward radial diffusion and weak pitch angle scattering creates a fixed inner boundary or barrier for ultra-relativistic electrons. The barrier is found to locate at a fixed L location, independent of the initial penetration depth of electrons that is correlated with the plasmapause location. Our simulation results quantitatively reproduce the evolution of the flux versus L profile, the L location of the barrier, and the decay rate of highly energetic electrons right outside the barrier.\n1Baker, D.

Possible sources of the sulfur (S) include the Chichón Volcano and petroleum basins in the area. A better understanding of the source of the H2S in CVL may help predict where else SAS may have occurred. Analysis of methane (CH4) in CVL may provide a proxy to assess the source of S entering CVL.\nWe obtained 13 air samples in 1-L Tedlar® bags from varying locations in CVL to assess the role of CH4 in sulfide-rich karst systems. CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations were measured by gas-chromatography. The stable isotopic ratios of carbon and hydrogen were measured on a stable isotope-ratio mass-spectrometer.\nCH4 in the air of CVL ranged from 1.88 ± 0.10 ppmv to 3.7 ± 0.2 ppmv. CO2 concentrations ranged from 400 ± 20 ppmv to 920 ± 50 ppmv. For comparison, the CH4 and CO2 concentrations in the outside atmosphere were 1.96 ± 0.10 ppmv and 430 ± 20 ppmv respectively. CH4 and CO2 were positively correlated in CVL (R2 = 0.91, CH4 = [0.0035 ± 0.0007] CO2 + [0.4 ± 0.4], p >0.01). The highest concentrations were near springs. Keeling-style analysis showed that the CH4 samples from CVL plot along a two-end member mixing model and suggest that CH4 is outgassing from spring water with isotopic compositions δ13CCH4 = -24 ± 3 ‰ and δ2HCH4 = -40 ± 40 ‰. CO2 did not plot along a two end member mixing model.\nThe proposed δ13C of CH4 entering from springs does not closely match the δ13CCH4 values from hydrocarbon basins in the area. This is likely due to oxidative loss of CH4 as it ascends to CVL which may be partly driven by anaerobic methanotrophy coupled to sulfate reduction. Analysis of the spring water chemistry coupled to biogeochemical modeling may help quantify the amount of methanotrophy occurring in the subsurface.",

Resident microbiota (bacteria and fungi) transform the majority of carbon in ecosystems, and the structure of these communities influence seedling establishment and the trajectory of vegetative recovery as well as biogeochemical cycling. We surveyed changes in microbial composition and activity after wildfire to better understand soil microbial resilience and fire ecology. Specifically, we assessed potential extracellular enzyme activities in response to fire severity across landscape position and aspect. We sampled 18 days after containment of the June 2013 Thompson Ridge Fire in the Jemez River Basin Critical Zone Observatory, across a gradient of burn severities in a mixed-conifer zero order basin. We subsampled six depths through the surface soil profile and measured potential activities of seven hydrolytic enzymes using established fluorometric techniques. Four of these enzymes hydrolyze C-rich substrates (β-glucosidase [BG], β-D-cellubiosidase [CB], xylosidase [XYL], and α-glucosidase [AG], two hydrolyze N-rich substrates N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase [NAG] and leucine aminopeptidase [LAP]), and one hydrolyzes a P-rich substrate (acid phosphatase [PHOS]). Results showed decreased activities with depth for BG, CB, and LAP. Significantly higher potential enzyme activity was observed for convergent sites relative to planar or divergent sites across all depths sampled. Additionally, we looked at shifts in enzyme nutrient acquisition ratios that correspond with resource limitations relative to microbial stoichiometric demands. Higher acquisition potential is interpreted as greater resource allocation towards nutrient acquisition. Results showed a variance in resource acquisition potential with depth for C relative to N, with greater resources being allocated towards acquiring C at shallower depth. Conversely, greater resource acquisition potential was expended towards acquiring P relative to N and C at greater depths. These results provide a greater understanding of the microbial role in soil C and nutrient cycling following fire and offer insight into microbially mediated biogeochemical ‘hot spots’ in the landscape.",

            "abstract": "The hyporheic zone is the region where surface water and groundwater interact beneath and adjacent to stream and river systems. The hyporheic zone has been shown to affect water quality constituents such as heat, pollutants, and nutrients in this interfacial region. Recent modeling studies have shown that some compounds upwelling from groundwater toward surface water only react when water originating in surface water and groundwater mix at the edge of the hyporheic zone. These “mixing-dependent” reactions may be important for addressing upwelling pollution, yet depend on the extent of the mixing zone. Recent modeling studies have also shown this mixing zone to be thin, but this has not been confirmed in lab or field studies. Our current study took the first step toward such confirmation by simulating mixing between hyporheic flow cells and upwelling groundwater in a 1.7 m x 1m flow-through laboratory sediment mesocosm. We used tracer dyes and digital photographs taken through the glass wall of the mesocosm to quantify mixing zone thickness. We varied key hydraulic controls such as the surface water head drop that drives the hyporheic flow cells. Steady-state results confirm the thin mixing zones predicted by the earlier modeling. Mixing zone length increases with increasing surface water head drop, but mixing zone thickness appears to remain relatively constant. Furthermore, if the head drop in surface water changes rapidly, the mixing zone moves through riverbed sediments but does not appear to change appreciably in thickness. As a result, we conclude that mixing zones are probably thin under a range of field conditions. This has implications for one common definition of the hyporheic zone as an area of substantial mixing of surface water and groundwater. Thin mixing zones also may limit mixing-dependent reactions of upwelling contaminants, which bears further study.",

However, Louisiana coastal wetlands have been threatened by natural (sea-level rise) and human (infrastructure development) stresses; they constitute the major part of the wetland loss of the country. Monitoring Louisiana’s coastal wetlands represent a large challenge for local and federal authorities due to the large amount of area and hostile environment. Insofar, optical remote sensing observations have been used to classify the wetlands, monitor land cover changes, and assess the wetland loss over time. However, optical data is insensitive to surface flow and, hence, unable to detect the width of the tidal zone and changes in this area over time. SAR interferometry can provide useful information and ease the monitoring task. Wetland InSAR is the only application of the InSAR technology that provides information of aquatic surface. It provides useful information on surface water level changes in both inland and coastal wetlands. In this study, we use InSAR and tide gauge observations to detect and compare surface water level changes in response to ocean tide propagation through the Louisiana coastal wetlands. Our data consist of ALOS PALSAR, Radarsat-1 and tide gauge information over the coast of Louisiana. In order to detect water level changes, we used mainly high coherence interferferograms with short temporal baselines (46-92 days for ALOS data and 24-48 days for Radarsat-1). Interferometric processing of the data provides details maps of water level changes in the coastal zone. Preliminary results indicate tidal changes of up 30 cm and that tidal flow is limited to 8-10 km from the open water. Our results also show that the tidal flow is disrupted by various man-made structures as, canals and roads. The high spatial resolution wetland InSAR observations can provide useful constraints for detailed coastal wetland flow models.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the role of shallow convection during the pre-onset of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) over the Tropical Western Pacific. Ten years of observations from a vertically pointing cloud radar, soundings, and other instruments from the ARM site at Manus Island are used. Shallow-cloud moistening is estimated from these observations. Episodes of large-scale convection at Manus are classified into MJO and non-MJO events. The characteristics leading to the onset of both types of events in the radar-observed shallow precipitating and non-precipitating clouds, sounding-observed humidity, and sub-grid moisture and temperature tendencies from reanalysis are compared. Deepening of positive low-tropospheric moisture anomalies is characteristic during the pre-onset of MJO events but not during the pre-onset of non-MJO events. This MJO feature is accompanied by a tilt of positive anomalies in diabatic heating. There are positive anomalies in shallow-cloud abundance and rainfall during both types of events, but these are slightly larger during MJO events. Shallow convection thrive during convectively suppressed conditions, which are absent during non-MJO events. However, shallow cloud moistening is smaller during MJO events due the slightly higher rainfall rates. In average, moistening from shallow clouds is about one tenth of the total column moistening (1 mm/day) during the pre-onset of the MJO. The differences in humidity between MJO and non-MJO events might be explained by the differences in the dynamic fields. This suggests that shallow convection do not play a leading role during the moistening phase of the MJO.",

            "abstract": "Hydromorphology concerns the structure and evolution of watershed systems over time (e.g. years, decades, and centuries). We introduce a generalized multivariate approach for exploring hydromorphological problems that involves estimation of the multivariate sensitivity or elasticity of streamflow to changes in climate, water use, and land use. Key advantages of the method presented are that it does not require a model assumption yet provides confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for the resulting elasticities.\nA case study highlights the influence of urbanization on the complete range of streamflow and shows that accounting for the simultaneous interactions among land use, climate, and water use is a necessary component for understanding the influence of urbanization on streamflow regimes. All streamflows are influenced to some extent by changes in climate, land use, and water use. However, in the case study the most striking sensitivities to all three factors are associated with low streamflows.\nThese results imply that future hydromorphological changes in the case study basin will tend to exacerbate average annual streamflows and droughts more than floods. The extremely large positive sensitivity of low flows to changes in land use departs from the conclusions of several previous studies (e.g. Brandes et al. 2005). Investigations of a much broader class of basins are needed to support and generalize this new result of sensitive response of low streamflows. Overall, the study demonstrates that streamflow is sensitive to changes in climate, land use, and water use. All three of these effects must be considered simultaneously to fully understand the hydromorphology of a watershed. It is our hope that future studies will extend this methodology to a much wider and richer cross section of watersheds.",

Double-sided continuous laser heating is combined with one-side flash heating of a metallic foil, while the time-resolved temperature is measured from both sides with spectral radiometry in an optical streak camera. Emission and temperature perturbations measured on opposite sides of the foil were modeled using finite element calculations in order to extract thermal diffusivity and conductivity of foils. Results on platinum and iron at high pressures and temperatures will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic environment has witnessed important changes due to global warming, resulting in increased surface air temperatures and rain events which both exacerbate snow cover deterioration (Semmens et al, 2013; Rennert et al, 2009; White et al, 2007; Min et al, 2008; Sharp et al, 2013; Schaeffer et al, 2013). Snow cover duration is declining by almost 20% per decade, a far higher rate than model estimates (Derksen and Brown, 2012). Concomitant with increasing temperatures and decreasing snow cover duration, the length of the arctic growing season is reported to have increased by 1.1 – 4.9 days per decade since 1951 (Menzel et al, 2006), and, plant productivity and CO2 uptake from arctic vegetation are strongly influenced by changes in growing season length (Myneni et al., 1997; Schaefer et al., 2005; Euskirchen et al., 2006). Based on more than a decade of eddy flux measurements in Arctic tundra ecosystems across the North slope of Alaska, and remotely sensed snow cover data, we show that earlier snow melt in the spring increase C uptake while an extended snow free period in autumn is associated with a higher C loss. Here we present the impacts of changes in snow cover dynamics between spring and autumn in arctic tundra ecosystems on the carbon dynamics and net C balance of the Alaskan Arctic.\n",

            "abstract": "The internal layer stratigraphy of polar ice sheets revealed by airborne radio-echo sounding (RES) contains valuable information about past ice sheet mass balance and dynamics. Internal layers in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are considered to be isochrones and are continuous over several hundreds of kilometres. In contrast, internal layers in Canadian Arctic ice caps appear to be very heterogeneous and fragmentary, consisting of highly discontinuous layers that can be traced over only a few to several tens of kilometres.\nInternal layers most likely relate to former ice surfaces (the upper few meters of snow/firn), the properties which are directly influenced by atmospheric conditions including the air temperature, precipitation rate, and prevailing wind pattern. We hypothesize that the heterogeneous and complex nature of layers in the Canadian Arctic results from highly variable snow and firn conditions at the surface. Characterizing surface properties such as variations in the snow/firn density from dry to wet snow/firn, as well as high-density shallow ice layers and lenses of refrozen water can help to elucidate the complex internal layer pattern in the Canadian Arctic ice caps.\nEstimates of the snow/firn surface density and roughness can be derived from reflectance and scattering information using the surface radar returns from RES measurements. Here we present estimates of the surface snow/firn density distribution over Devon Ice Cap in the Canadian Arctic derived by the Radar Statistical Reconnaissance (RSR) methodology (Grima et al., 2014, Planetary & Space Sciences) using data collected by recent airborne radar sounding programs. The RSR generates estimates of the statistical distribution of surface echo amplitudes over defined areas along a survey transect. The derived distributions are best-fitted with a theoretical stochastic envelope, parameterized with the signal reflectance and scattering, in order to separate those two components. Finally, the signal reflectance and scattering components are used in a backscattering model to invert for the distribution of the surface density and roughness generating the observed surface echo amplitudes.",

Mineral dust is injected into the atmosphere during dust storms when the surface winds are sufficiently strong and the land surface conditions are favorable. Dust storms are very common in specific regions of the world including the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, which contains more than 50% of the global dust sources. In this work, we present simulation of the dust cycle under the framework of CESM1.2.2 and evaluate how well the model captures the spatio-temporal characteristics of dust sources, transport and deposition at global scale, especially in dust source regions. We conducted our simulations using two existing erodibility maps (geomorphic and topographic) and a new erodibility map, which is based on the correlation between observed wind and dust. We compare the simulated results with MODIS satellite data, MACC reanalysis data, and AERONET station data. Comparison with MODIS satellite data and MACC reanalysis data shows that all three erodibility maps generally reproduce the spatio-temporal characteristics of dust optical depth globally. However, comparison with AERONET station data shows that the simulated dust optical depth is generally overestimated for all erodibility maps. Results vary greatly by region and scale of observational data. Our results also show that the simulations forced by reanalysis meteorology capture the overall dust cycle more realistically compared to the simulations done using online meteorology.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems are influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors. Abiotic factors, such as variation in meteorological conditions, directly drive biophysical and biogeochemical processes; biotic factors, referring to the inherent properties of the ecosystem components, reflect the internal regulating effects including temporal dynamics and memory. The magnitude of the effect of abiotic and biotic factors on forest ecosystem carbon exchange has been suggested to vary at different time scales. In this study, we design and conduct a model-data fusion experiment to investigate the role and relative importance of the biotic and abiotic factors for inter-annual variability of the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of temperate deciduous forest ecosystems in the Northeastern US. A process-based model (FöBAAR) is parameterized at four eddy-covariance sites using all available flux and biometric measurements. We conducted a “transplant” modeling experiment, that is, cross- site and parameter simulations with different combinations of site meteorology and parameters. Using wavelet analysis and variance partitioning techniques, analysis of model predictions identifies both spatial variant and spatially invariant parameters. Variability of NEE was primarily modulated by gross primary productivity (GPP), with relative contributions varying from hourly to yearly time scales. The inter-annual variability of GPP and NEE is more regulated by meteorological forcing, but spatial variability in certain model parameters (biotic response) has more substantial effects on the inter-annual variability of ecosystem respiration (Reco) through the effects on carbon pools. Both the biotic and abiotic factors play significant roles in modulating the spatial and temporal variability in terrestrial carbon cycling in the region. Together, our study quantifies the relative importance of both, and calls for better understanding of them to better predict regional CO2 exchanges.",

            "abstract": "It is commonly accepted that ambient ground motion within the 1 s to 10 s period range (including the so-called secondary microseism peak) is caused by ocean wave interactions that induce pressure fluctuations at the ocean floor through acoustic waves. In recent years, numerical ocean wave models have successfully predicted the maximum amplitude of the secondary microseism peak in the 4 s to 8 s range, where seismic energy is mainly caused by the interaction of ocean swells of typically 8 s to 16 s of periods, i.e. 100-400 m wavelengths, that travel in opposite directions as they are generated by distant storms, by single but fast moving storms or by coastal reflections.\nIn contrast, little attention has been devoted to the contribution of local wind generated seas characterized by shorter period waves (1 s to 3 s ocean waves, i.e. 1-10 m wavelengths) in the generation of higher frequency seismic noise in coastal regions. While this noise content is becoming increasingly used by seismologists, for example for high resolution ground imaging from dense arrays, its absolute amplitude and frequency dependence has not yet been consistently predicted: this is the purpose of this talk.\nWe present a simple analytical approach that allows the prediction of ambient seismic noise recorded on land in the 0.5 s to 3 s range from knowledge of the local wind field operating on the surrounding ocean. Ocean waves and their interactions are accounted for within hundreds of kilometers from coastal seismic stations, and a realistic ground structure is considered in the generation and propagation of Rayleigh waves. We show that the amplitude and frequency scaling of hourly noise spectra can be systematically predicted, and thus suggest that seismic stations can complement in-situ measurements in inferring wind sea properties in coastal regions.\nFurthermore, we use our new approach to demonstrate that seismic stations deployed on land can be used to remotely study ocean waves in sea ice environments, which is a topic of growing interest due to the role of ocean waves in the current decline of sea ice. We show that sea ice mechanical changes can be monitored at daily timescales using our framework. Our ongoing work consists in combining seismic observations with satellite observations of sea ice concentration and thickness to extract sea ice mechanical strength.",

            "abstract": "A critical point in the analysis of ground displacements time series is the development of data driven methods that allow to discern and characterize the different sources that generate the observed displacements. A widely used multivariate statistical technique is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which allows to reduce the dimensionality of the data space maintaining most of the variance of the dataset explained. It reproduces the original data using a limited number of Principal Components, but it also shows some deficiencies. Indeed, PCA does not perform well in finding the solution to the so-called Blind Source Separation (BSS) problem, i.e. in recovering and separating the original sources that generated the observed data. This is mainly due to the assumptions on which PCA relies: it looks for a new Euclidean space where the projected data are uncorrelated. Usually, the uncorrelation condition is not strong enough and it has been proven that the BSS problem can be tackled imposing on the components to be independent. The Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is, in fact, another popular technique adopted to approach this problem, and it can be used in all those fields where PCA is also applied. An ICA approach enables us to explain the time series imposing a fewer number of constraints on the model, and to reveal anomalies in the data such as transient signals. However, the independence condition is not easy to impose, and it is often necessary to introduce some approximations. To work around this problem, we use a variational bayesian ICA (vbICA) method, which models the probability density function (pdf) of each source signal using a mix of Gaussian distributions. This technique allows for more flexibility in the description of the pdf of the sources, giving a more reliable estimate of them. Here we present the application of the vbICA technique to GPS position time series. First, we use vbICA on synthetic data that simulate a seismic cycle (interseismic + coseismic + postseismic + seasonal + noise), and study the ability of the algorithm to recover the original (known) sources of deformation. Secondly, we apply vbICA to different tectonically active scenarios, such as earthquakes in central and northern Italy, as well as the study of slow slip events in Cascadia.",

This sparseness limits our understanding of the dominant feedbacks between the AIS, Southern Hemisphere climate, and global sea level. Marine records of iceberg-rafted debris (IBRD) provide a nearly continuous signal of ice-sheet dynamics and variability. IBRD records from the North Atlantic Ocean have been widely used to reconstruct variability in Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, but comparable records from the Southern Ocean of the AIS are lacking due to the low resolution and large dating uncertainties in existing sediment cores. Here we present two well-dated, high-resolution IBRD records that capture a spatially integrated signal of AIS variability during the last deglaciation. We document eight events of increased iceberg flux from various parts of the AIS between 19,000 and 9,000 years ago, in marked contrast to previous scenarios which identified the main AIS retreat as occurring after Meltwater Pulse 1A (MWP-1A) and continuing into the late Holocene. The highest IBRD flux occurred 14,600 years ago, providing the first direct evidence for an Antarctic contribution to MWP-1A. Climate model simulations with AIS freshwater forcing identify a positive feedback between poleward transport of Circumpolar Deep Water, subsurface warming and AIS melt, suggesting that small perturbations to the ice sheet can be substantially enhanced and providing a possible mechanism for rapid sea-level rise.",

            "abstract": "It is possible to manipulate the chemical and physical properties of pyrogenic organic matter (‘black carbon’ or ‘biochar’) during its production and tailor its composition for intended environmental management applications. In this study biochars made from grass (Tripsacum floridanum), oak (Quercus lobata), and pine (Pinus taeda) at 250 ºC in air and 400 and 650 ºC under N2 were characterized by solid state 13C-NMR spectroscopy and desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization mass spectrometry. Among the biochars produced, those originating from pine showed distinct characteristics, with greater amounts of oxygenated aromatic clusters after low temperature combustion and more condensed aromatic clusters after higher temperature pyrolysis. Although a mixture of small and large aromatic clusters occurred across the temperature profile, cluster size increased and functionality decreased with increasing combustion temperature (Figure 1). At medium and high temperatures, aromatic clusters of up to 60- carbon aromatic rings inter-connected with small chains dominated the biochars examined. These structures are intermediate in size between the linearly condensed structures and the predominantly condensed aromatic clusters proposed in earlier studies. Field aging of the pure biochars for 15 months decreased the total acid functional group content as determined by Boehm titration, but solid-state 13C-NMR analyses suggested the creation and transformation of a range of functional groups via leaching, oxidation, and addition of microbially-produced organic matter. Similar trends were observed when the biochars were mixed with soils, suggesting that the same biochar aging processes occurred in the soil environment. These findings demonstrate that biochar transformations occur over time through a multitude of processes that are both biochar and soil type-dependent.",

            "abstract": "As part of InTeGrate, teams of 3 instructors at 3 different institutions developed modules that help prepare pre-service teachers to teach Earth science aligned with the NGSS. Modules were evaluated against a rubric, which addresses InTeGrate’s five guiding principles, learning objectives and outcomes, assessment and measurement, resources and materials, instructional strategies and alignment. As all modules must address one or more Earth-related grand challenge facing society, develop student ability to address interdisciplinary problems, improve student understanding of the methods of geoscience, use authentic geoscience data, and incorporate systems thinking, they align well with the NGSS. Once modules passed the rubric, they were tested by the authors in their classrooms. Testing included pre- and post-assessment of geoscience literacy and assessment of student learning towards the module goal; materials were revised based on the results of testing.\nIn “Exploring Geoscience Methods with Secondary Education Students,” pre-service science teachers compare geoscientific thinking with the classic (experimental) scientific method, investigate global climate change and its impacts on human systems, and prepare an interdisciplinary lesson plan that addresses geoscience methods in context of a socioscientific issue. In “Soils and Society,” pre-service elementary teachers explore societal issues where soil is important, develop skills to describe and test soil properties, and create a standards-based Soils and Society Kit that consists of lessons and supporting materials to teach K-8 students about a soil-and-society issue. In “Interactions between Water, Earth’s Surface, and Human Activity,” students explore the effects of running water on shaping Earth’s surface both over geologic time and through short-term flooding events, and produce a brochure to inform citizens of the impact of living near a river.\nThe modules are freely available at http://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/teaching_materials/modules_courses.html and include Instructor Stories, where each author describes how they adapted the module to their teaching environment. The goal of showing different implementations of the materialst is to facilitate adoption and adaption beyond the team of authors.",

            "abstract": "Land cover and climatic change will alter biosphere-atmosphere exchanges of water vapor and carbon dioxide depending, in part, on feedbacks between biotic activity and water availability. Eddy covariance observations allow us to estimate ecosystem-scale productivity and respiration, and these datasets are now becoming sufficiently mature to advance understanding of these ecohydrological interactions. Here we use a network of sites in semiarid western North America representing gradients of water availability and functional plant type. We examine how precipitation (P) controls evapotranspiration (ET), net ecosystem production (NEP), and its component fluxes of ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross ecosystem production (GEP). Despite the high variability in seasonal and annual precipitation timing and amounts that we expect to influence ecosystem function, we find persistent overall relationships between P or ET and the fluxes of NEP, Reco and GEP across the network, indicating a commonality and resilience in ecosystem soil and plant response to water availability. But we also observe several important site differences such as prior seasonal legacy effects on subsequent fluxes which vary depending on dominant plant functional type. For example, multiyear droughts, episodic cool-season droughts, and hard winter freezes seem to affect the herbaceous species differently than the woody ones. Nevertheless, the overall, strong coupling between hydrologic and ecologic processes at these sites bolsters our ability to predict the response of dryland ecosystems to future precipitation change.",

            "abstract": "When considering radar observations of airless bodies containing regolith, the radar backscatter coefficient is dependent upon the complex dielectric permittivity of the regolith materials. In many current applications of imaging radar data, uncertainty in the dielectric permittivity precludes quantitative estimates of such important parameters as regolith thickness and depth to buried features (e.g., lava flows on the Aristarchus Plateau on the Moon and the flows that surround the Quetzalpetlatl Corona on Venus). For asteroids, radar is an important tool for detecting and characterizing regoliths. Many previous measurements of the real and/or complex parts of the dielectric permittivity have been made, particularly for the Moon (on both Apollo samples and regolith analogues). However, no studies to date have systematically explored the relationship between permittivity and the various mineralogical components such as presence of FeO and TiO2. For lunar materials, the presence of the mineral ilmenite (FeTiO3), which contains equal portions FeO and TiO2, is thought to be the dominant factor controlling the loss tangent (tanδ, the ratio of the imaginary and real components of the dielectric permittivity). Ilmenite, however, is not the only mineral to contain iron in the lunar soil and our understanding of the effect of iron on the loss tangent is insufficient. Beyond the Moon, little is known about the effects on permittivity of carbonaceous materials. This is particularly relevant for missions to asteroids, such as the OSIRIS-REx mission to (101955) Bennu, a carbonaceous asteroid whose regolith composition is largely unknown. Here we present preliminary broadband (300 Mhz to 14 GHz) measurements on materials intended as planetary regolith analogs. Our ultimate goal is to establish a database of the effects of a wide range mineralogical components on dielectric permittivity, in support of the OSIRIS REx mission and ongoing Earth-based radar investigation of the Moon. In addition to facilitating quantitative interpretation of lunar radar data, our results will provide context into which samples returned by OSIRIS REx will fit, and will therefore inform future remote exploration of asteroids.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale, real-time, sensor-driven analytics are a highly effective set of tools in many research environments; however, the barrier to entry is expensive and the learning curve is steep. These systems need to operate efficiently from end to end, with the key aspects being data transmission, acquisition, management and organization, and retrieval. When building a generic multidisciplinary platform, acquisition and data management needs to be designed with scalability and flexibility as the primary focus. Additionally, in order to leverage current sensor web technologies, the integration of common sensor data standards (ie. SensorML and SWE Services) should be supported. Perhaps most important, researchers should be able to get started and integrate the platform into their set of research tools as easily and quickly as possible.\nThe largest issue with current platforms is that the sensor data must be formed and described using the previously mentioned standards. As useful as these standards are for organizing data, they are cumbersome to adopt, often restrictive, and are required to be geospatially-driven.\nOur solution, RTEMP (Real-time Environment Monitoring Platform), is a real-time analytics platform with over ten years and an estimated two million dollars of investment. It has been developed for our continuously expanding requirements of operating and building remote sensors and supporting equipment for space physics research. A key benefit of our approach is RTEMP’s ability to manage agnostic data. This allows data that flows through the system to be structured in any way that best addresses the needs of the sensor operators and data users, enabling extensive flexibility and streamlined development and research.\nHere we begin with an overview of RTEMP and how it is structured. Additionally, we will showcase the ways that we are using RTEMP and how it is being adopted by researchers in an increasingly broad range of other research fields. We will lay out a roadmap describing our path forward in the development of RTEMP over the next year, including the anticipated incorporation of new in line analytics for carrying out feature extraction and autonomous decision making “on the fly”. Our goal, within a year, is to be operating the world’s first true sensor web (as opposed to sensor network) for geospace research.",

            "abstract": "The three-dimensional geomechanical model of Southern California was developed, including a mountain relief, fault tectonics and characteristic internal features such as the roof of the consolidated crust and Moho surface. The initial stress state of the model is governed by the gravitational forces and horizontal tectonic motions estimated from GPS observations.\nThe analysis shows that the three-dimensional geomechanical models allows monitoring of the changes in the stress state during the seismic process in order to constrain the distribution of the future places with increasing seismic activity. This investigation demonstrates one of possible approach to monitor upcoming seismicity for the periods of days – weeks – months. Continuous analysis of the stress state was carried out during 2009-2014. Each new earthquake with М~1 and above from USGS catalog was considered as the new defect of the Earth crust which has some definite size and causes redistribution of the stress state. Overall calculation technique was based on the single function of the Earth crust damage, recalculated each half month. As a result each half month in the upper crust layers and partially in the middle layers we revealed locations of the maximal values of the stress state parameters: elastic energy density, shear stress, proximity of the earth crust layers to their strength limit.\nAll these parameters exhibit similar spatial and temporal distribution. How follows from observations all four strongest events with М ~ 5.5–7.2 occurred in South California during the analyzed period were prefaced by the parameters anomalies in peculiar advance time of weeks-months in the vicinity of 10-50 km from the upcoming earthquake. After the event the stress state source disappeared.\nThe figure shows migration of the maximums of the stress state variations gradients (parameter D) in the vicinity of the epicenter of the earthquake 04.04.2010 with М=7.2 in the period of 01.01.2010-01.05.2010. Grey lines show the major faults. In the table the values are sampled by 2 weeks, “-“ indicates time before the event, “+” indicates time after the event.",

Soybean is an important global commodity crop, and the area of land cultivated for soybean has risen dramatically over the past 60 years, occupying more than 5% of all global croplands (Monfreda et al 2008). Escalating demands for soy over the next twenty years are anticipated to be met by an increase of 1.5 times the current global production, resulting in expansion of soybean cultivated land area by nearly the same amount (Masuda and Goldsmith 2009). Soybean cropland area is estimated with the use of a sampling strategy and supervised non-linear hierarchical decision tree classification for the United States, Argentina and Brazil as the prototype in development of a new methodology for crop specific agricultural area estimation. Comparison of our 30 m2 Landsat soy classification with the National Agricultural Statistical Services Cropland Data Layer (CDL) soy map shows a strong agreement in the United States for 2011, 2012, and 2013. RapidEye 5m2 imagery was also classified for soy presence and absence and used at the field scale for validation and accuracy assessment of the Landsat soy maps, describing a nearly 1 to 1 relationship in the United States, Argentina and Brazil. The strong correlation found between all products suggests high accuracy and precision of the prototype and has proven to be a successful and efficient way to assess soybean cultivated area at the sub-national and national scale for the United States with great potential for application elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "Caribbean reefs changed profoundly in taxonomic composition, diversity, and dominance structure during late Pliocene and Pleistocene climatic change. These changes coincide with protracted climatic deterioration and cooling between 2.0 to 0.8 Ma, and the onset of high amplitude sea-level fluctuations ~400 ka. The Dominican Republic Drilling Project (DRDP) was initiated to determine how climate change and global high-amplitude sea level changes influenced depositional patterns in Pliocene to Recent reef systems of the Caribbean. A transect of 7 core borings (~700 m total depth) were collected along the southern coast of the DR. New age constraints based on U/Th geochronometry and radiogenic Sr isotopes, combined with depositional lithofacies, faunal indicators, and stable isotope profiles have allowed us to correlate between wells and define the internal anatomy and stratal geometry of the individual reef sigmoids and sigmoid sets. Faunal records suggest most extinction occurred prior to ~1 Ma. Following this extinction, fringing reef margins of the Caribbean display a characteristic zonation in which Acropora palmata dominates shallow high-energy reef crests and Acropora cervicornis calmer fore-reef slopes and backreef lagoons. The dominance of acroporids across this zonation has been attributed to growth rates 5-100 times faster than other corals.",

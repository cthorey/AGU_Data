            "abstract": "Recent global and regional studies of seismic tomography in both oceans and continents show linear bands of low velocity anomalies that are aligned with absolute plate motion and coincident with intraplate volcanic chains. To explain the seismic and gravity anomalies observed beneath the Pacific ocean small scale convection is frequently cited but this model does explain the wide range of wavelengths that are reported. We propose a new hypothesis suggesting that viscous fingering instabilities can form when hot and wet mantle plumes discharge into the upper mantle and displace higher viscosity depleted asthenosphere. Fingers travel laterally through the asthenospheric channel below moving plates and are correlated with melting and intraplate volcanic chains observed on the seafloor. The development of viscous fingering instabilities are investigated in laboratory fluid experiments using high viscosity miscible fluids in a Hele-Shaw cell scaled to the Earth using appropriate non-dimensional parameters. We perform a set of fluid experiments with viscosity ratios 3 to 200. Viscous fingers are observed to form for all viscosity ratios above 3.0 Pa s. After an initial growth period, fingers exhibit a constant wavelength for a given viscosity ratio. Fingering wavelength is strongly dependent on the plate spacing and therefore asthenospheric layer thickness. The average fingering wavelength is shown to increase with increasing viscosity ratio. When the viscosity ratio is high we observe longer fingers that initiate closer to the point of origin. Plate motion will be simulated using a sheet of mylar moving over radial fingers. Preliminary results indicate that fingers align with plate motion both upstream and downstream. This new model for viscous fingering may link off-axis mantle plumes to spreading centers where they contribute to melting, surface volcanism and the growth and formation of new lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Iranian Plateau forms a broad zone of deformation between the colliding Arabian and Eurasian plates. The convergence is accommodated in the Zagros Mountains of SW Iran, the Alborz Mountains of northern Iran, and the Kopeh Dagh Mountains of NE Iran. These deforming belts are separated by relatively aseismic depressions such as the Lut Block. It has been suggested that the Arabia-Eurasia collision is similar to the Indo-Eurasia collision but at a early point of development and therefore, it may provide clues to our understanding of the earlier stages of the continent-continent collision process. We present results of the analysis of seismic data collected along two NE-SW trending transects across the Iranian Plateau. The first profile extends from near Bushere on the Persian Gulf coast to near to the Iran-Turkmenistan border north of Mashad, and consists of seismic recordings along the SW portion of the line in 2000-2001 and recording along the NE portion of the line in 2003 and 2006-2008. The second profile extends from near the Iran-Iraq border near the Dezfel embayment to the south Caspian Sea coast north of Tehran. We apply the combined 2.5D finite element waveform tomography algorithm of Baker and Roecker [2014] to jointly invert teleseismic body and surface waves to determine the elastic wavespeed structures of these areas. The joint inversion of these different types of waves affords similar types of advantages that are common to combined surface wave dispersion/receiver function inversions in compensating for intrinsic weaknesses in horizontal and vertical resolution capabilities. We compare results recovered from a finite difference approach to document the effects of various assumptions related to their application, such as the inclusion of topography, on the models recovered. We also apply several different inverse methods, starting with simple gradient techniques to the more sophisticated pseudo-Hessian or L-BFGS approach, and find that the latter are generally more robust. Modeling of receiver functions and surface wave dispersion prior to the analysis is shown to be an efficacious way to generate starting models for this analysis.",

            "abstract": "The High Plains aquifer underlies about 175,000 square miles in parts of eight States—Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. The aquifer is the principal source of water for irrigation and public supply in this area, which is one of the major agricultural areas in the United States. However, soon after groundwater irrigation began, water-level declines occurred in some parts of the aquifer. In response, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with numerous Federal, State, and local water-resource agencies, began monitoring groundwater levels in the aquifer. Water levels are measured annually primarily in irrigation wells in winter to early spring (generally January to May, depending on location), when water levels generally have recovered from groundwater pumping for irrigation in the previous growing season and before the current year’s irrigation season. The water-level elevation for predevelopment (about 1950) conditions was determined using water-level measurements from more than 20,000 wells. The water-level elevation for 2013 was measured in more than 9,000 wells. The water-level measurements were analyzed and interpolated to map discrete intervals of water-level changes from predevelopment to the year 2013. The change in the volume of drainable water stored in the aquifer was calculated using the mapped area of each water-level-change interval, the average water-level change within each mapped interval, and the estimated average specific yield for the aquifer.",

            "abstract": "The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Terra and Aqua satellites provides cloud properties with daily, global coverage from its broad spectral range (36 bands between 0.415-14.235 micron) at high spatial resolution (250 m for two bands, 500 m for 5 bands, 1000 m for 29 bands). These cloud properties are aggregated to produce climatologies and histograms that are used widely in observational studies, modeling applications, and further data production. Providing a measure of the cloud detection uncertainty is essential to its quality and proper use.\n The MODIS cloud mask algorithm includes several domains defined according to latitude, surface type, and solar illumination, including land, water, snow/ice, desert, and coast for both day and night. A series of spectral tests are applied to identify the presence of clouds. There are several groups of tests, with differing numbers of tests in each group depending on the domain. A clear-sky confidence level ranging from 1 (high) to 0 (low) is returned for each test. The minimum confidence from all tests within a group is taken to be representative of that group. The Nth root of the product of all the group confidences (Q) determines the final confidence, where N is the number of groups. \n Our objective is to quantify the sensitivity of the MODIS cloud detection to various factors included in the cloud mask algorithm– specifically surface type, seasonality and viewing geometry, as well as, traditional identified uncertainties like cloud cover heterogeneity. The challenge is that two or more of these factors frequently interact, producing combined uncertainties in the retrievals that cannot be quantified by calculating retrieval sensitivities to each factor separately. This presentation will present an assessment of uncertainty sources within the MODIS cloud mask products due to uncertainties in the cloud thresholding approach used in the algorithm. This is accomplished through statistical comparison of cloud detection results of many realizations of the same scenes with appropriate modifications to the various thresholds.",

            "abstract": "Several recent studies have attempted to quantify methane (CH4) emissions in North America, but large uncertainties remain in the magnitude, spatial and temporal distribution, and source sectors responsible. Estimates of biogenic emissions from wetlands, emissions related to animal husbandry, and the continental scale implications of recent shifts in the oil and gas industry are poorly constrained. We estimate North American CH4 emissions from biogenic and anthropogenic sources using the new CarbonTracker-Lagrange inverse modeling framework. A wide array of measurements taken between 2007 and 2012 provide top-down constraints. These include: in-situ and flask measurements made at surface sites, tall towers, and aboard aircraft; and remote sensing observations. Source region sensitivity is provided by the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model, driven by meteorological fields from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. CH4 emissions and background values are optimized simultaneously through Bayesian and geostatistical inversion. A restricted maximum likelihood estimation procedure is used to derive uncertainties in both emissions and the mole fraction field. The wide temporal coverage, dense network of measurements, and varied sources of data allow for an analysis of spatio-temporal trends in emissions that has not previously been accomplished with top-down constraints.",

            "abstract": "Climate change, extreme climate events, and climate-induced disturbances will have a substantial and detrimental impact on terrestrial ecosystems. How ecosystems respond to these impacts will, in turn, have a significant effect on the quantity, quality, and timing of water supply for energy security, agriculture, industry, and municipal use. As a community, we lack sufficient quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the complex interplay between climate extremes (e.g., drought, floods), ecosystem dynamics (e.g., vegetation succession), and disruptive events (e.g., wildfire) to assess ecosystem vulnerabilities and to design mitigation strategies that minimize or prevent catastrophic ecosystem impacts.\nThrough a combination of experimental and observational science and modeling, we are developing a unique multi-physics ecohydrologic framework for understanding and quantifying feedbacks between novel climate and extremes, surface and subsurface hydrology, ecosystem dynamics, and disruptive events in critical watersheds. The simulation capability integrates and advances coupled surface-subsurface hydrology from the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS), dynamic vegetation succession from the Ecosystem Demography (ED) model, and QUICFIRE, a novel wildfire behavior model developed from the FIRETEC platform. These advances are expected to make extensive contributions to the literature and to earth system modeling.\nThe framework is designed to predict, quantify, and mitigate the impacts of climate change on vulnerable watersheds, with a focus on the US Mountain West and the energy-water nexus. This emerging capability is used to identify tipping points in watershed ecosystems, quantify impacts on downstream users, and formally evaluate mitigation efforts including forest (e.g., thinning, prescribed burns) and watershed (e.g., slope stabilization). The framework is being trained, validated, and demonstrated using field observations and remote data collections in the Valles Caldera National Preserve, including pre- and post-wildfire and infestation observations. Ultimately, the framework will be applied to the upper Colorado River basin. Here, we present an overview of the framework development strategy and latest field and modeling results.",

            "abstract": "Carbonaceous species in PM2.5 were measured in three seasons (except winter) in downtown and around a year in suburban in Nanjing. In particular, the OC and EC concentrations were continuously measured with 1-h interval at both sites. The mean concentrations of PM2.5, OC, EC were 85.9 μg/m3, 10.4 μg/m3, 4.2 μg/m3 and 63.4 μg/m3, 8.1 μg/m3, 5.3μg/m3 for downtown and suburban respectively. At the suburban site, compared to the lowest average concentration in spring, the relatively higher concentration of carbonaceous aerosol in summer was caused by biomass-burning activities. Significant increasing peaks of OC (up to 122.9 ug/m3) and EC (up to 35.8 ug/m3) in suburban were recorded in the June 10th night, and it is indicated using back trajectory that the air mass came through nearby agriculture areas. On the other hand, the OC and EC concentrations during the 2nd AYG (Asian Youth Games, Aug 16th - 24th in 2013) compared to that in rest days in August reduced by 21% and 10%, respectively, attributing to the effective control measures on reduction of industrial point sources, temporary control of motor vehicle and fugitive dusts. Rations of OC/EC in suburban were much lower than that in downtown. This might be due to the fact that the sampling point in suburban is quite close (in 400 meters) to a main highway. Both OC and EC concentrations in suburban were higher in nighttime than daytime, except OC in summer, indicating the existence of strong SOC and supported by high OC/EC and O3 at noon. The annual average SOC estimated by EC-tracer methods occupied 34.5% and 36.7% of the total OC for the downtown and suburban areas, respectively. OC/EC correlations in suburban were much weaker than those from downtown areas, which shows suburban areas is much more affected by long-range transport of pollution and/or complex sources including domestic coal combustion, biomass burning, industrial and transportation, especially in three other seasons except winter, which is also supported by poor correlations between carbonaceous species and gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO) in spring at suburban site.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how barrier islands along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States respond to storms and sea-level rise is an important management concern. Although these threats are well recognized, quantifying the integrated vulnerability is challenging due to the range of time and space scalesover which these processes act. Developing datasets and methods to identify the physical vulnerabilities of coastal environments due to storms and sea-level rise thus is an important scientific focus that supports land management decision making. Here we employ a Bayesian Network (BN) to model the interactions between geomorphic variables sampled from existing datasets that capture both storm-and sea-level rise related coastal evolution. The BN provides a means of estimating probabilities of changes in specific geomorphic characteristics such as foredune crest height, beach width, beach height, given knowledge of barrier island width, maximum barrier island elevation, distance from an inlet, the presence of anthropogenic modifications, and long-term shoreline change rates, which we assume to be directly related to sea-level rise. We evaluate BN skill and explore how different constraints, such as shoreline change characteristics (eroding, stable, accreting), distance to nearby inlets and island width, affect the probability distributions of future morphological characteristics. Our work demonstrates that a skillful BN can be constructed and that factors such as distance to inlet, shoreline change rate, and the presence of human alterations have the strongest influences on network performance. For Assateague Island, Maryland/Virginia, USA, we find that different shoreline change behaviors affect the probabilities of specific geomorphic characteristics, such as dune height, which allows us to identify vulnerable locations on the barrier island where habitat or infrastructure may be vulnerable to storms and sea-level rise.",

            "abstract": "Step-heating 40Ar/39Ar analysis can reveal spatial distributions of 40Ar* at the micron scale imparted by post- crystallization heating events through complex, multi-diffusion domain models. These efforts have largely focused on single-phase, terrestrial samples with only scant attention paid to multi-phase or extra-terrestrial materials. Generalizing these models to incorporate the multiple activation energies (E) expected from bulk rock samples introduces significant interpretational ambiguity. This is because the thermal crossovers explicit in multi-E cases make the age spectrum a function of the lab heating schedule in thermally disturbed samples. A further difficulty is that unique interpretation of the associated Arrhenius plot is no longer possible and a range of E’s can be fitted with equal goodness of fit. In order to address these challenges, we developed a new computational approach that simultaneously inverts the Arrhenius spectra and release pattern using a variant of the Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) algorithm for a square-pulse heating event. Our version uses a Levy Flight to break the swarm out of a local minima rather than randomly modifying a single dimension as in the original APSO. Further we explored issues of Pareto efficiency arising from fitting two fitness functions (i.e., the fit to the age spectra and to the Arrhenius plot) and found an adequate resolution to the classic inability to have a single best fit. By utilizing multiple-E samples, we are able to obtain unique thermal history solutions. Application of these methods to high resolution age spectra of the Jilin chondrite and Apollo 16 samples (North Ray Crater) and found fits of sufficiently high fidelity to constrain the absolute temperature of the thermal episode to better than ±10%.",

            "abstract": "Climatic change affects streamflow in watersheds with winter snowpack and an annual snowmelt hydrograph. In the northeastern US, changes in streamflow are driven by both the advanced timing of snowmelt and increasing summer precipitation. Projections of climate for the region in the 21st century is for warmer winters and wetter summers. Water planners need to understand future changes in flow metrics to determine if the current water resources are capable of fulfilling future demands or adapting to future changes in climate. The study of teleconnection patterns between oceanic indices variations and hydrologic variables may help improve the understanding of future water resources conditions in a watershed.\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation between oceanic indices and discharge variations in the Merrimack Watershed. The Merrimack Watershed is the fourth largest basin in New England which drains much of New Hampshire and northeastern portions of Massachusetts, USA. Variations in sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP) are defined by the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), respectively. We hypothesize that temporal changes in discharge are related to AMO and NAO variations since precipitation and discharge are highly correlated in the Merrimack.\nThe Merrimack Watershed consists of undisturbed (reference) catchments and disturbed (developed) basins with long stream gauge records (> 100 years). Developed basins provide an opportunity to evaluate the impacts of river regulation and land development on teleconnection patterns as well as changing climate. Time series of AMO and NAO indices over the past 150 years along with Merrimack annual precipitation and discharge time series have shown a 1 to 2-year watershed hydrologic memory; higher correlation between Merrimack annual precipitation and discharge with AMO and NAO are observed when a 1 to 2-year lag is given to AMO and NAO indices. For instance, the mean correlation of AMO with precipitation/discharge for a zero-year lag was 0.16/0.09 and increased to 0.26/0.23 for a 1-year lag. Our study provides an insight on the lagged hydrologic response of reference catchments and developed basins to variations in oceanic indices.",

            "abstract": "Infrasound signals from volcanoes represent the acceleration of the atmosphere during an eruption and have traditionally been classified into two end members: 1) “explosions” consisting primarily of a high amplitude bi-polar pressure pulse that lasts a few to tens of seconds, and 2) “tremor” or “jetting” consisting of sustained, broadband infrasound lasting for minutes to hours. However, as our knowledge and recordings of volcanic eruptions have increased, significant infrasound signal diversity has been found. Here we focus on identifying and characterizing trends in volcano infrasound data to help better understand eruption processes. We explore infrasound signal metrics that may be used to quantitatively compare, classify, and identify explosive eruptive styles by systematic analysis of the data.\nWe analyze infrasound data from short-to-medium duration explosive events recorded during recent infrasound deployments at Sakurajima Volcano, Japan; Karymsky Volcano, Kamchatka; and Tungurahua Volcano, Ecuador. Preliminary results demonstrate that a great variety of explosion styles and flow behaviors from these volcanoes can produce relatively similar bulk acoustic waveform properties, such as peak pressure and event duration, indicating that accurate classification of physical eruptive styles requires more advanced field studies, waveform analyses, and modeling. Next we evaluate the spectral and temporal properties of longer-duration tremor and jetting signals from large eruptions at Tungurahua Volcano; Redoubt Volcano, Alaska; Augustine Volcano, Alaska; and Nabro Volcano, Eritrea, in an effort to identify distinguishing infrasound features relatable to eruption features. We find that unique transient signals (such as repeated shocks) within sustained infrasound signals can provide critical information on the volcanic jet flow and exhibit a distinct acoustic signature to facilitate automatic detection. Automated detection and characterization of infrasound associated with a diverse spectrum of explosive activity could provide great benefits to volcano monitoring and will be presented here.",

            "abstract": "Oyster reefs have been shown to provide myriad critical ecosystem services, however their role in directing flow and currents during non-storm conditions has been largely neglected. In many regions, oyster reefs form as linear structures perpendicular to the coast and across the path of streams and rivers, potentially entraining large volumes of freshwater flow and altering nearshore mixing. We hypothesize that these reefs have the potential to influence salinity over large areas, providing a “keystone” ecosystem service by supporting multiple estuarine functions. Here we present results from a field and modeling study to quantify the effects of reef extent and elevation on estuarine salinities under varying river discharge. We found salinity differences ranging from 2 to 16 g/kg between inshore and offshore sides of degraded oyster reefs in the Suwannee Sound (FL, USA), supporting the role of reefs as local-scale freshwater dams. Moreover, differences between inshore and offshore salinities were correlated with flow, with the most marked differences during periods of low flow. Hydrodynamic modeling using the 3-D Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) suggests that the currently degraded reef system entrained greater volumes of freshwater in the past, buffering the landward advance of high salinities, particularly during low flow events related to droughts. Using ROMS, we also modeled a variety of hypothetical oyster bar morphology scenarios (historical, current, and “restored”) to understand how changes in reef structure (elevation, extent, and completeness) impact estuarine mixing and near-shore salinities. Taken together, these results serve to: 1) elucidate a poorly documented ecosystem service of oyster reefs; 2) provide an estimate of the magnitude and sptial extent of the freshwater entrainment effect; and 3) offer quantitative information to managers and restoration specialists interested in restoring oyster habitat.",

            "abstract": "Though aerosol radiative effects have been recognized as some of the largest sources of uncertainty among the forcers of climate change, the verification of the spatial and temporal variability of the magnitude and directionality of aerosol radiative forcing has remained challenging. Significant and contrasting changes in tropospheric aerosol burden have occurred over the past two decades as a result of changing patterns of emissions of primary aerosol and gaseous precursors. During this period, SO2 and NOx emissions across the US have reduced by about 66% & 50%, respectively. In contrast, anthropogenic emissions have increased dramatically across Asia. These changes provide an opportunity for conducting a systematic investigation of the processes regulating aerosol distributions, their optical properties, and verification of their simulated radiative effects for past conditions relative to measurements. We conduct multi-decadal simulations for the 1990-2010 period with the two-way coupled WRF-CMAQ modeling system over a domain covering the northern hemisphere and a nested finer resolution continental U.S. domain. Simulated aerosol size and composition and size are used to estimate their optical properties which are then used in the radiation calculations impacting both photolysis rates and atmospheric dynamics. Model results (aerosol burden and composition, radiation, temperature) over North America and Asia are analyzed in conjunction surface, aloft and remote sensing measurements to contrast the differing trends in aerosol-radiation interactions in these regions over the past two decades. Both model and measurements indicate significant reductions in tropospheric aerosol burden across North America and an associated increase in shortwave radiation at the surface. In contrast, an increase in tropospheric aerosol burden and reduction in surface shortwave radiation in noted across large portions of Asia during the past two decades. Simulated trends in aerosol composition, tropospheric burden, and radiative effects are compared with those inferred from available measurements. Model simulations with and without aerosol radiative effects are analyzed to assess the impacts of these interactions on severity of air pollution episodes.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic tephra deposits typically contain inclusions or fragments of quenched melt that preserve pre-eruptive volatile concentrations within the volcanic conduit. The concentrations of CO2, H2O and OH in obsidian pyroclasts provide information on magma storage depths while gradients in these volatile species provide information on rates and mechanisms of gas loss (or gain) in magma during ascent.\nWe are measuring CO2, H2O and OH profiles and area maps in six randomly selected pyroclastic obsidian clasts from Mono Craters, California using conventional Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Previous studies of these pyroclasts have focused on spot analyses of volatile concentrations within clast interiors, but our study targets clast rims, bubbles, flow bands, and texturally homogeneous regions of the clasts. The objective is to use the magnitude and spatial distribution of heterogeneities to assess the role of vapor fluxing and to determine timescales of magmatic processes such as bubble growth/resorption and mixing of magma from variable depths.\nThe first clast that we have analyzed is relatively homogeneous in dissolved H2O and OH but exhibits millimeter-scale heterogeneities in dissolved CO2. The concentration of dissolved CO2 varies by a factor of two, ranging from 15 to 30 ppm with a patchy distribution throughout the clast. The patches of high CO2 concentration do not correspond to visible textures within the clast. Total water (H2Ot) varies from 1.5 to 1.7 wt% with higher water concentrations corresponding to darker regions of glass. The distribution of CO2 requires a mechanism for introducing millimeter-scale heterogeneity within minutes to hours prior to the eruption. Our interpretation is that obsidian pyroclasts are assembled during chaotic vertical mixing and thus sample a range of depths within the feeder system. This interpretation is consistent with previous inferences that resorption of bubbles within pyroclasts is caused by repeated breaking and rewelding of magma and not due to the more quiescent process of isobaric cooling in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "Tree die-off events have showed a rapid increase in the last decade as a result of warmer temperatures and more severe drought. In the southwestern US, where piñon-juniper (PJ) woodlands occupy 24 million ha, the turn of the century drought (1999-2002) triggered 40-95% mortality of piñon pine (Pinus edulis) and 2-25% mortality of juniper (Juniperous monosperma). To determine the consequences of this disturbance on surface water balance we conducted a girdling experiment where all piñon trees above 7 cm of diameter at breast height in an area of 200 m2 were girdled in September 2009. We compared water and energy fluxes in this girdled site (PJG) using open-path eddy covariance (EC) to fluxes measured simultaneously in an intact PJ woodland less than 3 km away (PJC). In addition to evapotranspiration (ET) measurements from EC, canopy transpiration (ETc) was measured using sap flow probes (Granier thermal dissipation method) installed on five juniper and five piñon trees at each site. Soil water content (SWC) was also monitored using TDR probes (CS610, Campbell Scientific) under the three main cover types ( bare soil, under juniper and under piñon) and at three depths (5,10 and 30 cm depths) in both sites.\nTotal ET at PJG decreased slowly, but progressively, relative to PJC following the girdling, with annual ET 5%, 10% and 19% lower in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, in the girdled site. Following the girdling, canopy transpiration was significantly reduced at PJG, with an observed reduction of annual ETc at PJG of 45%, 59% and 71% from 2010 to 2012 compared to the PJC site. Our results suggest that girdling triggered a significant increase of soil evaporation and understory transpiration (not directly measured) as a result of canopy cover loss. This agrees with significant higher establishment of annual forbs seen at PJG relative to PJC and the increase of solar radiation reaching the soil surface as a result of canopy cover loss. Our results suggest piñon mortality leaves PJ woodlands hotter and drier than intact PJ woodlands. Given the extent of mortality observed in these woodlands and the predicted increase in mortality expected over the next century, these results have important surface energy balance consequences for the Southwestern US.",

            "abstract": "Northwesterly winds dominate the southern Gulf of California during most of the year and are associated with high primary productivity due to upwelling. The North American Monsoon causes the wind direction to reverse during the summer months and this brings humid and warms conditions to the region. This climatic temporal-variation generates alternate sedimentation and as a consequence laminated deposits of biogenic and terrigenous composition, preserved by the presence of an oxygen minimum zone. A 5.4 m long piston core (36N) was recovered from Cuenca Alfonso during the DIPAL IV cruise on May 2011. The core was sampled at 1 cm intervals to produce high-resolution proxy records of primary productivity (biogenic opal, total organic carbon and carbonate content) and rainfall (terrigenous content).  The core spans from late Pleistocene to the present and it’s the longest analyzed record for the basin for the above-mentioned proxies. In general, the proxies show a negative trend towards the present, suggesting a more productive basin and wetter climate in the past. During climatic events like the Bølling-Allerød and the Holocene climatic optimum (HCO) CaCO3 content decreased and opal content increased; suggesting the presence of stronger NW winds and nutrient-richer waters. In contrast, during the Younger Dryas and 8.2 Kyr events the opal content decrease and the CaCO3 increase.  At 5.5 KyBP the negative trends in all components intensify, especially during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). An exception to this occurs during the little ice Age (LIA) where the opal and CaCO3 increase. The organic carbon content increases at the end of the HCO and during the MWP, and decreases during the BA, YD, 8.2 Kyr and LIA. The terrigenous content follows the 24°N summer insolation trend, but shows an increase during warm events (BA, HCO and MWP), and can be attributed to migration of the average position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone driven by variations in solar insolation.",

            "abstract": "Global flood risk is increasing in response to population growth in flood-prone areas, human encroachment into natural flood paths (exacerbating flooding in areas formerly out of harm’s way), and climate change (which alters variables driving floods). How will societies respond to and manage flood risk in coming decades? Analysis of flood policy evolution in the EU and US demonstrates that changes occurred in steps, in direct response to disasters. After the flood produced by the collapse of Tous Dam in 1982, Spain initiated a systematic assessment of areas of greatest flood risk and civil protection response. The devastating floods on the Elbe and elsewhere in central Europe in 2002 motivated adoption of the EU Floods Directive (2007), which requires member states to develop systematic flood risk maps (now due) and flood risk management plans (due in 2015). The flooding of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 resulted in a nationwide levee-safety assessment and improvements in communicating risk, but overall less fundamental change in US flood management than manifest in the EU since 2007. In the developing world, large (and increasing) concentrations of populations in low-lying floodplains, deltas, and coasts are increasingly vulnerable, and governments mostly ill-equipped to implement fundamental changes in land use to prevent future increases in exposure, nor to develop responses to the current threats. Even in the developed world, there is surprisingly little research on how well residents of flood-prone lands understand their true risk, especially when they are ‘protected’ by ‘100-year’ levees. Looking ahead, researchers and decision makers should prioritize improvements in flood risk perception, river-basin-scale assessment of flood runoff processes (under current and future climate and land-use conditions) and flood management alternatives, and bridging the disconnect between national and international floodplain management policies and local land-use decisions.",

Instead of simply replacing C20, we present a time series of monthly gravity field solutions complete to degree and order 60 from a weighted combination of GRACE and SLR data from five geodetic satellites (LAGEOS-1 and -2, Starlette, Stella and Ajisai). In the solution, the estimate of C20 and geocenter (equivalent to the degree-one geopotential coefficients) are based on the SLR data only; the GRACE contribution to C20 is not allowed to influence the combination. The combination of GRACE and SLR data improve the separation of C20 from the effects of the higher degree zonals. There is also evidence that the estimates of the resonance coefficients are improved. Detailed analysis will be presented in this paper.",

            "abstract": "In July 2014, by the initiative of the Moscow State University and Limnological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences, the first Training-through-Research Class@Baikal was launched in Lake Baikal, Russia. The cruise program focused on seafloor sampling and acoustic investigations of gas seeps, flares, mud volcanoes, slumps and debris flows, canyons and channels in the coastal proximity.\nA comprehensive multidisciplinary program to train students has been developed to cover sedimentology, fluid geochemistry, biology, geophysics and marine geology in general. Daily lectures were conducted on board by academics presenting pertinent research projects, and cruise planning and preliminary results were discussed with all the scientific crew.\nA daily blog with updates on the expedition activities, images, and ongoing cruise results, was also completed (i.e. visit the cruise blog: http://baikal.festivalnauki.ru/) and gave the opportunity to interact with experts as well as attract the interest also of a broader audience.\nThis project is a follow up to the well-established UNESCO Training-through-Research (TTR) Floating University Programme (http://floatinguniversity.ru/) that covered large areas on the European and arctic margins since 1991 with 18 research cruises attended by about 1000 BSc, MSc and PhD students from Europe, Asia, Africa and America. The crucial goal of both programmes is the training of new generations of scientists through active research directly on the field. Students can access the collected data and samples for their Master and PhD projects. Typically an extensive set of analyses and data processing is completed in-house and the results and interpretations are presented at post cruise meetings and international conferences.\nThe Baikal lake is 25 million years old rift zone and provides a large variety of active geological features that can be easily reached at daily sailing distance. This represents an extraordinary opportunity to switch and focus on different disciplines and processes. We envisage extending the duration of the following expeditions completing several crew changes in order to broaden the international cooperation.",

We conceptualize a delta channel network as a rooted acyclic directed graph where channels are modeled by edges and junctions by vertices. We use spectral graph theory – mainly the geometry of the null space of the directed weighted graph Laplacian – to establish a quantitative framework for extracting important structural and dynamics-related information from river deltas. Using this information, we introduce refined metrics of system complexity, such as entropy. Entropy has been proven to be an important measure of the amount of uncertainty in stochastic systems, and therefore a surrogate of the capacity of the system to undergo changes. Here we present an entropic approach to evaluate the robustness of deltas, showing how the two components of entropy: mutual information and conditional entropy can be interpreted in this framework. We also present other metrics that include, among others, resistance distance and number of alternative paths, which quantify the structural complexity of the system. We use these metrics to better classify deltaic systems, quantify their resilience and propose possible management scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Large water infrastructure projects have fueled the economies of developed countries and led to the widespread degradation of freshwater ecosystems. Proposed dams promise to similarly transform the economies and environment of developing countries. Yet with rapidly changing climate, traditional water infrastructure design carries with it an increased risk of failure if climate conditions shift beyond design parameters. Environmental concerns have long been at the periphery of water management decision-making. However, the destabilizing effect of climate change on traditional engineering practices, coupled with increased societal interest in sustainable water management, now present an opportunity to better integrate ecological principles in water infrastructure planning and design. Here we operationalize sustainable water management by incorporating ecological performance metrics with traditional engineering performance criteria in a decision-analysis framework. We adapt the decision-scaling risk assessment approach to evaluate ecological consequences of water management decisions and quantify tradeoffs and synergies among economic and environmental objectives. We apply the framework to the Iowa River system, where recent changes in flood intensity have prompted managers to consider alternative flood control strategies, including new infrastructure and reservoir operation rules. The system was modeled to quantify flood damages (to Iowa City and agricultural lands) and the ecological benefits of river floodplain inundation under alternative management and climate scenarios. We found that raising levees substantially reduced economic damages under wetter and more variable climate futures, but provided limited ecological benefits relative to the status quo. In contrast, changes in reservoir operations did not reduce the risk of catastrophic flood damage, but provided significant ecological benefits associated with increased floodplain inundation. The management option that provided the greatest ecological and economic benefits over the widest range of future climates involved raising existing levees and allowing for controlled floodplain inundation.",

The United States Environmental Protection Agency requires measurement and reporting of emissions of CH4 from NG transmission facilities. The Bacharach Hi-Flow Sampler (BHFS) is commonly used for quantifying CH4 emissions at transmission and other types of NG facilities. Here we document failure of the BHFS to transition from a catalytic oxidation sensor used to measure low NG (~5% or less) concentrations to a thermal conductivity sensor for higher concentrations (from ~5% to 100%), resulting in underestimation of NG emission rates, under one or more conditions: 1), calibration is more than ~2 weeks old; 2), firmware is out of date; or 3), the NG source is less than ~91% CH4. The extent to which this issue has affected recent emission studies is uncertain, but the analysis presented here suggests that BHFS sensor transition failure occurred during three recent field sampling programs.

We relocate the aftershocks occurring within the first month after the earthquake and combine them with teleseismic P and SH waveforms and long period surface waves together to unravel its slip history. While the inversion cannot distinguish between the two nodal planes derived from its GCMT solution, it is clear that the one with steep dip angle is more consistent with our relocated aftershocks. The preferred fault plane has therefore a strike of 306o and a dip of 84o. The June 2014 (Mw7.9) Rat Island earthquake is an intra-plate oblique normal fault earthquake within the subducted Pacific slab. The inversion leads to a seismic moment of 9.9 x 1021 Nm and an average rupture speed of 2.4 km/s. The slip distribution is separated in two large patches of slip, one east and one west to the hypocenter, with the aftershocks focussing mostly on the western side. The fault orientation also coincides with the orientation suggested for the northern boundary of the Rat block. Consequently, the small right-lateral strike-slip component of the earthquake could be explained by the transmission of the surface rotation of the Rat block at depth. In the meantime, addition of data from one strong-motion station and regional data might help to improve the reliability of the inversion. The possibility of having variable double-couple solutions distributed along strike is also going to be investigated.",

            "abstract": "At the regional level, precipitation (P) change can be one of the most uncertain aspects in climate change assessments, and general circulation models (GCMs) show marked disagreement over P projections at these scales. This intermodel uncertainty owes itself to several factors, including internal model variability, differences in model physics and parameterizations, and intermodel disagreement over end-of-century changes to circulation and moisture transport at larger scales. Here, we use empirical mode techniques, including empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), rotated EOFs, and singular value decomposition, to diagnose spatial patterns of intermodel disagreement over end-of-century P changes in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive. We label these Principal Uncertainty Patterns (PUPs) as a general term for the above empirical techniques applied to a model ensemble. Globally, the intermodel uncertainty is dominated by disagreement over changes in the deep tropics. To understand more regional signals, we focus on the midlatitude Pacific wintertime storm track domain, given its relevance to concern over regional P changes in western North America. The first PUP for the storm track domain highlights disagreement over the extension of the eastward edge of storm track precipitation. The second PUP is a more complex pattern involving disagreement over zonally asymmetric changes occurring to the Hadley cell and associated meridional displacement of the storm track. We consider the sensitivity of these results to methodological details, such as use of normalized and pattern-scaled P changes, regular versus rotated EOFs, and domain size. We further consider results based on multivariate PUPs of precipitation and other fields. For example, a survey of coupled disagreement between changes to P and surface air temperature or upper- and lower-level winds sheds light on larger-scale circulation and moisture transport uncertainties feeding into regional disagreement. Finally, PUPs of intermodel disagreement over the historical climatology show little relationship to model spread in end-of-century P changes. This latter result implies that intermodel uncertainty over P climatologies is not a good predictor for disagreement over end-of-century P projections.",

The current mountain top observatory building was built by the University at Albany in 1969-70 and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) began ozone measurements at this summit location in 1973. Those measurements continue to this day and constitute a valuable long term data record for tropospheric ozone in the northeastern U.S. The elevation of the summit is 1483 m above sea level, and is roughly 90 m above the tree line in this location. With a mean cloud base height of less than 1100 m at the summit, it is a prime location for cloud research. The research station headquarters, laboratories, offices, and a second measurement site are located at the Marble Mountain Lodge, perched on a shoulder northeast of the massif at an elevation of 604 m above sea level.\nParameters measured at the site include meteorological variables, trace gases, precipitation chemistry, aerosol mass and components, and more. Precipitation and cloud chemistry has a long history at the lodge and summit locations, respectively, and continues to this day. Some data from the 40-year record will be shown in the presentation. In the late 1980’s the summit site was outfitted with instrumentation to measure oxides of nitrogen and other ozone precursors. Measurements of many of these same parameters were added at the lodge site and continue to this day.\nIn this poster we will give an overview of the Whiteface Mountain Observatory and its two measurement locations. We will highlight the parameters currently being measured at our sites, and indicate those measured by ASRC, as well as those measured by other organizations. We will also recap some of the historical activities and measurement programs that have taken place at the site, as alluded to above.

A single well can generate up to 5 million L of produced water (PW) consisting of a blend of the injected fluid and brine from a shale formation. With thousands of wells completed in the past decade, the scope of the challenge posed in the management of this wastewater becomes apparent. The USGS Toxic Substances Hydrology Program is studying both intentional and unintentional releases of PW and waste solids. One method for the disposal of PW is underground injection; we are assessing the potential risks of this method through an intensive, interdisciplinary study at an injection disposal facility in the Wolf Creek watershed in WV. Disposal of PW via injection begun in 2002, with over 5.5 mil. L of PW injected to date. The facility consists of the injection well, a tank farm, and two former holding ponds (remediated in early 2014) and is bordered by two small tributaries of Wolf Creek. Water and sediments were acquired from these streams in June 2014, including sites upstream, within, and downstream from the facility. We are analyzing aqueous and solid phase geochemistry, mineralogy, hydrocarbon content, microbial community composition, and potential toxicity. Field measurements indicated that conductivity downstream (416 µS/cm) was elevated in comparison to upstream (74 µS/cm) waters. Preliminary data indicated elevated Cl- (115 mg/L) and Br- (0.88 mg/L) concentrations downstream, compared to 0.88 mg/L Cl- and <0.03 mg/L Br- upstream of the facility. Because elevated TDS is a marker of PW, these data provide a first indication that PW from the facility is impacting nearby streams. In addition, total Fe concentrations downstream were 8.1 mg/L, far in excess of the 0.13 mg/L found upstream from the facility, suggesting the potential for microbial Fe cycling. We are conducting a broad suite of experiments to assess the potential for microbial metabolism of the organic components of PW, and to determine the effects of this metabolism on the geochemistry of the site. We anticipate that this study will prove to be a useful model for the potential impact of a PW disposal facility on adjoining surface- and shallow groundwater.",

A rigorous metadata format that allows machine parsing of this information also makes it possible for model coupling frameworks to provide automatic and reliable semantic matching of input and output variables when models are coupled.\nModel metadata hinges in part on a controlled vocabulary that consists of human- and machine-readable terms that are unambiguously defined across modeling domains. The Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) Standard Names are a set of generic naming conventions that have been used to generate a self-consistent controlled vocabulary for surface dynamics processes. As part of the NSF’s EarthCube “Earth System Bridge” project, we extend the rich controlled vocabulary of CSDMS standard names to solid Earth modeling domains, including geodynamics, seismology, magnetotellurics, and petrology. We proceed to create a standard for Model Coupling Metadata (MCM) that is flexible enough to serve both the surface dynamics modeling community, and the deep Earth process modelers, thus bridging CSDMS and the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG) communities with a common semantic network.\nHere, we focus on our progress towards establishing an MCM standard for numerical models of solid Earth and Earth surface processes, and on the tools that facilitate creation and maintenance of such metadata. In development of the MCM standard, we leverage the Common Information Model (CIM) of the climate modeling community, as well as the NSF-funded EarthCube GeoSoft project.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas whose emissions from high-latitude ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change. Warming and permafrost loss is causing a vegetation shift in northern peatlands from well-drained palsas to graminoid-dominated wetlands, resulting in increased CH4 emissions. Understanding CH4 production patterns across this vegetation transition and under varying environmental conditions is important for improving the accuracy of models used to predict future emissions. We measured CH4 fluxes, porewater profiles of carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 concentrations, along with δ13C along a permafrost thaw gradient in Stordalen Mire, Sweden spanning a vegetation transition from palsa to Sphagnum and graminoid dominated wetlands. Measurements were made in the summers of 2013 and 2014, which had lower and higher average temperatures, respectively. Across years, CH4 fluxes increased in sites dominated by the graminoid species Eriophorum angustifolium. A change in C isotopes indicates a shift from hydrogenotrophic to increasingly acetoclastic production with thaw. Comparison between years showed considerable interannual variability in both porewater and emitted CH4, likely driven by large differences in temperature and cloud coverage. Porewater CH4 concentrations increased in sites with Eriophorum vaginatum, but decreased for Eriophorum angustifolium and showed almost no variation in Sphagnum sites. Carbon dioxide concentrations were variable in E. vag sites, but increased for E. ang and Sphagnum sites. Methane fluxes showed a different pattern, higher emissions in 2014 were only observed at the wettest graminoid site, while 2014 fluxes were similar or lower in the drier Sphagnum and Eriophorum vaginatum sites. These results show the value of multi-year data sets for understanding interactions between plant communities and environmental conditions in describing CH4 dynamics and will improve our ability to predict and understand future CH4 emissions.",

In the present study, we identify magnetic separators at the dayside magnetopause in global magnetospheric resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations for various solar wind and magnetospheric conditions.

Future flow projections may be modeled through the joint use of carbon emission scenarios, general circulation models and watershed models. This research effort ran 13 simulations for carbon emission scenarios (taken from the A1, A2 and B1 families) over the 21st century (2001-2100) for the Cache Creek watershed in Northern California. Atmospheric data from general circulation models, CCSM3 and ECHAM5, were dynamically downscaled to a 9 km resolution using MM5, a regional mesoscale model, before being input into the physically based watershed environmental hydrology (WEHY) model. Ensemble mean and standard deviation of simulated flows describe the expected hydrologic system response. Frequency histograms and cumulative distribution functions characterize the range of hydrologic responses that may occur. The modeled flow results comprise a dataset suitable for time series and frequency analysis allowing for more robust system characterization, including indices such as the 100 year flood return period. These results are significant for water quality management as the Cache Creek watershed is severely impacted by mercury pollution from historic mining activities. Extreme flow events control mercury fate and transport affecting the downstream water bodies of the Sacramento River and Sacramento- San Joaquin Delta which provide drinking water to over 25 million people.",

This has led to scrutiny regarding air quality impacts of this development. Significant attention has focused on quantifying venting and fugitive emissions for greenhouse gases and VOCs. We generate emission factors using a 2011 emissions inventory data set from the Barnett Shale. Commissioned by the city of Fort Worth, the inventory contains component and equipment-based leakage rates from 388 unique sites including 1,138 wells. With component counts ranging from 188 compressors to over 600,000 connectors, our data set is more robust than previous data sets used for the development of emission factors. For the 2,126 leaks with concentrations measured by a toxic vapor analyzer to be greater than 500 ppmv or otherwise detected by infrared camera, we develop normalized activity counts and emissions profiles on a per-well and per-site basis. We classify these leaks, along with minor, default zero, and compressor engine emissions, into nine categories. From this we develop emission factors ranging from the component- to site-level scale and compare our results with existing emission factors (e.g, EPA, API, California Air Resources Board) and the current literature.",

            "abstract": "Arctic warming is proposed to increase methane emissions from submerged permafrost driving a positive feedback. Where emissions are from shallow seas, bubbles transport much of the methane directly, while frequent Arctic storms sparge much of the remaining dissolved methane before microbes can oxidize it. Complexity arises where emissions are small bubbles or from deeper water due to dissolution below the storm-mixed layer. Given that these emissions span a wide geographic area, a promising remote sensing technology that has been used to map and estimate emissions; however, significant uncertainties exist in sonar data interpretation due to a range of parameters affecting sonar return including bubble size distribution and spatial distribution, vertical velocity, and temperature all of which are closely inter-related in a complex and at best poorly understood manner, and change as the bubble plume rises.\nThis process was illustrated in a series of in situ calibration experiments in the East Siberian Arctic Sea (ESAS) where controlled air bubble plumes were created and observed with sonar to quantify the relationship between sonar return and bubble plume flux for a first calibration of in situ sonar bubble plume observations in the ESAS. Results highlight the importance of bubble plume dynamics to sonar return and the absence of a simple relationship between sonar return and bubble flux. Instead sonar return related to height above seabed, even accounting for dissolution and changing hydrostatic pressure, confirming earlier laboratory studies for a deeper water column. Calibrations then were applied to field data of an area of ESAS natural seepage.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic flowpaths couple terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and are responsive to changing climate in the arctic. However, significant uncertainty remains regarding the character and strength of links between terrestrial ecosystems and downstream aquatic ecosystems. We investigated spatial and temporal patterns in solute concentrations and stream discharge of zero-order channels, termed water tracks, draining hillslopes underlain by permafrost within the Kuparuk Basin of northern Alaska. Water tracks are ubiquitous features in this region, and may serve as a key regulator of elemental fluxes between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Flow in water tracks was highly responsive to precipitation. Snowmelt dominated the annual hydrograph and in summer, rapid drying occurred between rain events. Despite widespread drying after snowmelt, isotopes of water indicated that snow-derived water contributed to flow in water tracks and the receiving river for several weeks beyond the snowmelt period, indicating capacity for storage of water in catchments even when thaw depth is shallow. In contrast, the snowmelt-derived flush of dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus subsided with discharge, indicating limited supplies of these elements, or rapid uptake within catchments. After snowmelt, concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, the elements limiting primary production of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, respectively, remained low or undetectable in inorganic forms, except during large storms. Thus we expect that changes to the intensity or magnitude of precipitation will alter the availability and distribution of limiting nutrients within tundra catchments. Our observations of zero-order arctic channels indicate that changes in precipitation patterns and thaw dynamics may alter nutrient regimes of arctic ecosystems due to the key functions of nutrient delivery and distribution performed by water tracks. Strong nutrient limitation in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems indicates potential for change in the structure and function of ecosystems under altered nutrient regimes in the arctic.",

            "abstract": "Since the beginning of the modern satellite record starting in October 1978, the Arctic sea ice cover has been shrinking, with the largest changes observed at the end of the melt season in September. Through 2013, the September ice extent has declined at a rate of -14.0% dec-1, or -895,300 km2 dec-1. The seven lowest September extents in the satellite record have all occurred in the past seven years.\nThis reduction in ice extent is accompanied by large reductions in winter ice thicknesses that are primarily explained by changes in the ocean’s coverage of multiyear ice (MYI). Using the University of Colorado ice age product developed by J. Maslanik and C. Fowler, and currently produced by M. Tschudi we present recent changes in the distribution of ice age from the mid 1980s to present. The CU ice age product is based on (1) the use of ice motion to track areas of sea ice and thus estimate how long the ice survives within the Arctic, and (2) satellite imagery of sea ice concentration to determine when the ice disappears. Age is assigned on a yearly basis, with the age incremented by one year if the ice survives summer melt and stays within the Arctic domain. Age is counted from 1 to 10 years, with all ice older than 10 years assigned to the “10+” age category. The position of the ice is calculated on weekly time steps on NSIDC’s 12.5-km EASE-grid.\nIn the mid-1980s, MYI accounted for 70% of total winter ice extent, whereas by the end of 2012 it had dropped to less than 20%. This reflects not only a change in ice type, but also a general thinning of the ice pack, as older ice tends to be thicker ice. Thus, with older ice being replaced by thinner first-year ice, the ice pack is more susceptible to melting out than it was in 1980’s. It has been suggested that ice age may be a useful proxy for long-term changes in ice thickness. To assess the relationship between ice age and thickness, and how this may be changing over time, we compare the ice age fields to several observational data sets on ice thickness. These comparisons reveal that while a near-linear relationship between age and thickness for ice up to 3m thick existed in earlier years, this relationship is changing.",

            "abstract": "Lava flow morphology is often utilized as an indicator of rheological behavior during flow emplacement. Rheological behavior can be characterized by the viscosity and yield strength of lava, which in turn are dependent on physical and chemical properties including crystallinity, vesicularity, and bulk composition. We are studying the rheology of a basaltic lava flow from a monogenetic Holocene cinder cone in the Cima lava field (Mojave Desert, California). The flow is roughly 2.5 km long and up to 700m wide, with a well-developed central channel along much of its length. Samples were collected along seven different traverses across the flow, along with real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS profiles to allow levee heights and slopes to be measured. Surface textures change from pahoehoe ropes near the vent to predominantly jagged `a`a blocks over the majority of the flow, including all levees and the toe. Chemically the lava shows little variation, plotting on the trachybasalt-basanite boundary on the total alkali-silica diagram. Mineralogically the lava is dominated by plagioclase, clinopyroxene and olivine phenocrysts, with abundant flow-aligned plagioclase microcrystals. The total crystal fraction is ~50% near the vent, with higher percentages in the distal portion of the flow. Vesicularity varies between ~10 and more than ~60%. Levees are ~10-15m high with slopes typically ~25-35˚, suggesting a yield strength at final emplacement of ~150,000 Pa. The effective emplacement temperature and yield strength of lava samples will be determined using the parallel-plate technique. We will test the hypothesis that these physical and rheological properties of the lava during final emplacement correlate with spatial patterns in flow morphology, such as average slope and levee width, which have been determined using remote sensing observations (Beem et al. 2014).",

            "abstract": "The southern margin of discontinuous permafrost in Canada is highly sensitive to climate change. Warming to this region causes rapid thaw and disappearance of permafrost resulting in large changes to ecological and hydrological processes. Changes in hydrology result from permafrost thaw induced subsidence and conversion of tree-covered peat plateaus into bogs and channel fens. . Bogs, fens and plateaus have contrasting hydrological functions. The elevated plateaus with their shallow root zone due to frozen soils convert a relatively high proportion of hydrological input to runoff which they convey to adjacent channel fens and bogs. Bogs are largely water storage features and are typically surrounded by raised peat plateaus, while channel fens transmit water to streams and rivers. In the Scotty Creek watershed, within the southern Taiga Plains regions of Canada’s Northwest Territories, numerous researchers have documented the decline of peat plateaus as a proxy for areal loss of permafrost terrain, and concomitant increases of wetland coverage. Analysis of spatial trends in global total water storage as measured by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites suggest a increasing trend of 6+/-1 mm/year water equivalent units over this region during the period 2003-2013. Analysis of a water budget constructed for the Scotty Creek watershed suggest that this long term trend is only weakly associated to the moderate increases to precipitation while the statistically significant increasing trends observed in discharge in this watershed would likely result in opposite sign. Further, seasonal trend analysis of the GRACE total water storage observations suggest that much of the increase in total water mass over this region occurs over the warm season suggesting that larger snowpacks are not driving the mass increase. In this presentation the changes to total water storage are compared to the trends of landscape change over this region to corroborate the rates of total water mass increase with changes in area of storage features.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of the forest-atmosphere exchange of carbon isotopes can be used to partition the net total carbon exchange (measured by standard eddy covariance) into its photosynthetic and respiratory components. This partitioning requires an estimate of the isotopic signature of canopy-scale photosynthesis, which has been obtained to date by assuming that the canopy behaves like a single ‘big leaf’. This assumption neglects the heterogeneity of the canopy both vertically and with respect to leaf angles: leaves at various heights and angles experience different sunlight, temperature, and wind, and are physiologically different as well. In order to explore errors associated with the big leaf assumption, we applied a big leaf isotopic partitioning algorithm to canopy-scale net fluxes of 13CO2, 12CO2, heat, and water generated by a multi-leaf isotopic canopy simulation. The simulation included micro-environmental heterogeneity produced by the canopy geometry (leaf angles and arrangement) as well as physiological variation among leaves, invoking leaf-level energy balance to determine leaf temperatures. Leaf behavior in the simulation was parameterized by leaf-level gas-exchange measurements of the relevant characteristics of a range of leaves in the canopy (e.g. limiting photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance, daytime respiration). These measurements indicated that photosynthetic capacity increased with height in the canopy, but that within a given canopy layer, leaf behavior showed surprisingly little variability. They also indicated that stomatal conductance did not relate quasi-linearly to light or photosynthetic rate, but was instead roughly constant with light at all photosynthetic photon flux densities above 100 μE m-2 s-1. The multi-leaf simulation incorporating these leaf behaviors suggested that the big leaf assumption is valid under diffuse light conditions but can lead to significant errors under clear sky conditions.",

            "abstract": "A new investigation of paleoclimate and environmental changes using beryllium isotopes in sediment from the Mendeleev Ridge of the western Arctic Ocean was accomplished using a 39 cm-long box core record. The age of core PS72/396-3 appears to date back to MIS 5.d based on the stratigraphy of beryllium isotopes and paleomagnetic data and other isotopic data of this study, AMS 14C ages and oxygen and carbon isotopes of planktonic foraminifera N. pachyderma sin. Both authigenic 10Be and 9Be records show that there are three major cold periods during MIS 5.d and reveals a much longer warm period after the second cold period based on 9Be record. The 10Be stratigraphy also reveals a paleomagetic excursion at 45 kyr which is comparable to other records. At depths from 22 to 25 cm, the lowest 10Be signal may be due to the highest paleomagnetic intensity, which is indicated as an age of 75 kyr from other records. However, a reduction in cosmogenic 10Be could be due to ice cover, and is correlated with δ18O evidence fo a cold period. Interestingly, 9Be data show that constant input of 9Be to the Mendeleev Ridge is observed for this time period. During this time period, TOC (%) values also show a similar pattern. The record of authigenic 9Be is inversely correlated to that of Ca and proportional to opal production. These observations confirm that 9Be can also be a good proxy as a climatic tracer. This study may be a useful approach for understanding Arctic climate change.",

            "abstract": "Shale gas can contribute significantly to the world’s energy demand. Hydraulic fracturing (fracking) on horizontal drill lines developed over the last 15 years makes formerly inaccessible hydrocarbons economically available. From 2000 to 2035 shale gas is predicted to rise from 1% to 46% of the total natural gas for the US. A vast energy resource is available in the United States. While there is a strong financial advantage to the application of fracking there is emerging concern about environmental impacts to groundwater and air quality from improper shale fracking operations. Elevated methane (CH4) concentrations have been observed in drinking water throughout the United States where there is active horizontal drilling. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic-fracturing can increase CH4 transport to aquifers, soil and the vadose zone. Seepage can also result from casing failure in older wells. However, there is strong evidence that elevated CH4 concentrations can be associated with topographic and hydrogeologic features, rather than shale-gas extraction processes.\nCarbon isotope geochemistry can be applied to study CH4source(s) in shallow vadose zone and groundwater systems. A preliminary TAMU-CC isotope data set from samples taken at different locations in southern Texas shows a wide range of CH4 signatures suggesting multiple sources of methane and carbon dioxide. These data are interpreted to distinguish regions with methane contributions from deep-sourced horizontal drilling versus shallow system microbial production. Development of a thorough environmental assessment using light isotope analysis can provide understanding of shallow anthropogenic versus natural CH4sources and assist in identifying regions that require remedial actions.",

            "abstract": "Communities in the southwestern U.S. rely on forested watersheds to provide high-quality water, but these watersheds are prone to major disturbance by wildfire. The loss of vegetation and litter can decrease water storage and infiltration and decrease nutrient uptake, leading to enhanced surface runoff, erosion, and nutrient export compared to undisturbed watersheds. Post-wildfire impacts on water quality vary widely across geographic regions, and are largely driven by post-fire storm timing and intensity. In the southwestern U.S., the North American Monsoon can produce high-intensity rain from July through September. A better understanding of the post-fire water-quality response of watersheds to monsoonal storms in this region is therefore critical. The Fourmile Canyon Fire burned 2600 ha near Boulder, Colorado in September 2010, including 23% of the Fourmile Creek watershed. This watershed had been recovering from historical mining activity, and dispersed waste rock and mine tailings were only partially revegetated before the wildfire. We collected water quality, hydrological, and meteorological data with high temporal and spatial density upstream and downstream of the burned area for 4 years post-fire. For 9 months post-fire, the area received snow or low-intensity rain, and the difference in stream water chemistry between burned and unburned watersheds was minimal. However, in the summer of 2011, and in the following two summers, relatively common monsoonal storms caused dramatic, but short-lived, increases in discharge, sediment, nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and metals downstream of the burned area. Such pulses can degrade aquatic ecosystems, impair water treatability, and decrease reservoir capacity. Climate change is projected to increase wildfire frequency and size and lead to an earlier and longer wildfire season. Simultaneously, storm frequency and intensity are predicted to increase, and the monsoon season may occur later in the year, potentially decreasing the average length of time between wildfire and subsequent high-intensity rain events. This suggests that substantial water-quality impacts may be more common in the future, resulting in a new paradigm for water treatment in the southwestern U.S.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the magnitude of, and controls over, CO2 and water fluxes in arctic ecosystems is essential for accurate assessment and prediction of their responses to climate change. In 2013, we harvested vegetation and soils in the most common plant community types located in the source areas for fluxes measured by eddy covariance towers located in three representative Alaska tundra ecosystems along a toposequence (a ridge site composed of heath tundra and moist non-acidic tundra, a mid-slope site composed of moist acidic tussock tundra, and a valley bottom fen site composed of wet sedge tundra and moist acidic tundra) at Imnavait Creek, Alaska. While the purpose of this harvest was to relate biomass and production to estimates of overall net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) obtained by micrometeorological methods, it also afforded an opportunity to compare with biomass harvests done in the 1980s in moist acidic tundra at Imnavait Creek; there have been no other harvests than ours at Imnavait since then. Our data showed that plant biomass and production were greatest in the tussock tundra at the mid-slope tower, and least in the wet sedge community at the fen tower, while plant diversity was greatest in the communities at the ridge site. Aboveground biomass of vascular plants in our 2013 harvest in moist acidic tundra was nearly three times higher than that measured approximately thirty years earlier in three harvests of nearby areas at Imnavait Creek, due to an increase in the biomass of shrubs and graminoids. Comparison with other biomass harvests from the vicinity of Toolik Field Station indicate that vascular plant biomass in moist acidic tundra has increased over this time period, with the greatest increase evident by the mid-1990s, and a more gradual increase through to the present time, despite no obvious increase in air temperature as seen in data from nearby climate stations. These data will be used to improve our calculations of gross ecosystem production and ecosystem respiration, and to parameterize a terrestrial ecosystem model and simulate the response of ecosystem carbon balance to historical and future climate change in arctic tundra.",

Satellite-based imagery is an increasingly important resource for analyzing changes in vegetation and land use, as well as monitoring the evolution of hazards and environmental conditions. A key requirement for exploitation of this imagery is visualization and extraction of multimodal data over space and time.\nAnalysis of this imagery requires four primary components: 1) Assignment of acquisition time, spatial reference, and parameter descriptions, 2) Preprocessing including radiometric calibration, generation of derived parameters such as NDVI, and normalization to a common spatial grid, 3) Cataloging and access for discovering and extracting data through space, parameter, and time, and 4) Visualization techniques including animation, parameter-time, space-time, and space-frequency plots.\nUsing ENVI, we will demonstrate how Landsat, MODIS, and Suomi NPP VIIRS data products can be prepared and visualized for exploring the evolution of processes and activities. Visual animation through a temporal stack of imagery is used to quickly understand trends in urban growth, vegetation, and land use. After exploring the temporal stack of images, spatio-temporal and periodic relationships are visualized using space-time and space-frequency representations of the data.\nSatellite-based imagery is a primary source of data for understanding global changes over time.

Transport pathways of pollutants and anthropogenic emissions are investigated using satellite images, surface weather chart, and chemical transport model simulation in the context of conceptual categorization of synoptic weather pattern. We combined daily distributions of MODIS AOD and CMAQ simulated PM to represent aerosol distribution; and GOME-2 and OMI NO2 column density as a proxy for fresh anthropogenic emission flux; and Korean Meteorological Administration surface weather analysis chart to understand synoptic weather pattern using GIS geo-referencing technique. We identified a periodic extension of the Siberian high to south China and its associated migratory systems are important to understand transport patterns in this region. Based on the relative location and strength of high pressure system over south China, we classified three types of synoptic patterns that might affect high surface PM events: (1) Expansion of Siberian high as a result of cold surge, (2) Cold front passage associated with migratory northern low pressure system, and (3) Stagnant high pressure system near Yellow Sea. In all cases, the development of high pressure system in south China is essential for development of pollutant event. We demonstrate that observed and simulated surface PM show good agreement, not only with MODIS AOD but also with NO2 column density, implying the possible contributions of transported anthropogenic emissions. We also demonstrate many of these PM plumes are originated from northeastern China, pushed southward by cold front passage, generating unique narrow-band-shape PM plumes. All 3 types of transport patterns are shown to be important, in terms of intensity, frequency, and vertical lifting. These transport pathways are crucial to understand not only local pollutant events but also mechanisms to lift and to transport East Asian anthropogenic emissions into Pacific.",

            "abstract": "For water limited areas such as southeastern Burkina Faso where the main activity is rainfed agriculture, it is crucial to understand the rainfall mechanism and its main drivers. The triggering convective mechanisms are important and contribute to more than 30% of the total rainfall. Several studies were devoted to the convective rainfall characterization. However, the rainfall partitioning between convective and non-convective events and the effects of land cover signature on the rainfall type at small scales remain relatively unexplored topics.\nThe following study aims to investigate the triggering mechanisms of rainfall and their interaction with land cover. For this purpose a simple realistic model combining the mixed layer growth (ML) and lifting condensation level (LCL) was implemented for convective rainfall tracking. Convective events occur when the LCL and ML curves intersect at the time corresponding to the rain event start. Sensible heat flux, air temperature and humidity measurements used for this analysis were collected over three years with twelve advanced weather monitoring Sensorscope stations and two eddy flux towers distributed over two different landscapes, an agricultural field and an savanna forest\nThe land cover signature evidence is highlighted by the similarity of the pdf of the rainfall over the forested region and agricultural fields with a slope -1.5. While a 10 to 30% difference in total yearly precipitation is observed between the agriculture zone and the forest region. Therefore, in addition to the soil moisture, higher temperature (Clausius-Clapeyron) and CO2 effect on rainfall mechanisms, the local land cover signature should be added for better rainfall modeling.",

            "abstract": "The Grandfather Mountain Window in western North Carolina exposes the lowest structural level in the Blue Ridge Province. Rocks in the window constitute a Late Proterozoic basement-cover sequence. The basement consists mainly of Blowing Rock Gneiss (sic, porphyroblastic schist) and Wilson Creek Gneiss, both overlain unconformably by the Grandfather Mountain Formation. All of these rocks have been pervasively overprinted by greenschist facies metamorphism. The typical greenschist mineral assemblage involves combinations of chlorite, muscovite, biotite, actinolite, epidote, calcite, quartz, albite and K-feldspar. Garnet discovered in basement rock calls into question the metamorphic grade. The average garnet (core-rim) is\n(Fe1.63-1.71Mn0.64-0.77Ca0.52-0.37Mg0.10-0.12)Al1.98-1.96Si3.06-3.04O12; the average biotite is (K0.96Na0.06Ca0.02)(Fe1.73Mg0.87Mn0.02Ti0.04Al0.23)(Si2.83Al1.17)O10(OH)2; the average muscovite is (K1.03Na0.02Ca0.02)(Al1.57Fe0.26Mg0.16Ti0.01)(Si3.31Al0.69)O10(OH)2. Thermometry involving Fe-Mn-Mg components in these minerals gives 766°C (+/- 91°C) at 13.6 kbars (+/- 1.4 kbar), respectively. There are at least four explanations for garnet in these rocks: (1) Garnet may have been stabilized in the greenschist facies by non-AFM components (esp. Mn), but the compositions are not unusual for metamorphic garnet, biotite and muscovite, and the calculated temperatures are too high for greenschist facies. (2) The garnet may be relict from earlier contact metamorphism, but the garnet is not spatially related to otherwise common metamorphosed (greenschist facies) mafic dikes. (3) The garnet is a product of heating during mylonitization. Finally, and most likely, (4) the garnet may be relict from an earlier episode of regional metamorphism. Samples of porphyroblastic schist and greenstone from the same outcrop give low temperature, greenschist facies conditions.",

            "abstract": "Recently new data collection platforms, many of them autonomous mobile platforms, have added immensely to the data volume the Ocean Acidification community is dealing with. This is no exception with NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) Ocean Acidification (OA) effort. Collaboration between the PMEL Carbon group and the PMEL Science Data Integration group to manage local data has spawned the development of a data management strategy that covers the data lifecycle from collection to analysis to quality control to archival. The proposed software and workflow will leverage the successful data management framework pioneered by the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) project, but customized for Ocean Acidification requirements.\nThis presentation will give a brief overview of the data management framework that will be implemented for Ocean Acidification data that are collected by PMEL scientists. We will also be discussing our plans to leverage this system to build an east coast ocean acidification management system at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), as well as a national OA management system at NOAA’s National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC).",

            "abstract": "Spaceborne lidar has been identified as a key technology by the international ecosystem science community because it enables accurate estimates of canopy structure and biomass and forms the basis for fusion approaches that extend the capabilities of existing and planned radar missions, such as the NASA-ISRO SAR and the ESA BIOMASS mission. The Global Ecosystems Dynamics Investigation Lidar (GEDI Lidar) was recently selected by NASA's Earth Ventures Instrument (EVI) program. From its vantage point on the International Space Station, GEDI Lidar provides high-resolution observations of forest vertical structure and addresses three, core science questions: What is the aboveground carbon balance of the land surface? What role will the land surface play in mitigating atmospheric CO2 in the coming decades? How does ecosystem structure affect habitat quality and biodiversity? GEDI informs these science questions by making billions of lidar waveform observations of canopy structure over its nominal one year mission length. The instrument uses three laser transmitters to produce 14 parallel tracks of 25 m footprints. These canopy measurements are then used to measure biomass and in fusion with radar and other remote sensing data to quantify changes in biomass resulting from disturbance and recovery. GEDI further marries ecosystem structure from lidar with ecosystem modeling to predict the sequestration potential of existing forests and to evaluate the impact of policy-driven afforestation and reforestation actions on sequestering additional carbon. Lastly, GEDI’s observations of ecosystem structure provide a mapping of critical habitat metrics at the fine scales required for understanding the patterns, processes, and controls on biodiversity and habitat quality. The selection of GEDI Lidar, when combined with the rapid advancement of new radar missions and the availability of long-term land cover archives from passive optical sensors, ushers in an exciting new era of land surface imaging with far ranging consequences for ecosystem science.",

            "abstract": "Routine field collection of fossils and other geologic specimens and maintenance of the resulting collections do not typically receive frequent infusions of large amounts of grant money, in spite of the relatively low costs of these activities and the baseline of data they provide. This type of work is often carried out by chronically-underfunded museums that that must use innovative methods of fundraising to carry out their missions.\nThe Virginia Museum of Natural History (VMNH) is an independent state agency that is not affiliated with a university or any other institution. The VMNH paleontology department carries out frequent excavations of vertebrate fossils at three different localities in Virginia and Wyoming, maintains a collection of several hundred thousand specimens, and conducts original research and participates in professional meetings. Yet the annual operations (non-salary) appropriation for the paleontology department is only $500/year. Since 2007, state appropriations have accounted for only 3% of the department’s non-salary funding, while grants (excluding salary-specific funding) have accounted for 27% and cash donations provided 1%. The remaining 69% has come from a diverse suite of alternate fundraising methods. Ecotourism and educational programming fees (37%) include fees paid by students and members of the public to participate in VMNH excavations, as well as fee-based field trips and programs involving fossils or casts. Merchandise sales (15%) are based on casts of specimens held in either the VMNH collections or at smaller museums that have contracted with VMNH to provide paleontology services. Contract work (13%) has included paleo-themed exhibit design, specimen evaluation, and repair of fossil specimens for smaller museums and visitor centers that lack a paleontology staff. A crowdfunding campaign designed to support a specific fossil excavation was responsible for 4% of the department’s funds. This diverse range of funding sources has both provided the department with sufficient funds to carry out its operations and insulated it from the effects of reduction of any one funding source. Moreover, as most of these methods involve considerable interaction with the public they serve as additional means of outreach.",

Population growth, land use changes, and environmental changes are intensifying stresses on water resources throughout the world. Increasing and competing demands for water require decision-making about water management and allocation to support multiple and competing uses. Further, climatic variability and periods of floods and drought are threats to humans, ecosystems, and economies. Inequalities in the distribution of water resources and access to safe and affordable water abound, greatly affecting communities. Here, we provide examples aiming to bridge the gap between social justice and environmental science literacy through college-level course work in watershed hydrology and management and in water law and policy. Examples are drawn considering water use, water pollution, and water governance. For example, we explore relationships between water governance (e.g., via land ownership and policy), land use (e.g., food production), water use (e.g., irrigation of agricultural lands), water pollution (e.g., pollution of surface and ground waters with agricultural nutrient runoff), and societal well-being (e.g., effects on communities). Course outcomes include increased social awareness, increased knowledge of water resources, and increased scientific literacy.",

We combine more than 100 survey-mode GPS velocities (Crowell et al., 2013) with Envisat InSAR observations from descending tracks 84 and 356 and ascending tracks 77 and 306 (149 total acquisitions), processed using the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) package (Hooper et al., 2007). The result is a dense map of surface velocities across the Imperial fault and surrounding areas. The data suggest that a previously little-known extension of the Superstition Hills fault through the town of El Centro may accommodate a significant portion of the slip previously attributed to the Imperial Fault. We investigate a suite of possible models for the transfer of this slip to the Imperial and Cerro Prieto faults to the south, yielding a range of plausible hazard scenarios. Finally, we compare the geodetic data to models of earthquake cycles with rate- and state-dependent friction to assess the implications for creep depth, moment accumulation rate, and recurrence interval of large events on these faults.",

            "abstract": "The economy of India is expected to face serious environmental challenges over the coming decades. Population growth, coupled with economic growth of nearly 7%/year to 2030 will translate into strong growth in energy demands – particularly electricity. The electricity sector’s claim on total available water could grow from 4% to more than 10% in India in 2030, if the use of wet cooling technologies persists (IGES 2013). Water-saving, dry cooling technologies are available for coal-fired power plants, but this requires significant investment and must be done at the time of construction. Growing water demands from electricity generation, when coupled with industrial, residential and commercial demands, are projected to result in water shortages for irrigation in some key river basins such as Indus, Ganges, Subernarekha, Krishna, and Chotanagpui (Rosegrant et al., 2013). The resulting pressure on agricultural production is likely to be exacerbated by climate change, which itself may increase demands for irrigation as an adaptation strategy to higher temperatures and more variable rainfall (AgMIP, 2013).\nIn this paper we examine the impact of water scarcity on economic growth, food, and energy security in India using an enhanced version of the GTAP-AEZ-WATER model. We find that investments in water-saving technology in the electricity sector are less costly than developing new water supply. However, even when these technologies are implemented, we project shortfalls in water available for irrigated agriculture. These shortfalls result in the contraction of irrigated area and diminished food production relative to the unconstrained baseline. However, trade could help India to mitigate a portion of this pressure by importing more food products from water abundant regions. In addition, allowing for the trading of water within river basins helps to alleviate some of the consequences of water scarcity.",

            "abstract": "Lightning processes radiated extremely wideband electromagnetic signals. Lightning images mapped by VHF interferometry and VHF time of arrival lightning mapping arrays enable us to understand the lightning in-cloud detail development during the extent of flash that can not always be captured by cameras because of the shield of cloud. Lightning processes radiate electromagnetically over an extremely wide bandwidth, offering the possibility of multispectral lightning radio imaging. Low frequency signals are often used for lightning detection, but usually only for ground point location or thunderstorm tracking. Some recent results have demonstrated lightning LF 3D mapping of discrete lightning pulses, but imaging of continuous LF emissions have not been shown. In this work, we report a GPS-synchronized LF near field interferometric-TOA 3D lightning mapping array applied to image the development of lightning flashes on second time scale. Cross-correlation, as used in broadband interferometry, is applied in our system to find windowed arrival time differences with sub-microsecond time resolution. However, because the sources are in the near field of the array, time of arrival processing is used to find the source locations with a typical precision of 100 meters. We show that this system images the complete lightning flash structure with thousands of LF sources for extensive flashes. Importantly, this system is able to map both continuous emissions like dart leaders, and bursty or discrete emissions. Lightning stepped leader and dart leader propagation speeds are estimated to 0.56–2.5x105 m/s and 0.8–2.0x106 m/s respectively, which are consistent with previous reports. In many aspects our LF images are remarkably similar to VHF lightning mapping array images, despite the 1000 times difference in frequency, which may suggest some special links between the LF and VHF emission during lightning processes.",

            "abstract": "It is well established that the ocean carbon cycle is changing. However, to date is has proven difficult to deconvolve changes associated with secular trends and natural variability. Ensemble simulations with Earth System Models provide a powerful tool for evaluating the secular trend (ensemble mean) and the intrinsic natural variability (ensemble spread). Here we consider the large initial-condition ensemble experiments of two Earth System Models, GFDL-ESM2M (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model, 30 member) and CESM1-BGC (Community Earth System Model with Biogeochemistry, 24 member), run with historical and RCP8.5 boundary conditions. Our goal is to not only characterize the anthropogenic trend for the ensemble mean for each model, but also to characterize the changes in variance between the two models over the 21st century. Our analysis reveals that the GFDL and CESM have divergent trends in 21st century ocean carbon uptake variability, with the GFDL-ESM2M and CESM-BGC1 having decreased and increased variance, respectively. Preliminary work towards attribution indicates that these differences are driven by a tendency towards decreased ENSO variance for the case of GFDL-ESM2M and increased ENSO variance for the case of CESM1-BGC.\nAdditionally, we have used the ocean carbon cycle variance from the two models to estimate the degree to which internal variability may account for multi-model ensemble spread between the CMIP5 suite of Earth System Models. Preliminary results indicate that as much as 25% of the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble spread in carbon uptake may reflect internal variability in the climate system.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric deposition of mercury (Hg) is a critical environmental stress that affects ecosystems and human health. Mercury emissions to the atmosphere from coal-fired power plants and other sources such as waste incineration can be deposited over large geographic areas to downwind landscapes in precipitation and in dry fallout. The northern Appalachian Mountains are downwind of major atmospheric mercury emissions sources. Some mercury reaches watersheds and streams, where it can accumulate in sediments and biota. Human exposure to mercury occurs primarily through fish consumption, and currently mercury fish eating advisories are in place for many of the streams and lakes in the region. Here, we explored mercury accumulation in forested landscapes - in air, soils, water, and biota. To quantify atmospheric mercury deposition, we measured both wet and dry mercury deposition at 10 forested locations, from which we present variation in mercury deposition and initial assessments of factors affecting the patterns. To quantify mercury accumulation in terrestrial environments, we measured soil mercury concentrations within and surrounding 12 vernal pools spanning various physiographic settings in the region. Given that vernal pools have large inputs of water via precipitation yet do not have any stream discharge outflow, they are likely spots within the forested landscape to accumulate pollutants that enter via wet atmospheric deposition. To quantify mercury accumulation in aquatic environments, we sampled mercury concentrations in streams draining 35 forested watersheds, spanning gradients of atmospheric deposition, climate and geology. Mercury concentrations were measured in stream water under base-flow conditions, in streambed sediments, aquatic mosses, and in fish tissues from brook trout. Results indicate that wet and dry atmospheric deposition is a primary source of mercury that is accumulating in watersheds of the Northern Appalachian Mountains.",

            "abstract": "The Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment in 2012 (SMAPVEX12) was conducted over an agricultural domain in southern Manitoba, Canada. The purpose of the campaign was to develop ground and airborne datasets for pre-launch validation of SMAP satellite soil moisture retrieval algorithms. Three key soil moisture datasets were collected in support of the campaign objectives: 1) intensive field sampling over (up to) 55 agricultural fields on 17 sampling days; 2) a continuously operated temporary in-situ network (> 30 stations) distributed over the domain; and 3) L-band microwave data from NASA’s Passive Active L-band Sensor (PALS) onboard a Twin-Otter aircraft. This presentation addresses whether dense temporary in-situ networks can supplant intensive field-sampling during pre-/post-launch validation campaigns. SMAPVEX12 datasets are examined at the field and aircraft pixel (~800 m) scale, and at the domain scale. Preliminary results demonstrate that, at the field-scale, there is generally limited agreement between a single station and sampled data over its field. Over the duration of the campaign, the majority of temporary soil moisture stations have > 0.04 m3m-3 RMSE with sampled field data, suggesting that a single station has limited representativeness of an agricultural field. Furthermore, the in-situ stations and field-sampled data are compared with PALS generated soil moisture to assess differences in daily RMSE. For wet-periods, both ground datasets provide a comparable RMSE for the PALS estimate. Although for dry-periods, the difference in RMSE between the ground datasets becomes more significant (> 0.04 m3m-3). This is because the field-sampled data exhibit a sharper dry-down than the in-situ station measurements. However, at the domain scale there is strong agreement between the soil moisture datasets. Additional results describe the sources of variability affecting these soil moisture datasets and the statistical number of stations needed to represent the SMAPVEX12 domain. This research is of importance for the efficient allocation of ground resources during remote sensing validation campaigns for soil moisture.",

            "abstract": "Turbulent fluxes of variables such as entropy and specific humidity in boundary layers and convection cannot be resolved explicitly in large-scale climate models but must be represented through parameterizations. Most current parameterizations use schemes that truncate the hierarchy of moment equations at first order and use second-order equations to estimate closure parameters, e.g., in local diffusive or non-local mass flux closures. However, truncations of moment equations at second order may lead to more accurate parameterizations. At the same time, they offer an opportunity to take spatially correlated structures (e.g., plumes) into account, which are known to be important for convective dynamics.\nHere we demonstrate the viability of a spatially nonlocal second-order closure (CE2), obtained by truncating the hierarchy of cumulant equations at second order and neglecting cumulants of 3rd order and higher. To explore the applicability of the CE2 closure, we study characteristics of different turbulence regimes through LES, comparing fully nonlinear LES with quasi-linear LES in which turbulent interactions among turbulent eddies are suppressed but nonlinear eddy—mean flow interactions are retained, as they are in the CE2 closure. In physical terms, suppressing eddy—eddy interactions amounts to suppressing, e.g., interactions among plumes, while retaining interactions between plumes and the environment (e.g., entrainment and detrainment). That is, the CE2 closure explicitly resolves entrainment and detrainment, obviating the need to parameterize them.\nA computational disadvantage is that solving the resulting equations for the second-order cumulants numerically in general is costly. We will be discussing ways in which additional assumptions (e.g., about horizontal correlation structures among turbulent fields) may lead to closures that are computationally efficient, yet more accurate than existing closures.",

            "abstract": "Concentrations of manganese (Mn) downstream of a hydropower dam are strongly influenced by seasonal reservoir dynamics. During warm months reservoirs experience stratification that results in the depletion of dissolved oxygen at depth and the concurrent release of dissolved Mn from the sediment into the water column. After being released from the dam these Mn rich waters are mixed with oxygenated river water and the Mn may become oxidized and removed from the water column over time. Previous studies have largely focused on patterns of Mn distribution within the first 20 km or less downstream of a dam. However, water quality issues at our field site extend much further downstream. The primary goal of our work was to investigate how seasonal dynamics in the reservoir couple with heterogeneity at the watershed scale to drive temporal and spatial patterns across large distances. Mn concentrations were monitored downstream of a hydropower dam in southwest Virginia over a two year period that covered the Roanoke River between Leesville Dam and a water treatment plant 150 km downstream. Data that we have collected over the past two years show that Mn concentrations are highest near the dam during reservoir stratification in late summer and fall and decrease with distance downstream. A mass balance of the first 19 km downstream from the dam suggests loss of Mn via sedimentation and filtering of particulates. Mn concentrations appear to reach a consistent minimum at 50 km downstream. However, after the 50 km inflection, Mn concentrations increase with distance downstream. Along the downstream reach (>50 km), Mn concentrations in the river also exhibit a better correlation with stream discharge and the suspended particle load. Tributaries to this reach are also characterized by higher concentrations of Mn than observed in the first 50 km which appear to be driving these increases in concentration. These results provide new insights into the temporospatial patterns of Mn concentrations across these greater distances. Coupling seasonal reservoir dynamics with hydrologic conditions and tributary inputs provides a multi-faceted approach that is more effective for predicting the distribution of Mn in reservoir sourced rivers.",

            "abstract": "Seismic Tomography was incorporated in Reservoir Geophysics with the intention of providing high-resolution images of regions in the Earth’s subsurface that are characterized as potential reservoirs. In this work, seismic traveltime tomography in the transmission mode was applied to real data from the Dom Joao Field, Reconcavo Basin, State of Bahia, Brazil. This basin represents a landmark of oil exploration in Brazil and has been intensively studied since the 1950s. Today, the Reconcavo Basin is still the principal oil producer in the State of Bahia, but there is a demand for new technologies, especially for mature fields, to improve hydrocarbon recovery. Acoustic ray tracing for the computation of traveltimes was used for forward modeling, and the conjugate gradient algorithm with regularization through derivative matrices was used as an inverse procedure. The tomographic inversion is an ill-posed problem because the existence, uniqueness and stability conditions are not completely satisfied. Mathematical techniques are commonly used with the intention of providing better conditioning for the numerical solution of such problems. The input data in the system are the traveltimes between the sources and the receivers and the distances propagated by each ray connecting such sources and receivers. Both inputs are provided through acoustic forward modeling. The linear system is regularized by derivative matrices derived to minimize the instability. This regularization procedure has a crucially important parameter called regularization parameter lambda. For the selection of lambda we used the L-module, which is based on the well-known L-curve. The estimated tomograms were consistent with previous geological knowledge of the area and the P-wave velocity range was consistent. The results showed that traveltime tomography is feasible for the characterization of reservoirs with a high rate of vertical change, similar to the Dom Joao Field.",

            "abstract": "Understanding natural variability in the climate system is vital for the detection and attribution of anthropogenically induced change in General Circulation Models (GCMs). GCM predictions of winter surface air temperature (SAT) variability generally are skillful at midlatitudes due to a strong coupling with tropical variability through atmospheric teleconnections. When atmospheric circulation weakens during the summer, however, GCM predictions of SAT variability are less skillful than during the winter, particularly over North America.\nThis study examines the extent that terrestrial water anomalies in the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) equivalent water thickness product influence patterns of summer SAT variability over North America from 2002 to 2014. Analysis of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) CM2.1 10-member ensemble indicates there is a significant land surface feedback on summer SAT. The GRACE product provides a metric for evaluating spurious soil moisture signals, which likely enhance summer SAT variability in the AMIP ensemble. To further investigate spatial patterns in soil moisture, simulated (AMIP) and reanalysis (Climate Prediction Center) rainfall patterns are used to demonstrate a potential cause-effect relationship between precipitation and terrestrial water anomalies. Finally, we evaluate whether soil moisture is a useful diagnostic for enhancing predictions of anomalous summer heat waves over North America.",

            "abstract": "In the aerosol transport process, the optical properties of aerosol particles can vary due to humidification or mixing with other kinds of aerosols. Previous studies have shown mixing dust with other types of aerosol tends to make the aerosol more spectrally absorptive, but the degree of impact of relative humidity (RH) along the transport path is not clear. To investigate this effect, we conduct a numerical study to estimate the radiative sensitivity of aerosols under various relative humidity conditions. Specifically, the OPAC (Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds) database is used, which provides the optical properties (i.e., the extinction, scattering and absorption coefficient, single-scattering albedo, asymmetry factor and phase function) of ten types of aerosols under various relative humidity conditions. Lookup tables (LUTs) of the bidirectional reflectivity, transmissivity and effective emissivity will be computed for the ten aerosol types for input to the high-spectral-resolution radiative transfer model (HRTM). Using these LUTs, the HTRM can calculate top-of-atmospheric brightness temperatures, which we can use to determine the degree of radiative sensitivity in the infrared spectral region. Furthermore, comparisons between simulations and MODIS observations will be presented.",

Estimates of the topside F-region ion density rely on accurately predicting the peak density and height of the F-layer and describing how the density decays with altitude. The latest incarnation of the IRI model (IRI-2012) includes two options to estimate the F-peak and three options to shape the topside profile. Previously it was shown that IRI overestimated the topside ionospheric densities during solar minimum between cycles 23 and 24, and the relative performance of the three topside shaper functions were compared. Here we reconstruct maps of the ionosphere near the magnetic equator using information about the F-peak from the Formosa Satellite-3/ Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC) and ion densities above 400 km from the Coupled Ion-Neutral Dynamics Investigation (CINDI) instrument on the Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite. By simultaneously comparing the both the peak ionospheric density and the topside ion densities, we can better evaluate the combinations of the component models in IRI-2012.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations from the Voyager 1 spacecraft show that it is sampling the local interstellar medium (LISM). This is quite surprising because standard steady-state and time-dependent models of the solar wind (SW) interaction with the LISM cannot give the heliopause position at about 120 AU without unrealistic assumptions about the LISM properties. This includes such models that assume a strong redistribution of the ion energy to the tails in the pickup ion distribution function. We investigate the heliopause (HP) stability with increased spatial resolution to reveal the details of the coupling between the heliospheric and interstellar magnetic fields (HMF and ISMF) at the heliospheric interface. In particular, this resolution makes it possible to perform a detailed comparison with Voyager observations. We also analyze magnetic field simulation results to identify the areas of possible magnetic reconnection between the HMF and ISMF lines. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability is considerably suppressed near the HP nose by the heliospheric magnetic field in steady-state models, but reveals itself in the presence of solar cycle effects. We argue that Voyager 1 may have penetrated into the LISM through such instability region. We also compare numerical simulations with the LISM properties taken from either Ulysses or IBEX observations.",

            "abstract": "The tropopause over the western tropical Pacific is thought to be one of the primary entry points of air from the troposphere into the stratosphere. In this region, temperatures are low enough in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL; ~14-18.5 km) to dehydrate air to the low values observed in the stratosphere. The NASA Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX) mission was designed to study the transport of water vapor and other trace gases in the TTL over the Pacific Ocean, in order to better understand how dehydration occurs and how ozone-depleting gases reach the lower stratosphere. The field campaign phase of the mission recently concluded with flights of the NASA Global Hawk unmanned aircraft over the western tropical Pacific from Guam in January-March 2014 (ATTREX-3). This followed two previous deployments with flights from California to the central and eastern tropical Pacific (ATTREX-1 and 2). Particularly in ATTREX-3, the long duration of the Global Hawk allowed observations over nearly a complete diurnal cycle in the TTL.\nOver 100 vertical profiles in the TTL were obtained over the western tropical Pacific, as well as long sections at constant altitude. As expected, very low values of water vapor (a few ppm) were observed, and ice saturation was frequently encountered. Ozone was consistently low in the TTL (averaging ~20 ppb), with low values extending up to the tropopause, particularly in March 2014. While ozone as low as 20 ppb was occasionally observed over the central and eastern Pacific in February-March 2013 during ATTREX-2, it more often averaged 40-50 ppb, and typically increased slowly with height from about 14 km to the tropopause. In ATTREX-3, long-lived tracers such as N2O were very close to their tropospheric values over the western tropical Pacific. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) data indicated that sampled air masses originated in the tropics, with little in-mixing of extratropical air. Methane and CO often peaked near the local tropopause. These initial results suggest frequent deep convection, bringing air from the local marine boundary layer (with low ozone and high values of long-lived trace species) directly to the upper troposphere. The origins and transport of air in the TTL during ATTREX-3 will be discussed, as well as the reasons for and implications of the very low ozone observed.",

            "abstract": "Radiative Convective Equilibrium (RCE) has proven to be a useful paradigm for studies of convection and the characteristics of idealized model configurations. Historically there has been little direct overlap between studies made with General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Cloud Resolving Models (CRMs). GCMs use global domains with resolutions ranging from 300 km to 20 km, while CRMs normally use domains roughly equivalent to a single GCM grid cell and resolutions ranging from 5km to 0.1km. Here we study the atmosphere of a GCM with boundary conditions that approximate RCE across a range of domain sizes (from 40 % of the surface of the Earth to 500x500 km^2) and resolutions of 20 km and 10 km. To that aim we use the newly developed nonhydrostatic, primitive equation model named ICON with two distinct physics parameterizations. Comparison of the simulations leads to a better understanding of the mechanisms and assumptions underlying the parameterizations of GCMs.\nClimate sensitivity and convective organization are the two physical processes we focus on with this study. Convective organization strongly influences the mean state of the atmosphere and the various feedback responses to a given perturbation. We compare changes in the top of the atmosphere radiative imbalance which result from prescribed changes in the surface temperature. This provides a direct calculation of feedback processes. The magnitude of the influence these feedbacks have on our system is diagnosed with the climate sensitivity. Initial results indicate that ICON provides a convenient modeling framework that will allow for a unified approach to the study of the inevitable future overlap between CRMs and experiments with parameterized physics at relatively high resolution. Preliminary results indicate sensitive dependence of the atmospheric state on details of the model configuration.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS), which provide open access to an enormous archive of historical and near real time imagery from NASA supported satellite instruments, has also released most of its software to the general public as open source. The software packages, originally developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Goddard Space Flight Center, currently include: 1) the Meta Raster Format (MRF) GDAL driver—GDAL support for a specialized file format used by GIBS to store imagery within a georeferenced tile pyramid for exceptionally fast access; 2) OnEarth—a high performance Apache module used to serve tiles from MRF files via common web service protocols; 3) Worldview—a web mapping client to interactively browse global, full-resolution satellite imagery and download underlying data. Examples that show developers how to use GIBS with various mapping libraries and programs are also available. This stack of tools is intended to provide an out-of-the-box solution for serving any georeferenced imagery.\nScientists as well as the general public can use the open source software for their own applications such as developing visualization interfaces for improved scientific understanding and decision support, hosting a repository of browse images to help find and discover satellite data, or accessing large datasets of geo-located imagery in an efficient manner. Open source users may also contribute back to NASA and the wider Earth Science community by taking an active role in evaluating and developing the software.\nThis presentation will discuss the experiences of developing the software in an open source environment and useful lessons learned.

            "abstract": "This research investigates surface strains related to seismic events and their relationship with pre- and post-seismic events in South American, Antarctica, Nazca, Cocos, North American and Caribbean plates , by analyzing the variation of estimated earth coordinates, for the period 2000-2014, supplied by a geodetic network called SIRGAS-CON. Based on data provided by the USGS for the same period, and after the Global Congruency test, we selected the events associated with unstable geodetic network points. The resulting strains were estimated based on the finite element method. It was possible to determine the strains along with the resulting guidelines for pre- and post-seismic, considering each region formed for analysis as a homogeneous solid body. Later, a multi-year solution of the network was estimated and used to estimate the strain rates of the earth surface from the changing directions of the velocity vectors of 332 geodetic points located in the South American plate and surround plates. The strain rate was determined and, using Euler vector computed, it was possible to estimate the convergence and accommodation rates to each plate. The results showed that contraction regions coincide with locations with most of the high magnitude seismic events. It suggest that major movements detected on the surface occur in regions with more heterogeneous geological structures and multiple rupture events; significant amounts of elastic strain can be accumulated on geological structures away from the plate boundary faults; and, behavior of contractions and extensions is similar to what has been found in seismological studies. Despite the association between seismic events and the strain of geodetic network, some events of high magnitude were excluded because it does not show the surface strain, which is located at great depths. It was confirmed that events of greater magnitude provide increased surface strain rate when compared with other similar depths.",

We hypothesize that a critical source of energy in the Arctic Ocean, heat content accumulating below the surface mixed layer and above the halocline, has been increasing in magnitude and area and may be contributing to the recent decline in the ice cover.\nTo address this hypothesis we analyze model output from a subset of the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM), where the atmospheric and land components are replaced with prescribed realistic atmospheric reanalysis data. First, mixed layer and halocline depths are estimated from RASM and compared with available observational estimates. Next, monthly heat content is calculated for the upper Arctic Ocean layer (UAOL), defined by these two hydrographic boundaries, for the period of 1948-2009. Consistent with observations from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution’s network of Ice-Tethered Profilers (ITP), model results indicate that heat has been stored in UAOL and that it has increased recently. Analyses of ITP data and RASM show that the total amount and rate of increase of heat content has been largest in the western Arctic and there might be a causal relationship between the accumulation of heat content and the reduction of sea ice volume.",

The multi-scale modeling framework substitutes conventional cloud parameterizations with a 2-D cloud-resolving model.\nBy considering soil moisture heterogeneity, the land-surface model is able to utilize the distribution of precipitation simulated by the cloud-resolving model in the super-parameterization, rather than it's summed total.\nAdditionally, treatments of gravitational drainage and runoff in the binned model are proposed and assessed. This is, in general, a conceptual addition to the binned approach of Sellers et al.; but it is also particularly motivated by the fine grid resolution of the cloud-resolving model used in super-parameterization, typically 2km.\nPreliminary results suggest that the binned-approach improves model representation of dry-down following rain events and may help mitigate some of the excessive latent heat fluxes simulated by the standard land model in the CESM.",

            "abstract": "Described here is a technique for H isotope analysis of organic compounds pyrolyzed from kerogens isolated from gas- and liquid-rich shales. Application of this technique will progress the understanding of the use of H isotopes not only in potential kerogen occurrences on Mars, but also in terrestrial oil and gas resource plays. H isotope extraction and analyses were carried out utilizing a CDS 5000 Pyroprobe connected to a Thermo Trace GC interfaced with a Thermo MAT 253 IRMS. Also, a split of GC-separated products was sent to a DSQ II quadrupole MS to make qualitative and semi-quantitative compositional measurements of these products.\nKerogen samples from five different basins (type II, II-S) were dehydrated (heated to 80°C overnight under vacuum) and analyzed for their H isotope compositions by Pyrolysis-GC-MS-TC-IRMS. This technique takes pyrolysis products separated via GC and reacts them in a high temperature conversion furnace, quantitatively forming H2. Samples ranging from ~0.5 to 1.0mg in size, were pyrolyzed at 800°C for 30s. and separated on a Poraplot Q GC column.\nH isotope data from all kerogen samples typically show enrichment in D from low to high molecular weight. H2O average δD = -215.2‰ (V-SMOW), ranging from -271.8‰ for the Marcellus Shale to -51.9‰ for a Polish shale. Higher molecular weight compounds like toluene (C7H8) have an average δD of -89.7‰, ranging from -156.0‰ for the Barnett Shale to -50.0‰ for the Monterey Shale. We interpret these data as representative of potential H isotope exchange between hydrocarbons and sediment pore water during basin formation. Since hydrocarbon H isotopes readily exchange with water, these data may provide some useful information on gas-water or oil-water interaction in resource plays, and further as a possible indicator of paleo-environmental conditions. Alternatively, our data may be an indication of H isotope exchange with water and/or acid during the kerogen isolation process. Either of these interpretations will prove useful when deciphering H isotope data derived from kerogen analyses. Understanding the role that these H-bearing compounds play in terrestrial shale paleo-environmental reconstruction may also prove useful as analogs for understanding the interactions of water and potential kerogen/organic compounds on the planet Mars.",

The MagIC database (http://earthref.org/MAGIC) was designed to accommodate the vast majority of data used in such investigations. Yet getting data from the laboratory into the database, and visualizing and re-analyzing data downloaded from the database, makes special demands on data formatting.\nThere are several recently published programming packages that deal with single types of data: demagnetization experiments (e.g., Lurcock et al., 2012), paleointensity experiments (e.g., Leonhardt et al., 2004), and FORC diagrams (e.g., Harrison et al., 2008). However, there is a need for a unified set of open source, cross-platform software that deals with the great variety of data types in a consistent way and facilitates importing data into the MagIC format, analyzing them and uploading them into the MagIC database. The PmagPy software package (http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/) comprises a such a comprehensive set of tools. It facilitates conversion of many laboratory formats into the common MagIC format and allows interpretation of demagnetization and Thellier-type experimental data. With some 175 programs and over 250 functions, it can be used to create a wide variety of plots and allows manipulation of downloaded data sets as well as preparation of new contributions for uploading to the MagIC database.",

            "abstract": "Ancient fluvial deposits are important records of historical surface conditions on Earth and also serve as important reservoir units for groundwater and hydrocarbons. Grain-size heterogeneity within fluvial deposits may record paleo-flow variability and/or paleo-sediment supply, but without improved understanding of the conditions under which clay can accumulate in sandy river beds, it is difficult to uniquely interpret these deposits.\nIn order to better understand the processes controlling when and where fine sediment accumulates in sandy river beds, we conducted a series of physical experiments to test if there is a relationship between supplied clay concentration and the amount of clay preserved in the river bed under constant and variable discharge conditions. In a 15.5 m feed-style flume, water discharge of 0.21 m3/s and sand supply of 15 g/s were used to aggrade a sandy bed 6.5 cm over the course of 4 hours. In three constant-discharge experiments, clay was added in concentrations of 1000 mg/l, 4000 mg/l and 8500 mg/l. An additional experiment with 1000 mg/l clay concentration was conducted with variable water-discharge, where discharge was slowed to a stop every hour of run time and clay allowed to settle for one hour and once overnight. After each experiment, clay deposits observable in the bed were mapped and samples were collected from the dry bed and analyzed for clay content.\nResults demonstrate that under constant discharge conditions, clay can accumulate in the bed and that the amount of clay retained in the bed is related to the amount of clay supplied to the flume. In sediment deposited with a low clay concentration, little to no clay accumulated in the bed while under high clay concentration, as much five percent of the bed had a high clay fraction. Clay accumulations that formed under constant flow conditions had different distribution and character from those formed under variable discharge conditions. In all experiments, clay retention was highest in the main aggradational phase of the runs, with markedly less clay preserved during bypass. These results suggest the nature of clay accumulations in sand channel deposits may be useful for reconstructing paleo-discharge conditions, and that subsurface reservoir quality may be predictable if these conditions are constrained.",

We estimate Earth rotation excitations using models of atmospheric, oceanic, and land hydrology surface mass variations and investigate the importance of including SAL over monthly to interannual timescales. We assess SAL effects in comparison with simple mass balance effects where net mass exchanged with the atmosphere and land is distributed uniformly over the global ocean. For oceanic polar motion excitations, SAL impacts are important even though mass balance impact is minor except at the annual period. This is true of global (atmosphere+land+ocean) polar motion excitations as well, although the SAL impacts are smaller. When estimating length-of-day excitations, mass balance effects have a dominant impact, particularly for oceanic excitation. Although SAL can have a significant impact on estimated Earth rotation excitations, its consideration did not improve comparisons with geodetic observations. This result may change in the future as surface mass models and Earth rotation observations improve.",

            "abstract": "The abundance of CO2 in the mesopause region has long been shown to track with mesopause cooling, making mesopause-region temperature measurement a way to track CO2 abundance in this critical region, where climate change indications often manifest early. One of the brightest thermally excited emissions in the mesopause region is the O2 A-band, whose emission peaks are significantly modulated as a function of temperature. Thus, spectroscopic recovery of a set of A-band emission lines between 763 and 765 nm, and a comparison of peak intensities, will provide information about mesopause temperature, and thus CO2 abundance. To get global coverage of this emission with high time resolution ( < 1s) requires a high-etendue spectrometer that can resolve the target lines (resolution ~ .06 nm), preferably aboard an efficient, economical vehicle capable of the global coverage that would be most beneficial to existing mesopause models. Nanosatellites are such a vehicle.\nThe NOASHIN instrument is a spectrometer very well suited to the low size, weight, and power (SWAP) of the nanosat platform. It is built around a Spatial Heterodyne Spectrometer (SHS), a monolithic Fourier transform spectrometer with no moving parts that shares the high etendue, high resolution advantages of conventional interferometers in a robust package ideal for space-based platforms. The NOASHIN instrument will be developed for, ultimately, a 1-U CubeSat, nadir-viewing nightglow measurement payload, used in a pushbroom imaging configuration from low-Earth orbit (~ 650 km), with an exposure time of < 1 s, leading to a target footprint of 9-km along-track.\nThe current development project will integrate a prototype NOASHIN SHS monolith into a 1.5-U CubeSat engineering prototype at the design SWAP requirements. The prototype will be detect emissions of the expected intensity (~700 R) from a lab source near the A-band and offload data onto a local computer for analysis.",

            "abstract": "The Transpolar Drift of sea ice across Arctic Ocean was arguably the first major element of Arctic Ocean circulation to be discovered. Nansen’s plan for his pioneering Fram expedition was based on the observation of the drift of the wreckage of the De Long’s ill-fated Jeanette from near Wrangle Island to the southern coast of Greenland. In this context the Transpolar Drift characterizes the large-scale motion of sea ice, but the term can be applied to the geostrophic circulation of the upper ocean as well. The Transpolar Drift of sea ice and upper ocean are related because both are driven, at least in part, by the gradient in dynamic ocean topography (DOT, sea surface height - geoid) associated with the Transpolar Front between Pacific and Atlantic-derived waters.\nStarting in the 1990s, major changes in direction of the ocean and ice transpolar drifts characterized shifts between anticyclonic and cyclonic ocean circulation. These affect the dominant pathways of ice, freshwater, and chemical constituents through Arctic Basin. Consequently, tracking behavior of the Transpolar Drift has been a high priority for the AON North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO). Recent hydrographic sections across the 90°E (from NPEO) and 90°W (from the Switchyard Project) longitude lines mainly straddle the Drift so that dynamic heights derived from the hydrography can be used as a proxy for DOT, and annual sections of geostrophic velocity determined. Sections along 0° and 180° longitude usually cross the Transpolar Front and Drift at a more oblique angle but provide a measure of Transpolar Drift direction. Hydrography results will be compared with DOT from satellite remote sensing, optimally interpolated satellite and buoy-derived ice drift, and changes in chemical constituents to describe the significance of and recent changes in the Transpolar Drift.",

            "abstract": "Sprites are spectacular transient luminous structures observed in the 50-95 km altitude range above active thunderstorms following large cloud-to-ground lightning strikes. Recordings at 10,000 images per second show impressive streamer activity with bright streamers moving up or down at velocities up to half the speed of light. Not surprisingly, the streamers have attracted much research attention. However, here we will concentrate on sprite beads, which together with sprite glows, are the dominant features in video images (30 or 25 images per second) and in photographs. Sprite glow forms after streamer activity near the sprite onset altitude and beads are small point-like optical features also associated with streamer activity. The reason that the glow and the beads are dominant in longer exposure images is primarily that they do not move much and hence light can integrate over the longer exposure times. In general, streamer activity at the start of the sprite lasts a few 10s of ms, while glow and beads last considerable longer; we have observed beads lasting in excess of 500 ms. High-speed imaging shows the glow and the beads to form along the path of streamers, but they do not appear optically before almost a millisecond after streamer passage. To first order, beads appear to be stationary, but a detailed analysis of high-speed observations often indicates a slow upward or downward motion. The optical emissions decay much slower than in other parts of the sprite indicating the presence of a longer lasting source of energy. The processes in beads leave an imprint, presumably creating a local irregularity, on the atmosphere lasting longer than the optical emissions. This imprint can serve as seed for streamer initiation in a subsequent sprite (re-ignition). Based on our observations the imprint can last up to 1 second. There have been suggestions that beads are formed around local pre-existing inhomogineities, but a recent observation indicate their formation more related to internal dynamics within the streamer channel. A sprite observation in August 2014 shows a streamer channel with beads spaced at regular intervals along the streamer path, which seems to be an unlikely distribution of pre-existing irregularities. A modeling effort based on these ideas is underway. ",

            "abstract": "Nitrate is found in agricultural runoff and natural water sources, and is known to be harmful to humans who ingest it, as well as to aquatic ecosystems into which it is transported. In the interest of simplifying and reducing cost of nitrate detection, we are developing a dedicated nitrate absorption spectrophotometer that is portable, automated, low maintenance, and appropriate for tile drains and agricultural runoff settings, and for natural streams and water bodies. Spectrophotometric and other optical methods for detecting concentrations of given substances have been well studied and implemented for both lab and field applications, but are often expensive and are rarely designed or well suited for long-term in-situ continuous monitoring of settings with low flow or minimal water.\nNitrate’s absorption spectrum ranges from below 200 nm to approximately 240 nm. Dissolved organic carbon’s absorption spectrum overlaps that of nitrate, ranging from below 200 nm to above 300 nm. By taking one absorption reading at a low wavelength within nitrate’s peak and a second reading between 240 nm and 300 nm, we see contributions of each substance. With a rough knowledge of the composition of samples of interest, this instrument is able to step outside the absorption spectra of expected interfering species, while staying within nitrate’s peak, effectively measuring exclusively nitrate and dissolved organic carbon.",

            "abstract": "The Chicxulub crater was formed by a bolide impact on the southern Gulf of Mexico at ~66 Ma ago that marked the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary, represented worldwide by the ejecta layer. The K/Pg boundary layer with its global distribution provides a high resolution marker, allowing high precision stratigraphic analyses in marine and continental sequences. Following crater formation, sedimentation re-established in the carbonate platform, filling the basin. Crater is located half on-land and half offshore, with the crater floor covered by sediments with variable thickness up to about 1 km. The target, impact and post-impact sequences have been drilled and cored, providing samples for stratigraphic, petrographic and physical-chemical laboratory studies. The post-impact stratigraphy has been analyzed in several studies at proximal, intermediate and distal outcrops and in the crater boreholes, using e.g., radiometric dating, micropaleontology, paleomagnetism, and strontium and stable isotope geochemistry. Emphasis has been given on the impact breccias-carbonates contact and the basal Paleocene sequence. Here we re-analyze the available data, revisiting the stratigraphy for the Santa Elena, Tekax, Peto and Yaxcopoil-1 boreholes using newly constructed detailed lithostratigraphic columns in the continuously cored boreholes. Additionally we extend the study to the Paleogene sequence in the Santa Elena and Yaxcopoil-1 boreholes using bulk carbon and oxygen isotopes, magnetic polarity, XRF core geochemistry and magnetic susceptibility stratigraphy. Results spanning chrons c29 to c24 constrain the K/Pg boundary, c29r-c29n polarity reversal and the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum, providing high resolution records. The basal Paleocene gap and age differences in an integrated stratigraphy are discussed and correlated to the GPTS scale and IODP marine isotope records. The extent and characteristics of crater structure and target/cover sediments have been imaged with terrestrial, marine and aerogeophysical surveys. We use the marine seismic sections for correlation of the geophysical logs and borehole stratigraphy, allowing lateral correlation across the crater and further constraining the sequence stratigraphy, platform evolution and impact effects.",

            "abstract": "GPS signals traveling through the earth's ionosphere are affected by charged particles that often disrupt the signal and the information it carries due to “scintillation”, which resembles an extra noise source on the signal. These signals are also affected by weather changes, tropospheric scattering, and absorption from objects due to multi-path propagation of the signal. These obstacles cause distortion within information and fading of the signal, which ultimately results in phase locking errors and noise in messages. In this work, we attempted to replicate the distortion that occurs in GPS signals using a signal processing simulation model. We wanted to be able to create and identify scintillated signals so we could better understand the environment that caused it to become scintillated. Then, under controlled conditions, we simulated the receiver's ability to suppress scintillation in a signal. We developed a code in MATLAB that was programmed to: 1. Create a carrier wave and then plant noise (four different frequencies) on the carrier wave, 2. Compute a Fourier transform on the four different frequencies to find the frequency content of a signal, 3. Use a filter and apply it to the Fourier transform of the four frequencies and then compute a Signal-to-noise ratio to evaluate the power (in Decibels) of the filtered signal, and 4.Plot each of these components into graphs. To test the code's validity, we used user input and data from an AM transmitter. We determined that the amplitude modulated signal or AM signal would be the best type of signal to test the accuracy of the MATLAB code due to its simplicity. This code is basic to give students the ability to change and use it to determine the environment and effects of noise on different AM signals and their carrier waves. Overall, we were able to manipulate a scenario of a noisy signal and interpret its behavior and change due to its noisy components: amplitude, frequency, and phase shift.",

            "abstract": "Marine advective fog is a common feature along the California coast during the summer season. This fog provides an important water source to many endemic fauna and flora. Studies are underway to better understand the chemical makeup of Pacific marine fog as it is an important input to the hydrologic cycle. We report results from our study focused on investigating the potential for coastal ocean upwelling to contribute volatile organic mercury to the overlying atmosphere where it could be incorporated into cloud droplets as monomethyl mercury (MMHg). Preliminary research by this group has indicated that fog water inputs to certain coastal locations may contribute up to 99% of the MMHg flux to land compared to the MMHg flux in rain. Mercury measurements, including total mercury (Hgt), MMHg, elemental mercury (Hg0), and dimethyl mercury (DMHg), were made to unfiltered water collected from depth profiles at 12 stations from Big Sur to Trinidad Head over the California shelf during summer 2014. Profiles of Hgt ranged from 0.3-2.4 pM and were similar to other reported measurements of Hgt for the North Pacific. A large range in concentration was observed for MMHg (10-540 fM) with elevated values generally occurring below the oxycline (>50m). Concentrations of Hg0 were 0.06 to 0.57 pM with elevated concentrations at depth relative to surface values. Depth profiles of DMHg were similar to MMHg and concentrations were measured from 10-295 fM with highest concentrations observed below the oxycline. Surface concentrations of DMHg averaged 40 ± 22 fM. Given the observed profiles for DMHg and the fact that it is sparingly soluble in water, a net flux of DMHg to the atmosphere is likely occurring. Based on these findings and the fact that MMHg and DMHg concentrations in the coastal ocean were highest in the low oxygen zone, we speculate that mercury is methylated in the water column and/or sediments as DMHg and that this water is upwelled seasonally in the coastal zones and contributes organic mercury to overlying cloud banks, which has the potential to deposit onto upland terrestrial ecosystems. Research is ongoing through the establishment of a network of 7 coastal terrestrial sites from Big Sur to Trinidad Head and through coastal oceanographic expeditions planned through the summer of 2015.",

            "abstract": "The Southwest Region of the Plate Boundary Observatory manages 480 continuously operating GPS stations located principally along the transform system of the San Andreas fault, Eastern California Shear Zone and the northern Baja peninsula. In the past year, network uptime averaged 98% with greater than 99% data acquisition.\nIn an effort to modernize the network, we have started to replace Trimble NETRS receivers with GNSS capable NETR9 receivers. Currently, we have 431 NetRS receivers deployed in the region, and 48 NetR9 receivers. In addition, 82 stations (17%) stream 1 Hz data over the VRS3Net typically with <0.5 second latency and an average completeness of >92%. Based on their typical data download rates, approximately 252 (53%) of all stations are capable of streaming 1 Hz, but have not yet been added to the real time network because of lack of resources. In the immediate aftermath of the M8.2 Chile earthquake in April 2014, high rate data downloads from the entire SW network had a success rate of 95% and 71% for 1 Hz and 5 Hz data downloads respectively.\nWe have continued to upgrade critical radio networks, including the San Francisco Bay Area, Anza Borrego, and Santa Barbara networks. These efforts are ongoing, but they have already significantly improved data download rates and dependability. We are also converting cell modem to radio communications whenever possible for increased reliability and cost savings.\nIn December 2013 the 13-station Edison network expansion was completed through cost recovery contracts. These stations span coastal southern California in Orange, San Diego and Los Angeles counties including a hybrid site on the Elly oil platform. The primary purpose of the stations is to aid in the seismic source characterization of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and assess the strain field associated with the Oceanside Blind Thrust and Newport Inglewood fault. The new stations fill a gap between SCIGN and PBO. Three sites have WXT520 Vaisala metpacks and twelve stations stream 1Hz data via VRS3Net.\nUNAVCO and SCRIPPS are working in collaboration to augment a subset of stations with low-cost strong-motion sensors along the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults. To date twelve PBO stations have been upgraded with MEMS accelerometer packages.",

            "abstract": "Relative to the U-Pb decay series, the Th-Pb decay series has received relatively little attention for geochronology although it offers promising applications in both high-resolution geochronology as well as thermochronology. The limitations are partly because Th measurements by thermal ionization have proven notoriously difficult, and for many geochronological applications, the additional information provided by Th-Pb has not been worth the effort required. However, the current generation of MC-ICPMS instruments provides nearly two orders of magnitude better sensitivity of Th than TIMS, eliminating this barrier to measurement and opening up this chronometer for new use. We have developed a method to measure relative abundances of Th, U and Pb by isotope dilution for high-precision geochronology. This method leverages the strengths of two instruments, the high sensitivity and stable mass fractionation of MC-ICPMS instruments for Th and U, and the low background, lack of isobaric interference, and signal stability of TIMS instruments for Pb. To make these measurements, we have calibrated a new synthetic isotope tracer that comprises a mixture of 229Th-233U-236U-202Pb-205Pb. The analytical strategy developed for accessory minerals is a hybrid of techniques previously developed for U-Pb ID-TIMS and U/230Th ID-MC-ICPMS, with a two-column HCl-HNO3 anion exchange procedure (one to separate U and Pb from matrix+Th, and the other to separate Th from matrix), followed by a recombination of the U and Th fractions for MC-ICPMS analysis while the Pb fraction is measured by TIMS. Th-Pb measurements are complementary to, and potentially as precise as the U-Pb gold standard, and the method will find application in certain geological problems, including (1) precisely determining the relative decay rates of 232Th and 238U, (2) dating materials that are young enough to be substantially affected by 230Th or 231Pa disequilibria, and (3) dating small quantities of high-Th minerals like monazite, allanite, and perovskite. We present here a description of the analytical strategy and preliminary measurements of calibration and reference materials.",

            "abstract": "GCM-based climate projections and downscaled climate data proliferate, and there are many climate-aware vegetation models in use by researchers. Yet application of fine-scale DGVM based simulation output in national forest vulnerability assessments is not common, because there are technical, administrative and social barriers for their use by managers and policy makers. As part of a science-management climate change adaptation partnership, we performed simulations of vegetation response to climate change for four national forests in the Blue Mountains of Oregon using the MC2 dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) for use in vulnerability assessments. Our simulation results under business-as-usual scenarios suggest a starkly different future forest conditions for three out of the four national forests in the study area, making their adoption by forest managers a potential challenge. However, using DGVM output to structure discussion of potential vegetation changes provides a suitable framework to discuss the dynamic nature of vegetation change compared to using more commonly available model output (e.g. species distribution models). From the onset, we planned and coordinated our work with national forest managers to maximize the utility and the consideration of the simulation results in planning. Key lessons from this collaboration were: (1) structured and strategic selection of a small number climate change scenarios that capture the range of variability in future conditions simplified results; (2) collecting and integrating data from managers for use in simulations increased support and interest in applying output; (3) a structured, regionally focused, and hierarchical calibration of the DGVM produced well-validated results; (4) simple approaches to quantifying uncertainty in simulation results facilitated communication; and (5) interpretation of model results in a holistic context in relation to multiple lines of evidence produced balanced guidance. This latest point demonstrates the importance of using model out as a forum for discussion along with other information, rather than using model output in an inappropriately predictive sense. These lessons are being applied currently to other national forests in the Pacific Northwest to contribute in vulnerability assessments.",

            "abstract": "Sensitivity of the Nile’s basin vegetation cover to climate was assessed using a simple diagnostic and correlation analysis approach. Over the last 30 years the basin experienced extreme climate events, in particular droughts (80’ies) and a noticeable and sustained recovery starting in the 90ies. We looked at the associated changes in the vegetation index signal over the same period using the newly generated seamless multi-sensor long-term data record about vegetation and phenology. The V4 VIP (vip.arizona.edu) 30+year record of vegetation index and growing season compiled from AVHRR and MODIS sensors was used. Additionally climate data for the corresponding 30-year period was acquired from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and temperature from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly (GHCN-M). A single year (2002) MODIS based Land Cover data was also used to cluster and assess change based on the vegetation type.\nThe overall response was complex owing to the complex climate regime (dry - wet, while increasingly hot), to topography, and the complex land cover of the region. Vegetation response was negative corresponding to the decrease in precipitation, until a strong and widespread recovery starting in the late 90’ies. The greening trend continued but started to break down with elevation as temperature started to play a more prominent role. The combined drier and hotter climate started to negatively impact high elevation vegetation. These changes were mostly driven by changes in the precipitation regimes with initially little impact of the temperature. However, the temperature sustained increase started to have the stronger impact when associated with the slightly drier conditions.\nThese diagnostic results coupled with climate models projection point to major negative impacts on the basin’s vegetation cover, productivity, and eventually their associated ecosystem services. These results suggest that the earlier and major changes will be experienced by the higher elevation areas.",

Year round measurements of turbulence where taken at heights, above, below, and in the live crown. Additionally measurements of tree bole motion were taken simultaneously for 150 trees surrounding the main meteorological tower. To identify the gust impressions and further understand the timing, spacing and intensity of momentum flux, a a multi-resolution decomposition (MRD) technique was used to find the dominant eddy size. Fourier analysis was applied to each tree for the corresponding time and changes in dominant tree frequency were mapped over time. Results indicate that the most coherency in stand-scale motion occurs when frequency changes are mapped at the same time resolution of the dominant eddy size. Through a mapping-displacement comparison, the sub-mesoscale motions of a canopy atmosphere and their effect on the tree's movement as well as fluxes of energy will be better understood.",

            "abstract": "Modern seismic networks typically deploy three component (3C) sensors, but still fail to utilize all of the information available in the seismograms when performing automated phase picking for real-time event location. In most cases a variation on a short term over long term average threshold detector is used for picking and then an association program is used to assign phase types to the picks. However, the 3C waveforms from an earthquake contain an abundance of information related to the P and S phases in both their polarization and energy partitioning. An approach that has been overlooked and has demonstrated encouraging results is the Component Energy Comparison Method (CECM) by Nagano et al. as published in Geophysics 1989. CECM is well suited to being used in real-time because the calculation is not computationally intensive. Furthermore, the CECM method has fewer tuning variables (3) than traditional pickers in Earthworm such as the Rex Allen algorithm (N=18) or even the Anthony Lomax Filter Picker module (N=5). In addition to computing the CECM detector we study the detector sensitivity by rotating the signal into principle components as well as estimating the P phase onset from a curvature function describing the CECM as opposed to the CECM itself. We present our results implementing this algorithm in a real-time module for Earthworm and show the improved phase picks as compared to the traditional single component pickers using Earthworm.",

Simplified studies using in-lab 'simulated' extreme environments, such as UV bulbs or cold blocks, are manually intensive, error-prone, and lose many complexities of the microbe/environment interaction.\nWe have built a prototype instrument to address this dilemma by allowing automated iterations of microbial cultures to be subject to combinations of modular environmental pressures such as heat, radiation, and chemical exposure. The presence of multiple sensors allows the state of the culture and internal environment to be continuously monitored and adjusted in response.\nOur first prototype showed successful iterations of microbial growth and thermal exposure. Our second prototype, presented here, performs an demonstration of repeated exposure of Escherichia coli to ultraviolet radiation, a well-established procedure. As the E. coli becomes more resistant to ultraviolet radiation, the device detects their increased survival and growth and increases the dosage accordingly. Calibration data for the instrument was generated by performing the same proof-of-concept exposure experiment, at a smaller scale, by hand.\nCurrent performance data indicates that our finalized instrument will have the ability to run hundreds of iterations with multiple selection pressures. The automated sensing and adaptive exposure that the device provides will inform the challenges of managing and culturing life tailored to uncommon environmental stresses.\nWe have designed this device to be flexible, extensible, low-cost and easy to reproduce. We hope that it enter wide use as a tool for conducting scalable studies of the interaction between extremophiles and multiple environmental stresses, and potentially for generating artificial extremophiles as analogues for life we might find in extreme environments here on Earth or elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "Isoprene is thought to be a major contributor to the global secondary organic aerosol (SOA) budget, and therefore has the potential to exert a significant influence on earth’s climate via aerosol direct and indirect radiative effects. Both aerosol optical and cloud condensation nuclei properties are quite sensitive to aerosol number size distribution, as opposed to the total aerosol mass concentration. Recent studies suggest that SOA particles can be highly viscous, which can affect the kinetics of SOA partitioning and size distribution evolution when the condensing organic vapors are semi-volatile. In this study, we examine the growth kinetics of SOA formed from isoprene photooxidation in the presence of pre-existing Aitken and accumulation mode aerosols in: (a) the ambient atmosphere during the CARES field campaign, and (b) the environmental chamber at PNNL. Each growth episode is analyzed and interpreted with the updated MOSAIC aerosol box model, which performs kinetic gas-particle partitioning of SOA and takes into account diffusion and chemical reaction within the particle phase. The model is initialized with the observed aerosol size distribution and composition at the beginning of the experiment, and the total amount of SOA formed in the model at any given time is constrained by the observed total amount of SOA formed. The variable model parameters include the number of condensing organic species, their gas-phase formation rates, their effective volatilities, and their bulk diffusivities in the Aitken and accumulation modes. The objective of the constrained modeling exercise is then to determine which model configuration is able to best reproduce the observed size distribution evolution, thus providing valuable insights into the possible mechanism of SOA formation. We also examine the evaporation kinetics of size-selected particles formed in the environmental chamber to provide additional constraints on the effective volatility and bulk diffusivity of the organic species. Our results suggest that SOA formed from isoprene photooxidation is semi-volatile, and the resulting size distribution evolution is highly sensitive to the phase state (bulk diffusivity) of the pre-existing aerosol. Implications of these findings on further SOA model development and evaluation strategy will be discussed.",

We use a glacial mass-balance model in conjunction with global climate model (GCM) output data to calculate the change in ELA between modern and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21 ka) climates in the presently hyper-arid subtropical Andes. The region is currently unglaciated, despite cold enough temperatures, as there is too little moisture to sustain glaciers. Previous studies suggest this area was glaciated during the LGM, however, little is known about the extent of the glaciation or the climate required to sustain it. The mass-balance model used in this study calculates the change in ELA using the positive degree-day (PDD) sum, the sum of daily mean air temperatures that are above zero. The PDD sum is used to calculate ablation, which is then assumed to be proportional to temperature, in order to calculate the change in ELA. Using output from several GCM simulations, we compare the change in ELA between LGM and modern climates across the different models for the subtropical Andes. These simulations suggest that the changes in climate resulted in a lowering of ELAs to the extent that parts of the subtropical Andes were glaciated during the LGM.",

            "abstract": "This presentation discusses the recent improvements to the PERSIANN-CCS (Precipitation Estimation from remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System). The PERSIANN-CCS is one of the algorithms being integrated in the IMERG (Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Mission GPM) to estimate precipitation at 0.04o lat-long scale at every 30-minute interval. While PERSIANN-CCS has a relatively fine temporal and spatial resolution for generating rainfall estimation over the globe, it sometimes underestimates or overestimates over some regions, depending on certain conditions. In this study, improving the PERSIANN-CCS precipitation estimation using long-term passive microwave (PMW) rainfall estimation is explored. The adjustment is proceeded by matching the probability distribution of PERSIANN-CCS estimates to the PMW rainfall estimation. Four years of concurrent samples from 2008 to 2011 were used in the calibration while one year (2012) of the data was used for the validation of the PMW-adjusted PERSIANN-CCS estimates. Samples over a 5 o x5 o lat-long coverage were collected and an adjustment look up table for each month covering 60oS-60oN was generated. The validation of PERSIANN-CCS estimation before and after PMW adjustment over CONUS using radar data was investigated. The results show that the adjustment has different impact on the PERSIANN-CCS rain estimates depending on the location and time of the year. PERSIANN-CCS adjustments were found to be more significant over high latitude and winter time periods and less significant over the low latitude and summer time period.",

            "abstract": "In an effort to establish the validity and accuracy of airborne, image based, CH4 remote sensing instruments. We employed Los Alamos National Laboratory’s high-resolution large eddy simulation model HiGrad to simulate the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), and controlled CH4 releases measured during a field campaign in July of 2013. A statistically similar ABL to that observed during the field campaign was produced by downscaling NCEP’s North American Model analysis fields assimilated through the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction model. These relatively coarse scale, observationally seeded simulations were then incorporated as initial and boundary conditions to drive high-resolution simulations with HiGrad. The resulting HiGrad simulations were compared against in-situ tower-based measurements from the field campaign, in order to establish a ground-truth validation of the multi-model simulation approach for both meteorology and CH4 dispersion. Subsequently, the high-resolution simulations were used to provide a statistically similar baseline of vertical column integrated CH4 concentration in the ABL, against which the new remote-sensing instrument observations could be compared. This multi-model approach to realizing a modeled ABL representative of that observed during the field campaign shows promise for future combined modeling and observation efforts aimed at specific real world case studies of ABL processes.",

            "abstract": "Submesoscale processes may influence the depth and stratification of the ocean surface boundary layer. Yet the prevalence of these motions throughout the ocean and the conditions that trigger them have been difficult to ascertain. Previous submesoscale-focused observational programs have considered regions with strong frontal currents, such as the Gulf Stream, where conditions are favorable for submesoscale instabilities. Here we present a times series of hydrographic observations, obtained at submesoscale resolution, from a region characterized by a weak mean flow. As part of the Ocean Surface Mixing, Ocean Submesoscale Interaction Study (OSMOSIS), glider pairs occupied a 20 km by 20 km region over the Porcupine Abyssal Plain in the northeast Atlantic from September 2012 to September 2013. This data set provides a unique opportunity to study the physical processes that contribute to upper ocean mixed-layer variability over a full seasonal cycle.\nWe analyze roughly 300 sections of buoyancy and geostrophic velocity to approximate potential vorticity, PV. Conditions indicative of symmetric instability (SI), q < 0 with lateral buoyancy gradients dominant over vertical buoyancy gradients, are rampant in late autumn and in winter. During this period mixed layer depths are variable, but observations of SI-favorable conditions are often immediately followed by a shoaling of the mixed layer. Occurrences of negative PV stop abruptly in the spring when the mixed layer shoals to ~50 m. We analyze the evolving buoyancy structure with respect to frontogenesis diagnosed from sea surface temperature, mesoscale activity diagnosed from sea surface height and wind forcing diagnosed from reanalysis. Preliminary results suggest that SI events occur during transitions from vortex-dominated to strain-dominated regimes and are enhanced by down-front winds. We also discuss the analysis of a 1/48-degree (~1.5 km-resolution) ocean model in the same region, where the frequency of SI events are similar to the glider observations.",

            "abstract": "The Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) on board the GPM Core Observatory consists of Ku-band (13.6 GHz) and Ka-band (35.5 GHz) radars, with an improved minimum detection sensitivity of precipitation compared to the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Precipitation Radar (TRMM PR).\nWe have studied impacts of improved detection sensitivity with the GPM DPR compared with the TRMM PR. One example of light precipitation is, a scattered rainfall around a trough over the subtropical South Pacific Ocean, which consists of weak but erect precipitation reaching over the melting level of ~2.5 km and trailing precipitation above, which reaches as high as 5km. Another example is a light anvil precipitation spreading from convective cores of a storm in the upper troposphere, overcasting shallow convective precipitation below. The ability of globally detecting such light precipitation will improve our knowledge of precipitation processes.\nUtilizing an early version of the DPR product, a quick evaluation on statistical impacts of increasing the detection sensitivity from 17dBZ to 12dBZ has been performed. Here, 17dBZ is the value which is mostly accepted as the performed detection sensitivity of the TRMM PR, and 12dBZ is the guaranteed sensitivity for GPM Ka-band radar. For the near surface precipitation, impacts are significant in terms of numbers, but limited to several regions in terms of the rainfall volume. Volume impacts are much larger at the upper troposphere, which is indicated by the detection of the anvil precipitation, for example. The upper level improvements are mostly found where the deep precipitation systems exist.\nQuantitative discussions utilizing the latest version of the DPR data, which is scheduled to be released to the public in September, will be presented at the session.",

            "abstract": "Sulfate aerosols have an important cooling effect on the Earth because they scatter sunlight back to space and form cloud condensation nuclei. However, understanding of the atmospheric sulfur cycle is incomplete, leading to uncertainty in the assessment of past, present and future climate forcing. Here we use annually resolved observations of sulfur and methanesulfonic acid (MSA) concentration in an array of precisely dated Southern Greenland ice cores to assess the history of sulfur pollution emitted from North America and Europe and the history of biogenic sulfate aerosol derived from the North Atlantic Ocean over the last 250 years. The ice core sulfur time series is found to closely track sulfur concentrations in North American and European precipitation since records began in 1965, and also closely tracks estimated sulfur emissions since 1850 within the air mass source region as determined by back trajectory analysis. However, a decline to near-preindustrial sulfur concentrations in the ice cores after 1995 that is not so extensive in the source region emissions indicates that there has been a change in sulfur cycling over the last 150 years. The ice core MSA time series shows a decline of 60% since the 1860s, and is well correlated with declining sea ice concentrations around Greenland, suggesting that the phytoplankton source of biogenic sulfur has declined due to a loss of marginal sea ice zone habitat. Incorporating the implied decrease in biogenic sulfur in our analysis improves the match between the ice core sulfur record and the source region emissions throughout the last 150 years, and solves the problem of the recent return to near-preindustrial levels in the Greenland ice. These findings indicate that the transport efficiency of sulfur air pollution has been relatively stable through the industrial era and that biogenic sulfur emissions in the region have declined.",

            "abstract": "A spatial reduction in bed material flux is observed where rivers transition from normal flow to the back-water influenced zone, as the river flow begins to feel the effect of sea-level in the receiving basin. The back-water length is a characteristic length scale of all rivers entering a receiving basin, but is best distinguished in lowland rivers with shallow gradient. We will quantify trends in stratigraphic architecture and sediment partitioning within the deposits of the Holocene Mississippi Channel Belt as a consequence of this change in river hydraulics at the back-water transition.\nMeasurements from Cairo to Head of Passes show that the back-water transition, in the vicinity of river kilometer 400, marks a dramatic reduction in the width of the Mississippi Channel Belt from 5 to 15 times the channel width upstream of the transition zone to nearly equal to the channel width downstream of the transition zone. This variation in channel belt width is tied to the decreased lateral mobility of the channel downstream of the back-water transition. The thickness of bank-attached bar deposits, collected from >1700 cores in 110 cross-sections, was used as a proxy for channel depth from Cairo to Head of Passes. Thickness trends reveal that bank-attached bars thicken from approximately 20m upstream of the transition to 45m just above Head of Passes, while decreased lateral migration result in narrower bar deposits. A comparison of 5 different channel belts from the Rhine-Meuse and Mississippi systems is presented. The data shows that when the channel belt width scaled by channel width is plotted against distance upstream scaled by the backwater length, a tight linear relationship emerges. This relationship is helpful when interpreting paleo-environment of deposition from ancient remotely-sensed channel belts in data with limited areal coverage.",

            "abstract": "The US coastline, over the past few years, has been overwhelmed by major storms including Hurricane Katrina (2005), Ike (2008), Irene (2011), and Sandy (2012). Supported by a growing and extensive body of evidence, a majority of research agrees hurricane activities have been enhanced due to climate change. However, the precise prediction of hurricane induced inundation remains a challenge. This study proposed a probabilistic inundation map based on a Statistically Modeled Storm Database (SMSD) to assess the probabilistic coastal inundation risk of Southwest Florida for near-future (20 years) scenario considering climate change. This map was processed through a Joint Probability Method with Optimal-Sampling (JPM-OS), developed by Condon and Sheng in 2012, and accompanied by a high resolution storm surge modeling system CH3D-SSMS. The probabilistic inundation map shows a 25.5-31.2% increase in spatially averaged inundation height compared to an inundation map of present-day scenario.\nTo estimate climate change impacts on coastal communities, socioeconomic analyses were conducted using both the SMSD based probabilistic inundation map and the present-day inundation map. Combined with 2010 census data and 2012 parcel data from Florida Geographic Data Library, the differences of economic loss between the near-future and present day scenarios were used to generate an economic exposure map at census block group level to reflect coastal communities’ exposure to climate change. The results show that climate change induced inundation increase has significant economic impacts. Moreover, the impacts are not equally distributed among different social groups considering their social vulnerability to hazards. Social vulnerability index at census block group level were obtained from Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute. The demographic and economic variables in the index represent a community’s adaptability to hazards. Local Moran's I was calculated to identify the clusters of highly exposed and vulnerable communities. The economic-exposure cluster map was overlapped with social-vulnerability cluster map to identify communities with low adaptive capability but high exposure. The result provides decision makers an intuitive tool to identify most susceptible communities for adaptation.",

            "abstract": "We present a comparison of three stochastic approaches for estimating log hydraulic conductivity (Y) and predicting steady-state groundwater flow. Two of the approaches are based on the data assimilation technique known as ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and differ in the way prior statistical moment estimates (PSME) (required to build the Kalman gain matrix) are obtained. In the first approach, the Monte Carlo method is employed to compute PSME of the variables and parameters; we denote this approach by EnKFMC. In the second approach PSME are computed through the direct solution of approximate nonlocal (integrodifferential) equations that govern the spatial conditional ensemble means (statistical expectations) and covariances of hydraulic head (h) and fluxes; we denote this approach by EnKFME. The third approach consists of geostatistical stochastic inversion of the same nonlocal moment equations; we denote this approach by IME. In addition to testing the EnKFMC and EnKFME methods in the traditional manner that estimate Y over the entire grid, we propose novel corresponding algorithms that estimate Y at a few selected locations and then interpolate over all grid elements via kriging as done in the IME method. We tested these methods to estimate Y and h in steady-state groundwater flow in a synthetic two-dimensional domain with a well pumping at a constant rate, located at the center of the domain. In addition, to evaluate the performance of the estimation methods, we generated four unconditional different realizations that served as “true” fields. The results of our numerical experiments indicate that the three methods were effective in estimating h, reaching at least 80% of predictive coverage, although both EnKF were superior to the IME method. With respect to estimating Y, the three methods reached similar accuracy in terms of the mean absolute value error. Coupling the EnKF methods with kriging to estimate Y reduces to one fourth the CPU time required for data assimilation while both estimation accuracy and uncertainty do not deteriorate significantly.",

            "abstract": "MODIS data has been extensively used to study vegetation and crop phenological characteristics and monitoring. Recently, land cover change detection techniques have been proposed that identify changes in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data collected by applying time series change detection techniques but these studies do not address most of the challenges associated with the land cover change detection problem. In this study, we present a novel un-supervised change detection method based on computing similarity between two given time series images (MODIS NDVI bi-weekly time series images). The widely used K-Means clustering is not very effective in modeling temporal correlations and crop phenology in particular. In addition clusters have to be manually labeled in order to identify changes. Our proposed research addresses these two limitations. Basic methodology is based on premise that if there is no change between two years, then the corresponding time series (and phenology) should be very “similar.” There are several measures for estimating the similarity between two give time series. Here we have adopted the widely used “Fréchet distance” as measure of similarity between two time series. Unlike regular clustering based time series, where year-wise time series are clustered separately, our algorithm builds a single cluster model for a given pair of year-wise time series. Using this single cluster model, each year-wise time series are then clustered into a given number of groups. Therefore, a direct comparison can be made between any two given clustered images to identify changes. We test our approach using data for years 2006 and 2011 and evaluating it against NLCD and USDA class labels. Results, challenges, and future research directions are discussed in details.",

            "abstract": "InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) is a NASA Discovery Program mission that will place a single geophysical lander on Mars to study its deep interior. InSight’s main experiment is the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS), which will robotically place a broadband seismometer provided by the French Space Agency (CNES) on the Martian surface. SEIS will operate on the surface for a full Mars year.\nInstalling and operating a seismometer on Mars imposes constraints rarely considered in terrestrial seismic installations. The InSight project has therefore conducted a terrestrial analog field deployment exercise to better understand and prepare for the distinctive challenges that placing a broadband seismometer in a Mars-like configuration and environment would pose. The exercise was conducted in two phases at NASA’s Goldstone facility in the Southern California Mojave desert. In the first phase we have installed a surface geophysical station including a broadband seismometer, a microbarometer, anemometer, and thermal sensors in a configuration resembling the InSight’s geophysical station. The site was located in an exposed location with rough surface and subsurface terrain. It was in close proximity to Goldstone permanent seismic station (GSC) that provided a ground-truth measurement. In the second phase, the installation was moved to a dry lakebed where the geophysical conditions mimic the expected geophysical environment of InSight’s target landing site on Mars.\nWe will present a summary of lessons learned so far from our analog deployment exercise. The data analysis emphasizes several aspects of key importance to the InSight mission: (1) Exploring strategies to mitigate environmental noise sources; (2) Recognizing noise sources that might be introduced by the InSight lander (solar panel flutter); (3) Identifying weak geophysical signals with low SNR above the environmental noise; (4) Using non tectonic signals (such as dust devils, and mechanical sources) to determine the elastic properties of the shallow structure.",

            "abstract": "Traveling bacterial waves are capable of improving contaminant remediation in the subsurface. It is fairly well understood how bacterial chemotaxis and growth separately affect the formation and propagation of such waves. However, their interaction is not well understood. We therefore perform a modeling study to investigate the coupled effects of chemotaxis and growth on bacterial migration, and examine their effects on contaminant remediation. We study the waves by using different initial electron acceptor concentrations for different bacteria and substrate systems. Three types of traveling waves can occur: a chemotactic wave due to the biased movement of chemotactic bacteria resulting from metabolism-generated substrate concentration gradients; a growth/decay/motility wave due to a dynamic equilibrium between bacterial growth, decay and random motility; and an integrated wave due to the interaction between bacterial chemotaxis and growth. Chemotaxis hardly enhances the bacterial propagation if it is too weak to form a chemotactic wave or its wave speed is less than half of the growth/decay/motility wave speed. However, chemotaxis significantly accelerates bacterial propagation once its wave speed exceeds the growth/decay/motility wave speed. When convection occurs, it speeds up the growth/decay/motility wave but slows down or even eliminates the chemotactic wave due to the dispersion. Bacterial survival proves particularly important for bacterial propagation. Therefore we develop a conceptual model to estimate the speed of growth/decay/motility waves.",

Among others, the Mt. Simon Sandstone of the Illinois Basin has been targeted by DOE partnerships for supercritical CO2 injection. In this study, we used lab experiments to test the feasibility of microbially-mediated sealing of a leaking wellbore and then used the data to model the biofilm growth and calcite precipitation while accounting for over nine chemical reactions. Sporosarcina pasteurii was investigated for its ability to precipitate calcium carbonate to seal fractures in cement or within the Mt. Simon Sandstone formation, at variable pressure and temperature conditions. S. pasteurii cultures were studied in a rocking autoclave at temperature (ca. 40oC) and pressure (ca. 12 MPa) consistent with the geologic formation at depth and surficial changes were characterized before and after experimental incubations using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). At temperatures up to 40oC, atmospheric pressure, and in the presence of the Mt. Simon brine (1.016 M NaCl, 0.171M CaCl2, 0.067 M MgCl2, 0.017 M Na2SO4, 0.006 M NaHCO3), S. pasteurii thrived and showed evidence of biofilm formation using SECM. These data are the first to be applied to the newly developed computational model that extends a singular and degenerate model of biofilm growth and incorporates a variational inequality to remove the singularity. This study extends our knowledge of the stability of biologically generated carbonate species, and the associated biota, in pore-space and fractures of pertinent geological strata and cement under conditions consistent with deep storage of CO2.",

            "abstract": "Flow near the termini of tidewater glaciers varies over short time-scales due to mechanisms that are poorly understood. Repeat observations with high temporal and spatial resolution, recorded around the terminus, are required to better understand the processes that control flow variability. Progress in light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology permit such observations of the near-terminus and the pro-glacial ice mélange, though standard workflows for quantifying deformation from point clouds currently do not exist. Here, we test and develop methods for processing displacements from LiDAR data of complexly deforming bodies. We use data collected at 30-minute intervals over three-days in August 2013 at Helheim Glacier, Greenland by a long-range (6-10 km), 1064 nm wavelength Terrestrial LiDAR Scanner (TLS). The total area of coverage was ~25 km2.\nDistributed shear in glaciers prevents a simple transformation for aligning repeat point clouds, but within small regions (~100 m2) strain is assumed to be minor between scans. Registering a large number of these individual regions, subset from the full point-cloud, results in reduced alignment errors. By subsetting in a regular grid, rasters of velocities between scans are created. However, using data-dependent properties such as point density causes the generation of unevenly spaced velocity estimations, which can locally improve resolution or decrease registration errors. The choice of subsets therefore controls the output product's resolution and accuracy. We test how the spatial segmentation scheme affects the displacement results and alignment errors, finding that displacements can be quantified with limited assumption of the true value of displacement for the subset, barring great morphological changes. By identifying areas that do not deform over the temporal domain of the dataset, and using these as the subsets to align, it should be possible to deduce which structures are accommodating strain. This allows for a characterization of the deformation style at the surface that is not attainable with other existing technologies.",

            "abstract": "Celadonite is a low-temperature (<~50 °C) alteration mineral that fills voids and fractures within buried and metasomatized volcanic rocks. The common occurrence, mineral chemistry and structural properties of celadonite (a K2O-rich and Ar retentive phyllosilicate) make it attractive as a monitor of not only spatial and temporal variability of low-temperature hydrothermal fluid circulation and alteration, but also potentially of burial rates of lava piles.\nThe Neogene lava pile in E Iceland underwent burial metamorphism, tectonic tilting and subsequent glacial exhumation, and is today exposed with superimposed sub-horizontal regional zeolite facies mineral zones. From a single sample of the Skessa Tuff, a prominent welded pyroclastic flow, we present new 40Ar/39Ar incremental heating age determinations using the ARGUS-VI multi-collector mass spectrometer at OSU: plagioclase (10.26 ± 0.12 Ma), groundmass (10.15 ± 0.10 Ma), early-forming light green celadonite (9.73 ± 0.03 Ma) and later-forming dark blue-green celadonite (9.67 ± 0.03). The sample was collected at ~500 m above sea level (masl), beneath volcanic material from the Thingmuli dyke swarm and central volcano.\nThe cooling ages of plagioclase and groundmass separates are in close agreement and represent the eruption age of this pyroclastic flow. The geochronologic data and petrographic observations suggest homogeneous and relatively rapid crystallization of celadonite. The inferred original top of the lava pile is ~650 m (1400 masl, and lost to erosion) above the top of the analcime zone (~750 masl). Celadonite is predominantly found as early-stage lining of primary pore space, but overgrown by chlorite/smectite clays and zeolites at higher grades. Above ~750 mals vesicles are void of celadonite, and hence, celadonite precipitates in a narrow zone at ~650 m depth. The pyroclastic flow and its subsequent burial to ~650 m depth is separated by ~600 ky, which suggests a burial rate of ~1100 m/m.y. This burial rate is 2x that of estimates from contemporaneous sections located away from central volcanoes. Considering the proximity of the sampling site to Thingmuli, it seems reasonable to expect a greater burial rate. Thermochronology and celadonite 40Ar/39Ar dating can unravel tectono-magmatic processes associated with the burial of flood basalt piles.",

The torus varies both spatially and temporally, driven by changes in volcanism and asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere. We report results from 9 nights of observation spanning November 2013 to February 2014 with the Dual Imaging Spectrograph on the ARC 3.5m telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico. Emissions in these data include the [SII] doublets at 6716/6731A and 4069/4076A, [OII] at 3726/3729A, [SIII] at 3722A and 6312A, as well as resonantly scattered neutral [NaI] at 5890/5896A. Constraints on electron density, temperature and ion mixing rations can be obtained. Observations of both ansa during a 5 hour period characterize the complete longitudinal structure. Specifically, the intensity ratio of the collisionally excited [SII] doublet at 6716/6731A is a diagnostic for local electron density sampled at ~20 minute cadence. Absolute intensity can be derived directly from the reflectance of Jupiter's disc and standard calibrations are performed on the data such as bias subtraction, wavelength calibration and recti fication. A unique background subtraction procedure is developed to disentangle scattered Jovian reflection and the torus. These observations were made in conjunction with JAXA's Hisaki mission, the HST auroral campaign and infrared monitoring of volcanism to better understand how mass and energy are transported throughout the system.",

            "abstract": "We report on the preliminary results of spraying saltwater using a variant of effervescent spray atomization (ESA), for the purpose of producing salt nuclei for Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB). ESA is a well known industrial method, where air and water are mixed, to produce a choked two phase flow in a nozzle. The choked flow leaves a pressure residue at the nozzle exit which produces very efficient atomization. The resulting measured salt aerosol appears to be smaller than what is expected from current ESA theories. As measured with standard and well calibrated standard aerosol instruments, the distribution of the salt nuclei has an approximately log normal distribution with mean diameter of 60-80 nm and a GSD close to 2. Measured by electrostatic precipitation of the aerosol on a Si wafer and SEM observation, the median diameter is almost 1.5-2x as large, and this discrepancy has to date not been fully resolved.\nWhile the observed median diameter is perhaps somewhat on the low side for efficient conversion in the clouds, this nuclei distribution should be useful for preliminary field experiments. Assuming this distribution, with very simple means, a single small nozzle 150 um in diameter produces 5.3 x1012 nuclei/sec. A few hundred nozzles would be sufficient to produce 1015 nuclei/sec, requiring a power of only 25 kW, although errors on the tail end of the distribution could easily double this figure. To lift the spray, we envision the nozzles easily integrated in standard snowmaking machines, which are estimated by their manufactures to lift the nuclei from 50-100 m in the air, requiring another 20 kW of power. In cooperation with and under the scientific guidance of the U. of Washington, we propose to develop a set of staggered MCB experimental tests in Central California, first on land, and subsequently over the ocean. While this method may not be the ultimate one desired for full deployment (If ever), its simplicity, low cost and ease of deployment would seem to make it a great candidate for initial field experiments.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the rates and drivers of subsidence in deltas is essential to manage subaerial land in these naturally ephemeral settings. Subsidence in deltaic settings may be driven by deep crustal processes including isostasy and faulting, compaction of Holocene deposits, and anthropogenic activities such as groundwater management and fluid withdrawal. Here, we offer a new method to measure compaction rates and their spatial variability in the Mississippi Delta (MD) to test the null hypotheses that compaction increases seaward and is a major driver of subsidence.\nLate Holocene compaction rates are measured using the mouthbar-overbank stratigraphic boundary. This boundary generally corresponds to mean low tide level; therefore its present-day height relative to coeval mean low tide level is a measure of compaction since the formation of this boundary. The age of this boundary is established through quartz OSL dating, and Holocene relative sea level history in the MD has been well-established. The common occurrence of the mouthbar-overbank boundary in progradational fluviodeltaic successions in the MD makes it possible to study the spatial variability of compaction rates. We also compare displacement rates for this boundary directly north and south of two coast-parallel normal faults.\nResults show that late Holocene compaction rates in the Lafourche subdelta of the MD are on the order of a few mm/yr, significantly lower than historical surface subsidence rates for the region. Therefore, the elevated historical surface subsidence rates are likely the result of human alteration of the delta such as fluid withdrawal and groundwater management. Compaction rates do not increase seaward as generally assumed, and instead seem to be driven primarily by the thickness of sediments overlying the mouthbar sands. Thus, the highest rates are documented relatively inland. In addition, we do not find a significant increase in subsidence across normal faults in our study area, suggesting that the contribution of faulting to subsidence has been minimal over the past millennium.",

            "abstract": "This work describes a methodology used for large scale modeling of wave propagation from\nunderground explosions conducted at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) in two different geological settings:\nfractured granitic rock mass and in alluvium deposition. We show that the discrete nature of rock\nmasses as well as the spatial variability of the fabric of alluvium is very important to understand ground\nmotions induced by underground explosions. In order to build a credible conceptual model of the\nsubsurface we integrated the geological, geomechanical and geophysical characterizations conducted\nduring recent test at the NTS as well as historical data from the characterization during the underground\nnuclear test conducted at the NTS. Because detailed site characterization is limited, expensive and, in\nsome instances, impossible we have numerically investigated the effects of the characterization gaps on\nthe overall response of the system. We performed several computational studies to identify the key\nimportant geologic features specific to fractured media mainly the joints; and those specific for\nalluvium porous media mainly the spatial variability of geological alluvium facies characterized by\ntheir variances and their integral scales. We have also explored common key features to both geological\nenvironments such as saturation and topography and assess which characteristics affect the most the\nground motion in the near-field and in the far-field. Stochastic representation of these features based on\nthe field characterizations have been implemented in Geodyn and GeodynL hydrocodes. Both codes\nwere used to guide site characterization efforts in order to provide the essential data to the modeling\ncommunity. We validate our computational results by comparing the measured and computed ground\nmotion at various ranges.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore\nNational Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

            "abstract": "We present models and analysis of the magnetic field structure of three sigmoidal active regions (ARs). Sigmoids, forward or backward S-shaped EUV and X-ray emissions in the corona, are relevant as predictors of eruptive events such as flares and Coronal Mass Ejections. The regions were modeled using the Flux Rope Insertion Method, in which flux ropes, held in equilibrium by an overlying potential arcade, represent the sigmoids. The flux rope paths were inserted into a potential field following the filaments observed in 304Å. The models were then relaxed into a nonlinear force free (NLFFF) state using a magnetofrictional relaxation process.\nThe first region studied is NOAA AR 12017, which produced an X1.0 flare at 2014/03/29 17:35. The second is NOAA AR 11283, which erupted with an X2.1 flare at 2011/09/06 22:12. For these regions, we show detailed comparisons of Quasi-Separatrix Layer (QSL) maps and observed flare ribbons. The slow evolution of an unstable solution at the time of the eruption produces a set of QSL solutions. Comparison of the photospheric mapping of the QSL with the flare ribbons will be a good measure of how well we have captured the magnetic structure of the particle acceleration region with our simple NLFFF models.\nThe third is NOAA AR 11093. This region was a double decker filament composed of two branches over the same polarity inversion line. At 2010/08/07 17:55, the upper filament erupted with an M1.0 flare. This is the first time a double decker flux rope region has been modeled using these techniques. We show the interaction of the two inserted flux ropes and the evolution of the region through a series of NLFFF solutions to the evolving photospheric magnetic field.\nThis work has been funded by the NSF-REU solar physics program at Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, grant number AGS-1263241.",

It would allow a better understanding of how ash behaves and spreads in the atmosphere and therefore better estimate the location and propagation of the ash during an eruption. We tested a new gravity current model that allows us to study the transition from one flow regime to another in data plume growth data from several eruptions. It was found that previous asymptotic models of umbrella cloud growth only treat one part of the evolution of the cloud. The new model allows for the study of the duration of different regimes and the timing of transitions during growth of the umbrella cloud. It was found, by testing the effect of the different input parameters of the model, that the duration of release from the volcanic source has a larger impact than the drag force and the initial radius of the intrusion on the initial and downwind spreading.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen availability is important for biological reactions and the demand of oxygen is determined by the size of the organism. Few marine organisms can tolerate low oxygen conditions, but benthic foraminifera, a group of amoeboid protists that are highly sensitive to environmental factors, are known to live in these conditions. Benthic foraminifera may be able to live in oxygen stressed environments by changing the size and shape of their test. Low oxygen concentrations should favor smaller, thinner-shelled, flattened test morphologies. We hypothesize that the volume-to-surface area ratio of benthic foraminifera will decrease with decreasing dissolved oxygen concentrations. To test this hypothesis, we picked two calcareous species (Epistominella exigua and Cassulinoides porrectus) and one agglutinated species (Portatrochammina antarctica) from three sediment cores collected from Explorer’s Cove, Antarctica. Starting at the sediment-water interface, each core spans approximately 5-8 cm of depth. Profiles of dissolved oxygen concentrations were measured at the time of collection. At specific depths within the cores, we measured the three dimensions of picked foraminiferal tests using NIS-Elements. We calculated the volume and surface area of the tests assuming the shape of the foraminifers was an ellipsoid. The size trends of E. exigua confirm our hypothesis that the test volume-to-surface area ratios correlate positively with dissolved oxygen concentrations (p-value < 0.001). However, the size trends of the other species refute our hypothesis: P. antarctica shows no correlation and C. porrectus shows a negative correlation (p-value < 0.001) to dissolved oxygen concentrations. Thus, our results show that the change in size in response to variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations is species dependent. Moreover, we find that calcareous species are more sensitive to oxygen fluctuations than agglutinated species.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic beach berms (sometimes called artificial berms or artificial dunes) temporarily enhance the ability of beaches to withstand overtopping and thus guard against coastal flooding. However, the combination of a rising tide, storm surge, and/or waves may erode anthropogenic berms in a matter of hours or less and cause flooding [1]. Accurate forecasts of coastal flooding therefore demand the ability to predict where and when berms fail and the volume of water that overtops into defended coastal lowlands. Here, a two-dimensional numerical model of swash zone waves and erosion is examined as a tool for predicting the erosion of anthropogenic beach berms.\nThe 2D model is known as a Debris Flow Model (DFM) because it tightly couples flow and sediment transport within an approximate Riemann solver and is able to resolve shocks in fluid/sediment interface [2]. The DFM also includes a two dimensional avalanching scheme to account for gravity-driven slumping of steep slopes.\nThe performance of the DFM is examined with field-scale anthropogenic berm erosion data collected at Newport Beach, California. Results show that the DFM can be applied in the swash zone to resolve wave-by-wave flow and sediment transport. Results also show that it is possible to calibrate the model for a particular event, and then predict erosion for another event, but predictions are sensitive to model parameters, such as erosion and avalanching.\n",

            "abstract": "Tropical cyclone-induced storm surges are among the most destructive natural hazards that impact the United States. Unfortunately for academic research, the available time series for extreme surge analysis are very short. The limited data introduces uncertainty and affects the accuracy of statistical analyses of extreme surge levels. This study deals with techniques applicable to data sets less than 20 years, including simulation modelling and methods based on the parameters of the parent distribution. The verified water levels from water gauges spread along the Southwest and Southeast Florida Coast, as well as the Florida Keys, are used in this study. Methods to calculate extreme storm surges are described and reviewed, including ‘classical’ methods based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution and the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), and approaches designed specifically to deal with short data sets. Incorporating global-warming influence, the statistical analysis reveals enhanced extreme surge magnitudes and frequencies during warm years, while reduced levels of extreme surge activity are observed in the same study domain during cold years. Furthermore, a non-stationary GEV distribution is applied to predict the extreme surge levels with warming sea surface temperatures. The non-stationary GEV distribution indicates that with 1 Celsius degree warming in sea surface temperature from the baseline climate, the 100-year return surge level in Southwest and Southeast Florida will increase by up to 40 centimeters. The considered statistical approaches for extreme surge estimation based on short data sets will be valuable to coastal stakeholders, including urban planners, emergency managers, and the hurricane and storm surge forecasting and warning system.",

            "abstract": "In January 2013, a Mw 7.5 earthquake ruptured a segment of the Queen Charlotte Fault offshore the town of Craig in southeast Alaska. The region of the fault that slipped during the Craig earthquake is adjacent to and possibly overlapping with the northern extent of the 1949 M 8.1 Queen Charlotte earthquake rupture (Canada’s largest recorded earthquake), and is just south of the rupture area of the 1972 M 7.6 earthquake near Sitka, Alaska. Here we present aftershock locations and focal mechanisms for events that occurred four months following the mainshock using data recorded on an Ocean Bottom Seismometer (OBS) array that was deployed offshore of Prince of Wales Island. This array consisted of 9 short period instruments surrounding the fault segment, and recorded hundreds of aftershocks during the months of April and May, 2013. In addition to highlighting the primary mainshock rupture plane, aftershocks also appear to be occurring along secondary fault structures adjacent to the main fault trace, illuminating complicated structure, particularly toward the northern extent of the Craig rupture. Focal mechanisms for the larger events recorded during the OBS deployment show both near-vertical strike slip motion consistent with the mainshock mechanism, as well as events with varying strike and a component of normal faulting. Although fault structure along this northern segment of the QCF appears to be considerably simpler than to the south, where a higher degree of oblique convergence leads to sub-parallel compressional deformation structures, secondary faulting structures apparent in legacy seismic reflection data near the Craig rupture may be consistent with the observed seismicity patterns. In combination, these data may help to characterize structural heterogeneity along the northern segment of the Queen Charlotte Fault that contributes to rupture segmentation during large strike slip events.",

            "abstract": "This contribution will present results from passive seismic studies of hydraulic fracture treatments in North American and Asian basins.\nOne of the key data types is a comparatively new surface-based seismic imaging product - “Tomographic Fracture Images®” (TFI®). The procedure is an extension of Seismic Emission Tomography (SET), which is well-established and widely used. Conventional microseismic results – microearthquake hypocenter locations, magnitudes, and focal mechanism solutions – are also obtained from the data via a branch of the processing workflow. TFI is accomplished by summing the individual time steps in a multidimensional SET hypervolume over extended periods of time, such as an entire frac stage. The dimensions of a SET hypervolume are the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the voxels, the time step (typically on the order of 100 milliseconds), and the seismic activity value. The resulting summed volume is skeletonized to produce images of the main fracture surfaces, which are known to occupy the maximum activity surfaces of the high activity clouds from theory, field studies, and experiments.\nThe orientation vs. area of the resulting TFIs can be analyzed in detail and compared with independent data sets such as volumetric structural attributes from reflection seismic data and borehole fracture data. We find that the primary effect of hydraulic fracturing is to stimulate preexisting natural fracture networks and faults. The combination of TFIs with hypocenter distributions and microearthquake focal mechanisms provides detailed information on subsurface stress compartmentalization. Faults are directly imaged which allows discrimination of fault planes from auxiliary planes of focal mechanism solutions. Examples that will be shown include simultaneous movement on a thrust fault and tear fault and examples of radically different stress compartments (e.g. extensional vs. wrench faulting) stimulated during a single hydraulic fracture treatment.\nThe figure shows a TFI of a single frac stage in the Eagle Ford FmFm that is unusually symmetrical and smooth near the perforations. Color shows intensity of cumulative seismic activity (red = high, violet = low). Note that the energy decreases and the complexity increases as the frac quenches in the natural fracture system.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this work is to investigate subsurface controls on the distribution of vegetation at two sites located within the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory (CZO). Located in southwestern Idaho, the Reynolds Creek CZO extends over a steep elevation-climatic gradient (mean annual precipitation 250 - 1100 mm/yr, mean annual temperature 5.5 °C to 11°C). The existing, publically available hydroclimatic data are long-term and spatially extensive, including precipitation (>50 yr), snow course SWE (>50 yr), temperature (30-50 yr), soil moisture and temperature (>10 yr), and some soil depth data. Both sites we investigated were at elevation greater than 2000m, and both sites showed abrupt changes in vegetation with no surface expression of changes in the underlying geology. The first site, termed Dry Meadow (DM), consists of a grassy meadow that transitions from being saturated to the surface during the spring runoff to dry with a water table at a depth of 4-6m in the late summer. The grassy meadow transitions abruptly to sage brush dominated terrain with no significant change in elevation. The second site, termed the Aspen Grove (AG), shows an abrupt transition from dry grassy terrain to an Aspen grove along a constant, and low gradient hill slope. At both sites we acquired high density seismic refraction data (1m receiver spacing) along transects that ranged from 95 to 160 m. Additionally we acquired 107 m long electrical resistivity profiles in both dipole-dipole and Wenner arrays with 2 m electrode spacing. At both sites, both seismic and ERT data indicate a distinct and abrupt drop in depth to the top of the weathered rock surface of 10-15 m. These topographic lows in the bedrock may be either erosional or structurally controlled, but in either case create accommodation space for the accumulation of sediment and an altered groundwater distribution that can accommodate a shift in the dominant vegetation type.",

            "abstract": "In steep semi-arid areas like coastal Southern California, most nitrate export occurs during storm events. Observed data from the Santa Barbara Long term ecological research site shows that concentration and concentration-discharge relationships vary both throughout storm events and seasonally. Nitrate sources can be inferred from these data by comparing the arriving time of the nitrate concentration peak and that of the stream flow peak. For example, for small storm events in September or October after the long sever summer drought, nitrate concentration peak several hours earlier than stream flow peak, and may indicates the nitrate flux is from near-stream riparian areas. In contrast, storm events in the winter or early spring after a series of precipitation events tend to produce the nitrate concentration peaks several hours later than the stream flow peak, and indicates the nitrate flux is from hydrologically connected upslopes area. To model these dynamics, hydrologic models must be able to capture temporal shifts in hydrologically connected source areas as well as seasonal shifts in nitrogen availability associated with ecosystem biogeochemical cycling. We assess the ability of Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys), to reproduce the seasonal/multi-yearly nitrate’s export patterns and compare the success of different model implementations. Specifically we compare a new developed hourly time-step implementation versus a daily time-step model and a model implementation where lateral routing is based on the “fill and spill” hypothesis versus the more traditional approach based on subsurface transmissivity functions. We also compare behavior of different parameterizations of the 'fill and spill' approach, including comparing uniform and spatially heterogeneous storage capacities. Results highlight the importance of both the hourly time-step and the threshold based response of a “fill and spill” connectivity model.",

In this abstract we examine the intensity and spatial coverage of these newly formed particles in relation to cloud and the tropopause. We use a detailed aerosol model MAIA (Model of Aerosols and Ions in the Atmosphere) (Lovejoy et al., 2004; Kazil et al., 2007) constrained by observations to simulate aerosol evolution along modeled forward trajectories originating at locations where NPF was measured.

            "abstract": "Introductory Earth science classes can become more interactive through the use of a range of seismic data and models that are available online, which students can use to conduct simple research regarding earthquakes and earth structure. One way to introduce students to these data sets is via a new set of six intro-level classroom activities designed to introduce undergraduates to some of the grand challenges in seismology research. The activities all use real data sets and some require students to collect their own data, either using physical models or via Web sites and Web applications. While the activities are designed to step students through a learning sequence, several of the activities are open-ended and can be expanded to research topics.  For example, collecting and analyzing data from a deceptively simple physical model of earthquake behavior can lead students to query a map-based seismicity catalog via the IRIS Earthquake Browser to study seismicity rates and the distribution of earthquake magnitudes, and make predictions about the earthquake hazards in regions of their choosing. In another activity, students can pose their own questions and reach conclusions regarding the correlation between hydraulic fracturing, waste water disposal, and earthquakes.\nOther data sources are available for students to engage in self-directed research projects. For students with an interest in instrumentation, they can conduct research relating to instrument calibration and sensitivity using a simple educational seismometer. More advanced students can explore tomographic models of seismic velocity structure, and examine research questions related to earth structure, such as the correlation of topography to crustal thickness, and the fate of subducted slabs. The type of faulting in a region can be explored using a map-based catalog of focal mechanisms, allowing students to analyze the spatial distribution of normal, thrust and strike-slip events in a subduction zone region. For all of these topics and data sets, the societal impact of earthquakes can provide an additional motivation for students to engage in their research.\nwww.iris.edu",

            "abstract": "Recent analyses show that many GHG stabilization scenarios require technologies that permanently extract CO2 from the atmosphere –so-called “net negative emissions.” Among the most promising negative emissions approaches is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). The most mature options for CO2 storage are in sedimentary rocks located in thick sedimentary basins. Within those basins, CO2 can be stored either in depleted or depleting hydrocarbon formations or in so-called saline aquifers. In addition to the economic costs of bioenergy with CO2 capture, key to the success of and scale at which BECCS can contribute to negative emissions is the ability to store quantities on the order of 1 Gt per year of CO2.\nToday, about 65 Mt of CO2 per year are injected underground for the purposes of enhancing oil recovery (CO2-EOR) or for CO2 storage, the vast majority being for CO2-EOR. Achieving 1 Gt per year of negative emissions will require a 15-fold scale up of the current injection operations. This paper will review the conditions necessary for storage at this scale, identify what has been learned from nearly 2 decades of experience with CO2 storage that provides insight into the feasibility of CO2 storage on this scale, and identify critical issues that remain to be resolved to meet these ambitious negative emissions targets.\nCritical technological issues include but are not limited to: the amount of CO2 storage capacity that is available and where it is located in relation to biomass energy resources; identification of sustainable injection rates and how this depends on the properties of the geological formation; the extent to which water extraction will be required to manage the magnitude of pressure buildup; identification of regions at high risk for induced seismicity that could damage structures and infrastructure; and selection of sites with a adequate seals to permanently contain CO2. Social, economic and political issues are also important: including the support for and confidence in the projects by the local population; scale at which these projects are financially feasible; resolution of issues such as who pays and who benefits from these projects; and development of regulatory frameworks that are at the same time, environmentally protective and not overly burdensome.",

            "abstract": "Seasat-A was NASA’s first ocean observing satellite mission. It launched in June 1978 and operated continuously until it suffered a power failure 106 days later. It contained an altimeter (ALT), scatterometer (SASS), SAR, microwave radiometer (SMMR), and a visible/infrared radiometer (VIRR). These instruments allowed Seasat to measure sea surface height, ocean winds and both brightness and sea surface temperatures. The data, except for the SAR, are archived at PO.DAAC. Since these are the only oceanographic satellite data available for this early period of remote sensing, their importance has grown for use in climate studies. Even though the datasets were digitized from the original tapes, the Seasat data have since still been maintained in the same flat binary format technology of 1980 when the data were first distributed.\nIn 2013 PO.DAAC began a project to reformat the original data into a user friendly, modern and maintainable format consistent with the netCDF data model and Climate Forecast (CF) and Attribute Conventions Dataset Discovery (ACDD) metadata standards. A significant benefit of using this data format includes the improved interoperability with tools and web services such as OPeNDAP, THREDDS, and various subsetting software, such as PO.DAAC’s HiTIDE. Additionally, application of such metadata standards provides an opportunity to correctly document the data at the granule level.\nThe first step in the conversion process involved going through the original documentation to understand the source binary data format. Documentation was found for processing levels 1 and 2 for ALT, SASS and SMMR. Software readers were then written for each of the datasets using Matlab , followed by regression tests performed on the newly outputted data in order to demonstrate that the readers were correctly interpreting the source data. Next, writers were created to convert the data into the updated format. The reformatted data were also regression tested and science validated to ensure that the data were not corrupted during the reformatting process. The resulting modernized Seasat datasets will be made available iteratively by instrument and processing level on PO.DAAC’s web portal http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov, anonymous ftp site, ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/seasat and other web services.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of neutral species densities in the upper thermosphere and lower exosphere remains elusive despite the analytical theories established by the pioneers of Aeronomy roughly fifty years ago, despite the evident requirements of Space Weather modeling, and despite the pragmatic reality of manned and unmanned spacecraft exploitation of the region. In fact, [O], [He] and [N2] have not been measured in-situ in the upper atmosphere since the era of DE-2, and then for only 18 months from 1981-1983 (near solar maximum). Prior to that, the Atmospheric Explorer program (AE-A launched in 1963, AE-E ended in 1980) provided the neutral density information upon which the MSIS model is largely based. No instrument has measured [H] in-situ, which is instead derived in MSIS by solution of the proton continuity equation.\nThe ExoCube satellite provides a long-overdue benchmark for the densities of significant neutral and ionized species in the upper atmosphere, on a global scale, for the Space Weather and Aeronomy communities. These will be the first in-situ global neutral density data since DE-2, including the first direct measurements of [H] using a mass spectrometer technique. Since roughly half of the total electron column content (TEC) arises from photoionization of H, reliable knowledge of exospheric [H] is a crucial requirement of realistic Space Weather modeling of TEC. To insure that this project has enduring impact beyond the projected two-year duration of the satellite mission, experimental interaction with ground-based ISR and optical facilities is integrated. The simultaneous collection of ion and neutral densities will facilitate the use of ExoCube data for studies of charge exchange processes. Overpasses with observatories will enable ExoCube measurements to be used as a constraint for retrieval of density information from forward modeling of ground-based observations. Presented here will be the first post-launch mission status and operations.",

            "abstract": "More than a dozen of aged biomass burning plumes (BBPs) from various sources in free troposphere were encountered during the aircraft-based NOMADSS (Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury and Aerosol Distributions, Sources and Sinks) field campaign from June 1 to July 15, 2013. HCN and CO were used as tracers to identify the BBPs; the ratio of n-butane to propane was used to determine the photochemical age of the BBPs, which was ranging from 5 to 15 days. Significant enhancement in HONO concentration, by 5-56 ppt, was observed with elevated NOx and particulate nitrate concentrations in these BBPs comparing to background air mass. High HONO/NOx ratio up to 0.5 suppresses the importance of NOx as HONO precursors. Further HONO and NOx budget analysis reveals that photo-recycling of particulate nitrate in plumes to NOx was the main chemical source of NOx with HONO as an intermediate. An implication of this recycling NOx source on O3 formation is demonstrated in the correlation of O3 and NOx in aged plumes.\n ",

            "abstract": "The internal structure of ophiolite complexes has long been used as a window into the inaccessible parts of the oceanic lithosphere and by inference, processes beneath spreading centers. However, even the best preserved ophiolite complexes have been tilted, folded, faulting and dismembered during post-spreading tectonic events. Some degree of reconstruction is required to restore ophiolite structures to their appropriate relative orientations in order to relate them to processes beneath spreading centers. A number of assumptions about ophiolite structures have been used to guide reconstructions including: lava flows (horizontal, especially sheet-like lavas), dikes in lavas and sheeted dike complexes (vertical and parallel to spreading centers), the contacts between major rock units (horizontal, analogous to the seismic structure of oceanic crust) and the mafic/ultramafic contact representing the geologic expression of the Moho (horizontal). Based in part on these assumptions the internal structure of rock units, metamorphic relationships, and the kinematics of faults and deformation fabrics are also inferred. The spreading direction is seldom constrained in ophiolites making it difficult to assess the geometry of asymmetrical features, such as the dip of dikes, faults, or igneous layering, relative to spreading axes. Observations from exposures of upper crustal rock units (lavas, transition zones, dike and upper gabbroic rocks) along major tectonic escarpments in oceanic crust formed at fast to intermediate rates, as well as the uplifted and glaciated Tertiary basaltic crust of Iceland, raise questions about several of the assumptions used in ophiolite reconstructions. Alternative reconstructions may provide new ideas about spreading processes.",

            "abstract": "Current theoretical climatology suggests three key climate processes – snow cover contribution to surface albedo, cloud cover prevalence and near surface water vapour – influencing the surface energy balance are expected to exhibit elevation-gradients in global warming-driven changes. These gradients are in turn expected to act as mechanisms contributing to EDW. This study examines the simulation of these mechanisms and their influence on projections of EDW in a dynamically downscaled transient perturbed physics ensemble (PPE). The downscaling experiment in question is the Hadley Centre Regional Model version 3 PRECIS configuration (HadRM3P) 25km simulation over the South Asian domain driven by the MetOffice 17-member QUMP (Quantifying Uncertainty in Model Projections) ensemble of the Hadley Centre Climate Model version 3 (HadCM3). Use of the multi-member PPE enables quantification of uncertainty in projected changes in climate variables – albedo, cloud cover, water vapour and near surface temperature – while the spatial resolution of a RCM improves insight into the role of elevation in projected rates of change.\nThis work specifically addresses the Regional Climate Model (RCM) representation of expected EDW mechanisms by calculating vertical profiles (relative to modelled surface elevation of downscaled grid cells) for changes in:\n[1] albedo, i.e. the ratio of future to control period albedo where albedo is calculated as one minus the ratio of absorbed surface solar radiation to incoming surface solar radiation;\n[2] shortwave cloud radiative effect (CRE), i.e. the ratio of future to present CRE where CRE is calculated as incoming “top of atmosphere” shortwave radiation minus incoming surface shortwave radiation;\n[3] near surface water vapour -- in terms of specific humidity (Qair) – and related down-welling longwave radiation, but because previous EDW research has shown non-linearity in Qair radiative influence, changes in Qair is evaluated in both delta (additive) and relative (multiplicative) terms.\nThe RCM representation of expected EDW mechanisms will be placed in the context of model validation and bias assessment using a combination of global meteorological reanalyses and available local observations.",

            "abstract": "Microcystin, a hepatotoxin produced by the cyanobacteria Microcystis, has been known to contaminate fresh water sources around southern California. Ingesting this toxin can cause death in animals and illnesses in humans, which has promoted the World Health Organization (WHO) and California to establish preliminary guidelines for microcystin concentrations in the water (1 µg/L in drinking water and 0.8 µg/L for recreational exposure respectively). However, very few studies have been done to assess the effects of this toxin when aerosolized, even though Fitzgeorge et al. (1994) describes the toxin as potentially 12x more deadly if inhaled rather than swallowed. This project aimed to identify areas with the potential for high microcystin concentrations using airborne data and then model the potential atmospheric transport of the toxin. After applying the Master Scattering Line Height (MSLH) and Aphanizomenon-Microcystis Index (AMI) algorithms to Airborne Visible/ Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), multiple water bodies were identified as having the potential for Microcystis, although many of the observed water bodies had AMI values indicating the presence of Aphanizomenon-- a non-toxic cyanobacteria that is usually present before Microcystis. A relationship between toxins and biomass was developed and used to estimate the amount of phycocyanin and dissolved microcystin in the water. Brevetoxin, common in the Florida 'red tides', was used as a proxy to estimate the amount of microcystin that becomes aerosolized given a known water concentration (Kirkpatrick et al, 2010). These amounts were then run and averaged with the HYSPLIT dispersion model for 4 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours. The final results show that most areas are exposed to less than 0.1 ng/m^3 after 4 hours. As a worst case scenario, one final model was run to show the exposure amount when Pinto Lake was observed to have the maximum amount of microcystin recorded in 2007. The results show that after 4 hours, some areas were exposed to values greater than 10.0 ng/m^3. These results highlight the potential widespread presence of freshwater toxins in populated areas of California, and the potential for chronic exposure at some distance from the source.",

            "abstract": "Soils are the largest terrestrial carbon (C) reservoir, storing 2,300 Gt C globally, with the largest C input allocated by plant roots. Many root-derived C inputs are low molecular weight compounds (exudates), although complex C compounds from sloughed off cells and decaying roots also contribute precursors to the soil organic matter (SOM) pool. Root-derived compounds are metabolized by microorganisms, using extracellular enzymes to degrade the more complex C compounds. Thus, products of microbial use of root C may be free in soil solution or occur as microbial cell material. Products of root decomposition are stabilized in soil when C compounds are protected from degradation by (i) chemical recalcitrance, (ii) physical protection by aggregation, or (iii) physical-chemical protection by sorption to mineral surfaces. Previous studies show that sorption of SOM to soil minerals can stabilize C compounds for up to thousands of years. We examined the influence of soil mineralogy on sorption of root-derived C. We hypothesized that differences in specific surface area (SSA) and chemical reactivity of four mineral types: goethite, kaolinite, quartz, as well as native minerals extracted from field soil, are significant controls on the rate, quantity, and composition of mineral-sorbed SOM. Soils were collected at the UC Hopland Research and Extension Center in Hopland, CA and planted in soil microcosms with the common annual grass A. barbata; seeds collected from the field site. Microcosms were incubated in a sealed chamber under 13CO2 (99 atom%) for 8 weeks. Plant photosynthesized-C is allocated to the soil via roots, and with the 13C label, allows us to trace the fate of plant-derived C in the soil. Minerals, which were isolated in 18 μm mesh to exclude roots but not microorganisms, were extracted and measured for total C and 13C atom% after a 12 week growing season of A. barbata. Preliminary FTIR and 13C-NMR analysis show differences in the chemical composition of mineral-associated SOM. Understanding the pathway through which SOM is first stabilized by mineral-association in soils, and the influence of soil mineralogy on that pathway, may improve models of soil C cycling and climate change predictions for soil C pools.",

Water column studies were conducted in 2011 and 2014 to complement magnetic, seismic, bathymetric and heat flux surveys, respectively. Results from the heat flow survey indicate that Lake Rotomahana is getting warmer relative to historic measurements, with individual stations within the lake releasing heat in excess of 60 Watts/m2. Helium sources are found at the lake floor at depths of ~50 meters and ~100m. Helium concentrations below 50 m depth have increased with high statistical significance over the three years between surveys and represent some of the highest concentrations ever measured at 6x107 ccSTP/g with an end-member 3He/4He value of 7.1 Ra. Hydrothermal activity comprises a significant portion of the inputs to Lake Rotomahana, as evidenced by δD and δ18O values, as well as ratios of conservative elements such as boron and chloride. Waters collected from lakeshore hot springs show geographic differences in geothermal source temperature using a Na-K geothermometer, with inferred reservoir temperatures ranging from 200 to 230°C. Lake Rotomahana was in part the focus of the 1886 Tarawera eruption; our results show both pre-eruption hydrothermal sites and newly created post-eruption sites are active and should be monitored for continued changes.",

            "abstract": "The more than 1000-km-long main branch of the mid-continent rift system (MRS) near Lake Superior and the Minnesota-Wisconsin border nearly took North America apart, but ceased rifting soon after it began. Thermal and magmatic events and subsidence- related sedimentary processes significantly changed the structure of the upper crust across and along the MRS. To map the depth extent and lateral changes in deep lithospheric structure related to the MRS, we estimated and studied receiver functions (RFs) from 82 SPREE (Superior Province Rifting EarthScope Experiment) broadband seismic stations and seven EarthScope Transportable Array stations. We inverted the RFs for depths of seismic-velocity discontinuities and shear-velocity structure of the crust. The RFs for each station are derived from the deconvolution of the radial component with the vertical component in the time domain (Ammon et al., 1991). Using a relatively high corner frequency in the deconvolution passband helps us resolve multiple layers within the crust. The most prominent feature of the RFs is the P-to-S wave converted at the Moho (Fig. 1), which reflects the contrast in rock properties between the lower crust and upper mantle. This Moho-generated P-to-S converted wave is very clear in RFs for stations outside of the MRS. Inside the MRS, the RFs are more ambiguous and suggestive of a basal crustal layer with shear velocities in between typical lower crust and upper mantle values. There is more variation among the RFs for stations within the MRS than among stations outside of the MRS.",

            "abstract": "As part of a collaborative effort with the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology, a virtualized seismic data acquisition and processing system was recently installed at the Centro Sismológical Nacional (CSN) at the Universidad de Chile for use as part of their early warning system. Using lessons learned from the Earthscope Transportable Array project, the design of this system consists of dedicated acquisition, processing and data distribution nodes hosted on a high availability hypervisor cluster. Data is exchanged with the IRIS Data Management Center and the existing processing infrastructure at the CSN. The processing nodes are backed by 20 TB of hybrid Solid State Disk (SSD) and spinning disk storage with automatic tiering of data between the disks. As part of the installation, best practices for station metadata maintenance were discussed and applied to the existing IRIS sponsored stations, as well as over 30 new stations being added to the early warning network.\nFour virtual machines (VM) were configured with distinctive tasks. Two VMs are dedicated to data acquisition, one to the real-time data processing, and one as relay between data acquisition and processing systems with services for the existing earthquake revision and dissemination infrastructure. The first acquisition system connects directly to Basalt dataloggers and Q330 digitizers, managing them, and acquiring seismic data as well as state-of-health (SOH) information. As newly deployed stations become available (beyond the existing 30), this VM is configured to acquire data from them and incorporate the additonal data. The second acquisition system imports the legacy network of CSN and data streams provided by other data centers. The processing system is connected to the production and archive databases. The relay system merges all incoming data streams and obtains the processing results. Data and processing packets are available for subsequent review and dissemination by the CSN. Such configuration enhances the overall system in terms of operation and maintainability.",

            "abstract": "Through spring the ice pack of the Beaufort Sea transitions from an extensive, consolidated ice state in late winter to a less extensive, weaker, marginal ice zone in summer. Using an array of autonomous instruments deployed in early April 2012 along the periphery of the multiyear ice pack, we highlight the seasonal evolution of ice drift as the ice pack broke up and individual ice floes entered a state of free drift. Coincident hourly observations of ice drift, surface winds, and ice mass balance were collected from early April to the end of July 2012 when the autonomous equipment failed. During this period ice drift speeds tripled, meander coefficients increased, ice drift became less correlated across increasingly small length scales, inertial oscillations developed along the ice floe trajectories and ice floes became increasingly responsive to surface winds, as indicated by increasing scaling factors and turning angles. Given that monthly mean wind speeds remained around 4 m/s throughout the study, we ascribe the seasonal change in ice drift characteristics to the seasonal mechanical weakening of the ice pack. Using a combination of in situ and remotely sensed observations we highlight the seasonal decline of local and regional ice concentrations, declining ice floe flexural strengths, substantial surface melt and bottom ablation and a seasonal tendency towards smaller floe sizes. Collectively these observations represent the mechanical weakening of the ice pack which fostered a seasonal increase in the responsiveness of the ice pack to atmospheric forcing.",

            "abstract": "Continental growth on a terrestrial planet acts as an insulator of the mantle heat flow, but it also favors heat loss, as the heat producing elements (40K, 238U, 232Th) are depleted from the mantle, and concentrated in continental crust. As a result, the thermal evolution of the planet strongly depends on the balance between insulation and heat production of the continental lithosphere. What effects will this balance have for the long term thermal history of the planet?\nWe built a parameterized thermal history model of the Earth, which takes into account the continental insulation on the thermal evolution of the Earth. Though the continental crust is generally thought of as a perfect insulator, this might not be entirely correct. Previous models have shown that mantle heat flux has a non-linear dependence to the continental surface area even though the insulating effect of continents can increase the average mantle temperature.\nOur parameterization includes the continental growth as maintaining the feedback between continental insulation and mantle heat flux. We do this with the scaling of heat flux parameters (Lenardic et al., 2005) and adding the continental crust heat flux component into an equation of heat flux from Sotin and Labrosse (1999). This model brings a more thorough understanding of the thermal evolution of the Earth by taking into account both the continental insulation and the mantle heat flux feedbacks from continental growth. This study will help us understand the thermal history of a terrestrial planet with continents. It will also help us understand the characteristics of heat loss of a terrestrial planet with the onset of continental crust formation.",

            "abstract": "Inverse modeling is essential for generating reliable subsurface flow and transport models that can inform groundwater resource management and aquifer remediation efforts. Multiple point statistics (MPS) based models, beyond the traditional two-point statistics based methods, offer an alternative to simulate complex geological features and pattern, conditioned to the measured conductivity data. Parameter estimation of MPS conductivity field, using measured dynamic data such as piezometric head data, remains one of most challenging tasks in inverse modeling. We propose a new local-global pattern matching method to integrate dynamic data into geological models. The local pattern is composed of hydraulic conductivity and piezometric head, sampled from joint training images that are composed both of spatial variations in conductivity as well as the corresponding simulated piezometric head. Subsequently, a global constraint is enforced on the simulated geologic models in order to honor the entire temporal profile of measured head data. Meanwhile, the training image models are refined on the basis of new accepted models at each time step in order to reduce the computational cost of pattern matching. As a consequence, the final suite of models preserves both the geologic patterns of variability as well as honor the dynamic data in a computationally efficient fashion. This local-global pattern matching method is demonstrated for modeling a two dimensional bimodal distributed heterogeneous conductivity field. The results indicate that the characterization of conductivity and predictions of flow and transport are improved when the piezometric head data are integrated into the geological models.",

            "abstract": "Land-use/land-cover changes at regional and global scales have been shown to play an important role in altering the climate, the hydrological cycle and the biogeochemical cycle. Urbanization is an extreme case of land-use/land-cover change through which natural surfaces are transformed into man-made surfaces. How urban areas affect regional and global climate and equally importantly, how urban areas respond to climate change at different time scales (ranging from seasonal to decadal) are critical areas of research. However, to date, most global climate and earth-system models that are used to investigate impacts of land-use/land-cover changes on the climate do not include an urban representation. Moreover, the dynamic growth and changes of urban areas (e.g., transformations of cropland to urban land) are not considered in any existing urban representations. In order to answer the questions raised above, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has developed a high-resolution global climate model with an urban representation that can simulate interactively both changes in urban environments and feedbacks of urban changes. In this study, efforts towards urbanizing the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) land model LM3 are described. In addition, historical simulations with the urbanized GFDL LM3 are used to investigate how the growth of urban areas has affected the near-surface climate in recent decades.",

            "abstract": "Semi-direct radiative forcing of climate occurs when interactions between aerosols and radiative fluxes in the atmosphere yield a dynamical response in clouds. Semi-direct forcing is typically thought to be a positive radiative forcing whereby soot and biomass burning aerosols absorb sunlight and burn-off clouds. However, a negative semi-direct forcing is suspected in at least two regimes, the summertime Southeast Atlantic Ocean and the wintertime North Indian Ocean, where the heating profile by aerosol absorption by solar radiation is elevated above the elevation of the low clouds. Here we use a combination of satellite data and a model simulation to further characterize the signature of semi-direct radiative forcing in these two locations and elsewhere on the globe. We apply CERES albedos, Calipso profiles of aerosol extinction and cloud-top altitude, and a simulation with the Goddard Earth Observing System Model version 5 (GEOS-5) Earth system model with meteorology constrained by MERRA and an assimilation of MODIS AOT (MERRAero). to quantify the vertical heating profile by aerosols under clear and cloudy skies. We seek to determine: (1) where aerosol heating by soot and biomass burning aerosol is occurring; (2) where vertically in the column the heating is occurring relative to the observed level of low cloud development; and (3) whether the variations of albedo with aerosol forcing suggest a positive, negative, or inconclusive semi-direct radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "Thallium (Tl) isotopes are an emerging proxy with the potential to track surficial redox processes. To date Tl isotopes have not been extensively explored for the entire range of redox condition in the modern ocean. Thallium has a relatively short residence time, ~20 thousand years, however new and existing seawater data shows that the modern, dominantly oxic, ocean remains conservative with respect to concentration and isotopes. Past studies have shown that there are only two geologic processes that impart a large isotopic fractionation (1) adsorption onto manganese oxides and (2) low temperature oceanic crust alteration. However, for relatively short term redox events it is reasonable to assume that the dominate isotope fractionation process is associated with manganese oxide precipitation. We present new water column and sediment, authigenic and detrital, Tl isotope data from the Black Sea and Cariaco Basins – the largest permanently anoxic basins in the modern ocean. Preliminary authigenic sediment data from these anoxic basins suggest these settings effectively capture the seawater value. Combining new and existing oxic open ocean data along with calculated fluxes constrain the mass balance of Tl, which shows the ability to fingerprint the global extent of manganese oxide burial and thus infer the extent of oxic seafloor burial.\nCombining thallium isotopes with other reliable paleoredox proxies such as molybdenum (Mo) isotopes and can help to elucidate global redox events. We have employed a quantitative model to explore the possible utility of multiple isotope systems such as the links between Mo and Tl isotopes. As a case study, we have modeled Tl and Mo isotopes during the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event where thallium isotopes in early diagenetic pyrite and have shown the potential to record excursions in the local and/or possibly global burial of manganese oxides. This modeling exercise has shown that Tl isotopes lend insight into the global marine oxic burial flux of metals during oceanic anoxic events and helps to explain variations in other elemental systems.",

REX samples and records in two polarizations both total RF power in a 4.5 MHz bandwidth, and radio signal waveforms in a narrow, 1.25 kHz band. During the encounter, and at closest approach to Pluto, the spacecraft's high gain antenna (HGA) will scan Pluto's equatorial latitudes, intercepting the specular zone, a region near Pluto's limb that geometrically favors reflection from the earth's direction. At the same time, a powerful 80 kW uplink beacon will have been transmitted from earth by the DSN to arrive at Pluto during spacecraft closest approach. Reflection from the specular zone is expected to be sufficiently strong to observe the bistatic uplink in the REX narrowband record. Measurements in both polarizations will then be combined to yield surface reflectivity, roughness and limits on the dielectric constant in the specular zone.",

As well, there is growing evidence that the partitioning of water-soluble organic gases to particle-phase liquid water and their subsequent condensed-phase reactions can form additional SOA to that formed by more traditional mechanisms. While previous studies have investigated the formation of isoprene SOA under a range of relative humidity (RH) conditions, the role of particle-phase liquid water in SOA formation remains unclear. The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of particle-phase liquid water on isoprene SOA yield. SOA was generated from the OH oxidation of isoprene at RH 75% in the presence of either effloresced (i.e. dry) or deliquesced (i.e. wet) ammonium sulfate (AS) particles. Results suggest that SOA yield is enhanced for wet AS seed particles. The effects of particle acidity on SOA formation will be presented as well. These experimental results demonstrate the importance of particle-phase liquid water on the uptake of volatile organic gases and their contributions to SOA formation.",

            "abstract": "Soils of the northern permafrost regions store 50% (1672 Pg) of the world’s belowground organic carbon (C). Peatlands within this region store 277 Pg as soil C and often occur as a mosaic of wetland types, each with variable sensitivity to climate change. Permafrost thaw further increases landscape heterogeneity in peatland structure and C function. While end-member stages such as fully intact or fully thawed permafrost are well studied in peatlands, C fluxes are not well constrained in transitional thaw stages that also cover a significant area of these ecosystems. Moreover, changes in the environmental correlates of C fluxes, due to thaw, are not well described and are vital to modeling future changes to C storage of permafrost peatlands. We used 10 thaw stages in a sub-arctic peatland as a space for time substitution to measure changes in CH4 and CO2 fluxes and their correlates. Growing season mean CH4 fluxes showed a large range across the thaw gradient, increasing with thaw, from -1.1 to 370.2 mg CH4 m-2 d-1. CO2 fluxes were highly variable along the thaw gradient with GPMAX (maximum gross photosynthetic CO2 capture at maximum photosynthetically active radiation; PAR) ranging from 2.4 to 8.2 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1. Across the site, we found significant relationships of C fluxes with the correlates: water table depth, thaw depth, temperature, PAR, vascular green area and water chemistry parameters. Within individual thaw stages, strengths of bivariate environment-C flux correlations changed inconsistently as the thaw progressed. A notable exception, temperature sensitivity of CH4 fluxes, increased linearly with thaw, suggesting a shift from substrate to temperature limitation. However, C fluxes have multiple and interactive controls that are not adequately described by bivariate analyses. We found that interactive effects on C fluxes changed variably along the thaw gradient, showing that transitional stage dynamics differ unpredictably from adjacent or end-member stages. Our results suggest that transitional stages contribute to the large variability of C fluxes in a thawing landscape and may require variable parameterization in models estimating C fluxes from abiotic and biotic controls.",

Here, ENSO teleconnections to snow-fraction, wet-day frequency and temperature, and air-mass type (using Sheridan’s synoptic classification), as well as to average temperature and precipitation, were evaluated at weather stations across the Pacific Northwest. The analysis was performed separately for early (October/November), middle (December/January) and late (February/March) portions of the cool-season. The stability of these relationships over time was also evaluated. Currently, ENSO has the strongest and most widespread influence on PNW weather late in the cool season, with some effect in the autumn, but little detectable impact in the mid-winter. Earlier in the 20th century, the autumn peak in ENSO influence was somewhat more pronounced and the spring somewhat less. There were also modest geographic differences in teleconnection patterns, such as a region-wide response in average February-March temperature, but more localized effects on wet-day temperature. Geographic and seasonal distinctions in teleconnections to weather and climate could drive important differences in ecological and hydrological outcomes. This type of daily-level analysis may be useful in meeting the needs of stakeholders interested in using teleconnections for seasonal planning, but who may need more seasonally specific information or non-standard variables. However, this study also demonstrates the need for a thorough understanding of teleconnection spatial patterns, seasonal variability, and temporal flexibility when they are being presented to stakeholders as a decision-making tool.",

            "abstract": "The nature, timing and cause(s) of the Earth’s second oxygenation event are widely debated. It has been argued that there was a single pronounced rise in atmospheric oxygen toward present levels in the Late Neoproterozoic, which in turn triggered the evolution of animals. Here we suggest a more complex co-evolutionary scenario, with fluctuations in ocean and atmosphere oxygenation in the Late Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic caused partly by the evolution of animals, followed by a pronounced rise of atmospheric oxygen to present levels later in the Paleozoic caused by the rise of land plants.\nCurrent geochemical evidence suggests some parts of the deep oceans became oxygenated during the Ediacaran, but there was subsequent de-oxygenation of the ocean during the Cambrian that may have persisted into the Ordovician. Only later in the Paleozoic is there evidence for widespread oxygenation of the deep ocean, together with charcoal indicating atmospheric oxygen had approached present levels.\nThe limited Neoproterozoic oxygenation of the ocean could be explained by the evolution of filter-feeding sponges removing oxygen demand from the water column and encouraging a shift from cyanobacteria to faster-sinking eukaryotic algae, which transferred oxygen demand to greater depths and into sediments. The resulting oxygenation of shelf bottom waters would have increased phosphorus removal from the ocean thus lowering global productivity and oxygen demand in a positive feedback loop encouraging ocean oxygenation [1].\nThe subsequent Cambrian de-oxygenation of the ocean could be explained by the evolution of bioturbating animals oxygenating the sediments and thus lowering the C/P burial ratio of organic matter, reducing organic carbon burial and lowering atmospheric oxygen [2].\nThe later rise of land plants, selectively weathering phosphorus from continental rocks and producing recalcitrant high C/P biomass, increased organic carbon burial and atmospheric oxygen, finally producing a persistent, global oxygenation of the deep ocean [3].\nThus, the Earth’s protracted second oxygenation event culminated in the Paleozoic not the Neoproterozoic.\n[1] Lenton et al.

            "abstract": "The process of evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the earth system, driving key land-surface processes in the energy, water and carbon cycles. Land-cover (LC) exerts multiple controls on ET, yet the global distribution of ET by LC and the related physical variables are poorly understood. The lack of quantitative understanding of global ET variation with LC begets considerable uncertainties regarding how ET and key land-surface processes will change alongside ongoing anthropogenic LC transformations.\nHere we apply statistical analysis and models to a new global ET database to advance our understanding of how annual actual ET varies with LC type. We derive global fields for each LC using linear mixed effect models (LMM) that use geographical and meteorological variables as possible independent regression variables.\nOur analysis of the new database provides new insights into how ET varies globally, providing more robust estimates of global ET rates for a broad range of LC types. Results from this study indicate two major advancements are required to improve our ability to predict how ET will vary with global change. First, further collection of ground truth observations of ET is needed to fill gaps in LC type and spatial location identified in this paper. Second, LC types need to be de-aggregated into finer categories to better characterize ET, to reduce uncertainty and weakened strength to predictor variables, associated by aggregation of heterogeneous LC types into one group; this will require the development of higher-resolution LC databases.",

In Aug. 2013 an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) was deployed in 40 m of water off Cannon Beach in Yakutat, AK as part of the Yakutat area wave energy resource assessment. Over the course of the 1.5 year deployment, the ADCP will record area wave and current data in order to verify the area wave energy resource. Preliminary data analysis shows a vigorous wave field with maximum wave heights up to 16 m in Nov. 2013. In addition to the in-situ directional wave data recorded by the ADCP, a SWAN wave climatology spanning the past 20 years is being developed along with a simulation of the wave field for the near shore (5 m<depths<10 m) based on wave statistics provided by the ADCP. Technology studies at the TRTS include performance tests of a research debris diversion platform (RDDP) at protecting a 5 kW New Energy hydrokinetic turbine from river debris flows and to determine the effect of RDDP generated river current turbulence on turbine efficiency. Previous tests have shown that the RDDP effectively sheds debris, however, large debris objects can cause RDDP rotation about its mooring point requiring that a stable attachment between the RDDP and protected floating structure be in place to ensure that debris is diverted away from the protected structure. Performance tests of an Oceana hydrokinetic power turbine will be conducted in late August or early September, 2014 at the TRTS in realistic Alaskan river conditions of current turbulence, high sediment flow and debris. Measurements of river sediment concentration, current velocity and river stage will be made, and current turbulence will be derived. CFD simulations of the RDDP interaction with the river flow will be completed to compare current velocity and turbulence results, depending on the opening angle of the device. Study activities and results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "In the City of Los Angeles, groundwater accounts for 11% of the total water supply on average, and 30% during drought years. Due to ongoing drought in California, increased reliance on local water supply highlights the need for better understanding of regional groundwater dynamics and estimating sustainable groundwater supply. However, in an urban setting, such as Los Angeles, understanding or modeling groundwater levels is extremely complicated due to various anthropogenic influences such as groundwater pumping, artificial recharge, landscape irrigation, leaking infrastructure, seawater intrusion, and extensive impervious surfaces. This study analyzes anthropogenic effects on groundwater levels using groundwater monitoring well data from the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works. The groundwater data is irregularly sampled with large gaps between samples, resulting in a sparsely populated dataset. A multiple imputation method is used to fill the missing data, allowing for multiple ensembles and improved error estimates. The filled data is interpolated to create spatial groundwater maps utilizing information from all wells. The groundwater data is evaluated at a monthly time step over the last several decades to analyze the effect of land cover and identify other influencing factors on groundwater levels spatially and temporally. Preliminary results show irrigated parks have the largest influence on groundwater fluctuations, resulting in large seasonal changes, exceeding changes in spreading grounds. It is assumed that these fluctuations are caused by watering practices required to sustain non-native vegetation. Conversely, high intensity urbanized areas resulted in muted groundwater fluctuations and behavior decoupling from climate patterns. Results provides improved understanding of anthropogenic effects on groundwater levels in addition to providing high quality datasets for validation of regional groundwater models.",

Elemental stoichiometries in euphotic zone protists can be used as end-members in biogeochemical models for bioactive elements (e.g. Fe, Si) and can provide insight into relationships found in the deep ocean and sediments (e.g. Cd:P, Zn:Si) due to broad and organism-specific geochemical links. Though sub-euphotic zone (e.g. hydrothermal, margin-sourced lateral) inputs and processes are also interesting aspects of these cycles, biological incorporation of TEIs in the euphotic zone is, fundamentally, where “the rubber meets the road.” Using the 2013 Pacific GEOTRACES super stations and Peruvian coastal transect as ecological waypoints, we present and compare results from three methods for studying trace elemental composition of phytoplankton: single-cell synchrotron x-ray fluorescence (SXRF); weak chemical leaching (acetic acid/hydroxylamine); and total chemical digestion (HNO3/HCl/HF). This combination of techniques allows examination of taxon-specific trends in biotic stoichiometry across the Eastern Pacific and also provides traditional bulk chemical metrics for both biotic and bulk shallow particulate composition.",

            "abstract": "Colloids exert significant influence on subsurface hydrology, geochemistry, and microbiology. In particular, colloid deposits reduce permeability, triggering a reduction or realignment of flow. Since many subsurface processes are transport-limited, this reduction or realignment of flow, in turn, influences numerous chemical and biological processes. This work explores a conceptual model linking permeability with colloid deposit morphology, where deposit morphology is quantified by two metrics of the colloid deposit: (1) characteristic size and (2) fractal dimension. These two metrics are measured using static light scattering (SLS) within refractive index matched (RIM) porous media, into which a suspension of 100 nm carboxylate-modified polystyrene microspheres are eluted at constant flow. Scattering data are fitted with a two-parameter model that includes deposit fractal dimension, and with a three-parameter model that also includes deposit size. For each set of scattering measurements, the appropriate model is selected using the Akaike information criterion, and model errors are estimated using the bootstrap with 100 replicates. Results indicate two key findings. First, fractal dimensions generally decrease with time as additional colloids are eluted into the column, indicating a transition from more uniform to more dendritic deposits. Second, permeability reduction is associated with colloid deposits having smaller fractal dimensions, that is, with more dendritic and space-filling deposits. Modeling efforts are currently underway to correlate permeability with the underlying hydrodynamic and geochemical variables that determine colloid deposit morphology.",

            "abstract": "Bedrock, hydrology and microbial communities are primary contributors to sub-glacial chemical weathering and therefore mediate the chemical composition of bulk glacial outflow. Chemical weathering associated with glaciers has attracted attention due to the possible link between increased chemical weathering during glacial retreat and control of the marine radiogenic strontium (87Sr/86Sr) ratios [1-3]. Here we contrast the differences in strontium isotope (87Sr/86Sr) compositions of the dissolved load (DL) and suspended sediments (SS) from bulk subglacial outflows from three, northern hemisphere ice masses. We sampled from sub-glacial outflows draining geographically and geologically distinct glacial termini from the (1) the South, East and West of the Greenland Ice sheet (GIS), (2) the Juneau Icefield and (3) the Columbia Icefield. The diversity in regional outlet facilitates the comparison of glaciers with differing climate, size, hydrology and bedrock. The magnitude of offset in 87Sr/86Sr ratios between the SS and DL (Δ87/86Sr, ‰, = (87Sr/86SrSS - 87Sr/86SrDL)*1000) varies between -62 to +7 ‰ and shows a positive correlation with pH, regardless of differences in glacier size and bedrock lithology. Here we believe the magnitude of the offset between the DL and SS is due to variations in subglacial weathering environments driven primarily by residence times of both water and sediment within the glacial system, and secondarily by bedrock lithology. The most radiogenic Sr compositions (both DL and SS) are found draining the GIS (up to 87Sr/86Sr = 0.80716) indicating the GIS may have provided a significant source of radiogenic Sr to the oceans during times of deglaciation.\n[1] Armstrong, R.L., (1971) Nature, v. 230, p. 132-133\n[2] Capo, R.C., De Paolo, D.J., (1990) Science, v. 249, no. 4964, p. 51-55.\n[3] Vance, D., Teagle, D.A.H., Foster, G.L.

            "abstract": "We present a geochemical application for determining the decompression history prior to caldera formation through analysis of the first-erupted fractions of fall deposits for two voluminous eruptions: the 2.1 Ma Huckleberry Ridge Tuff (HRT; 2500 km3) and the 767 ka Bishop Tuff (BT; 650 km3). The BT is an archetypical example of a continuous explosive eruption, with the whole of the eruption inferred to have lasted ~6 days [1]. In contrast, the fall deposits at the base of the HRT contain evidence for intra-eruption reworking, interpreted as representing eruption breaks on the order of weeks to months [2]. We have analyzed volatiles in melt inclusions (MI) from the first stages of the fall deposits to track initial magma movement and conduit development, as diffusive loss of hydrogen species occurs on timescales ranging from hours to weeks [3]. MI from the initial 3 cm of the HRT deposit show considerable variability in H2O concentrations (4.4-1.3 wt.%) which we attribute to diffusive loss during syn-eruptive decompression. Using a diffusion model [4], the timescales for H2O loss by diffusion from the majority of MIs (T~800 °C) are on the order of 1-6 days, with some values approaching several weeks. However, fitting of diffusion profiles to transects of H2O and CO2 measured along reentrants (unsealed inclusions) provide timescales of final ascent between 1 and 3 hours [3]. These timescales suggest a two-stage depressurization history preceding, and in the earliest stages of, the HRT eruption. MI from the first 4 cm of the BT, however, present a narrower spread in H2O concentrations, from 4.3-5.9 wt.%. If the lower values are the result of diffusive loss, then the decompression timescales required (T~720°C) are as much as 1-2 months, suggesting that some parcels of magma experienced extended decompression before the start of the eruption. Current work incorporating BT reentrants and MIs over the full initial BT stratigraphy will show whether a two-phase decompression model is also necessary.\n[1] Wilson & Hildreth (1997), J Geol 105, 407.\n[2] Wilson (2009), AGU Fall Meeting, #V23C-2085.\n[3] Liu et al.

Quantifying the rates of the different processes has proved challenging due to the high degree of variability encountered in both field and lab settings. To determine the rates and mechanisms controlling long-term limestone weathering, we analyse a lidar scan of the Western Wall, a Roman period edifice located in Jerusalem. Weathering rates in fine-grained micritic limestone blocks are up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the average rates estimated for coarse-grained limestone blocks at the same site. In addition, in experiments that use atomic force microscopy to image dissolving micritic limestone, we show that these higher reaction rates could be due to rapid dissolution along micron-scale grain boundaries, followed by mechanical detachment of tiny particles from the surface. Our analysis indicates that micron-scale grain detachment, rather than pure chemical dissolution, could be the dominant erosional mode for fine-grained rocks in many carbonate terrains.",

            "abstract": "Coastal salt marsh ecosystems rank as one of the ecosystems which sequester the most carbon (C) in the world (Chmura, 2003; Mcleod et al., 2011). California hosts multiple small marsh ecosystems outside of the San Francisco Bay that are limited in geographic extent but still contribute significantly to global soil C. This study evaluates 11 marsh sites along the California coast for annual soil C sequestration rates using 14C, 137Cs, and 210Pb chronologies. Estimates of carbon sequestration for California over the past 100 years from this study average at 49 g C m-2 yr-1. Long term estimates of soil C generally are lower because of natural decomposition of organic C, but this study indicates a persistence of high C storage capacity for coastal marsh systems. These estimates provide valuable insight into the long term capacity for coastal salt marshes to mitigate climate change through sequestration of C.",

            "abstract": "Estuaries are important components of coastal ecosystem and function as dominant pathways of material exchange at the land-sea interface. The transport of terrestrial input through river inflow is controlled by physical process including tides, waves, and fresh water discharge. This study investigates net water and salt flux within Xiaoqinghe River mouth, a mesotidal shallow estuarine system (water depth < 8 m) exports substantial amount of nutrients and pollutants to the adjacent Laizhou Bay. Profile velocity and salinity are measured using ADCP and CTD through complete tidal cycles (25hours) in April, July and September 2013. The instantaneous velocity and salinity data are decomposed into time-averaged means and time-varying components based on the improved Kjerfve (1986) method to quantify the contributions of various physical processes. The results show that the freshwater discharge and tidal pumping are dominant processes of salt transport during the wet season and dry season, respectively, while both factors are almost the same during the normal season. The advective flux also determined the direction of the net salt flux. The remaining terms, which are dependent on the deviations from time-average means have a limited role in salt transports. The vertical shear flux tended to very small. There is a distinguishable difference between the transport of salinity and water for all three surveys, and also obvious separation character of salinity and water’s long-term transport during all three surveys. An imbalance of the salt budget across the river mouth is also observed. Overall, tidal pumping is the underlying process of salt transport while river discharge dominates its temporal variation. This study will make addition to scientific foundation for management hazardous contamination and best time to release of environmental flows during difference seasons.",

            "abstract": "We present a parallel goal-oriented adaptive finite element method for accurate and efficient electromagnetic (EM) modeling of complex 3D structures. An unstructured tetrahedral mesh allows this approach to accommodate arbitrarily complex 3D conductivity variations and a priori known boundaries. The total electric field is approximated by the lowest order linear curl-conforming shape functions and the discretized finite element equations are solved by a sparse LU factorization. Accuracy of the finite element solution is achieved through adaptive mesh refinement that is performed iteratively until the solution converges to the desired accuracy tolerance. Refinement is guided by a goal-oriented error estimator that uses a dual-weighted residual method to optimize the mesh for accurate EM responses at the locations of the EM receivers. As a result, the mesh refinement is highly efficient since it only targets the elements where the inaccuracy of the solution corrupts the response at the possibly distant locations of the EM receivers. We compare the accuracy and efficiency of two approaches for estimating the primary residual error required at the core of this method: one uses local element and inter-element residuals and the other relies on solving a global residual system using a hierarchical basis.\nFor computational efficiency our method follows the Bank-Holst algorithm for parallelization, where solutions are computed in subdomains of the original model. To resolve the load-balancing problem, this approach applies a spectral bisection method to divide the entire model into subdomains that have approximately equal error and the same number of receivers. The finite element solutions are then computed in parallel with each subdomain carrying out goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement independently.\nWe validate the newly developed algorithm by comparison with controlled-source EM solutions for 1D layered models and with 2D results from our earlier 2D goal oriented adaptive refinement code named MARE2DEM. We demonstrate the performance and parallel scaling of this algorithm on a medium-scale computing cluster with a marine controlled-source EM example that includes a 3D array of receivers located over a 3D model that includes significant seafloor bathymetry variations and a heterogeneous subsurface.",

Our goal was to understand how fine root structure enables sustained ecosystem metabolism through a summer of very limited moisture availability and high heat, and facilitates resource acquisition during the short spring period of high resource supply. An additional goal was to provide a basis for upscaling root biomass and soil carbon to the landscape scale. We sampled trees of different size and tree clusters via a stratified sampling scheme that accounted for spatial heterogeneity in root biomass and soil carbon with lateral distance from the tree bole, or cluster center, and soil depth. We upscaled these estimates using site-specific information from a lidar survey conducted in the same region over a 36 ha area in 2009. We found that fine roots and soil carbon are spatially heterogeneous in their landscape distribution in oak savanna habitat, and that they greatly increase with tree size and age. We also found that Q. douglasii possesses a dimorphic fine root architecture, uniquely suited to the region’s climatic constraints, and exhibits morphological plasticity among trees of different size, age, and physical setting.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown large differences in the humidity climatology of the upper troposphere (UT) region between global models and observations. Such discrepancies can lead to large differences in the water vapor feedback estimations between models, reanalyses and satellite observations, and therefore climate projection uncertainties. Global Circulation Models (GCMs) could also mischaracterize the middle troposphere moist convection leading to erroneous conclusions about the water vapor vertical distribution and horizontal transport. We observationally constrain the UT humidity by employing high accuracy (<1.0%) and high vertical resolution (100-200 m) Global Positioning System Radio Occultation (GPSRO) refractivity measurements. Preliminary results from GPSRO reveal a significantly drier tropical boundary layer than both ECMWF and MERRA reanalyses. In the middle and upper troposphere, GPSRO is moister than ECMWF but drier than MERRA. These features are more pronounced at equatorial latitudes. These differences could have greater repercussions with regards to the water vapor feedback estimation. Also, zonally varying distributions of relative humidity (RH) from GPSRO, MERRA and ECMWF were also correlated with precipitation measurements from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). We found latitudinal differences between maxima of precipitation and RH, which could imply that large-scale horizontal transport in the boundary layer plays a critical role to governing the coupling strength between precipitation and RH. The application of GPSRO data in constraining the underlying model physics will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "This research presents a novel perspective on college students and their risk perception in a fire prone US State; Idaho. Idaho was “top #1” in burned lands by acreage in 2012 with approximate 15% of all US burned lands; in 2013 “top #2”. Past studies have conducted surveys on residents in high wildfire risk communities to learn what factors make homeowners more likely to engage in mitigation activities and therefore increase communities’ resiliency. This research emphasis is on a population that deals with the threat of fire but is likely less invested through property ownership and other investment of risk; yet, equally threatened in quality of life. Are college students the left-out population in the ‘planning for wildfires’ and its communication process?\nMain hypothesis is that a college population will have a different perception and awareness (and therefore mitigation actions) than i.e. residents invested in the wild land urban interface (WUI). Dominant research methodologies in past studies are identified as surveys, focus groups, or interviews focusing on homeowners in fire prone areas that have witnessed wildfire or are exposed to increasing fire risk. Yet again, research on population that has no property ownership, investments at stake, and therefore no direct monetary values associated (but potentially non-monetary), is found little to none in these studies.\nThe university population based study and its findings offers a contrast to current literature related to these traditional residents surveys/interviews. The study’s survey and interactive spatial assessment of risk perception with allocation of perceived hazards zones promotes understanding of where risk is apparent for participants. Results are used to inform agencies such as campus emergency management, regional wild fire mitigation efforts, and to enhance public communication. Lessons learned include the challenges of a comprehensive inclusion process when mitigating for hazards and building resiliency in a region with development pressures.",

RBSP-ECT data products derive from the three instrument elements that comprise the suite, which collectively covers the broad energies that define the source and seed populations, the core radiation belts, and also their highest energy ultra-relativistic extensions. These RBSP-ECT instruments include, from lowest to highest energies: the Helium, Oxygen, Proton, and Electron (HOPE) sensor, the Magnetic Electron and Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS), and the Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope (REPT). We provide a brief overview of their principles of operation, as well as a description of the Level 1-3 data products that the HOPE, MagEIS, and REPT instruments produce, both separately and together.

The measurements at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) have further revealed that discrete and intense bursts of X-rays were closely correlated with the formation of leader steps during CGs [Dwyer et al., GRL, 32, L01803, 2005]. The mechanism of relativistic runaway electron avalanches (RREAs) in large-scale thunderstorm electric fields has been ruled out for this energetic phenomenon as it is not capable of explaining the observed energy spectra [Dwyer, GRL, 31, L12102, 2004]. On the other hand, Celestin and Pasko [JGR, 116, A03315, 2011] have shown theoretically how the large flux of thermal runaway electrons generated by streamers during the negative corona flash stage of stepping lightning leaders could instead be responsible for these X-ray bursts during negative CGs, and for terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) [Fishman et al., Science, 264, 1313-1316, 1994] during intra-cloud lightning flashes (IC). In addition to intense X-ray emissions, Stolzenburg et al. [JGR, 118, 2918-2937, 2013] have suggested that the impulsive breakdown associated with initial leaders during the initial breakdown (IB) stages of CGs and ICs can generate considerable amount of visible light. The purpose of the present work is to quantify the optical emissions resulting from the excitation of air molecules produced during the acceleration process of thermal runaway electrons in the highly inhomogeneous electric field produced around lightning leader tip region in negative CGs. For this purpose, a full energy range Monte Carlo model combined with an optical emission model is employed to simulate, from first principles, the dynamics of electrons in the energy range from sub-eV to GeV and the subsequent generation of optical emissions by the large ensemble of low- and high-energy electrons involved. We specifically investigate the geometrical and optical features of the fluorescence light produced as corresponding measurements could be used to diagnose the electrical properties of lightning leaders.",

            "abstract": "Solar wind electrons are expected to play an important role for energy transport in the solar corona and wind. Solar wind electron velocity distributions exhibit three components: a thermal core, a suprathermal halo, and a magnetic field aligned strahl, which is usually moving away from the Sun. The origin of these non-thermal distributions is unknown. Are such distributions already present in the solar corona or are they only a consequence of the solar wind transport in the interplanetary medium? The answer to these questions is of paramount importance to understand the origin of the solar wind. It requires accurate in situ measurements of the electron properties. Traditional electron analysers generally suffer from spacecraft charging and photoelectron perturbations, but the alternative method of Quasi-Thermal Noise Spectroscopy (QTN), which has been successfully used in various space plasma environments, is immune to these limitations. This method is based on the electrostatic fluctuations induced by the thermal motion of the ambient plasma particles, which can be measured with a sensitive radio wave receiver connected to a wire dipole antenna. As this quasi-thermal noise is completely determined by the particle velocity distributions in the frame of the antenna, QTN is a high-accuracy robust method for determining electron moments together with some non-thermal features. After a short review of the QTN method, we describe its recent developments and how it will be implemented on the upcoming missions Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus. New simulations of QTN measurements in the inner heliosphere are presented for typical expected corona, solar wind and ICMEs conditions down to 9.5 solar radii.",

From high resolution geochronology and sedimentology of laminated series accumulated on narrow shelf, we observed that anomalous structures such as slumps and discontinuities overlaid by turbidite deposits record the last giant Mw~8.8 earthquake and tsunami occurred on 1877 in the region. Once compared with the reanalysis of historical chronicles and seismological data, we suggest that only large magnitude events produce ground accelerations generating slumping or discontinuities.\nThe analysis of long (ca. 5.5 m) sediment cores together with high resolution seismic subbottom profile data allow us to infer the occurrence of several giant earthquakes in the last ca. 1600 years, with a mean recurrence in the order of 400 years. Under this scope, the Mw8.1 occurred this year off Pisagua-Iquique region, as other previous historic events (Mw7.7, Tocopilla, 2007; Mw7.6, Iquique, 1933), seem to be moderate earthquakes into a larger seismic cycle.",

In order to determine to strength of concrete as destructive, core is taken from concrete parts of the structure and uniaxial compressive strength test is applied in the laboratory.

Schmidt hammer test in situ and core sampling along with uniaxial compressive test are carried out in order to determine the strength of concrete in existing structures in Bornova district of İzmir. Seismic ultrasonic P wave velocity measurements in situ were also applied on the core. The concrete strength values obtained from techniques applied in study were compared and error values are determined. By seismic ultrasonic P wave velocity measurements with error value %5 strength of concrete is determined quickly without any destruction on structures studied.",

            "abstract": "Relocation of Iceland’s subaerial rift zones over the last ~20 Myr has controlled the formation of voluminous silicic magmas in an intra-oceanic setting. While partial melting of hydrated basaltic crust plays an important role in generating silicic magmas at on-rift central volcanoes in Iceland, little is known about the timescales involved in generating silicic magmas or the petrogenesis of these evolved melts. In situ zircon analyses (U-Pb and trace elements by SHRIMP-RG, Stanford/USGS; δ18O by ims 1270, UCLA; εHf by Neptune MC-ICPMS, WSU) from silicic magmas from the Árnes and Hafnarfjall-Skarðsheiði (HS) central volcanoes in northwestern and western Iceland provide potential end members for investigating longevity and geochemical variation. Silicic magmatism at both large (>20 km diameter) centers began ~2 Myr after their parent rifts relocated and ≥20% of the erupted material is silicic in composition; however, longevity and petrogenetic processes vary between Árnes and HS. U-Pb ages reveal a short-lived (0.5 Myr) silicic lifespan for Árnes (12.8-13.3 Ma) vs. ~1.5 Myr life for HS (3.8-5.2 Ma). At HS, zircon δ18O is lowest in older units (averaging ~1.8‰ at 5.2 Ma), progressively increases to 3.3‰ in the middle units and decreases slightly in the youngest units (2.9‰; δ18O 2σ uncertainty for all samples is ~0.5–1‰), suggesting a history of silicic magma generation through partial melting of hydrothermally altered crust, transitioning toward either a greater role for fractional crystallization of basaltic parent magma or a less altered source over the volcano’s lifetime. Árnes units’ δ18O are homogeneous within error (3.2–3.6‰) and show no age correlation, consistent with a simpler petrogenetic history. Hf isotopic data reveal a more strongly depleted mantle signature for Árnes zircons (εHf0 avg~12.3±1.7) than for HS magmas (εHf0 avg~11.4±1.5).",

            "abstract": "The identification and mapping of compositionally (olivine-/pyroxene-enriched), thermophysically (rocky), and morphologically (flat floors with lobate margins, no visible ejecta/central peak) distinct infilled craters over the majority of the martian cratered southern highlands coupled with the ancient formation age of floor materials (~3.5-4Ga) recently resulted in the interpretation that volcanic infilling was the likely responsible process. However, the source of this material is enigmatic, as no vents are observed and these deposits do not occur in association with any specific volcanic or geographic provinces, leading to the proposal that impact excavation-induced decompression melting of a mantle source may be responsible for the intra-crater materials.\nThe conditions under which impact-induced decompression melting occurs, if at all, are not well constrained. In this work, we present the quantitative modeling of this process by coupling the pMELTS thermodynamic model for silicate magmas to a CTH shock physics impact model with realistic rock rheology. Initial conditions are established for early to modern Mars with mantle potential temperatures (1250-1550˚C), surface heat fluxes (20-80 mW/m2) and radiogenic crustal heat production (1x10-10-1.0x10-12 W/kg) with a crustal composition of Adirondack class basalts and mantle composition following Dreibus and Wanke.\nEarly results (~80km lithosphere, 1350˚C mantle potential temperature) show ~5-7% excess melt generated at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary for large craters (e.g. 180 km). These impact events also create zones of high shear strain/fracture systems that propagate through the entire brittle lithosphere. In general the thinner lithosphere and higher mantle potential temperature conditions on early planetary bodies should produce more melt at a given crater size and allow for the translation of this process to smaller crater sizes like those observed on Mars. If pre-existing melt is trapped below a stagnant lithospheric lid, it may also be released through fractures created by the impact. Examining these processes through numerical modeling techniques provides the potential to constrain early planetary evolutionary models by placing constraints on mantle potential temperatures, lithospheric thicknesses, etc.",

            "abstract": "Summer (June-September) is usually considered as the season for high ozone. Owing to the emission reduction, long-term EPA surface ozone records show a decreasing trend during the summer over the US. However, the records also reveal increasing trends of concentration and variation of ozone during the spring and the fall in many regions of the US, indicating an extension of the ozone season. Here we analyze two cases of high monthly mean extremes over the Southeast: May 2007 and October 2011.We conduct a series of model simulation using the Regional chEmical trAnsport Model (REAM). Although doing a reasonably good job in general, the regional chemical transport model tends to underestimate the ozone by ~ 10 ppbv when relative humidity is low, indicating that a mechanism linking ozone and relative humidity is not represented in the model. The correlation between ozone and relative humidity is verified using 30-year ozone and meteorological data. Previous phytological studies in a controlled environment suggest that the stress under low humidity can stimulate trees to release more biogenic isoprene and this mechanism is not yet included in current biogenic emission algorithms such as MEGAN. Inclusion of this mechanism in the REAM model improves the model performance in the extreme years. We suggest that a drier condition in the future may be a key factor for the extension of the ozone season through the feedback of relative humidity on isoprene emissions. This feedback will also affect the production of secondary organic aerosols from isoprene oxidation.",

            "abstract": "Aerosols affect the global energy budget by scattering and absorbing sunlight (direct effects) and by changing the microphysical properties, lifetime, and coverage of clouds (indirect effects). One of the key challenges in quantifying the aerosol direct and indirect effects is to deep our understanding about the size distribution, size-resolved composition, and mixing state of aerosols. However, detailed information on size distribution and mixing state is often not available or incomplete in current climate models. Here, we incorporated APM into CESM. APM is a multi-type, multi-component (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, SOA, BC, OC, dust, and sea salt), size-resolved particle microphysics model. Online chemistry, up-to-date nucleation, oxidation aging of medium-volatile and semi-volatile organic gases, aerosol-cloud interaction with stratiform cloud, shallow convection cloud, and deep convection cloud are considered. The amounts of secondary species coated on primary particles, through condensation, coagulation, equilibrium uptake, and aqueous chemistry, are also tracked. Model results are compared with aerosol mass observed by IMPROVE/EMEP, vertical structure of global particle number from aircraft-based field campaigns, particle and cloud condensation nuclei number at ground-based stations, aerosol optical properties retrieved by several satellites. Model results can capture the major characteristics shown in these observations. With this model system, we find that global burdens of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, BC, OC from 2000 to 2100, under scenario RCP 4.5 where total radiative forcing is stabilized before 2100, are decreased by 44%, 50%, 43%, 40%, 40%, respectively. Dust and sea salt increase slightly. Global burdens of secondary species coated on BCOC, dust, and sea salt are deceased by 34%, 30% and 60%, respectively. Global averaged aerosol number in the lower troposphere (from surface to 3 km) is significantly decreased, especially for particles smaller than 40 nm. Although secondary particles (SP) are decreased from 2000 to 2100, aerosol number is still dominated by SP. Cloud droplet number in the lower troposphere is decreased 30% from 2000 to 2100. The impacts of the aerosol changes on cloud properties, precipitation, and radiative forcing will be discussed in detail.",

            "abstract": "The complexity of a catchment’s physical heterogeneities is often addressed through calibration via observed streamflow. As hydrologic models move from lumped to distributed, and Earth observations increase in number and variety, the question is raised as to whether or not such distributed observations can be used to satisfy the possibly heterogenic calibration needs of a catchment. The goal of this study is to examine if calibration of a distributed hydrologic model using soil moisture observations can improve simulated streamflow. The NWS’s Hydrology Laboratory Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) is used in this study. HL-RDHM uses the Sacramento Heat Transfer with enhanced Evapotranspiration for rainfall-runoff production and can convert conceptual storages to soil layers. This allows for calibration of conceptual parameters based on observed soil moisture profiles. HL-RDHM is calibrated using scalar multipliers of a-priori grids derived from soil surveys, with the premise that heterogeneity of these grids is correct. This assumption is relaxed to study the benefit of distributed calibration. Soil moisture measurements in the Turkey River Basin, which was equipped with 20 in-situ soil moisture sites for the Iowa Flood Studies campaign, were used for calibration of parameters related to soil moisture (i.e. storage and release parameters). The Shuffled Complex Evolution method was used to calibrate pixels collocated with in-situ probes based on soil moisture RMSE at point scale. Methods to allocate calibrated parameter values to remaining pixels include an averaging method, spatial interpolation, and a similarity method. Calibration was done for spring 2013, and validation for 2009 and 2011. Results show that calibration using stream gauges remains the superior method, especially for correlation. This is because calibration based on streamflow can correct peak timing by adjusting routing parameters. Such adjustments using soil moisture cannot be done as there is no strong connection between routing and soil moisture. However, calibration using soil moisture did improve simulated hydrograph bias and RMSE. This is paired with the benefit of improving the representation of the heterogeneous soil moisture state, which is not considered when calibrating with streamflow alone.",

In this work multivariate statistical techniques are used to assess the groundwater quality of the supply wells (30 to 40 meters deep) in the hidrogeologic region of the Ring of Cenotes, located in Yucatan, Mexico. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis are applied in groundwater chemistry data of the study area. Results of principal component analysis show that the main sources of variation in the data are due sea water intrusion and the interaction of the water with the carbonate rocks of the system and some pollution processes. The cluster analysis shows that the data can be divided in four clusters. The spatial distribution of the clusters seems to be random, but is consistent with sea water intrusion and pollution with nitrates. The overall results show that multivariate statistical analysis can be successfully applied in the groundwater quality assessment of this karstic aquifer.",

            "abstract": "Active gas venting occurs on the Vestnesa Ridge, an elongated sediment drift north of the Molloy Transform and just east of the Molloy Ridge, one of the shortest segments of the slow spreading North-Atlantic Ridge system. The crest of the Vestnesa Ridge at water depth between 1200-1300 m is pierced with fluid-flow features. Seafloor pockmarks vary in size up to 1 km in diameter with significant morphological features consisting of small ridges, diapiric structures and small pits. Detailed hydro-acoustic surveying shows that gas mostly emanates from the small-scale pits, where also hydrates have been recovered by sediment sampling. High-resolution P-Cable 3D seismic data acquired in 2012 show vertical focused fluid flow features beneath the seafloor pockmarks. These co-called chimneys extend down to the free-gas zone underneath a bottom-simulating reflection (BSR). Here, they link up with small fault systems that might provide pathways to the deeper subsurface. The chimney features show a high variability in their acoustic characteristics with alternating blanked or masked zones and high-amplitude anomalies scattered through the whole vertical extent of the chimneys. The amplitude anomalies indicate high-impedance contrasts due to the likely presence of gas or a high-velocity material like gas hydrates or carbonates. In most cases, the high-amplitude anomalies line up along specific vertical pathways that connect nicely with the small-scale pits at the surface where gas bubbles seep from the seafloor. We re-acquired the 3D seismic survey in 2013 for time-lapse seismic studies in order to better understand the origin of the amplitude anomalies and in order to track potentially migrating gas fronts up along the chimney structure. The time-lapse seismic analysis indicates several areas, where gas migration may have led to changes in acoustic properties of the subsurface. These areas are located along chimney structures and the BSR. This work provides a basis for better understanding of the temporal and spatial scales of subsurface fluid migration through vertical, focused fluid flow structures.

The purpose of this study is to verify if satellite thermal infrared radiation (OLR) anomalous signals can be found retrospectively in association with three major earthquakes in XinJiang province China (M6.9 of 02.12.14; M6.2 of 08.12.2012 ; M7.2 of 03.20.08) by systematically applying analysis of multi-sensor satellite thermal and ground temperature/humidity observations for the period of 2008-2014. Meteorological satellite data include NOAA polar orbit NPOES and Chinese geostationary satelliteFY2D. In-situ atmospheric data include NOAA data recorded near the Hotan (37°N 80°E) weather station.\nIn the case of M6.9 of 02.12.14 NOAA-18 OLR survey for January –February shows that the initial indication of building an atmospheric anomaly was detected in the period 20-30 of January (10-20 days before the main shock) and maximum reached on Jan 21 westward from the epicenter. The OLR reference field was built for the entire period of 2004-2014. FY2D OLR data show similar trend in detecting OLR signals by revealing anomalous value with persistency of more then 9 hours on Jan 31, 2014. The 2012 (M 6.2) and 2008 (M7.2) event shows similar OLR anomalies (the 2012 events has the smallest value) that were building near to the epicenter area, over the major Altyn Tagh fault lines within 10-15 days before the seismic event. This probably is connected with the gas release enhancement and additional flux emission and provides information about major fault activation in this area. The hourly in-situ observation show similarly in the air temperature increases for (strong for 2008 and 2014, weak for 2012) and the relative humidity drops, probably as the result of additional atmospheric ionization as observed before the three earthquake events.\nOur initial results suggest that systematic use of multi-parameters and multisensory observation of pre-earthquake anomalies, provides some additional tools for validation of the observed physical parameters associated with earthquake processes.",

However, global models of OA have shown large discrepancies when compared to the observations because of the limited capability to simulate secondary OA (SOA). For reducing the discrepancies between observations and models, recent studies have shown that chemical aging reactions in the atmosphere are important because they can lead to decreases in organic volatility, resulting in increase of SOA mass yields. To efficiently simulate chemical aging of SOA in the atmosphere, we implemented the volatility basis set approach in a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). We present full-year simulations and their comparisons with multiple observations - global aerosol mass spectrometer dataset, the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments from the United States, the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme dataset and water-soluble organic carbon observation data collected over East Asia. Using different input parameters in the model, we also explore the uncertainty of the SOA simulation for which we use an observational constraint to find the optimized values with which the model reduces the discrepancy from the observations. Finally, we estimate the effect of OA on climate using our best simulation results.",

            "abstract": "One of the outstanding problems in astrophysics is the origin of stellar coronae, winds, and, more generally, the ubiquitous existence in the universe of hot million degree (or more) plasmas. The solar corona and wind provide an accessible environment to understand plasma heating and acceleration, and this is one of the main goals of the upcoming NASA mission Solar Probe Plus, which will arrive closer to the Sun (10 Rs), within the acceleration region than any previous spacecraft.\nAlfvén waves, which can easily propagate along magnetic field lines from the cooler photosphere to the hot corona and above, are thought to provide a possible mechanism to supply the energy required to heat and boost the solar wind, through turbulent dissipation and pressure. In-situ observations show that a nonlinear cascade of Alfvén waves, mainly propagating outward, is taking place, and that it evolves with heliocentric distance. In spite of the well defined observational signatures, the evolution of such Alfvénic turbulence in the solar wind is still a matter under debate, as neither linear theory nor numerical simulations can account for the observed properties. In particular, the effects of the expansion of the underlying solar atmosphere are a crucial element which must be taken into account, since the observed decrease in overall rms energies is best accounted for by expansion effects.\nHere we present a model to study the dynamics of a plasma parcel embedded in a radially accelerating solar wind, all the way from the acceleration region to the inner heliosphere, called the Accelerating Expanding Box. This model takes describes the radial evolution of turbulence and structures as they are observed in the expanding solar wind in a relatively simple way. As a first application, we show how expansion affects the onset and the radial evolution of the decay of large amplitude Alfvén waves through interaction with magnetoacoustic waves, the parametric decay instability.",

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice is an important constituent of the global climate system and has undergone significant changes in recent years. Both a decrease in sea ice extent, especially over the summer months, as well as an overall thinning of the ice pack have been observed. Superimposed on the decreasing trend is considerable interannual variability which has proven difficult to predict, particularly when the variability deviates far from the trend. One of the challenges for model based seasonal predictions of sea ice is an accurate representation of sea ice initial conditions, particularly the distribution of sea ice thickness (SIT), for which the observational record is sparse. As a possible means of filling this gap and establishing an improved method for initializing SIT in the Canadian Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPS), this research aims to investigate how accurately SIT can be estimated in real time using better observed and physically relevant predictors. In this study sea ice concentration (SIC), sea level pressure (SLP), and combined SIC/SLP are used to construct a predictor-predictand model using maximum covariance analysis (MCA). The model parameters are determined over a period of 15 years prior to the initialization year, and an estimation of the SIT field is made by applying this statistical model to the anomalies of the predictor for the year of interest. Sea ice data from the Polar Science Center PIOMAS product are used to construct and test the model, and estimations of SIT over the period 1995-2012 are examined. Monte Carlo experiments are performed to test the statistical significance of the SIT prediction as a function of the predictors and how many statistical modes are retained.",

            "abstract": "The Minshan region, located along the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau north of the Sichuan Basin, provides an important natural laboratory in which to study the patterns of deformation and their relationship to mountain building at the margin of the plateau. The Minshan range is bounded by the Minjiang fault to the west and Huya fault to the east. Evidence from the Neotectonics sediments suggests that deformation along the western Min Shan may reflect the surface response to thickening of a weak lower crust at the margin of the Tibetan Plateau (Kirby et al., 2000). In 2014, two deep seismic profiles was carried out across the Minjiang fault (55 km long) and Huya fault (45 km long) respectively, supported by China geological survey project (No.1212011220260) and Crust Probe Project of China (SinoProbe-02-01).\nThe recording of seismic waves from 4 big shots (500kg), 100 middle shots (120 kg) and 400 small shots (36 kg) were employed. The geophones spacing is 50 m. The preliminary stack sections provide us a detailed deformation mechanism of the Minshan region for the first time. The result shows that: (1) The Huya fault section shows different reflection characteristics on the west and east flank. (2) The Moho reflection beneath the Huya fault, which appeared at 12-13 s two-way time, tilts from the east to the west. (3) The Minjiang fault shows as a series of thrust nappe in the upper crust. (4) A strong reflector appears in the middle crust of the Minjiang section at 8-9 s two-way times, and it dips down to the lower crust from west to east.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an extremely potent greenhouse gas that is produced naturally in the soil environment during both nitrification and denitrification. Chamber based techniques – adapted from other greenhouse gas research fields – have been used for many years to study soil N2O emissions. These chambers can provide estimates of gaseous fluxes, but some techniques have been shown to produce systematic bias. These biases have been well studied for more abundant greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, but a detailed understanding is lacking for N2O due to the technical challenges associated with N2O determination (e.g. low signal-to-noise ratio in gas chromatography (GC) measurements). Recent advances in laser technology enable N2O measurements to be made in real time with high accuracy and precision, allowing for quantification of potential systematic biases introduced by chamber systems. Here, we present a laboratory-based system consisting of a large gas reservoir with a perforated lid and variable-depth sand column that produces stable N2O fluxes, which can be used to benchmark chamber performance. The theory and development of the system is outlined, along with three-dimensional model results that assess the system’s performance and potential limitations (e.g. proximity limitations for multiple chambers, effect of large chambers on the calibration system dynamics). Preliminary results from the InGOS multi-institution chamber benchmarking study are also presented, which will focus on chamber performance across a wide range of N2O fluxes and cross-chamber comparisons demonstrating the significance of measurement protocol and chamber design in error elimination.",

            "abstract": "Wind ventilation enhances exposure of suspended, canopy-captured and corniced snow to subsaturated air and can significantly increase sublimation rate. Although sublimation rate may be high for highly ventilated snow this snow regime represents a small fraction snow that resides in a basin potentially minimizing its influence on snow mass balance. In contrast, the vast majority of a seasonal snowpack typically resides as poorly ventilated surface snow. The sublimation rate of surface snow is often locally so small as to defy direct measurement but regionally pervasive enough that the integrated mass loss of frozen water across a basin may be significant on a seasonal basis. In a warming climate, sublimation rate increases even in subfreezing conditions because the equilibrium water vapor pressure over ice increases exponentially with temperature. To better understand the process of wintertime surface snow sublimation we need to quantify the depth to which turbulent and topographically driven pressure perturbations effect air exchange within the snowpack. Hypothetically, this active layer depth increases the effective ventilated snow surface area, enhancing sublimation above that given by a plane, impermeable snow surface. We designed and performed a novel set of field experiments at two sites in the Oregon Cascades during the 2014 winter season to examine the spectral attenuation of pressure perturbations with depth for dense snow as a function of turbulence intensity and snow permeability. We mounted a Campbell Scientific Irgason Integrated CO2 and H2O Open Path Gas Analyzer and 3-D Sonic Anemometer one meter above the snow to capture mean and turbulent wind forcing and placed outlets of four high precision ParoScientific 216B-102 pressure transducers at different depths to measure the depth-dependent pressure response to wind forcing. A GPS antenna captured data acquisition time with sufficient precision to synchronize a Campbell Scientific CR-3000 acquiring pressure data with a CR-1000 data logger acquiring winds at 20Hz. Snow permeability was measured both acoustically and empirically using measured grain size and density measurements. Wind perturbation and pressure correlations describe the functional dependence of above surface wind forcing on subsurface pressure perturbation response.",

Four different statistical approaches: Cumulative Distribution Function, β0 Parameter, Chi-Square Variance Test, and inter quartile range (IQR) are applied to know the statistical behavior of the Refractivity Gradient and thus the propagation conditions in the atmosphere. It is seen that atmospheric refractivity gets modified from 8 to 4 days prior to the earthquake around the epicenter exceeding the confidence level, β0 parameter also increases for the month of occurrence of the Earthquake indicating anomalous propagation conditions.",

            "abstract": "Arctic wetlands are currently net sources of atmospheric CH4. CH4 emissions in Arctic tundra vary widely in space and time, with proximate controls—competing decomposition processes, substrate availability, CH4 oxidation, and CH4 transport—dependent on local climate, soil, hydrology, and biology. These complex controls and high spatial and temporal variability make it difficult to characterize current CH4 processes and predict their responses to climate change. We ask: (1) how do metabolic CH4 production pathways and oxidation rates vary across spatial and temporal gradients in the Arctic, and (2) how do these subsurface processes relate to surface greenhouse gas fluxes? In polygonal tundra in Barrow, Alaska, we sampled from a gradient of topographic features and subsurface ice properties, from areas with large, intact ice wedges and ice-rich permafrost (low polygons) and areas with smaller, degraded ice wedges and lower permafrost ice contents (flat/high polygons). 5 times in 2012 and 2013, we measured surface CH4 and CO2 fluxes, soil pore space concentrations of CH4, DIC, and N2O at 3 depths, stable isotope abundances of CH4 and DIC, and soil moisture and temperature. We find that surface greenhouse gas fluxes and CH4 production pathways vary between geomorphic features. Low polygons have high CH4 fluxes (~200 nm/m2s) and carbon isotope compositions typical of acetate cleavage, and flat/high polygons have low or negative CH4 fluxes and isotopic signatures typical of CO2 reduction. High dissolved CH4 concentrations at depth and 13C enrichment of shallow CH4 suggest CH4 oxidation controls surface efflux in upland features, while dual isotope measurements (D/H and 13C/ 12C) indicate shifting CH4 production pathways with depth, with acetate cleavage more important at shallower depths. Among distinct sub-features within each polygon type, we find that CH4 processes, relative oxidation rates, and surface emissions depend on subsurface ice properties in ways that cannot be explained by surface soil moisture and temperature measurements alone. As part of the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment (NGEE-Arctic), this study’s results will be integrated with a broad range of measurements, with the goal of improving regional-scale models.",

            "abstract": "The result of volcanic ash transport simulation strongly depends on an eruption column model, that gives a profile of discharging rate of ash particles, for a predictability of dispersion of ash particles. Simple eruption column models, such as proposed by Suzuki (1983), have been adopted in volcanic ash transport simulations for its simplicity and convenience. However, such a model sometimes brings erroneous results especially when an environmental wind field considerably affects the behavior of eruption column. The distortion of eruption column and enhancement of turbulent mixing due to wind shear should be taken into account in an eruption column model for the improvement of its applicability.\nThe authors have conducted the three-dimensional simulation of volcanic plume for the 2011 Shinmoe-dake eruption, assuming the vertically-sheared wind field actually observed in the event, and have taken statistics of the locations and mobile vectors of the ash particles getting out of the simulated volcanic plume to establish the profile of discharging rate. The resulted profile is distinctly different from that based on a usual eruption column model. The new profile is characterized by the relatively large discharge of micron-sized ash particles from the middle level of the plume, comparing to the usual one. The authors plan to validate the new model in the simulation of long-range transport of volcanic ash, based on satellite observation data. This work will be a basis for a future improvement of the volcanic ash fall forecast by Japan Meteorological Agency, which is established with the Suzuki’s model. The characteristics and validity of new model will be discussed in the presentation.\nAcknowledgement\nThis study was supported by the Earthquake Research Institute cooperative research program.\n",

Incorporating uncertainty with respect to both climate change and policy decisions is essential for projecting the evolving probability of coastal inundation and erosion, and the associated community vulnerability, through time.\n Through collaboration with a group of stakeholders in Tillamook County, Oregon, we are co-developing a scenario analysis and modelling tool to explore strategies that may reduce vulnerability to coastal hazards within the context of uncertainty and climate change. We use Envision, a spatially explicit multi‐agent modelling platform that provides a scenario-based, policy centric framework for examining interactions between human and natural systems across a landscape. Probabilistic simulations of extreme total water levels along the shoreline allow us to capture the variability of sea level rise, wave climate, and the El Niño Southern Oscillation under a range of climate change scenarios through the end of the century. Additionally, we explore a range of alternative futures related to management decisions and socioeconomic trends as defined with input from stakeholders. Here we quantify the relative contribution of uncertainty from both climate change and policy decisions in terms of multiple landscape metrics including damage to property (e.g. the number of buildings impacted by flooding and erosion). Quantifying uncertainty within the Envision framework will help to improve the usefulness of the model and determine the relative impact of policy and management decisions on the adaptive capacity of Pacific Northwest communities under a range of future climate scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Arctic permafrost ecosystems store ~ 50 % of global belowground carbon (C) and are a considerable source of atmospheric methane (CH4). Current estimates report that nearly 10 – 40 Tg yr-1 of CH4 is released from permafrost environments. In particular, topographic depressions on the landscape are predominantly anoxic and conducive to active methanogenesis. At the sediment-water interfaces of the water-saturated polygonal units, namely low- and flat-centered polygons, CH4 and oxygen gradients overlap and bacterial CH4 oxidation is an important process contributing to CH4 consumption. Methanotrophic bacteria represent the major terrestrial sinks for CH4 and can reduce CH4 emissions by ~70 %. Therefore, determining how the activity and abundance of methanotrophic communities respond to warming temperature conditions is critical to predicting effects of permafrost thaw and active layer warming on CH4 emissions. As ground temperature increases in the Arctic landscape, a major impact of permafrost thaw could be draining of the active layer with resultant subsidence leading to the formation of elevated and relatively oxic high-centered polygons. These changes can impact both methanogen and methanotroph communities and affect net CH4 fluxes.\nTo understand the controls of temperature and substrate availability on CH4 oxidation, we examined process rates and temporal dynamics of methanotroph biomass in contrasting landscape gradients. We investigated the active layer and Cryoturbated permafrost organic soilsd from replicate soil cores collected from high-centered and flat-centered polygonal units in the Barrow Environmental Observatory, Barrow, AK. We used quantitative PCR to quantify methanogen (mcrA) and methanotroph (pmoA) population size by functional gene analysis. We present potential methane oxidation activity in response to three incubation temperatures (-2 oC, 4 oC, and 10 oC) that represent thaw-season ground temperatures. Our objectives were to estimate the rates of CH4 oxidation in response to seasonal fluctuations in temperature and to contrast the potential of methanogenic environments to oxidize CH4. We further compare the results with methanogenesis rates to understand the temporal dynamics of CH4 production and oxidation in warming conditions.",

            "abstract": "Positive breakdown during lightning discharges is generally considered to be weak and slowly propagating, as high speed video observations show it to be optically weak, and studies of the development of cloud-to-ground (CG) and intracloud (IC) flashes show development in the negative charge region to be slow. With the proper instrumentation, however, fast positive breakdown is a relatively common feature of both CG and IC flashes. The breakdown is bright at VHF, but is smoothly continuous so that time-of-arrival VHF mapping systems such as the Lightning Mapping Array are usually unable to detect or locate its occurrence. However, the breakdown is easily locatable using interferometric mapping techniques. Such an interferometer was developed at NM Tech in the 1980s and used in the CaPE studies at Kennedy Space Center in 1991, where it observed fast (1-6 × 107 m/s), VHF-bright positive leaders propagating away from the source region of negative CG return strokes (Shao et al., 1995).\nHere we report new observations of fast positive breakdown, obtained with Langmuir Laboratory's flash-continuous broadband VHF interferometer, that confirm and substantially expand our understanding of the phenomena. Numerous examples have been observed following return strokes of negative CG flashes, including bolt-from-blue discharges, and during K-processes of both IC and CG flashes. The breakdown typically propagates a few kilometers at speeds on the order of 107 m/s and frequently produces some of the brightest radiation of the flash. A particularly interesting feature of the breakdown is that it propagates into regions of previously un-ionized air. Then following the breakdown, frequently no further VHF emission is seen along or beyond its channel, indicating that the channel formed is not conducting. But on occasion, especially during cloud-to-ground flashes, the end of the fast positive breakdown turns into a normal, slowly propagating positive leader.",

This new approach to K-12 science education requires a dedicated effort to address teacher preparation in ESS. Here, we present an instructional model that explicitly integrates the three dimensions of the NGSS as an organizing framework in large-enrollment, undergraduate introductory geoscience courses targeted toward future teachers. This curriculum development is part of a campus-wide collaboration among science, engineering, and education faculty to enhance science teacher preparation. This approach reflects NGSS conceptual shifts and promotes a learner-centered environment where students regularly engage with each other and course material as part of the course:\n\n1) In terms of content, Earth systems and interactions, are emphasized; rocks and minerals are discussed in the context of their use to understand and predict changes over Earth’s past, present, and future; and engineering and technology are incorporated into discussions of mediating human impacts on Earth systems. 2) Cross-cutting concepts, such as cycles and flows, are explicitly referenced throughout the course to promote connections between and application of prior knowledge and new information or situations. 3) Guided by explicit prompts for partner discussions in class, students regularly engage in scientific practices, such as arguing by evidence and constructing an explanation. We will provide examples of student learning assessment, including in-class responses pre- and post- partner discussions, short written reflections, and cumulative projects. Ongoing evaluation of this instructional approach will include pre- and post- Geoscience Concept Inventory responses.",

            "abstract": "Many Earth Science archives are currently structured as the data are collected or calculated: individual files hold results for single time slices. This approach is easy to write while data are being collected or calculated and is optimized for viewing the data in latitude/longitude slices (maps or images) or animations of a series of these maps. It also works well for spatial comparisons of values at the same time. Several groups have recently explored approaches to reorganizing data in order to optimize access for analysis of climate variations, i.e. temporal changes at a given location. One approach, termed “data rods”, takes this reorganization to the opposite end of the organization spectrum with a file for each grid cell time series. An alternative in the middle of the organization spectrum offers flexible access that can support either map or time series views. This approach takes advantage of chunking to divide the data into three-dimensional blocks, i.e. two-dimensional latitude/longitude tiles with a time dimension. This chunking approach is implemented as a core capability of the HDF5 file format and its tools and offers a number of advantages: improved multi-use case data access, integrated data compression, expanding or shrinking data dimensions, adding or deleting data, and simplifying data management by decreasing the number of files in each collection. We will provide real-world examples of these benefits using data products from current data archives.",

            "abstract": "Low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) are earthquakes that are depleted in high-frequency content relative to earthquakes of similar magnitude. Along the San Andreas Fault, as in many subduction zones, LFEs occur in rapid succession, forming tectonic tremor. Depletion of high frequencies can be attributed to either source or path effects, however studies of LFEs and nearby earthquakes with approximately the same path have shown that the LFE source is responsible for the differences in spectral content. In this study we use an empirical Green’s function approach to further investigate what physical properties of the LFE source cause high-frequency depletion. We use a dataset of approximately one million LFEs comprising 88 LFE families on the deep San Andreas Fault. For a subset of the shallowest LFE families, there are nearby earthquakes that locate within 3 km of the LFE hypocenter (a small fraction of the path length). We exploit the assumed difference in moment-duration scaling between LFEs and regular earthquakes and use these earthquakes as empirical Green’s functions. We determine relative LFE source time function using time domain deconvolution and increase the signal-to-noise ratio by jointly inverting multiple LFEs within individual families. Preliminary results show similar source-time functions derived at many different seismic stations, independent of source-station azimuth. The lack of directivity suggests the rupture velocity is a small fraction of the shear wave velocity. In many kinematic earthquake source models, the spectral corner frequency is proportional to the rupture velocity and the slip velocity. Hence, a low rupture velocity may explain why LFEs are depleted in high frequency content relative to traditional earthquakes.",

In the Christina River Critical Zone Observatory, we use the chemistry of water, in particular the oxygen-18 and chloride concentrations, and hydrograph separation to evaluate the contributions of different water sources to the stream discharge during a series of five storm events in 2011 and 2012. These events varied in magnitude, from 44 to 168 mm total precipitation, and precipitation chemistry, with δ18O values ranging from -5.38 to -11.06 ‰. The contribution of old water during the storm peak, determined by isotope hydrograph separation, varied from 0% in a spring storm of annual magnitude to 76% during Hurricane Sandy. Soil moisture data, available for all but one of our storms, indicates higher old water contribution at peak flow when the catchment has higher antecedent soil moisture.\nUnderstanding differences in water sourcing to the stream during different events provides a basis on which we analyze the movement of critical zone processing with regard to erosion and the source of exported sediment. For example, sediment fingerprinting with fallout radioisotopes indicated variation in sediment source between events. For example, suspended sediment samples taken during Hurricane Irene (28 August 2011) contained between 0 and 11.4 Bq/kg cesium-137 (137Cs) and 175 – 698 Bq/kg of beryllium-7 (7Be), indicating some level of recent surface erosion. Suspended sediment samples taken during Hurricane Sandy (29 October 2012) did not contain measureable activities of either 137Cs or 7Be.",

We are exploring vegetation and permafrost distributions during the last 21,000 years and future projections (2100 C.E.) to gain an understanding of the effects of climate shifts on this complex subsystem. When forced with the baseline climatology, compiled from the University of Delaware temperature and precipitation climatology and ERA-40 sunshine data, our biome simulations were generally consistent with current vegetation observations in the study region. The biomes in this region are mostly evergreen and deciduous taiga capped by shrub and graminoid tundras to the north. The more noticeable differences were the tree line simulated north of the Brooks Range in Alaska and evergreen taiga in southwest Alaska where we know these biomes do not exist today.\nThe projected changes in climate conditions in the region under a RCP8.5 climate scenario (significant warming upwards of 10°C by some models, an increase in precipitation by as much as 40%, and carbon dioxide concentration reaching approximately 940 ppm) drive shifts in Arctic biomes. The tree line shifts northward while shrub tundra and graminoid tundra regions decrease significantly. An intrusion of cool mixed, deciduous, and conifer forests above 60° north, especially in southwest Alaska, were marked and were not modeled for present day. Across eastern Russia, deciduous taiga begins to overtake evergreen taiga, except along the coastal regions where evergreen taiga remains the favored biome.

            "abstract": "The mathematical codes embedded within different vegetation models ultimately represent alternative hypotheses of biosphere functioning. While formulations for some processes (e.g. leaf-level photosynthesis) are often shared across vegetation models, other processes (e.g. carbon allocation) are much more variable in their representation across models. This creates the opportunity for equifinality – models can simulate similar values of key metrics such as NPP or biomass through very different underlying causal pathways. Intensive carbon cycle measurements allow for quantification of a comprehensive suite of carbon fluxes such as the productivity and respiration of leaves, roots and wood, allowing for in-depth assessment of carbon flows within ecosystems. Thus, they provide important information on poorly-constrained C-cycle processes such as allocation. We conducted an in-depth evaluation of the ability of four commonly used dynamic global vegetation models (CLM, ED2, IBIS, JULES) to simulate carbon cycle processes at ten lowland Amazonian rainforest sites where individual C-cycle components have been measured. The rigorous model-data comparison procedure allowed identification of biases which were specific to different models, providing clear avenues for model improvement and allowing determination of internal C-cycling pathways that were better supported by data. Furthermore, the intensive C-cycle data allowed for explicit testing of the validity of a number of assumptions made by specific models in the simulation of carbon allocation and plant respiration. For example, the ED2 model assumes that maintenance respiration of stems is negligible while JULES assumes equivalent allocation of NPP to fine roots and leaves. We argue that field studies focusing on simultaneous measurement of a large number of component fluxes are fundamentally important for reducing uncertainty in vegetation model simulations.",

Density is, in particular, an important parameter that allows us to differentiate between lithologies and estimate or calculate other petrophysical properties. It is well established that compressional and shear wave velocities of common crystalline rocks increase with increasing densities (i.e. the Birch and Nafe-Drake relationships). Conventional empirical relations do not take into account S-wave velocity. Physical properties of Fe-oxides and massive sulfides, however, differ significantly from the empirical velocity-density relationships. Currently, acquiring in-situ density data is challenging and problematic, and therefore, developing an approximation for density based on seismic wave velocity and elastic moduli would be beneficial. With the goal of finding other possible or better relationships between density and the elastic moduli, a database of density, P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young’s modulus, and Poisson’s ratio was compiled based on a multitude of lab samples. The database is comprised of isotropic, non-porous metamorphic rock. Multi-parameter cross plots of the various elastic parameters have been analyzed in order to find a suitable parameter combination that reduces high density outliers. As expected, the P-wave velocity to S-wave velocity ratios show no correlation with density. However, Birch’s seismic parameter, along with the bulk modulus, shows promise in providing a link between observed compressional and shear wave velocities and rock densities, including massive sulfides and Fe-oxides.",

The sensitivity of cloud radiative effects on the properties of cloud is investigated in this study using the observation data.

The BBK discoveries pose several challenges to conventional controlled-source EM surveying since the relatively shallow water dampens the anomaly magnitudes due to airwave coupling, and the reservoirs are in close proximity to other resistive features. The 160 m spacing of the 44 receiver bipoles on the towed streamer offers much higher data density than is typically achieved with conventional seafloor receiver surveys. We tested the resolving capabilities of the towed-streamer by inverting the survey data using a new code based on a 2.5D parallel goal-oriented adaptive finite element method and a modified implementation of the Occam inversion algorithm. The inversion successfully images the 1-2 km wide Bressay and ~5 km wide Bentley reservoirs, illustrating that the high data density of the towed streamer offers improved resolution over sparsely sampled nodal seafloor receiver data. The results also demonstrate the importance of allowing for anisotropy when inverting data from this region. Whereas anisotropic inversion clearly recovers the lateral edges of the known reservoirs, isotropic inversion results in inter-bedding of resistive and conductive layers that conceal the reservoirs.",

In this study, three scenarios of geysers are numerically simulated using a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The three tested scenarios are comprised of a drop shaft that is closed at its bottom and partially or fully open at the top. Initially, the lower section of the drop shaft is filled with pressurized air, the middle section with stagnant water and the upper section with air at atmospheric pressure. The pressure and volume of the pressurized air, and hence the stored energy, is different for all three test cases. The volume of the stagnant water and the air at atmospheric pressure are kept constant in the tests. The numerical simulations aim to identify the correlation between dimensionless energy stored in the pressurized air pocket and dimensionless maximum pressure reached at the outlet. This dimensionless correlation could be used to determine the energy threshold that does not produce air-water geyser, which in turn could be used in the design of combined sewer systems for minimizing geysers.",

            "abstract": "The Kohistan-Ladakh arc (KLA) separates India from Eurasia in the western Himalaya. Two conflicting hypotheses have been developed concerning the collision between India, the KLA, and Eurasia. In the classical model, the KLA is thought to have collided with Eurasia in the Cretaceous (~85-110 Ma), and, subsequently, India collided with Eurasia and the KLA at ~50 Ma along the Indus-Tsangpo suture. Alternatively, it has been proposed that India first collided with the KLA at ~50 Ma, and, subsequently, India and the KLA collided with Eurasia at ~40 Ma along the Shyok-Tsangpo suture zone. These different collision scenarios make distinct predictions for the absolute timing of the India-Eurasia collision. In the classical hypothesis, the KLA should have been located at ~20°N after collision with Eurasia, whereas the alternative model predicts that the KLA remained far removed form Eurasia, therefore south of ~20°N in the Paleo-Tethys until 50 Ma. We conducted a paleomagnetic study to test these two conflicting hypotheses by determining the paleolatitude of formation for a ~67-52 Ma sequence of the Khardung volcanics--a unit located in the Shyok-Nubra valley and overlying the KLA.\nSamples were collected at four sites. During stepwise thermal demagnetization, samples from all four sites contained co-directional high-temperature (HT) magnetization components persisting to the magnetite Curie temperature of 580°C or greater. A baked contact test at one site suggests that these HT magnetizations predate dike intrusion and bedding tilt, indicating that the HT components likely reflect primary magnetization. The average of the HT site mean directions implies a paleolatitude of 5°N.\nOur results preclude the possibility that the KLA collided with Eurasia at ~ 20°N in the Cretaceous. Instead, they support the hypothesis that the KLA initially collided with India at ~ 50 Ma in the equatorial region of the Tethyan ocean.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate possible effects of altered levels of atmospheric CO2 concentrations on carbon fluxes in a natural chaparral ecosystem. Here we present that the increase of CO2 from near pre-industrial levels of around 250 ppm to recent past CO2 levels of 350 ppm are sufficient to increase NEE. These data indicate that chaparral ecosystems will increase carbon sequestration under elevated CO2 levels and that under elevated atmospheric CO2 there will be greater sink or reduced source of ecosystem CO2 to the atmosphere as a result of improved moisture status. The effect of elevated CO2 on increasing NEE was greatest during the warm and dry season versus the cold and wet season. Further, it appears that increasing atmospheric CO2 will have greater relative effects in areas of increasing water stress as CO2 treatment effects on NEE were greater in modestly dry years and with longer periods of drought. The daily maximum NEE difference between the lowest (250 ppm) and the highest (750 ppm) CO2 concentrations treatments for January was -0.127gC m-2 h-1, but for June was -0.267 gC m-2 h-1 in this study, which was a 210 percent increase. The differences between the lower treatments and higher treatments were greater in the later years indicating there was an accumulative effect.

            "abstract": "We test the hypothesis that magma supply to Kīlauea volcano, Hawai‘i may be affected by magma volatile content. We find that volatile content and magma flow from deep source to Kīlauea's summit reservoirs are non-linearly related. For example, a 25-30% change in volatiles leads to a near two-fold increase in magma supply.\nHawaiian volcanism provides an opportunity to develop and test hypotheses concerning dynamic and geochemical behavior of hot spot volcanism on different time scales. The Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō-Kupaianaha eruption (1983-present) is thought to be fed by essentially unfettered magma flow from the asthenosphere into a network of magma reservoirs at approximately 1-4 km below Kīlauea's summit, and from there into Kīlauea's east rift zone, where it erupts. Because Kīlauea's magma becomes saturated in CO2 at about 40 km depth, most CO2 is thought to escape buoyantly from the magma, before entering the east rift zone, and instead is emitted at the summit. Between 2003 and 2006 Kīlauea's summit inflated at unusually high rates and concurrently CO2emissions doubled. This may reflect a change in the balance between magma supply to the summit and outflow to the east rift zone. It remains unknown what caused this surge in magma supply or what controls magma supply to Hawaiian volcanoes in general.\nWe have modeled two-phase magma flow, coupled with H2O-CO2 solubility, to investigate the effect of changes in volatile content on the flow of magma through Kīlauea's magmatic plumbing system. We assume an invariant magma transport capacity from source to vent over the time period of interest. Therefore, changes in magma flow rate are a consequence of changes in magma-static and dynamic pressure throughout Kīlauea's plumbing system. We use measured summit deformation and CO2 emissions as observational constraints, and find from a systematic parameter analysis that even modest increases in volatiles reduce magma-static pressures sufficiently to generate a 'surge' in magma supply and in CO2 emissions.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is the second most important long-lived greenhouse gas from both natural and anthropogenic sources. In Switzerland, CH4 sources are dominated by agricultural activities (>80%) while natural emissions from wetlands and wild animals are thought to represent a minor source (~3 %). Except for leakage from the natural gas distribution network, all relevant emissions in Switzerland are associated with microbial processes which, due to their diffuse nature and sensitivity to ambient conditions, are associated with comparatively large uncertainties. The Swiss National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, for example, assigns an uncertainty of 18% to the country total CH4 emissions as compared to only 3% for CO2.\nTo verify the Swiss national CH4 emission estimate and to reduce its uncertainty, “top-down” methods combining atmospheric observations and regional scale transport simulations can be used. Here, we present two independent analyses of the Swiss CH4 emission budget using inverse modeling. The first is based on airborne observations during more than 20 flights of a motor glider conducted in the framework of the MAIOLICA project. The second is based on near surface measurements from the newly established CarboCount CH measurement network (http://www.carbocount.ch). A Bayesian inversion framework is applied to these observations in combination with source sensitivities (footprints) calculated with the Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model FLEXPART. To account for the complex terrain and flow in Switzerland, FLEXPART is driven by meteorological fields from the non-hydrostatic numerical weather forecast model COSMO at horizontal resolutions of up to 2 km x 2 km. Due to the critical role of the transport simulations, we first present an analysis of the sensitivity to different model configurations (e.g. resolution, time-averaged winds versus instantaneous fields, ECMWF versus COSMO fields). We then present the inverse modeling results separately for the airborne and the ground-based observations contrasting the numbers to the official National Greenhouse Gas Inventory.",

            "abstract": "Carbonates are ubiquitous in nature, forming in a variety of settings at the surface and through burial. The field and petrographic relationships of carbonate phases can often be linked to the depositional setting and burial path(s) that the sedimentary pile has experienced. Clumped isotopes are taking on an important role of testing the temperature of formation of the carbonates, and combined with other approaches such as fluid inclusion analyses offers tremendous potential for testing basin evolution models. However, while the relative ages of carbonates are often fairly easily elucidated, the absolute ages of the events recorded in carbonates are not. U-Pb dating of carbonates offers the best potential for constraining the ages. However, not all fluids have favorable U/Ca ratios.\nU-Pb dated groundwater carbonates from the Late Triassic New Haven Arkose give an age of 211 +/- 2 Ma, consistent with the known age of deposition. Late bright luminescent calcite from the same formation gives an age of 81+/-11 Ma, constraining the age (both primary and secondary) of carbonate formation. Clumped isotope analyses of primary carbonate phases show somewhat elevated temperatures between 50-60o C, some 30 degrees hotter than other estimates for this Triassic equatorial setting, and are more likely the result of re-ordering of 13C-18O bonds at depth. Apparently the primary calcite, appears to have preserved its depositional U-Pb systematics, however bond re-ordering or recrystallization of these carbonates appear to reflect values closer to thermal equilibrium with the last phase of carbonate formation (bright luminescent calcite, 81 ± 11 Ma). Further work on these samples will target these younger calcites to determine if this later calcite phase records similar temperatures.",

We combine structural analysis, geochemistry, stable isotopes and K-Ar dating of synkinematic illite/muscovite to investigate the processes that control localization and weakening of initially strong, seismogenic brittle faults. We aim at better understanding how the constantly evolving architecture and composition of brittle-ductile faults affect their seismogenic properties.\nThe Kvenklubben fault in northern Norway is part of a Caledonian compressional imbricate stack. It juxtaposes greenschist facies metabasalts in the hanging wall against meta-dolostones and has a 2.5 m thick fault core consisting of talc-bearing calc-phyllonites and chlorite phyllonites. Petrographic and geochemical results indicate that the phyllonites formed mainly through fluid-rock interaction and progressive decomposition of the adjacent wall rocks. K-Ar dating and chlorite geothermometry documents that the fault damage zone developed from the base upwards with fault initiation at 530 Ma around 200°C and the main development during reactivation around 440 Ma at c. 285°C.\nEarly strain increments were accommodated in the dolostone by pressure-solution, formation of optimally oriented tensional fractures and cataclasis along geometrical irregularities of the growing fault plane. Fluids caused sequential decarbonation of the dolostones and carbonation of the metabasalts, resulting in the formation of phyllosilicate-decorated planar fabrics. The newly formed phyllosilicate levels weakened the fault under overall viscous creep conditions. The strongly anisotropic fluid-flow within the phyllonites, together with vein sealing following localized and transient high pore pressure-driven embrittlement, caused strain hardening. Together, the interaction between strain weakening and hardening mechanisms allowed for the fault core to become gradually wider with increasing shear strain, clearly demonstrating the dynamic character of the fault. An important conclusion is that mechanical models need to account for the evolving character of faults and their structural maturity.",

Much of what we know about climate through the Pliocene comes from marine sediments. However, we know relatively little about interannual to interdecadal variability, yet reconstructing Pliocene climate at such resolution has the potential to yield important information for testing climate models. Recent advances in uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating have paved the way for investigating Pliocene (and older) high-resolution palaeoclimate records from speleothems. We present such an example from the Nullarbor Plain, Australia.\nThe Nullabor is an emerged, karstified platform of Eocene to Miocene limestones situated on the arid southern fringe of the Australian continent. Caves developed in the karst preserve a large archive of ancient calcite speleothems, in stark contrast to the virtual lack of calcite speleothems today. U-Pb radiometric dating of these speleothems reveals that most the growth occurred during the Pliocene. The geochemistry of these speleothems suggests that the Nullarbor was a wetter and more-vegetated environment at the time. High-resolution geochemical analyses and fluorescence microscopy show that some of the speleothems are almost certainly annually laminated, and contain multi-proxy signatures similar to Holocene speleothems that are commonly associated with hydrological processes.

            "abstract": "At present, our understanding of the locked zone at Cascadia subduction zone is based on thermal modeling and elastic modeling of horizontal GPS velocities. The thermal model by Hyndman and Wang (1995) provided a first-order assessment of where the subduction thrust might be cold enough for stick-slip behavior. The alternative approach by McCaffrey et al. (2007) is to use a Green's function that relates horizontal surface velocities, as recorded by GPS, to interseismic elastic deformation. The thermal modeling approach is limited by a lack of information about the amount of frictional heating occurring on the thrust (Molnar and England, 1990). The GPS approach is limited in that the horizontal velocity component is fairly insensitive to the structure of the locked zone. The vertical velocity component is much more useful for this purpose. We are fortunate in that vertical velocities can now be measured by GPS to a precision of about 0.2 mm/a. The dislocation model predicts that vertical velocities should range up to about 20 percent of the subduction velocity, which means maximum values of ~7 mm/a. The locked zone is generally entirely offshore at Cascadia, except for the Olympic Peninsula region, where the underlying Juan De Fuca plate has an anomalously low dip. Previous thermal and GPS modeling, as well as tide gauge data and episodic tremors indicate the locked zone there extends about 50 to 75 km onland. This situation provides an opportunity to directly study the locked zone. With that objective in mind, we have constructed a full 3D geodynamic model of the Cascadia subduction zone. At present, the model provides a full representation of the interseismic elastic deformation due to variations of slip on the subduction thrust. The model has been benchmarked against the Savage (2D) and Okada (3D) analytical solutions. This model has an important advantage over traditional dislocation modeling in that we include temperature-sensitive viscosity for the upper and lower plates, and also use realistic constitutive models to represent the locked zone. Another important advantage is that the 3D model provides a full representation of the interseismic deformation, which is important for interpreting GPS data.",

            "abstract": "At Ketzin (Germany) the first European onshore pilot scale project for geological storage of CO2 was initiated in 2004. This project is multidisciplinary and includes 3D time-lapse seismic monitoring. A 3D pre-injection seismic survey was acquired in 2005. Then CO2 injection into a sandstone saline aquifer started at a depth of 650 m in 2008. A 1st 3D seismic repeat survey was acquired in 2009 after 22 kilotons had been injected. The imaged CO2 signature was concentrated around the injection well (200-300 m). A 2nd 3D seismic repeat survey was acquired in 2012 after 61 kilotons had been injected. The imaged CO2 signature further extended (100-200 m). The injection was terminated in 2013. Totally 67 kilotons of CO2 were injected. Time-lapse seismic processing, petrophysical data and geophysical logging on CO2 saturation have allowed for an estimate of the amount of CO2 visible in the seismic data. This estimate is dependent upon a choice of a number of parameters and contains a number of uncertainties. The main uncertainties are following. The constant reservoir porosity and CO2 density used for the estimation are probably an over-simplification since the reservoir is quite heterogeneous. May be velocity dispersion is present in the Ketzin reservoir rocks, but we do not consider it to be large enough that it could affect the mass of CO2 in our estimation. There are only a small number of direct petrophysical observations, providing a weak statistical basis for the determination of seismic velocities based on CO2 saturation and we have assumed that the petrophysical experiments were carried out on samples that are representative for the average properties of the whole reservoir. Finally, the most of the time delay values in the both 3D seismic repeat surveys within the amplitude anomaly are near the noise level of 1–2 ms, however a change of 1 ms in the time delay affects significantly the mass estimate, thus the choice of the time-delay cutoff is crucial. In spite of these uncertainties, the close agreement (over 85%) between the injected and observed amount is encouraging for quantitative monitoring of a CO2 storage site using seismic methods. The missing 15% (maximum) is completely within the simulated dissolved CO2 quantity.",

            "abstract": "More than one-third of the United States’ land cover is comprised of rangelands, which support both forage production and livestock grazing. For grasses in both semi-arid and humid environments, small changes in precipitation and temperature, as well as grazing, can have disproportionately larger impacts on ecosystem processes. For example, these areas may experience large response pulses under highly variable precipitation and other potential future changes. The ultimate goal of this study is to provide information on the interactions between management activities, climate and ecosystem processes to inform sustainable rangeland management. The specific objectives of this paper are to (1) evaluate a new carbon allocation strategy for grasses and (2) test the sensitivity of this improved strategy to changes in climate and grazing strategies.\nThe Regional Hydro-ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys) is a process-based, watershed-scale model that simulates hydrology and biogeochemical cycling with dynamic soil and vegetation modules. We developed a new carbon allocation algorithm for partitioning net primary productivity (NPP) between roots and leaves for grasses. The ‘hybrid’ approach represents a balance between preferential partitioning due to environmental conditions and age-related growth. We evaluated this new allocation scheme at the point-scale at a variety of rangeland sites in the U.S. using observed biomass measurements and against existing allocation schemes used in RHESSys. Additionally, changes in the magnitude, frequency, and intensity of precipitation and temperature were used to assess ecosystem responses using our new allocation scheme. We found that changes in biomass and NPP were generally more sensitive to changes in precipitation than changes in temperature. At more arid sites, larger percent reductions in historic baseline precipitation affected biomass and NPP more negatively. We incorporated grazing impacts through biomass removal. We found that the recovery of grasses to defoliation was governed primarily through the following parameters: (1) the daily to annual allocation of NPP and (2) the fractional storage of carbohydrates. The latter was more appropriate in balancing seasonal patterns of grazing with enough emergency storage of carbon for regrowth.",

            "abstract": "Alaska is one of the most seismically active and tectonically diverse regions in the United States. To examine risk, we have updated the seismic hazard model in Alaska. The current RMS Alaska hazard model is based on the 2007 probabilistic seismic hazard maps for Alaska (Wesson et al., 2007; Boyd et al., 2007). The 2015 RMS model will update several key source parameters, including: extending the earthquake catalog, implementing a new set of crustal faults, updating the subduction zone geometry and reoccurrence rate. First, we extend the earthquake catalog to 2013; decluster the catalog, and compute new background rates. We then create a crustal fault model, based on the Alaska 2012 fault and fold database. This new model increased the number of crustal faults from ten in 2007, to 91 faults in the 2015 model. This includes the addition of: the western Denali, Cook Inlet folds near Anchorage, and thrust faults near Fairbanks. Previously the subduction zone was modeled at a uniform depth. In this update, we model the intraslab as a series of deep stepping events. We also use the best available data, such as Slab 1.0, to update the geometry of the subduction zone.\nThe city of Anchorage represents 80% of the risk exposure in Alaska. In the 2007 model, the hazard in Alaska was dominated by the frequent rate of magnitude 7 to 8 events (Gutenberg-Richter distribution), and large magnitude 8+ events had a low reoccurrence rate (Characteristic) and therefore didn’t contribute as highly to the overall risk. We will review these reoccurrence rates, and will present the results and impact to Anchorage. We will compare our hazard update to the 2007 USGS hazard map, and discuss the changes and drivers for these changes.\nFinally, we will examine the impact model changes have on Alaska earthquake risk. Consider risk metrics include average annual loss, an annualized expected loss level used by insurers to determine the costs of earthquake insurance (and premium levels), and the loss exceedance probability curve used by insurers to address their solvency and manage their portfolio risk. We analyze risk profile changes in areas with large population density and for structures of economic and financial importance: the Trans-Alaska pipeline, industrial facilities in Valdez, and typical residential wood buildings in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau.",

Stoichiometry is a framework based on elemental ratios for understanding how organisms interact within ecosystems. Linking the two has the potential to yield fresh insight about how ecosystems utilize elements and energy. We sought to quantify the link between the stoichiometry of ecosystem metabolism, specifically the C:N:P ratios of integrated autotrophic assimilation, and the stoichiometric tissue ratios observed in the dominant autotrophs. Using high frequency in situ nutrient sensors we estimated the assimilatory fluxes of C, N, and P in multiple spring-fed rivers of varying autotrophic species composition. We measured autotroph cover in each spring river, collected composite vegetation samples, and evaluated tissue stoichiometry; as expected, we observed large differences in C:N and N:P between algal and vascular plant taxa. We observed associations between measured tissue stoichiometry and elemental ratios at the ecosystem scale, suggesting that aggregated assimilatory fluxes may be useful for partitioning primary production and linking organismal nutrient content to the stoichiometry of ecosystem metabolism.",

In this context, groundwater exploitation is a valuable strategy and the estimation of recharge rates is crucial for water management planning, specially considering the changes in land use.\nIn the present study we aim to assess the impact of land cover change on the groundwater recharge at the Santa Cruz Island (Galápagos), where a marked vegetation zonation is observed on the windward side. We studied during one year two adjacent land covers that extend on the majority of the island: a secondary forest and a pasture land.\nWe monitored the climatic variables and throughfall over the pasture and under the forest, respectively. At both plots, the soil water suction was measured with automatic tensiometers in a vertical profile at different soil depth. We associate (i) a Rutter-type canopy interception model, with (ii) a 1-D physically-based variably saturated flow model. This allows the estimation of interception losses, cloud water interception, plant transpiration, runoff and deep percolation. The model was calibrated with the throughfall and soil water suction measurements.\nThe model reveals contrasting behaviors in the soil water transfers between the two plots. The difference could be attributed to the reduction of the net precipitation input at the forest, which is caused by higher evaporation losses at the canopy. The approach provides insights about the soil water dynamics under different land covers, and may help to assess the effect of land use change in the groundwater recharge of a vast region of the island.",

The ion composition and the charge states of the solar wind streams measured in situ and are used to determine their coronal origin. The physical properties of the multi-ion solar wind plasma and turbulent wave spectra are modeled with multifluid models, while the kinetic processes that lead to solar wind ion heating by resonant waves and instabilities are modeled with 2.5 hybrid models that include the kinetic ion wave-particle interactions and ion-cyclotron wave heating processes.

            "abstract": "Evidence is growing that cataclysmic floods, such as jokulhlaups, have scoured parts of the Pacific Northwest not only during the last glacial maximum (such as the Missoula Floods), but also during earlier parts of the Quaternary. These floods left large erosional features in the “Channeled Scablands” such as colossal flood gravel bars, as well as sediments deposited in backflooded tributary valleys. Evidence for pre-last-glacial cataclysmic floods in the region includes very-well-developed paleosols capping flood deposits, middle Pleistocene U-series disequilibrium dates on some flood sediments, and reversed-paleomagnetic-polarity flood sediments, indicating early Pleistocene age. We document additional evidence for ancient cataclysmic floods at two site, near The Dalles, OR and Othello, WA. The Dalles site consists of 8 flood sediment - capping Stage I to III calcic paleosol couplets, with the third unit from the top containing tephra of the Dibekulewe volcanic ash (0.5 Ma). The sandy nature of the proposed flood sediments is too coarse-grained to attribute to aeolian transport. The Othello site consists of 2 meters of caliche over 40 cm of ancient flood sands and fine gravels\nWe collected paleomagnetic samples from both sites, conducting low temperature cycling (LT), alternating field (AF), and thermal demagnetization experiments on them. These experiments indicate that most samples contain: 1) a large magnetization component in multi-domain magnetite (demagnetized by LT), 2) a large component in goethite (demagnetized by 150°C), and 3) a primary magnetization in pseudo-single and single domain magnetite. The Dalles site spans the Matuyama-Brunhes reversal (0.78 Ma). These and previously published data indicate that one or more mechanisms for generating cataclysmic floods have existed in the Pacific Northwest for much of the Quaternary.",

These compounds have well-known atmospheric histories and solubilities. Information derived from CFC concentration and ratio measurements in the global ocean allows us to infer the past history of deep water formation and the rates of spreading and mixing processes. These tracers have also been extensively used to compare and calibrate large-scale ocean circulation models and to estimate the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2. During the P02 CLIVAR/CO2 Repeat Hydrography section along 30°N in 2004, low but detectable levels (>0.005 picomole kg-1) of CFCs (esp. CFC-12) were unexpectedly observed in deep waters (>3000-4000m) along an extensive area between Hawaii and California in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean. Near-bottom CFC concentrations tended to be higher toward the California outer continental shelf region (i.e. Southern California Borderland Basins or SCBB). Potential analytical errors or sampling contamination possibilities were carefully checked during the expedition. These anomalous bottom CFC features were observed again in the same region during the P02 revisit cruise in 2013 by an independent group. The presence of CFCs at the levels measured is inconsistent with presently understood rates and pathways of deep ventilation processes in this region. Potential mechanisms for generating these anomalous features will be discussed, including: a) previously unknown deep ventilation processes in this region; b) release of CFCs from sunken ships or other objects; c) spreading of high-CFC content deep waters from the SCBB along the continental slope; d) vertical transport of CFCs by adsorption/uptake by sinking particulates (including particulate organic matter and/or plastic debris) originating in the surface ocean and re-release in the bottom waters. Studies of sediment trap, sediment cores, uptake and release of chemical compounds by plastics, and uptake and transport by organisms in various sizes (from plankton to baleen whales) would shed light in this mysterious feature and potential knowledge in material transport from the surface ocean to the ocean floor.",

The main limitation of this approach is that samples with relatively high concentrations of Pb and Sr are typically required. Here we present the development of analytical methods for the accurate and precise in situ measurement of Pb and Sr isotope ratios in relatively low-concentration samples using a laser ablation system (193-nm excimer laser) with a double-focusing single-collector (SC) ICPMS (Nu AttoMTM). Our methods build on published techniques [4-6] that used different LA-SC-ICPMS instrumentation to demonstrate the benefits of fast-scanning ion-counting measurements combined with flat-top peaks. We have paid special attention to the characterization and correction of instrumental artifacts using solutions of the NIST SRM981 Pb and SRM987 Sr standards in “wet plasma” mode. For Pb, this includes correcting for the interference of 204Hg on 204Pb, characterizing the effects of tails from thallium (at masses 203 and 205) on the Pb peaks, evaluating the stability of the instrumental mass bias, and maintaining linearity of the detector response over the full dynamic range. For Sr, this includes correcting for the interference of 86Kr on 86Sr and 87Rb on 87Sr, verifying the accuracy of an internal correction for instrumental mass bias, and calibrating the ion optics scanning parameters. LA-SC-ICPMS results for Pb and Sr isotopic measurements of international glass standards and newly developed in-house mineral and glass reference materials will be presented.\n[1] Davidson et al.

We identified earthquakes as small as M ~1 up to M 3, one of the largest earthquakes induced by hydraulic fracturing in the United States. These events all occurred 4-12 March 2014 and the rate decayed once the Ohio Department of Natural Resources issued a shutdown of hydraulic fracturing at a nearby well on 10 March. Using a locally derived velocity model and double difference relocation, the earthquake epicenters occurred during six stimulation stages along two horizontal well legs that were located ~0.8 km away. Nearly 100 stages in nearby wells at greater distances from the earthquake source region did not coincide with detected seismicity. During the sequence, hypocenters migrated ~600 m along an azimuth of 083 degrees defining a vertically oriented plane of seismicity close to the top of the Precambrian basement. The focal mechanism determined for the M 3 event had a vertically oriented left-lateral fault plane consistent with the earthquake distribution and the regional stress field. The focal mechanism, orientation, and depth of hypocenters were similar to that of the 2011 Youngstown earthquake sequence that occurred ~20 km away, but was correlated with wastewater injection instead of hydraulic fracturing. Considering the relatively large magnitude of these events and the b-value of 0.85, it appears the hydraulic fracturing induced slip along a pre-existing fault/fracture zone optimally oriented in the regional stress field.",

            "abstract": "Interpreting the geological record of Amazon biomass combustion requires comparing charcoal accumulation rates in various biomes at different time scales. Charcoal accumulation rates, a proxy for palaeofire records, were obtained in sediment cores from Amazon lakes surrounded by several vegetation types and from a reservoir in an intense land use change region. The records presented in this study were obtained in the following areas i) a reservoir in Alta Floresta region (northern Mato Grosso State); ii) Lago do Saci (southern Pará State), a lake close to Alta Floresta and located at the southern border of Pará State; iii) a bog in an ecotone area in the Humaitá region (southern Amazonas State); iv) lakes in lateritic iron crust of the Carajás Hills (southeastern Pará State); v) Lago Comprido, a floodplain lake close to the Amazon River and surrounded by tropical rain forest (Monte Alegre, Pará State; vi) Lagoa da Pata in the Morro dos Seis Lagos alkaline complex (São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Amazonas State) and vii) Lago Caracaranã, a secluded lake in the northern Amazon cerrado (Roraima State). The highest charcoal accumulation rates were observed for modern records related to an intense change in land use at Alta Floresta, which had no precedent during the Holocene history of the Amazon. High charcoal accumulation rates that were observed in the Carajás region during low lake level phases in the Amazon in the mid-Holocene were comparable to those at the onset of the human settlement in Alta Floresta region. An increase in charcoal accumulation rate was observed in the late Holocene when the lake level was high, suggesting an interaction between climates and human presence. Low charcoal accumulation rates are typical of modern high rainfall environments, as observed in Lagoa da Pata where the environment is not susceptible to occurrences of wildfires even during relatively drier climatic phases. Low charcoal accumulation rates also exist in the relatively dry cerrado (savanna type) biome even during relatively dry phases in the Caracaranã region where the savanna-type vegetation biomass is lower and thus generates less charcoal particles than forest ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural production in West Africa is extremely vulnerable to precipitation change and variability. Designing adaptation options to anticipate these changes in precipitation requires robust predicting future climate conditions. Output from Global Circulation Models (GCMs) is too coarse to be used directly to assess regional and high order statistics changes. We use output from a set of Regional Climate Models that dynamically downscale CMIP5 GCMs and analyze mid-century changes in the characteristics of precipitation in West Africa over cropland areas. For each RCM/GCM combinations, we compared predicted precipitation for the period 2035-2065 under the RCP 8.5 scenario with its historical reconstruction of 1975-2005. The mean changes emerging from an analysis of the ensemble of 15 RCM/GCM combinations suggest moderate (~3%) increases in annual precipitation,a very consistent delay in the onset of the rainy season (1 to 4 days from South to North) and no consistent change in the ending of the rainy season. This illustrates a general shortening of the rainy season. An analysis of dry spells (periods of consecutive days with less than 5 mm) for a durations of between 5 and 15 days revealed an increased probability of experiencing longer dry spells during the rainy season in the future climate, coupled with a general intensification of precipitation. This finding was consistent across all models. Our analysis promotes regional prioritization of adaptation measures to the changes in precipitation characteristics that could potentially have detrimental effects on crop yields while also affecting water resources management, species distribution, and others sectors. Increased storage of water, in combination with supplemental irrigation can be an important mechanism for adapting to the effects for regional precipitation changes on crop yield.",

            "abstract": "Species classification, gap analysis, biomass estimates, and biodiversity assessments in semiarid and arid regions can be improved by identifying individual shrubs using ground and airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). In this study, we develop a new 3-dimensional shrub delineation method based on a moving window and region growing segmentation approach using ground based LiDAR (terrestrial laser scanning, TLS). The method leverages the variation and distribution of point densities that characterize a shrub and its boundary. The algorithm uses a combination of a voxel-based window (5-cm cubes) and segmentation. The segmentation approach begins with a seed point of the highest vegetation point from the point cloud, from the tallest to the shortest shrub. The automatic delineation results from this new method are compared to existing neighborhood point statistics and object-oriented segmentation methods, as well as manual delineation of individual shrubs. The results demonstrate that our new method closely approximates the number and boundaries of shrubs in two plots of different shrub densities, in comparison to manual delineation. These results provide an improvement over existing methods which over-delineate the branches and sub-crowns within shrubs. Our automatic delineation method will be used to improve shrub species classification and biomass estimates within TLS data, and potentially adapted for future use with airborne LiDAR.",

These flows are low-δ18O requiring tens of percent of shallowly remelted hydrothermally-altered material and provide evidence into how large silicic magma systems evolve before and after major caldera-forming cycles.\nWe have developed a technique to directly analyze small micro-domains of rhyolite glass for precise (better than 0.1 ‰) δ18O determination coupled with D/H, [H2O], trace elements, and Pb isotopes. We present evidence for striking δ18O homogeneity (4.48 ± 0.12 ‰, 2 standard deviations of all analyses) both across small (1 km3) and large (up to 70 km3) flows and between flows erupted over almost 200 ka. D/H analyses in the glasses are highly degassed and are not affected by secondary hydration (H2O = 0.05 to 0.28 wt. %, δD = -99 to -171 ‰). Trace element analyses show broad temporal compositional evolution consistent with increasing feldspar fractionation over time: the oldest Scaup Lake flow contains 8 ppm Sr, 330 ppm Rb, and 270 ppm Ba to the youngest Pitchstone Plateau flow contains 0.7-1.9 ppm Sr, 180-250 ppm Rb, 18-25 ppm Ba. We also show small but recognizable trace element heterogeneity within lava flows unrelated to long-term geochemical trends.\nHomogeneity of oxygen in melt from individual lava flows across the LCT caldera is consistent with convective homogenization of a large magma body generated by remelting of post and pre LCT hydrothermally-altered and likely highly variable, low- δ18O rocks. In combination with trace element data we show that the CPM rhyolites have also undergone a broad, caldera-wide differentiation trend with no evidence for significant recharge. We are reconciling diverse geochemical data streams to develop a comprehensive petrologic model for the evolution of the most recent products of Yellowstone volcanism.",

This error can be counteracted by the addition of sodium azide to the hydroxide-iodide pickling reagent. The 2013 US GEOTRACES zonal transect included stations off the coast of Peru with nitrite values up to 10µmol/kg in the upper 400 meters of the water column. Low concentrations of dissolved oxygen were also present in the upper 800 meters, providing an opportunity to study the effect of high nitrite levels on dissolved oxygen analysis over a range of concentrations. Without the addition of azide, the error in dissolved oxygen measurement increased linearly with nitrite concentration. The interference was only significant in samples with nitrite concentrations higher than 1.5 µmol/kg, all of which also had low dissolved oxygen concentrations (<45µmol/kg). The unique combination of high nitrite and low dissolved oxygen is present in such well known and relatively small areas of the world’s oceans that the addition of azide is not necessary as a standard procedure for the vast majority of oceanographic measurements.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have established consistent relationships between pH and bacterial diversity and community structure in soils from site-specific to landscape scales. However, these studies rely on DNA or PLFA extraction techniques from bulk soils that encompass metabolically active and inactive, or dormant, communities, and loose DNA. Dormant cells may comprise up to 80% of total live cells. If dormant cells dominate a particular environment, it is possible that previous interpretations of the soil variables assumed to drive communities could be profoundly affected. We used H218O stable isotope probing and bar-coded illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes to monitor the response of actively growing communities to changes in soil pH in a soil microcosm over 14 days. This substrate-independent approach has several advantages over 13C or 15N-labelled molecules in that all growing bacteria should be able to make use of water, allowing characterization of whole communities. We hypothesized that Acidobacteria would increasingly dominate the growing community and that Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes would decline, given previously established responses by these taxa to soil pH. Instead, we observed the reverse. Actinobacteria abundance increased three-fold from 26 to 76% of the overall community as soil pH fell from pH 5.6 to pH 4.6. Shifts in community structure and decreases in diversity with declining soil pH were essentially driven by two families, Streptomyceaca and Microbacteracea, which collectively increased from 2 to 40% of the entire community. In contrast, Acidobacteria as a whole declined although numbers of subdivision 1 remained stable across all soil pH levels. We suggest that the brief incubation period in this SIP study selected for growth of acid-tolerant Actinobacteria over Acidobacteria. Taxa within Actinomycetales have been readily cultured over short time frames, suggesting rapid growth patterns. Conversely, taxa within Acidobacteria have been characterized as slow growers with low cell turnover and may represent a relatively quiescent portion of the bacterial community over the short-term. These results suggest that the short-term responses by individual taxa to pH may differ significantly from long-term responses reflecting variable life strategies within the community itself.",

            "abstract": "The geometry and age progression of Emperor and Hawaii seamounts provide compelling evidence for a major change in Pacific plate motion over a short period of geological time at c. 50 Ma. This time approximately coincides with significant changes in plate boundary configuration and rate in the Indian Ocean, Antarctica, and with the onset of subduction zones in the western Pacific from Japan to New Zealand.\nThis new subduction system that initiated during Eocene time can be divided into two sectors:\nThe northern sector formed at the eastern boundary of the Philippine Sea plate and evolved into the Izu-Bonin-Mariana system. It has and is being extensively studied (2014 IODP expedition 351) to determine the magmatic products, but is limited in the record that is preserved because it is entirely intra-oceanic in character.\nThe southern sector, the Tasman Area sector, borders continental fragments of Gondwana from Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia and New Zealand. This subduction zone evolved into the Tonga-Kemadec system. Because most of the southwest Pacific remained in marine conditions throughout Paleogene time and because rapid seawards roll-back of the subduction is inferred to have happened, it presents extensive well-preserved stratigraphic records to study the Eocene-Oligocene plate boundary evolution.\nThe recent compilation of c. 100.000 km of 2D seismic data in the Tasman Frontier database has allowed us to describe, in the overriding plate of the proto subduction, stratigraphic evidence for large Cenozoic vertical movements (2-4 km) over a lateral extension of 2000 km (from New Caledonia to New Zealand), long-wavelength (~500 km) warping and large amounts of reverse faulting and folding near the proto-trench. These recent observations from the Lord Howe Rise, New Caledonia Trough and South Norfolk Ridge system reveal clear evidence for convergent deformation (uplift and erosion) and subsequent subsidence recorded in Eocene and Oligocene stratal relationships. Together, these evidences form a tectonic event, which is manifest as a regional Eocene-Oligocene unconformity, and which is named the \"Tectonic Event of the Cenozoic in the Tasman Area\" (TECTA).\nStudying the absolute timing of TECTA and the relative timing of its sub-events will allow to better understand its role and relation to Eocene global change.",

Experiences from the last Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), which assembled the data used for the last IPCC Assessment Report (AR5), concluded that the processing, archiving, and post-run diagnostic operations required on such large model output took almost as long to complete as the model runs themselves! As a result, we have been investigating and developing light-weight Python-based tools to parallelize the time-intensive post-run steps in the climate model workflow. In particular, we have developed a parallel Python tool for converting time-slice model output to time-series format, and we have more recently developed a parallel Python tool to perform fast time-averaging of time-series data, an operation needed for many diagnostic computations. These tools are designed to be light-weight, easy to install, with very few dependencies, and that can be easily inserted into the climate model workflow with negligible disruption. In this work, we present the motivation, approach, and results of the two light-weight parallel Python tools that we have developed, as well as our plans for future research and development.",

            "abstract": "Three-month long mooring data are collected in Chesapeake Bay to investigate the lateral circulation driven by wind. The clockwise and counterclockwise lateral circulations (look into estuary) derived by the Ekman transport are observed during up-estuary and down-estuary winds, respectively. Different from the clockwise circulation, the counterclockwise circulation shows an asymmetry because the lateral velocity in the left side of the circulation is significantly weakened. In the entire observation period, the observed surface lateral (sub-tidal) velocity and along-channel wind speed have a linear relationship, but it occurs only in the right (eastern) side of the bay because of the asymmetry. During the set-down phase of up-estuary and down-estuary winds, enhanced bottom lateral currents can be observed. However, the enhanced bottom current during down-estuary wind only appears in the right side of the bay, while it can be found in the entire cross-channel section during up-estuary wind. In the deep channel (right side of the bay), there is a linear correlation between the bottom lateral current and along-channel sub-tidal velocity, suggesting that the enhanced bottom lateral current is generated by the bottom stress associated with the along-channel current. A realistic ROMS model reproduces temporal variation of the surface and bottom lateral circulations during up-estuary and down-estuary well. The diagnostic analyses of the momentum equation in ROMS model suggest that the lateral pressure gradient, which is induced by water accumulation in the left side of the bay and steepening of isopycnals caused by the counterclockwise circulation, inhibits surface Ekman transport under the down-estuary wind and generates a clockwise lateral circulation in the end of the down-estuary wind in the left side of the bay. Our observations and numerical simulations indicate that the sub-tidal lateral circulation in Chesapeake Bay is dominated by the Ekman transport caused by wind.",

NO3 + BVOC reactions were responsible for a substantial (50%) fraction of losses even during daylight hours when photolysis and NO reactions are rapid NO3 sinks. Steady-state calculated NO3 and measured BVOC concentrations were used to predict accumulated NO3 loss and these values were correlated with total gas- and aerosol-phase alkyl nitrate measurements taken with TD-LIF and aerosol organic nitrate mass measured by Aerosol Mass Spectrometry (AMS). This enabled determination of the BVOCs most responsible for NO3 loss during periods of aerosol growth. Further correlations with specific organonitrates measured by Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CIMS) allow assignment of several individual product molecules connected to secondary organic aerosol formation in the southeastern United States.",

            "abstract": "Using upper ocean monthly salinity and temperature data from the moored TAO/TRITON array in the western equatorial Pacific since the late 1990s, we found, consistent with previous work, that the region experiences large interannual fluctuations in salinity. On the equator at 147 degrees E, 156 degrees E and 165 degrees E the interannual sea surface salinity (SSS) has peak to peak amplitudes that often exceed 1 psu. The salinity variability, which matches well the comparatively short record of overlapping SSS estimated by the Aquarius satellite, changes little over the top 50 m of the water column. Beneath this mixed layer depth the amplitude of the salinity variability steadily decreases over the remaining part of the order 100 m thick isothermal layer. Corresponding hydrostatic estimates of dynamic height over the isothermal layer lead to interannual sea level variability of only a few cm amplitude. However, the sea level due to the fresher water is associated geostrophically with a strong fresh water zonal equatorial interannual jet that at 156 degrees E has an amplitude of about 27 cm/s. Along-track altimeter data give a geostrophic equatorial zonal interannual flow that agrees well with this, suggesting that the near-surface interannual flow in the region is due to the shallow fresh jet. A zonal momentum balance indicates that this jet is mostly due to zonal wind stress forcing. The fresh water jet is maximally correlated with the Nino3.4 El Nino index when the jet leads by 3 months.",

Investigation illustrates that the most important four EOF basis functions contribute to about 70% of the total variance, and represent the basic variation patterns: EOF1 represents the poloidal draping configuration, EOF2 presents the toroidal draping configuration for a single sheet structure, EOF3 presents the profile of magnetic y-component in the positive motional electric field (+E) Hemisphere, EOF4 represents a double sheet pattern. Regressions reveal the dependency of the magnetic patterns on the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) components and the VEX orbital orientation, capturing important physical drivers of current systems around Venus.

            "abstract": "Recent studies showed an approximately linear relationship between global mean temperature change and cumulative CO2 emissions. The ratio between temperature change and cumulative emissions, referred to as Transient Climate Response to cumulative Emissions (TCRE), is approximately constant over a wide range of cumulative CO2 emissions but differs between climate models. Thus besides being potentially useful for estimating global warming for a certain amount of CO2 emissions, the TCRE is also a benchmark for model-intercomparison as it combines both physical and biogeochemical model characteristics. However, the underlying physical and bio-geochemical mechanisms behind the constancy of the TCRE are not well known. It has been suggested that ocean heat and carbon uptake are governed by the same mechanisms, determining the constancy of the TCRE. However, there are reasons to question this hypothesis as atmospheric CO2 levels and in turn temperature response also depend on land carbon uptake. This study explores the role of ocean heat and carbon uptake in the approximate constancy of the TCRE, but also takes into account the role of land carbon uptake. For this study the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM), a model of intermediate complexity, is used. The UVic ESCM includes a simple 1-dimensional atmosphere, a dynamic 3-dimensional ocean coupled to a sea-ice model, and a land-surface scheme coupled to a dynamic vegetation model. All components include a carbon cycle. Simulations are performed whereby the effect of different ocean mixing parameterizations on ocean heat and carbon uptake and the TCRE under CO2 forcing is explored. The results of these model simulations give insight into the mechanisms behind the constancy of the TCRE.",

            "abstract": "The distribution of stable isotope ratios between dissolved and solid phases are commonly used to assess processes of mineral formation, alteration and dissolution in a variety of low temperature systems. In order to model this partitioning, a description of isotopic exchange occurring at the fluid-solid surface is required. The use of continuum scale reactive transport models to describe heterogeneous isotopic fractionation is thus hindered by the ability to discretize isotopic gradients within a solid phase. Here we present a multi-component pore scale model for the partitioning of calcium isotopes between dissolved Ca2+ and calcite using a lattice Boltzmann method capable of describing the isotopic composition of an evolving mineral surface distinct from the bulk calcite composition.\nA key feature of our model is the ability to simultaneously track isotopic exchange at the fluid-solid surface as well as the isotopic composition of both bulk fluid and bulk calcite. This is significant in that the surface exchange dictates the evolution of isotopic compositions through time, while the bulk isotope ratios represent the actual measured values of samples collected in the field. Using this approach, we reexamine the distribution of calcium isotope ratios in pore fluids and carbonates reported for deep-sea core profiles with particular emphasis on interpretation of the equilibrium fractionation factor. Based on simulations of an initially supersaturated fluid surrounding a calcite crystal at a range of porosities, we show that the fluid can achieve both chemical and isotopic equilibrium with the solid surface while maintaining the appearance of disequilibrium with the bulk solid. The extent to which the final equilibrated calcium isotope ratio of the bulk fluid and bulk solid agree is therefore a function of the depth into the mineral surface that is exchangeable with the fluid.",

            "abstract": "The Wind spacecraft provides high-quality, in-situ measurements of the solar wind's thermal ions with two separate instruments -- an electrostatic analyzer and a pair of Faraday cups. Each instrument's raw measurements must be processed to derive values for bulk parameters (e.g., densities, velocities, and temperatures). Until now, this analysis has always been carried out independently for each instrument. We report on our ongoing development of new software, dubbed \"Janus,\" that will, for the first time, jointly analyze measurements from these two instruments. By drawing on their unique strengths, Janus will produce higher-quality data on solar-wind ions than an analysis of measurements from either instrument individually could. While Janus on its own will be an asset to the heliophysics community (especially for the study of CME's, CIR's, and other transient phenomena), it will also serve as an important case study for Solar Probe Plus (SPP), which will similarly have both a Faraday cup and an electrostatic analyzer for measuring thermal ions. A joint analysis of measurements from these SPP instruments will be especially important since, unlike their counterparts on Wind, their fields of view will only slightly overlap. SPP is expected to frequently encounter periods during which its two ion instruments together will have strong coverage of the incoming particles but separately will not.",

            "abstract": "The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a dominant mode of intraseasonal variability in the tropics. It has wide-ranging impacts on global patterns of precipitation and surface temperature, and it has been suggested that it has an effect on ENSO. Large-scale convection fueling the MJO is initiated over the tropical Indian Ocean and propagates eastward across the Maritime Continent (MC) and into the western Pacific as a pattern of alternating phases of active and suppressed convection. As an eastward-propagating MJO convective event encounters the MC, its nature is altered due to the complex interactions with the landmass and topography as well as the warm coastal ocean. Previous studies have shown strong diurnal cycles over land and ocean, with distinct diurnal maxima of convection during the day and night, respectively. This complex air-sea-land interaction over the MC region and its impact on the large-scale convection and the MJO are still not well understood.\nThis study aims to improve our understanding of the effects of the MC on the MJO as it propagates eastward from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific. We use the University of Miami Coupled Model (UMCM), a fully coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean model, to investigate the air-sea-land interaction processes and their impact on the large-scale convection associated with MJO. A control simulation of an MJO is carried out first using the DYNAMO observations from 2011 as model verification. To understand the effects of the MC on the MJO convection, coupled model experiments will be conducted by varying the island topography and/or altering the landmass with water surface. Analysis of the coupled model simulations will be compared with satellite observations such as the TRMM precipitation and cloud cluster tracking using hourly IR data. The outcome of this study is expected to provide some insights into important mechanisms that underlie the complex phenomenon.",

            "abstract": "Recently, autonomous sensors have been developed to profile the in-situ chemistry of a water column. These sensors provide extensive, long-term data of ocean chemistry, contributing to our understanding of the state of oceanic pH and overall trends in acidification. Measurements obtained from these sensors should account for the effects of in-situ physical parameters on the chemical equilibria of the system. TRIS-HCl buffers are frequently used in calibration of pH measuring systems. The effects of temperature and salinity on its dissociation constant (K) at 1atm pressure are understood; however, the effects of higher pressures are yet uncharacterized.\nThe effect of pressure on the thermodynamic equilibrium constant can be represented by KP/K0, where the superscript P denotes gauge pressure and 0 denotes atmospheric pressure. For weak acids, this can be estimated from data of the partial molal volumes (v0) and compressibilities (k0) measured at 1atm. We have measured the density and sound speed of TRIS and TRIS-HCl to determine values for v0 and k0 in water, NaCl, and seawater as a function of temperature. Results show that the partial molal properties are higher in NaCl than in water and increase with temperature. This is attributed to changes in solute-solvent interactions and solute-hydration. The values in seawater and NaCl of equal ionic strength are in reasonable agreement, supporting the use of NaCl as a medium representative of seawater. The results are used to estimate the effect of pressure on the dissociation of TRIS-HCl up to 1000 bars. The effect of pressure is found to be greater in water than in NaCl or seawater, and decreases with temperature. The largest effect is seen in water at 5oC (K1000 = 1.044 K0). While this deviation may appear to be minor, it offsets the pK(TRIS-HCl) by 0.02 units, well within the reporting limits. Thus, the effect of pressure becomes more important in freshwater systems with low in-situ temperatures. These new equations for the pressure-dependence of pK(TRIS-HCl) can be used in conjunction with the previous equilibrium studies made at 1atm to improve the calibration of in-situ pH measurements for an aquatic water column.",

Membership includes women working in over 50 countries, although the majority of ESWN members work in the U.S. ESWN increases retention of women in the geosciences by enabling and supporting professional person-to-person connections. This approach has been shown to reduce feelings of isolation among our members and help build professional support systems critical to career success.\nIn early 2013 ESWN transitioned online activities to an advanced social networking platform that supports discussion threads, group formation, and individual messaging. Prior to that, on-line activities operated through a traditional list-serve, hosted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The new web center, http://eswnonline.org, serves as the primary forum for members to build connections, seek advice, and share resources.

            "abstract": "The paper will describe the major results obtained during the pre-landing phase, running from July throughout November 2014, of the Rosetta Mission by the instrument VIRTIS (Visible, Infrared and Thermal Imaging Spectrometer), the dual channel spectrometer onboard Rosetta. The nucleus observations were performed in a wide range of conditions with spatial resolution varying from the initial 500m down to 12.5m and have allowed to generate compositional maps of the illuminated areas. Special emphasis was placed on mapping those surface regions considered reachable areas for the Philae Lander descent, and to those area in the “neck” of the nucleus which from the very early Osiris observations did show hints of surface outgassing activity. The surface temperature has been determined since the first distant observations of the nucleus. Already on the mid of july from a distance of 15000km, when the nucleus was filling one VIRTIS-M pixel, the mean surface temperature has been measured as 205+-5K. This pointed to a surface structure largely covered by a porous crust, mainly devoid of water ice. The major results obtained at higher spatial resolution shall be described and discussed. Finally, an extensive campaign of observations at limb to measure abundances of major volatile compounds (H2O, CO2 and CO) as well as dust scattering properties were carried out.\nAuthors acknowledge the support from national funding agencies.",

            "abstract": "Recent epidemics of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Sudan and South Sudan (locally known as Kala Azar) have caused an estimated 100,000 deaths and have renewed the impetus for defining the ecological boundaries of this vector borne disease. In the past 30 years outbreaks have occurred cyclically within this country, but recent shifts in endemicity have necessitated a more robust understanding of the drivers of the disease. Previous work (e.g. Gebre-Michael et al., 2004; Ashford & Thomson, 1991; Hoogstraal & Heyneman, 1969) has suggested that the primary biological vector in this region, the female sand fly Phlebotomus orientalis, exhibits sensitivities to environmental and climatic variables.\nResults of this study showed a relationship between precipitation and inundation during months of the transmission season (April-July) and the number of confirmed cases in the following September-January period. Particular months of the transmission season with below-average precipitation were better indicators of lagged reports of VL than others. During VL epidemics (2009, 2010, 2011) the month of June exhibited below average precipitation. The two largest epidemics (2010, 2011) were associated with years of below average precipitation in the month of April.\nInundation during April-July (AMJJ) also exhibited a strong inverse relationship with reported VL cases in the following September- January (SONDJ). This relationship was best explored when comparing the VL case data of a specific medical center to the inundation anomalies. Results are typified by the Lankien Medical Center analysis where below average inundation during April displays an inverse relationship with VL cases in the following SONDJ.\nDrought may lead to below average inundation, which could allow for soils to maintain their fissures, thus maintaining the sand fly breeding habitat, resulting in a sustained breeding season for the sandflies (Quate, 1964). Above-average precipitation and inundation might have the inverse effect, eliminating their breeding sites within the soil.\nLand surface temperature (LST) Night, LST Day, and relative humidity did not show a particularly strong relationship with VL. Further research is needed, as these variables are known to exist across strong gradients within the northern states of South Sudan (Quate, 1964).",

            "abstract": "Tropical forests such as the forests of the Amazon basin are a significant component of the earth’s carbon budget, yet how these forests respond to seasonal changes in weather, along with the extent to which tree biology synchronizes with seasonal cycles, are poorly understood.\nFor evergreen forests in equatorial Amazon that experience dry seasons, most global vegetation models project a dry-season decrease in gross primary productivity (GPP). However, eddy covariance observations and remote sensing assessments suggest a late-dry season increase in GPP.\nMost global vegetation models assume that there is no seasonal variation in leaf phenology (cycles of leaf flush and senescence), or in leaf physiology. We conducted a case study in the Tapajos National Forest KM67 site, near Santarém, Brazil, to investigate whether leaf aging and seasonal shifts in leaf demography could cause an increase in GPP during the dry season. In a series of fieldwork campaigns beginning in August 2012, we monitored leaf demographic composition (leaf age categories) from 1-m branches collected from 20 trees representing abundant species, and we assessed how photosynthesis varies with leaf age for a subset of these trees.\nOur results show that photosynthetic capacity (e.g. Vcmax) is higher for leaves that matured during the most recent dry season than for older leaves from previous periods of growth. For many trees, leaf demography shifted during the dry season such that recently matured leaves replaced old leaves. For instance, leaf demography of an Erisma uncinatum, the most abundant canopy tree species at our site, had significantly more recently matured leaves, and significantly fewer old leaves, during surveys late in the dry season (after mid-October) than early in the dry season (prior to mid-September). These results suggest that shifts in leaf demography together with the effects of leaf age on leaf physiology can increase GPP during the dry season at the KM67 site. Thus, leaf phenology may be a dominant driver of GPP seasonality in moist tropical forests of the equatorial Amazon.",

            "abstract": "Soils represent a significant pool for carbon storage and sequestration. Previous field experiments have indicated that some mineral compositions are more effective in preserving soil organic matter (SOM) from microbial degradation. Due to climate change, it is important to quantify which soil types are changing in mineral surface chemistry. One way to do that is by differentiating the SOM stabilization mechanisms in different soil types at various depths. This study focused on examining the distribution of soil mass and composition by the soils density and mineral classification and the soils stability by measuring the amount of carbon and radiocarbon abundance. The United States Geological Survey collected the soils in Oregon, Mississippi, Alaska, and Arizona. The four different soil types were separated by density using density fractionation. Radiocarbon analysis of the different soils varying in density was conducted at Lawrence Livermore National Lab-Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry to determine the 13C/14C ratios. The ratios were used to determine the average age of the carbon in the samples. To determine the composition of the soil types, the soils were processed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab using Fourier Transform Infrared-Attenuated Total Reflection. Results confirmed the amount of carbon, radiocarbon abundance and composition varied among the sites, thus SOM responds differently to climate change depending on the soil type.",

            "abstract": "Ontology design in support of sensor networks requires deep scientific and technical knowledge. For instance, sensor network ontologies may define concepts rich enough to describe the selection of sensor locations that are driven by both scientific use cases, such as proximity to a physical entity, and technical requirements, such as wireless coverage. Our work in collaboration with IBM and the FUND for Lake George is set within the context of the Jefferson Project that aims to monitor, analyze, and understand observation and simulation data in support of decision making concerning the ecosystem of Lake George, NY.\nWe have designed a Human-Aware Sensor Network Ontology (HASNet-O) that we believe is broadly reusable. We will highlight its contributions, describe its relationships to well used ontologies, and demonstrate it in action in the Jefferson Project. The ontology leverages best in class foundational ontologies including OBOE, VSTO, and PROV. One of the reasons HASNet-O is reusable is because it uses a provenance perspective to generalize what initially looked like sensor-specific terms that can be more accurately viewed as provenance terms. For example, we observe that the Activity concept from the PROV language, a W3C provenance standard, can be used to explain complete sensor lifecycles by describing how a network operates including how human interventions may interfere with the quality of the sensor network data, even for highly automated networks. We further observe that Observation activities, which are at the core of most sensor network ontologies, are not described in terms of deployments. In fact, Deployment activities are rarely documented in sensor data/metadata although Observation instances can only occur during the lifetime of Deployment instances.\nOur analysis of network ontologies in light of provenance knowledge includes a discussion about relationships. For instance, relationships between sensors and data are well-established provenance properties characterized in sensor network terms: the fact that a dataset was generated by a sensor may be described in terms of PROV’s wasDerivedFrom property between Activity and Entity instead of a less generic fromSensor relationship between Dataset and Sensor (in this case, it is assumed that Dataset is a subclass of PROV’s entity).

            "abstract": "Controversies around the uplift history of the Central Andes may partly be due to the common use of single stable-isotope elevation proxies that are limited in recording the paleo-hydrological cycle during uplift. Our new, multi-proxy stable isotope data from 68 lipid biomarker n-alkanes, 62 soil carbonates (SC), and 15 volcanic glass shards (VG) from a well-dated section in the intermontane Angastaco Basin in the E Cordillera of NW Argentina (25°45 S, 66 W) provide insight into the paleo-hydrological cycle during uplift and outward growth of the adjacent Puna plateau’s eastern margin. The samples cover a time interval from ~10 to 2 Ma with a resolution of ~ 0.2 Ma. C29 and C31 alkanes yield δD and δ13C values ranging from -95 to -160 ‰ (VSMOW) for δD and -23 to -36 ‰ (PDB) for δ13C. Measured SC range from 18 to 31 ‰ (VSMOW) for δ18O and -4 to -17 ‰ (PDB) for δ13C, whereas VG δD values range from -71 to -95 ‰ (VSMOW). In concert with published clumped-isotope temperature and VG data (Carrapa et al., 2014) our data indicate humid foreland conditions after 10 Ma that became drier at 6.5 Ma as a result of basin uplift and orographic barrier formation farther east. We constructed equidistant time series to calibrate and evaluate each proxy signal to determine which part of the hydrologic cycle is recorded and how each is influenced by regional surface uplift. The results show that water hydrating the VG reflects precipitation, whereas SC and n-alkanes record soil-water compositions. All three proxies show similar short-term trends in δD, δ18O and δ13C on timescales of < ~1 Myr, but deviate significantly over timescales of > ~1 Myr. For example, VG δD values show a gradual depletion during uplift from 6.5 to 4 Ma, whereas C29 and C31 δD values are D-enriched in response to basin aridification, which is in line with a change from C3 to C4 plants as recorded by δ13C C29 and C31. SC δ18O values show a buffered signal with a similar trend as δD of n-alkanes. As no modern C4 plants exist >2000 m (Cotton et al., 2014), an observed shift at 3 Ma in δ13C C29 and C31 alkanes back to C3 vegetation cover suggests that most of the basin was uplifted above 2000 m (to modern elevations) during that time. The reconstruction, calibration, and signal analysis of these proxies on a single record is crucial to understand how each proxy responds to surface uplift.",

            "abstract": "As contributors to the US EPA’s Climate Impacts and Risk Assessment (CIRA) project, we present empirically-based projections of climate change impacts on the yields of five major US crops. Our analysis uses a 15-member ensemble of climate simulations using the MIT Integrated Global System Model (IGSM) linked to the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), forced by 3 emissions scenarios (a \"business as usual\" reference scenario and two stabilization scenarios at 4.5W/m2 and 3.7 W/m2 by 2100), quantify the agricultural impacts avoided due to greenhouse gas emission reductions.\nOur innovation is the coupling of climate model outputs with empirical estimates of the long-run relationship between crop yields and temperature, precipitation and soil moisture derived from the co-variation between yields and weather across US counties over the last 50 years. Our identifying assumption is that since farmers’ planting, management and harvesting decisions are based on land quality and expectations of weather, yields and meteorological variables share a long-run equilibrium relationship. In any given year, weather shocks cause yields to diverge from their expected long-run values, prompting farmers to revise their long-run expectations. We specify a dynamic panel error correction model (ECM) that statistically distinguishes these two processes.\nThe ECM is estimated for maize, wheat, soybeans, sorghum and cotton using longitudinal data on production and harvested area for ~1,100 counties from 1948-2010, in conjunction with spatial fields of 3-hourly temperature, precipitation and soil moisture from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) forcing and output files, binned into annual counts of exposure over the growing season and mapped to county centroids. For scenarios of future warming the identical method was used to calculate counties’ current (1986-2010) and future (2036-65 and 2086-2110) distributions of simulated 3-hourly growing season temperature, precipitation and soil moisture. Finally, we combine these variables with the fitted long-run response to obtain county-level yields under current average climate and projected future climate under our three warming scenarios. We close our presentation with a discussion of the implications for mitigation and adaptation decisions.",

            "abstract": "The volume of water stored within a catchment and its partitioning between groundwater, soil moisture, snowpack, vegetation and surface water ultimately characterise the state of the hydrologic system. While storage is relatively straightforward to conceptualize and define, it is difficult to measure. The response time of discharge to precipitation events and the partitioning of water are both largely determined by the amount of storage. Although this important role of storage is widely recognized, the processes within catchments and the influence of storage on the sensitivity of a catchment are still not completely understood. Here we present results from a study in which we estimated dynamic storage in five different northern headwater catchments within the VeWa (Vegetation effects on water flow and mixing in high-latitude ecosystems) project using the HBV-light model. All five catchments are located in high-latitude regions (Scotland, US, Canada and Sweden), but have contrasting catchment characteristics. These catchments allowed for inter-site testing of how to conceptualize catchment water storage and its relation to catchment runoff. Based on the output data from HBV, the relation between storage and discharge for each catchment was investigated. Changes in dynamic storage across the catchments and differences in calibrated parameters were studied and linked to catchment characteristics for better process understanding. Different scenarios were used to determine the influence of storage on the sensitivity of the catchment. Results showed that catchments with a large storage potential were less sensitive to changes in the input data, as expected. Even though a simple model was used here for the simulation, the results can still contribute to a better understanding of dynamic storage by the comparison across catchments.",

In a high nutrient/low chlorophyll region of the ocean such as the Arctic, sea ice is an important aggregator of dissolved and particulate Fe from aerosol, lithogenic, and biogenic sources. While particulate Fe is less bioavailable than dissolved Fe, it is far more abundant in sea ice. As a result, sea ice directly enhances productivity by ice entrapment of mineral dust particulates containing Fe, which can be released into the surface ocean waters during melting. In seawater underlying sea ice, Fe can be concentrated up to two orders of magnitude higher than in the ice-free open ocean (Lannuzel et al., 2011).\nA transect of sea ice cores were collected in the spring of 2014 offshore of Barrow, AK, and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago to capture a gradient of sediment contributions from shelf sediments to aeolian sediments. At Barrow, AK, land fast first year ice was sampled. In the Canadian Arctic, both multi-year (pack ice) and first year (land fast) ice cores were retrieved. First year ice cores were between 100-150 cm thick and the multi year core was 195 cm thick. Cores were subsampled by depth and filtered. The resulting ice core sediments were analyzed for elemental composition, and multistep Fe-leaching experiments were conducted to determine the fraction of soluble Fe. Thus we have ascertained the solubility of particulate Fe prior to onset of melt season. Dissolved trace metals were also analyzed to ascertain changes in concentration with ice core depth of lithogenic elements (Mn, Al) and biologically important elements (Si, Mo, Cu, Zn). Preliminary results show some enrichment of lithogenic inputs near surface, indicating dust deposition, and lower portions of the cores, suggesting resuspended sediments from the continental shelf. Concentrations of some biologically important elements decrease with depth, suggesting possible biological uptake by sea ice algae.",

            "abstract": "“Kappa” has always been an important input parameter in most codes commonly used for the stochastic simulation of strong ground motion. It is the one parameter controlling the decay of the high-frequency part of the seismic spectrum and, although still debated, it is most frequently related to the site effect. In the present study, we use the lower-magnitude earthquake records in the EUROSEISTEST database (http://euroseisdb.civil.auth.gr) to compute site-specific “kappa” and then predict larger-magnitude earthquake records through stochastic simulations. We emphasize the proper use of “kappa” when it is combined with empirical transfer functions that have resulted from Standard Spectral Ratios (SSR) or Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratios (HVSR), as these functions already include part of the “kappa” effect. Furthermore, we discuss the scatter in “kappa” measurements in relation to the site class and the distance to the earthquake source, and present examples of the possible effect of such scatter in simulated ground motion.",

            "abstract": "Although seismic velocity generally reflects material density, density models drawn solely from seismic interpretations suffer from the fact that temperature, melt-depletion, variations in quartz content, and in-situ melt—as well as myriad other factors—have different effects on the relationship between velocity and density. To wit, such models generally do not accurately recover gravity and/or topography variations. We have developed a probabilistic density modeling method that estimates density from seismic velocity and heat flow and refines these initial estimates in order to reproduce gravity and topography, accounting for lithospheric flexure. Both the input seismic velocity modeling and the refinement are Monte Carlo-type approaches, so the posterior distribution of models provides a direct measure of uncertainty. We leverage the aforementioned difference in sensitivity to separate density variations into thermal and compositional components, providing information on the chemistry and physical state of the crust and upper mantle. Using this approach and Transportable Array seismic data, we present a density model of the western US lithosphere (from central Kansas west) to a depth of 150 km that reveals: 1) remarkably uniform, near- to supra-solidus mantle temperatures beneath regions deformed in the Cenozoic--including the Colorado Plateau--that are ~400 °C higher than those beneath the nominally stable interior of North America; 2) crustal melt (~1%) beneath Miocene-Recent volcanic provinces; 3) depleted mantle lithosphere beneath the Wyoming craton and northern High Plains; 4) likely hydrated lower crust in the Colorado Plateau and Great Plains; and 5) that horizontal differences in lithostatic pressure create deviatoric extensional stress of ~10 MPa in the northern Basin and Range and along the margins of the Colorado Plateau. This density model is a rich source of information, shedding light on the causes and consequences of tectonism, crust-mantle interactions, and topography in the western US.",

            "abstract": "Glaciers and snow cover are natural storage reservoirs that delay runoff on seasonal and longer time-scales. Glacier wastage and reduced snow packs will impact the volume and timing of runoff from mountain basins. Estimates of the contributions of glacier and snow melt to runoff in river systems draining mountain regions are critical for water resources planning. The USAID funded CHARIS project aims to estimate the contributions of glacier and snow melt to streamflow in the Ganges, Indus, Brahmaputra, Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers. Most efforts to estimate glacier and snow melt contributions use temperature-index or degree-day approaches. Near-surface air temperature is a key forcing variable for such models. As with all mountain regions, meteorological stations are sparse and may have short records. Few stations exist at high elevations, with most stations located in valleys below the elevations of glaciers and seasonal snow cover. Reanalyses offer an alternative source of temperature data. However, reanalyses have coarse resolution and simplified topography, especially in the Himalaya. Surface fields are often biased. Any reanalysis product must be both bias-corrected and “downscaled” to the resolution of the melt-runoff model. We present a combined empirically-based bias-correction and downscaling procedure that uses near-surface air temperature from global atmospheric reanalyses to generate near-surface temperature forcing fields for the five river basins in the CHARIS study area. We focus on three 3rd Generation reanalyses; NASA MERRA, NCEP CFSR and ECMWF ERA-Interim. Evaluation of reanalysis temperature fields reveals differences between seasonal means of 500 hPa air temperatures for the three products are of the order of 1 °C, indicating choice of reanalysis can impact model results. The procedure accounts for these seasonal variations in biases of the reanalysis products and in lapse rates.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM) featuring isopycnal ocean component (MICOM). The Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 5 (CMIP5) NorESM historical simulations showed a decline of the AMOC after 1980 concurring with the recent observations from RAPID-MOCHA program. The NorESM future projections predict reduction of the AMOC with 12 to 30% under different warming (RCP2.6-RCP8.5) scenarios. In the CMIP5 model intercomparison project, the NorESM ocean component demonstrated an intense AMOC and took place in the upper end of the AMOC magnitudes model range. The NorESM AMOC strength was found to be sensitive to oceanic grid resolution and whether coupled or uncoupled configuration is used. However, the AMOC tends to be on the strong side in all configurations. In order to find the causes of this vigorous AMOC we carried out a careful diagnostics of the AMOC and explored possible relationship to the model biases found in the Atlantic thermohaline structure, meridional heat and salt transports. Several processes has been investigated to understand further their connection and significance to the AMOC strength and variability: 1) The Labrador Sea Deep Water Mass formation 2) Sub-polar gyre circulation variability 3) The density anomalies created locally during the winter deep water convection or remotely by salt anomalies transferred from the tropics or fresh anomalies from the Arctic. Furthermore, the AMOC sensitivity to sub-grid scale physical parameterizations such as isopycnal eddy mixing and diapycnal mixing and the impact of model resolution on the representation of overflows is examined.",

            "abstract": "There are extended periods over the solar cycle where significant discrepancies occur between the observed open magnetic flux (i.e., those based on spacecraft observations) and that determined from coronal models. One explanation for the source of these discrepancies is that the magnetic fields in CMEs, which have yet to disconnect from the Sun and are thus “closed,” are nonetheless included in open flux estimates because open and closed magnetic field lines are not easily distinguished in spacecraft data. Another possibility is that a portion of the open flux measured by in-situ spacecraft originates from the time-dependent evolution of solar magnetic fields that is not captured by static or steady state coronal model solutions. In this paper, we compute total open heliospheric magnetic flux using three different methods and compare these results with those obtained using in-situ interplanetary magnetic field observations. The first two methods make use of the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model to calculate the total open magnetic flux using as its input: 1) traditional Carrington or diachronic maps and 2) Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport (ADAPT) model synchronic maps. The diachronic and synchronic photospheric magnetic field maps are derived from identical sets of magnetograms taken with the National Solar Observatory (NSO) KPVT and VSM magnetographs. The third method makes use of observationally derived Helium and EUV coronal hole maps overlain on the above mentioned magnetic field maps to compute total open magnetic flux. Key questions to be addressed in this paper are: 1) do diachronic versus synchronic PFSS open flux estimates differ significant from one another and 2) how do open flux estimates based on observationally derived coronal holes compare with model and in-situ values?",

The reflectance-based approach requires that personnel be present at a test site during the sensor overpass, so the Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS) was developed in order to capture data during every possible overpass, which assists in the temporal trending of the radiometric calibration of earth-observing sensors. The number of earth-observing sensors is rapidly increasing in recent years, and RadCaTS provides the ability to radiometrically calibrate them without the requirement of frequent field campaigns. The 2013 launch of Landsat 8 provides a unique opportunity for RadCaTS in that it is being used to supplement the in situ measurements by RSG ground personnel, and it will be used throughout the lifetime of the Landsat 8 mission. This allows more data to be collected throughout the year, and it also allows the accuracy and uncertainty of RadCaTS to be analyzed. The current top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance uncertainty of the reflectance-based approach is ~2.6% in the mid-visible region of the spectrum, and current work indicates that the uncertainty of RadCaTS in TOA spectral radiance is ~3–4%. This work presents the radiometric calibration results of RadCaTS for a variety of sensors such as Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI, Terra and Aqua MODIS, MISR, ASTER, and Suomi NPP VIIRS.",

To quantify these effects, we have characterized the changes in UV-visible absorption, stiffness, and particle shape that occur when aqueous SOA is exposed to repeated wet-dry cycles and photooxidation. Material properties were measured with Atomic Force Microscopy of atomized laboratory generated SOA; this material was created by combining glyoxal, methylglyoxal, or glycolaldehyde with ammonium sulfate, glycine, or methylamine in solution and either spray drying or evaporating the bulk solution. In addition to optical and material properties, changes in organic functional groups were tracked using scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM) of the near carbon edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS). Photooxidation experiments of the same aqueous SOA revealed concomitant changes in the organic functional groups and light absorption spectra, along with measurable changes in particle stiffness.",

A wide range of precipitating electrons were measured with the Acute Precipitating Electron Spectrometer (APES) and Medium-energy Electron SPectrometer (MESP), cumulatively covering 300 ev to 200 keV in varying time resolutions. DC to low frequency electric and magnetic fields were measured at the same time and a langmuir probe was also employed. In addition to the on board instrumentation a suite of ground based imagers was deployed under apogee. We used several electron-multiplying charge-coupled devices (EMCCDs) with different filters and field of views imaging along magnetic zenith. This yielded multi-emission line information about the auroral brightness at the magnetic footprint of the rocket critical for our main goal of exploring the correlation of the sheer flows often observed in high resolution imagery during aurora and the in situ signatures of precipitating particles and waves.

However, we currently lack theory for predicting the properties external forcing must have to be stored in the stratigraphic record. One of the most important boundary conditions influencing dynamics of sediment transport systems and their resulting stratigraphy is Relative Sea-Level (RSL). In this study, we use physical experiments to explore the capacity of autogenic processes to shred perturbations of RSL prior to transfer to the stratigraphic record. We are currently testing the hypothesis that RSL cycles with amplitudes greater than one channel depth (Hc) and/or periodicities longer than the time necessary to deposit, on average, one channel depth of thickness over an entire basin (Tc) will be preserved in stratigraphy. RSL cycles with magnitudes less than Hc and periods less than Tc, though, should be prone to signal shredding prior to transfer to the immobile stratigraphic record. We are conducting a series of physical experiments subject to cycles of RSL with amplitudes and periodicities on either side of our hypothesized shredding thresholds. Initial time series analysis of deposition rates from an experiment with RSL cycles characterized by amplitudes and periods a factor of 2 greater than Hc and Tc, respectively, show signal preservation. Specifically, auto-correlation analysis reveals periodicity in deposition rates equal to the imposed periodicity of RSL cycles. This study improves our ability to predict and interpret allogenic signals in the stratigraphic record and separate these signals from the products of autogenic processes.",

Analyses were performed using CAMECA ims-1270 (UCLA). The depletion of fluid in Ca and the above mentioned elements caused a continuous increase in element to calcium ratios during each experiment. However, we were not able to fully resolve the influence of fluid depletion on apparent partition coefficients during disequilibrium crystallization. Our results suggest that growth rate strongly affects incorporation of Mg, Sr, Ba, and U into the calcite lattice. Growth Entrapment Model (GEM) explains observed relationships between growth rate and partition coefficients. However, elemental profiles across individual crystals suggest that the factors controlling incorporation process may not be ubiquitous for each element.\nCalcite growth velocities obtained from our work overlap with the growth rate range reported for speleothems and marine biogenic carbonates. We anticipate comparing elemental relationships in synthetic calcite with those obtained in natural samples which were reported in previous literature.",

            "abstract": "On 20 August 2010 an energetic disturbance triggered large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations in a large fraction of a nearby filament. The triggering mechanism appears to be episodic jets connecting the energetic event with the filament threads. We analyzed this periodic motion to characterize the underlying physics of the oscillation as well as the filament properties. The results support our previous theoretical conclusions that the restoring force of large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations is solar gravity, and the damping mechanism is the ongoing accumulation of mass onto the oscillating threads. Based on our previous work, we used the fitted parameters to determine the magnitude and radius of curvature of the dipped magnetic field along the filament, as well as the mass accretion rate onto the filament threads. These derived properties are nearly uniform along the filament, indicating a remarkable degree of homogeneity throughout the filament channel. Moreover, the estimated mass accretion rate implies that the footpoint heating responsible for the thread formation, according to the thermal nonequilibrium model, agrees with previous coronal heating estimates. We also estimated the magnitude of the energy released in the nearby event by studying the dynamic response of the filament threads, and concluded that the initiating event is likely to be a microflare. Using a nonlinear force-free field extrapolation of the photospheric magnetogram to estimate the coronal magnetic structure, we determined the possible connectivity between the jet source and the oscillating prominence segments. We will present the results of this investigation and discuss their implications for filament structure and heating.\nThis work was supported by NASA’s H-SR program.",

Because IBEX collects ENAs from the same “slice” of sky every six months, astronomical parallax can be used to try to determine the distance to the ribbon in a completely model-independent way. This is complicated because the ribbon is a diffuse structure and there are statistical and temporal variations in the ENA intensities. A lower limit for the distance to the IBEX ENA Ribbon with the first ten maps will be presented. More years of IBEX maps will continue to refine the distance.

            "abstract": "LiDAR is a powerful remote sensing tool allowing for forest metrics to be taken on varying scales, which ultimately provide important forestry variables used to calculate factors such as total biomass or leaf area index. These variables are most useful when calculated for individual trees throughout a stand, but in very dense forests, identifying single trees becomes more difficult by traditional means. Full forests can be quantified uniquely for the best understanding of ecological contributions as opposed to purely in situ tree inventories which are time consuming and extremely localized. Canopy height models (CHM) can be used to understand the forest as a whole. By inverting the CHM, the tree data becomes sinks in the ground, mimicking ponds; by applying watershed-related spatial analyst tools in ArcGIS and GrassGIS, the trees are delineated by makeshift \"flooding.\" Within this algorithm, the crown peaks are also extracted as an intermediate step to delineation, but this is a reliable means to obtain an accurate number of trees, as well as their individual heights with high reliability (R2 = 0.87). Delineated tree polygons can be directly overlaid onto different rasters to get many forest variables. In tightly clustered and very sparse stands, this method of delineation has a high level of accuracy. Following the workflow studies conducted on NEON LiDAR data on the Soaproot Saddle site, a ground-truth comparison was made with the Teakettle Experimental Forest site due to the availability of tree inventory data.

We seek approaches that are feasible for a global resolution, yet still reflect the enormous biodiversity of the deep microbial community and its associated metabolic pathways. We present a modeling framework grounded in thermodynamics and redox reaction stoichiometry that represents diverse microbial metabolisms explicitly. We describe a bacterial/archaeal functional type with two parameters: a growth efficiency representing the chemistry underlying a bacterial metabolism, and a rate limitation given by the rate of uptake of each of the necessary substrates for that metabolism. We then apply this approach to answer questions about microbial ecology. As a start, we resolve two dominant heterotrophic respiratory pathways- reduction of oxygen and nitrate- and associated microbial functional types. We combine these into an ecological model and a two-dimensional ocean circulation model to explore the organization, biogeochemistry, and ecology of oxygen minimum zones. Intensified upwelling and lateral transport conspire to produce an oxygen minimum at mid-depth, populated by anaerobic denitrifiers. This modeling approach should ultimately allow for the emergence of bacterial biogeography from competition of metabolisms and for the incorporation of microbial feedbacks to the climate system.",

An X5-class solar flare, the strongest to date in 2014, was observed by multiple spacecraft on 25 February at 05:00 UT. However, the source of this flare was well off the Sun-Earth line and the coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with the event arrived at Earth with a glancing blow. An NGDC product based on NOAA’s GOES magnetometer observations and a magnetopause model indicates the magnetopause compressed to below geosynchronous orbit around the time of the event. However, global geomagnetic activity was moderate and not generally expected to result in a significant WAAS degradation. This study summarizes the WAAS anomaly in the context of comprehensive space weather environmental characterization and highlights the value of geomagnetic activity indicators (e.g., magnetopause location) for situational awareness and predicting space weather geoeffectiveness.",

            "abstract": "The Dobe graben is a northwestern trending, Quaternary continental rift found within the east-central block of the Afar Depression (AD), Ethiopia. The AD is one of only few places where three active tectonic rift arms meet on land. Extensional rifting is ongoing in the Dobe graben as evident by the 1989 swarm of intermediate magnitude (5.7 < Ms < 6.3) earthquakes. Dobe graben extension occurs on steeply dipping faults, where the maximum displacement, fault length, heave and spacing spans in three orders of magnitude. Crustal deformation within the graben was measured through ascending and descending interferograms using the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR), C- Band (l = 5.6 cm) of the ENVISAT satellite. Results from the Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-INSAR) over a period of four years (05/20/2005 to 03/05/2010) suggests that the vertical component of deformation is distributed along a 50 km long NW trending zone in the Dobe graben. The vertical component of deformation is -0.5 to -0.3 cm along the graben axial rift floor likely representing subsidence due to riftingand +0.6 cm to 0.9 cm at the middle of the Dobe relay zone due to uplifting along the border escarpment faults. An estimate for the extension rate has been calculated from twelve traverses across the Dobe graben using Shuttle Rader Terrain Model (SRTM). Results show a deformation elongation (e) value ranging from 0.225 to 0.348. A fractal dimension of 0.03 from the graben floor was obtained for the measured population of fault throws (n= 162) in 12 traverses totaling 172 km. This value is interpreted to represent the dominant contribution to extension from faults with large throw. Moreover, frequency distribution of a natural fault population along the graben floor revealed a negative exponential law distribution indicating a strong strain partitioning within the active axial graben floor. A fractal dimension of 0.01 from the graben shoulder escarpment was obtained for the measured population of fault throws (n= 30) in 12 traverses totaling 48 km revealed a negative power fit distribution indicated a strong strain localization by the graben boarder faults.",

            "abstract": "Ice streams and outlet glaciers act as major pathways through which ice sheets discharge to the oceans, and increases in discharge have the potential to thin inland ice dramatically. Because of this potential, the dynamics of these outlets are especially scrutinized. Many ice streams and outlet glaciers have active subglacial hydraulic networks that can modulate sliding at the ice--bed interface. These networks are often sensitive to ocean forcing and, in particular, tides. Ocean tides create a periodic pressure condition at the ice-ocean boundary. The periodicity allows in-depth understanding of the effects of the subglacial system where ice flow is sensitive to water drainage. This sensitivity allows inference of the importance of the subglacial system relative to overall ice discharge in other areas of the ice sheet.\nHere, we show how tides affect subglacial till using mathematical and numerical models of subglacial water flow. Tides modulate effective pressure that, under certain circumstances, aids in till failure and slip. The critical parameter for tidal influence on slip is the compressibility of the water system. The compressibility is linked to the amount of water stored along the ice--bed interface. For ice streams, observations show two starkly different tidally-modulated behaviors. In one case, Rutford Ice Stream has a smoothly varying displacement with the tides. Whillans Ice Stream, however, shows discrete stick-slip events. We show how both of these types of behaviors can be related to hydraulic weakening of the slip interface and discuss implications of this phenomenon. Furthermore, we use a multiple stable state drainage model to understand how the drainage system is affected by morphological switches. Finally, we discuss how the ice stream cases relate to Greenland outlet glaciers and highlight the major differences.",

The challenges encountered in fractured media are usually more complex than un-fractured porous media because of the irregular connectivity patterns between individual fractures, large number of parameters, and wide distribution of parameter space. The Continuous Random Time Walk (CTRW) methodology provides a framework for modeling non-Fickian transport through fracture networks by employing probabilistic distributions to generate particle jump lengths and residence time spanning over orders of magnitude. We apply CTRW framework to model transport of radionuclides in the fractured volcanic tuff of Western Pahute Mesa located at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). By analyzing borehole data recorded at the NNSS, statistical attributes of fracture parameters are derived that are used to generate discrete fracture network (DFN) realizations. Through convolution of both particle travel time and fracture length distribution, transport is modeled on a continuum of spatial scales via the CTRW technique and the predictions are compared against DFN results to ascertain the efficacy of upscaling.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography is instrumental in mapping 3D velocity structures of the Earth’s interior based on travel-time measurements and waveform differences. Although both ray theory and other asymptotic methods have been successfully employed in global tomography, they are less accurate for long-period waves or steep velocity gradients. They also lack the ability to predict “non-geometrical” effects such as those for the core diffracted phases (Pdiff , Sdiff) which are crucial for mapping heterogeneities in the lowermost mantle (D'' layer). On the other hand, sensitivity kernels can be accurately calculated with no approximations by the interaction of forward and adjoint wavefields, both numerically simulated by spectral element methods.\nWe have previously shown that by taking advantage of the symmetry of 1D reference models, we can efficiently and speedily construct sensitivity kernels of both P and S wavespeeds based on the simulation and storage of forward and adjoint strain fields for select source and receiver geometries. We have also shown the effect on global models inverted based on ray theory versus finite-frequency kernels in a parallel LSQR inversion.\nThe CRUST1.0 model provides an updated version of the global sediment thickness on a finer 1° grid, based on active source seismic studies as well as receiver function studies. Crustal corrections for CRUST1.0 for the mantle may vary significantly from the ray-theoretical values, depending on crustal thickness, crustal velocities and wave period. We improve upon our previous model by incorporating the CRUST1.0 sediments and crustal corrections. This provides better response in the upper mantle and crustal regions. We produce this updated model for the S phases, and intend to extend the results to both P and S phases in the future.",

            "abstract": "Preterm birth is a serious health issue in the United States that contributes to over one-third of all infant deaths. Puerto Rico being one of the hot spots, preliminary research found that the high preterm birth rate can be associated with exposure to some contaminants in water used on daily basis. Puerto Rico has more than 200 contaminated sites including 16 active Superfund sites. Risk of exposure to contaminants is aggravated by unlined landfills lying over the karst regions, highly mobile and dynamic nature of the karst aquifers, and direct contact with surface water through sinkholes and springs. Much of the population in the island is getting water from natural springs or artesian wells that are connected with many of these potentially contaminated karst aquifers. Mobility of contaminants through surface water flows and reservoirs are largely known and are highly correlated with the variations in hydrologic events and conditions.\nIn this study, we quantify the spatial and temporal distribution of Puerto Rico’s surface water stores and fluxes to better understand potential impacts on the distribution of groundwater contamination. To quantify and characterize Puerto Rico’s surface waters, hydrologic modeling, remote sensing and field measurements are combined. Streamflow measurements are available from 27 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gauging stations with drainage areas ranging from 2 to 510 km2. Hillslope River Routing (HRR) model is used to simulate hourly streamflow from watersheds larger than 1 km2 that discharge to ocean. HRR model simulates vertical water balance, lateral surface and subsurface runoff and river discharge. The model consists of 4418 sub-catchments with a mean model unit area (i.e., sub-catchment) of 1.8 km2. Using gauged streamflow measurements for validation, we first assess model results for simulated discharge using three precipitation products: TRMM-3B42 (3 hour temporal resolution, 0.25 degree spatial resolution); NWS stage-III radar rainfall (~ 5 min temporal resolution and 4 km spatial resolution); and gauge measurements from 37 rainfall stations for the period 2000-2012.

Both instruments are designed to measure electrons and ions with energies between tens of keV and a few MeV, depending upon particle species. Using a new data analysis technique we've developed, the EPAM instrument can provide high energy-resolution, species-resolved energy spectra for a number of ion species including helium and oxygen which RBSPICE is designed to observe. Between May 22nd and 26th of 2013, EPAM observed an energetic particle event with a nearly flat energy spectra and greatly enhanced helium and oxygen composition. RBSPICE measured a strong surge in oxygen flux, but saw no correspondingly strong increase in the helium flux. We present a detailed analysis and comparison of the energetic ion spectra, composition, and timing measured by the ACE and the Van Allen Probes instruments in conjunction with magnetic field and energetic particle measurements from other spacecraft for this event, and provide a discussion on the injection of interplanetary oxygen into the inner magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Globally, the upper elevation margins of montane forests follow a latitudinal pattern, ranging from below 1000 m at high latitudes to above 3000 m on continental tropical mountains. Forest lines on oceanic islands are distinctly lower, but are also latitude dependent. While proposed mechanisms to explain forest line position are generally related to effects of low temperature, including tissue damage from freezing and slow growth, aridity has been suggested as a possible cause of the lower oceanic island forest lines. A relatively undisturbed forest line is found on Haleakalā Volcano, on the Island of Maui at an elevation of around 2000 m. Forest on Haleakalā does not appear to be limited by low temperature; mean annual temperature at the forest line (8.8-10.5°C) is well above the suggested threshold growing season temperature. Instead, the position of this ecotone coincides with the mean elevation of the trade wind inversion (TWI), which separates the moist marine atmospheric layer from arid upper air. Abrupt changes in moisture-related climate variables are found at the TWI, including one of the steepest mean annual rainfall gradients in the world. In recent work, microclimate during drought was shown to play a critical role in structuring the Haleakalā forest line, the position of which was most strongly related to relative humidity during a strong El Niño-induced drought. The relationship between El Niño-driven drought and ecotone position was tested in long-term paleoecological data. Reconstructions of the cloud forest’s upper limit and moisture balance over the past 3,300 years were strongly associated with paleorecords of El Niño event frequency. The forest ecotone may be particularly responsive to strong, short-duration drought events because taxa here, particularly the isohydric dominant canopy tree Metrosideros polymorpha, are near their physiological limits. Minimum leaf water potential in M. polymorpha near the forest line is close to the turgor loss point under non-drought conditions, indicating that drier conditions may cause moisture stress and may be an important driver of ecotone position. Overall, data suggest that the forest line is controlled by moisture limitation and its current position may be vulnerable to increasing drought frequency associated with climate warming.",

It is demonstrated that the depletion of closed flux in the near Earth magnetotail and the increase of open lobe magnetic flux can lead to the evolution of two separate very thin current sheets in the near Earth and the mid tail regions of the magnetosphere. The relative intensity and width of these current sheets depends on the details of the flux circulation and additional solar wind properties. Both of these current sheets can lead to the onset of magnetic reconnection. We discuss the physics of the dual current sheet formation and implications for the properties of magnetic reconnection in either current sheet. It is suggested that only reconnection onset in the near Earth current sheet may be consistent with substorm expansion because the flux tube entropy depletion of mid tail reconnection appears insufficient to cause geosynchronous particle injection and dipolarization. Therefore reconnection in the mid tail current sheet is more likely associated with flux tube entropy depleted bursty bulk flows.",

            "abstract": "Surplus nitrate (NO3-) in streams is a persistent problem for many aquatic ecosystems and denitrification represents the primary removal process for NO3- in streams. Hyporheic zones can have high denitrification potentials, but the role of the hyporheic denitrification on reach and network scale NO3- removal is unknown because it is difficult to estimate using current methods. Here, we develop a new approach that links existing independent and complementary multi-scale measurements of denitrification and total NO3- uptake. This approach is then used to quantify the role of hyporheic NO3- removal in a 303m reach of a third-order agricultural stream in western Oregon, USA. The reach scale NO3- dynamics were characterized with steady-state 15N-NO3- tracer addition experiments and solute transport modeling, while the hyporheic conditions were measured via in situ biogeochemical and groundwater modeling. Our linking of multi-scale approaches revealed that the hyporheic NO3- removal (rate coefficient λHZ = 0.007 h-1) accounted for 17% of the observed total reach NO3- uptake, and 32% of the reach denitrification estimated from the 15N experiments. The primary limitations of hyporheic denitrification at the reach scale were labile dissolved organic carbon availability (low hyporheic SUVA254) and the restricted size of the hyporheic zone due to anthropogenic channelization (sediment thickness ≤ 1.5 m). Linking multi-scale methods enabled us to make one of the first ever reach-scale estimates of hyporheic influence on stream NO3- and denitrification dynamics. Further, this study also demonstrates that the traditional reach scale tracer experimental designs and subsequent transport modeling cannot be used alone to directly investigate the role of the hyporheic zone on reach scale water and solute dynamics.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that throughout the central and eastern U.S. there has been a marked increase in seismicity since 2009, at least some of which appears to increased wastewater injection. No area has seen a greater increase in seismicity than Oklahoma. In this paper, we utilize newly available information on in situ stress orientation and relative magnitudes, the distribution of high volume injection wells and knowledge of the intervals used for waste water disposal to identify the factors potentially contributing to the occurrence of triggered seismicity. While there are a number of sites where in situ stress data has been successfully used to identify potentially active faults, we are investigating whether this methodology can be implemented throughout a state utilizing the types of information frequently available in areas of oil and gas development. As an initial test of this concept, we have been compiling stress orientation data from wells throughout Oklahoma provided by private industry. Over fifty new high quality data points, principally drilling-induced tensile fractures observed in image logs, result in a greatly improved understanding of the stress field in much of the state. A relatively uniform ENE direction of maximum compressive stress is observed, although stress orientations (and possibly relative stress magnitudes) differ in the southern and southwestern parts of the state. The proposed methodology can be tested in the area of the NE-trending fault that produced the M 5+ earthquakes in the Prague, OK sequence in 2011, and the Meers fault in southwestern OK, that produced a M~7 reverse faulting earthquake about 1100 years ago. This methodology can also be used to essentially rule out slip on other major faults in the area, such as the ~N-S trending Nemaha fault system. Additional factors leading to the occurrence of relatively large triggered earthquakes in Oklahoma are 1) the overall increase in injection volumes throughout the state in recent years (especially in some particular areas) 2) the injection of waste water in a geologic formation laying directly above crystalline basement rocks and 3) the widespread distribution of injection wells.",

            "abstract": "The response of net atmosphere-land carbon exchange under future warming and increasing CO2 is key to the projection of future climate change. However, current land-surface model differ widely in their prediction of the land carbon sink by 2100. These models are increasingly complex and entail a large array of mechanisms. Consequently, the number of “knobs”(i.e. model parameters) available to tune model results has increased drastically. In principal, objectively tuning all parameters of a model to the measurements at hand should yield a best configuration. But in practice, it is important to know structure of data that helps best to improve a model’s long-term carbon sink trajectory; or alternatively whether there are variables where a model data mismatch would not necessarily compromise the model outcome.\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis of LM3VN, a land surface model with a prognostic nitrogen cycle, by varying 60 parameters, and checked for correspondence between the sensitivity of the model’s long-term (1850-2100) carbon sink and contemporary (1980-2006) calibration variables. We found, that few parameters had a strong impact on the long term carbon sequestration, showing that the model entails a number of negative feedbacks. Importantly, the parameters to which the model was most sensitive were found to vary between individual gridcells, supporting the idea of point-specific and regional model assessment. The model’s prediction of the current total carbon inventory correlated well with the prediction of the long term carbon sink, indicating that evaluation of models against current carbon inventories could improve their prediction of carbon sequestration over the this century, although the aggregation of such data is challenging. A promising correspondence is that of the interannual variability of net carbon exchange, we found this the correlation to be significant in a majority of gridcells (73%) but weak if globally aggregated. Overall, such targeted sensitivity analysis may help to select data sets and inform observation networks in order to constrain the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to global change factors, particularly if broadened across models and scenarios.",

These changes are driven primarily by ice-ocean interaction beneath ice shelves, but existing observations of the spatial distribution, timing, and magnitude of ice shelf melt are limited.\nUsing the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline, we generated digital elevation models (DEMs) with ~2 m posting from all ~450 available WorldView-1/2 along-track stereopairs for the Amundsen Sea sector. A novel iterative closest point algorithm was used to coregister DEMs to filtered Operation IceBridge ATM/LVIS data and ICESat-1 GLAS data, offering optimal sub-meter horizontal/vertical accuracy. The corrected DEMs were used to produce annual mosaics for the entire ~500x700 km region with focused, sub-annual products for ice shelves and grounding zones.\nThese mosaics provide spatially-continuous measurements of ice shelf topography with unprecedented detail. Using these data, we derive estimates of ice shelf thickness for regions in hydrostatic equilibrium and map networks of sub-shelf melt channels for the Pine Island (PIG), Thwaites, Crosson, and Dotson ice shelves. We also document the break-up of the Thwaites ice shelf and PIG rift evolution leading up to the 2013 calving event.\nEulerian difference maps document 2010-2014 thinning over fast-flowing ice streams and adjacent grounded ice. These data reveal the greatest thinning rates over the Smith Glacier ice plain and slopes beyond the margins of the fast-flowing PIG trunk. Difference maps also highlight the filling of at least two subglacial lakes ~30 km upstream of the PIG grounding line in 2011.\nLagrangian difference maps reveal the spatial distribution of ice shelf thinning, which can primarily be attributed to basal melt. Preliminary results show focused ice shelf thinning within troughs and large basal channels, especially along the western margin of the Dotson ice shelf.\nThese new data provide critical observations that will improve our understanding ice-ocean interaction and mass loss for the Amundsen Sea sector on local and regional scales.",

Ice storage on Antarctica also influences the global water cycle. Through upwelling of deep waters, the Southern Ocean is an important regulator of atmospheric CO2. To better constrain the evolution of paleoclimate in this region over major climate transitions of the Cenozoic, we estimated ocean temperatures using clumped isotope thermometry. Clumped isotope thermometry is a thermodynamically-based stable isotope thermometer that can be used to constrain temperatures previously estimated using other paleothermometers (which in turn leads to constraints on ice volume), as it allows the exclusion of water isotope composition from temperature estimates (unlike the δ18O thermometer). We previously have published calibrations for foraminifera and mollusks, two of the major archives used in this study. Critical transitions investigated include the Eocene-Oligocene boundary and the Middle Miocene Climate Transition.

            "abstract": "The notion that groundwater remediation is transport-limited emphasizes the coupling between physical (i.e., hydrodynamic), geochemical, and microbiological processes in the subsurface. Here we leverage this coupling to promote groundwater remediation using the approach of engineered injection and extraction. In this approach, inspired by the literature on chaotic advection, uncontaminated groundwater is injected and extracted through a manifold of wells surrounding the contaminated plume. The potential of this approach lies in its ability to actively manipulate the velocity field near the contaminated plume, generating plume spreading above and beyond that resulting from aquifer heterogeneity. Plume spreading, in turn, promotes mixing and reaction by chemical and biological processes. Simulations have predicted that engineered injection and extraction generates (1) chaotic advection whose characteristics depend on aquifer heterogeneity, and (2) faster rates and increased extent of groundwater remediation. This presentation focuses on a complimentary effort to experimentally demonstrate these predictions experimentally. In preparation for future work using refractive index matched (RIM) porous media, the experiments reported here use a Hele-Shaw apparatus containing silicone oil. Engineered injection and extraction is used to manipulate the geometry of an initially circular plume of black pigment, and photographs record the plume geometry after each step of injection of extraction. Image analysis, using complimentary Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches, reveals the thickness and variability of the dispersion zone surrounding the deformed plume of black pigment. The size, shape, and evolution of this dispersion zone provides insight into the interplay between engineered injection and extraction, which generates plume structure, and dispersion (here Taylor dispersion), which destroys plume structure. These experiments lay the groundwork for application of engineered injection and extraction at field sites where improvements to the rate, extent, and cost of remediation are hoped.",

            "abstract": "Scientific literacy has been defined as the foremost challenge of this decade (AAAS, 2012). The Geological Society of American in its position statement postis that due to the systemic nature of the discipline of earth science, it is the most effective way to engage students in STEM disciplines. Given that the most common place for exposure to earth sciences is at the freshman level for non majors, we decided to transform a freshman introductory geology course to an active, student centered course, using an inquiry based approach. Our focus was to ensure the students saw the earth sciences as broadly applicative field, and not an esoteric science.\nTo achieve this goal, we developed a series of problems that required the students to apply the concepts acquired through their self guided learning into the different topics of the course. This self guided learning took the form of didactic content uploaded into the learning management system (the various elements used to deliver the content were designed video clips, short text based lectures, short formative assessments, discussion boards and other web based discovery exercises) with the class time devoted to problem solving.\nA comparison of student performance in the active learning classroom vs. a traditional classroom as measured on a geoscience concept inventory (the questions were chosen by a third party who was not teaching either courses) showed that the the students in the active learning classroom scored 10% higher on the average in comparison to the traditional class. In addition to this heightened performance, the students in the active classroom also showed a higher degree of content retention 8 weeks after the semester had ended. This session will share the design process, some exercises and efficacy data collected.",

            "abstract": "This presentation will describe 15 years of MODIS observations of the thermal flux from Earth’s sub-aerially erupting volcanoes. The MODVOLC algorithm has been providing data regarding volcanic eruptions on Earth to the volcanological community since the launch of Terra MODIS, via the internet, in near-real-time (http:modis.higp.hawaii.edu). During this time, eruptions at 102 volcanoes have been observed, including activity associated with mafic lava flows, lava lakes, vent-based explosive activity and felsic lava domes. This presentation will present an overview of how MODIS has documented every eruption to occur on Earth since 2000, and will describe some of the more interesting result that have been obtained from the analysis of this archive. The total amount of energy radiated into the atmosphere can be divided into two parts: a baseline level of emission which has increased gradually over this 15 period, superimposed on which are large “spikes” attributable to large, lava-flow-forming eruptions. The most intense eruption during this period of time was the 2004 eruption of Nyamuragira, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, whilst the largest magnitude event was the 2012-2013 eruption of Tolbachik, Russia. Spatio-temporal patterns in thermal output will be addressed. Time-series analysis of heat flux from these 102 volcanoes has revealed while some volcanoes exhibit statistically significant periodicity in the magnitude of their heat output, many do not.",

            "abstract": "Accurate and timely information on rice crop growth and yield helps governments and other stakeholders adapting their economic policies and enables relief organizations to better anticipate and coordinate relief efforts in the wake of a natural catastrophe. Such delivery of rice growth and yield information is made possible by regular earth observation using space-born Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology combined with crop modeling approach to estimate yield. Radar-based remote sensing is capable of observing rice vegetation growth irrespective of cloud coverage, an important feature given that in incidences of flooding the sky is often cloud-covered. The system allows rapid damage assessment over the area of interest. Rice yield monitoring is based on a crop growth simulation and SAR-derived key information, particularly start of season and leaf growth rate. Results from pilot study sites in South and South East Asian countries suggest that incorporation of SAR data into crop model improves yield estimation for actual yields. Remote-sensing data assimilation into crop model effectively capture responses of rice crops to environmental conditions over large spatial coverage, which otherwise is practically impossible to achieve. Such improvement of actual yield estimates offers practical application such as in a crop insurance program. Process-based crop simulation model is used in the system to ensure climate information is adequately captured and to enable mid-season yield forecast.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the typical method of adding mass-action reaction terms to the advection-dispersion equation overestimates the field-scale reaction rates. The mismatch is usually attributed to poor mixing. A recent method, based on a purely Langragian particle tracking (PT) theoretical development, successfully reproduces the results of mixing-limited bimolecular reaction (A+B → C) from two benchmark experiments. In this numerical method, the reactants are represented by particles. The reactions are determined by a combination of two probabilities that govern whether: 1) reactant particles are collocated during a short time interval, and 2) two collocated particles favorably transform into a reaction. We extend the application of the PT method to biodegradation, which is commonly characterized by more complex Michaelis-Menten (Monod) chemical kinetics. The advantage of the PT method is that it explains the variation of reaction rate based on mixing-controlled particle collisions instead of using empirical parameters. The PT method is not only able to match the Michaelis-Menten (Monod) equation under ideal conditions, but also is able to capture the characteristics of non-ideal conditions such as imperfect mixing, disequilibrium, and limited availability of the active sites. Furthermore, for the ultimate goal of applying the Langragian PT method directly to the field scale problems, this method is implemented to the simulation of carbon tetrachloride (CT) biodegradation at the Schoolcraft, Michigan, site, where the hydraulic properties and reaction kinetics are well understood.",

            "abstract": "Uranium contaminates groundwater at many sites throughout the United States. At the aquifer in Rifle, CO, U(IV) has been found to accumulate in natural organic matter (NOM)-rich sediments comprising buried alluvial material. We expect that NOM, which is composed of detrital plant material and microbial biomass and necromass, profoundly influences the speciation of U(IV). Specifically, we hypothesize that NOM forms stable complexes with U(IV) (i.e., “noncrystalline” U(IV)), particularly through organic phosphorus moieties associated with bacteria and exopolymeric substances (EPS). Complexation with NOM can help to explain why noncrystalline U(IV) is more abundant in the subsurface than the mineral uraninite (UO2). The abundance and relative reactivity of non-crystalline U(IV) suggests that it drives U fate and transport in the subsurface.\nW are examining the reduction of U(VI) and subsequent complexation of U(IV) in model NOM systems comprising homogenized, partially degraded plant material, which is analogous to the detrital plant material abundant in Rifle sediments, and its associated microbial consortia. We employ a suite of spectroscopic (X-ray absorption spectroscopies) and microscopic (scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry) tools that allow us to identify the number and types of coordinating ligands and the distribution of U with respect to NOM components, including bacterial cells, plant matter and entrained minerals. In preliminary experiments we found that 50 - 100 % of U(VI) was reduced to U(IV) within several days. Furthermore, NOM was observed to sorb both U(VI), as a carbonyl complex, and U(IV), possibly as a phosphoryl complex. Further microscopic analyses are designed to elucidate whether U(IV)-P complexes are associated with bacteria or EPS. Our research suggests a new, more complicated model for U(IV) speciation in subsurface sediments, in which complexation by NOM, as opposed to mineral formation, controls U reactivity.",

            "abstract": "Tsunamis have inflicted death and destruction on the coastlines of the world throughout history. The occurrence of tsunamis and the resulting effects have been collected and studied as far back as the second millennium B.C. The knowledge gained from cataloging and examining these events has led to significant changes in our understanding of tsunamis, tsunami sources, and methods to mitigate the effects of tsunamis. The most significant, not surprisingly, are often the most devastating, such as the 2011 Tohoku, Japan earthquake and tsunami. The goal of this poster is to give a brief overview of the occurrence of tsunamis and then focus specifically on several significant tsunamis. There are various criteria to determine the most significant tsunamis: the number of deaths, amount of damage, maximum runup height, had a major impact on tsunami science or policy, etc. As a result, descriptions will include some of the most costly (2011 Tohoku, Japan), the most deadly (2004 Sumatra, 1883 Krakatau), and the highest runup ever observed (1958 Lituya Bay, Alaska). The discovery of the Cascadia subduction zone as the source of the 1700 Japanese “Orphan” tsunami and a future tsunami threat to the U.S. northwest coast, contributed to the decision to form the U.S. National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. The great Lisbon earthquake of 1755 marked the beginning of the modern era of seismology. Knowledge gained from the 1964 Alaska earthquake and tsunami helped confirm the theory of plate tectonics. The 1946 Alaska, 1952 Kuril Islands, 1960 Chile, 1964 Alaska, and the 2004 Banda Aceh, tsunamis all resulted in warning centers or systems being established.\n\nThe data descriptions on this poster were extracted from NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) global historical tsunami database. Additional information about these tsunamis, as well as water level data can be found by accessing the NGDC website www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/",

            "abstract": "Space weather’s effects upon the near-Earth environment are due to dynamic changes in the energy transfer processes from the Sun’s photons, particles, and fields. The coupling between the solar and galactic high-energy particles, the magnetosphere, and atmospheric regions can significantly affect humans and our technology as a result of radiation exposure. Space Environment Technologies (SET) has developed innovative, new space weather observations that will become part of the toolset that is transitioned into operational use. One prototype operational system for providing timely information about the effects of space weather is SET’s Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) system. ARMAS will provide the “weather” of the radiation environment to improve aircraft crew and passenger safety. Through several dozen flights the ARMAS project has successfully demonstrated the operation of a micro dosimeter on commercial aviation altitude aircraft that captures the real-time radiation environment resulting from Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Energetic Particles. The real-time radiation exposure is computed as an effective dose rate (body-averaged over the radiative-sensitive organs and tissues in units of microsieverts per hour); total ionizing dose is captured on the aircraft, downlinked in real-time via Iridium satellites, processed on the ground into effective dose rates, compared with NASA’s Langley Research Center (LaRC) most recent Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation System (NAIRAS) global radiation climatology model runs, and then made available to end users via the web and smart phone apps. We are extending the dose measurement domain above commercial aviation altitudes into the stratosphere with a collaborative project organized by NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) called Upper-atmospheric Space and Earth Weather eXperiment (USEWX). In USEWX we will be flying on the ER-2 high altitude aircraft a micro dosimeter for effective dose rate measurements and a thermal neutron monitor to characterize Single Event Effects (SEEs) in avionics. In this presentation we describe recent ARMAS and USEWX advances that will ultimately provide operational users with real-time dose and dose rate data for human tissue and avionics exposure risk mitigation.",

            "abstract": "The chemistry of rocks and soils analyzed by Curiosity represent a diverse population including mafic and felsic compositions. The data from Gale Crater can be compared with the accumulated data for martian materials from other landing sites, the Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) experiment on the Mars Odyssey Spacecraft, and the data for martian meteorites. Variations in the CaO/Al2O3 ratio in primitive igneous rocks can provide a fundamental signature of crustal formation on Mars. Abundances of other elements like Fe in the surface rocks can reflect later differentiation effects. Comparing the chemistry of Gale samples with other martian data must take into account the different geochemical components in the samples. The most important distinction is between the volatile elements including H, C, Cl, S, and the lithophile elements including Al, Si, Fe, Mn, Ca, Na, Mg, etc. The large enrichments of the volatile elements SO3, Cl, and H2O in the soils may represent contributions from volcanic aerosols or other local sources of volatiles. Alteration and transport of fluid mobile major elements by aqueous or hydrothermal processes could complicate the estimation of crustal abundances of elements such as Ca but early results suggest little or no chemical fractionation attributable to alteration. Other clues to the role of fluids can come from the ChemCam data for the highly fluid mobile elements lithium and manganese. Regional comparisons of chemistry only make sense when considering the absolute abundances and elemental ratios within the different component classes. The use of elemental ratios avoids the problem of the correction required to get volatile-free abundance data for comparison of GRS data with meteorites and landing site rocks measured by the ChemCam Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) experiment and Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS). The huge size of the GRS footprint makes it especially difficult to make the required corrections. Eventually data from the whole suite of experiments on Curiosity will allow us to improve volatile corrections for GRS observations of Gale Crater and the rest of Mars.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic consistency of eight reanalysis datasets is evaluated in terms of momentum budget of polar stratospheric vortex. Their consistency is quantified by computing the residue of 6-hourly zonal-mean wind tendency that is not explained by zonal-mean momentum equation. Both Eulerian-mean and transformed Eulerian-mean equations are considered. In all datasets, absolute residues rapidly increase with heights partly due to unresolved wave forcings (e.g., gravity waves) in momentum equations. However, in comparison to early generation datasets, modern reanalysis datasets generally show an improved dynamic consistency at all levels. The improvement from NCEP-NCAR to NCEP-DOE and to NCEP-CFSR reanalysis data is very discernible. Similar improvement is also found from ERA-40 to ERA-Interim, and from JRA-25 to JRA-55 data.\nThe residues and individual forcing terms of momentum equations are further evaluated in the course of the vacillation cycle of the stratospheric polar vortex, i.e., quasi-periodic intensification and weakening of the wintertime stratospheric winds, to identify the source of the residues and their inter-data differences. The residues vary in function of the vacillation cycle with relatively small residues in weak and strong vortex states but large residues in intermediate state, indicating that dynamic consistency of reanalysis data may depend on the mean state. Throughout the vacillation cycle, the largest discrepancy among datasets is found in the Coriolis torques acting on the Eulerian-mean circulation, explaining a large portion of inter-data spread of the residues. Transformed Eulerian-mean diagnostics of wave-mean flow interaction, such as the EP-flux divergence, are generally consistent across reanalysis dataset. This indicates that a good representation of mean meridional circulation is crucial for dynamic consistency of stratospheric wind variability in the reanalysis data.",

            "abstract": "Variations in the isotopic composition of precipitation are determined by fractionation processes which occur during temperature and humidity dependent phase changes associated with evaporation and condensation. Oxygen stable isotope ratios have therefore been frequently used as a source of palaeoclimate data from a variety of proxy archives. Exploitation of this record from ombrotrophic peatlands, where the source water used in cellulose synthesis is derived solely from precipitation, has been mostly limited to Northern Hemisphere Sphagnum-dominated bogs, with limited application in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) or in peatlands dominated by vascular plants.\nThroughout New Zealand (NZ), the preserved root matrix of the restionaceous wire rush (Empodisma spp.) forms deep peat deposits. NZ provides an ideal location to undertake empirical research into oxygen isotope fractionation in vascular peatlands because sites are ideally suited to single taxon analysis, preserve potentially high resolution full Holocene palaeoclimate records and are situated in the climatically sensitive SH mid-latitudes. Crucially, large gradients exist in the mean isotopic composition of precipitation across NZ, caused primarily by the relative influence of different climate modes.\nWe test the capacity for δ18O analysis of Empodisma alpha cellulose from ombrotrophic restiad peatlands in NZ to provide a methodology for developing palaeoclimate records. We took surface plant, water and precipitation samples over spatial (six sites spanning >10° latitude) and temporal (monthly measurements over one year) gradients. We found a strong link between the isotopic compositions of surface root water, the most likely source water for plant growth, and precipitation in both datasets. Back-trajectory modelling of precipitation moisture source for rain days prior to sampling showed clear seasonality in the temporal data that was reflected in surface root water. The link between source water and plant cellulose was less clear, although mechanistic modelling predicted mean cellulose values within published error margins for both datasets. Improved understanding and modelling of δ18O in restiad peatlands should enable use of this approach as a new source of palaeoclimate data to reconstruct changes in past atmospheric circulation",

            "abstract": "Over the years, there have been frequent reports of a dependence of hydraulic conductivity (K) estimates on test volume (scale). This dependence is commonly demonstrated using results from laboratory permeameter tests and from slug and pumping tests. Typically, K estimates from pumping tests are reported to be considerably larger than those from slug tests, which, in turn, are considerably larger than those from permeameter tests. Despite the large body of evidence, a key question remains unresolved – is this relationship produced by methodological differences or a natural underlying scale dependence in K? The most effective means to resolve this question is to use a single technique that can be configured to span orders of magnitude in test scale. The constant-rate pumping test is just such a technique. In the first few minutes to tens of minutes of pumping, the affected volume is relatively small. In contrast, after days of pumping, this volume can be orders of magnitude larger. If there is an underlying scale dependence, it should be revealed by K estimates determined from different durations of pumping. We have been investigating this issue using pumping tests in unconsolidated aquifers in central and western Kansas. In western Kansas, irrigation wells are pumped nearly continuously for the entire growing season. If nearby observation wells are available, we can use this near-continuous pumping as a long-duration, albeit imperfectly controlled, pumping test to increase the scale of the investigation. An initial assessment of these formal and ad-hoc pumping tests has found no evidence of a scale dependence in K; these tests are typically characterized by homogeneous aquifer behavior at small to moderate times of pumping after which boundary effects become dominant. Thus, if there is an underlying scale dependence, it is below the scale of these observations, which would have to be considered rather serendipitous. We can assess the relationship at smaller scales by placing observation wells immediately adjacent to the pumping well and by relating slug tests to pumping tests in the same well using deconvolution approaches. Although further work is needed to finally resolve this long-standing conundrum, we have seen no indication that the reported dependence is a reflection of an underlying scale dependence in K.",

A laboratory study to examine the near bed turbulent evolution and sediment bed response was conducted at near field scale. Two-dimensional observations of the flow field were obtained with a submerged Particle Imaging Velocimetry system looking at a 9 cm by 17 cm region just above a movable ripple sand bed subjected to forcing caused by free-surface gravity waves with 30 cm wave height and a 4 second period. Robust particle tracking techniques and high resolution cameras allowed for millimeter scale resolution of the velocity field and sea floor evolution. Periods of high suspension were concomitant with high near-bed velocities as observed with a high resolution acoustic Doppler profiler. The growth of the boundary layer was particularly observable during the longer duration offshore directed flow. The vortex is created during flow reversal in the ripple trough, growing to roughly the height of the ripple. The coherent structure is ejected during the subsequent half wave cycle and sheared apart at the peak of the onshore directed flow. The high shear associated with the vortices are correlated to sediment suspension and subsequent sediment transport resulting in an onshore migration rate of 1.5 mm/min.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater accounts for 25% of the United States’ total water supply. Despite this importance, research efforts related to the impact of climate change on water resources have focused on surface water projections. Here we present results from a United States Geological Survey John Wesley Powell Center Group that synthesized current knowledge on groundwater recharge and the impact of climate change on recharge across the western US (west of 100o longitude). The specific aquifers considered included the High Plains Aquifer, San Pedro basin, Death Valley regional flow system, Wasatch Front aquifers, Central Valley Aquifer, Columbia Plateau Aquifer system, Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Glacial Aquifer, Williston basin and a regional overview of research on mountain aquifer systems. Combining existing studies on projected climate-change effects on recharge (available for half of the chosen systems) with expert knowledge of the remaining systems, several key patterns emerge across the region. First, our estimates indicate declines in recharge across the southern aquifers of 10-20% on average but with a wide range of uncertainty that surrounds zero change. Second, the northern tier of aquifers will likely see no change to slight increases in recharge. Third, mountain system recharge is expected to decline across the entire region due to changes in winter precipitation leading to decreased snowpack. Several critical knowledge gaps contributed uncertainty to our estimates. First, more studies coupling climate projections to groundwater systems are needed. Second, a generally poor understanding of mountain system processes is a source of significant uncertainty. Third, the response of focused recharge to potential changes in precipitation intensity and frequency is uncertain due to a lack of process understanding and the limited ability of climate projections to forecast changes in precipitation. Finally, feedbacks between climate, irrigation practices, and recharge result in significant uncertainties in several highly developed aquifer systems regarding how they might respond to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial biosphere models are being used to forecast ecosystem response to future climate change. However, the predictions of these models do not agree, and their ability to accurately represent decadal- and longer-scale ecological processes has rarely been tested.\nHere we investigate how the structure of the terrestrial biosphere models affects their ability to accurately simulate vegetation dynamics over the past 1000 years. Six models and model variations are involved, including the Ecosystem Demography 2 model (ED2), the Community Land Model (CLM4.0, CLM4.5, CLM4.5-dynamic vegetation), and the Lund-Postdam-Jena models (LPJ-GUESS and LPJ-wsl). Using common paleoclimatic drivers and modeling protocols, we simulated vegetation changes in the northeastern US with these models for the past 1000 years. We compared the model outputs with paleoecological/historical benchmark datasets (paleo-vegetation data reconstructed from fossil pollen records and pre-EuroAmerican vegetation data from the Public Land Survey and Town Proprietor Surveys) to evaluate model performance. We characterized the models based on how they represented photosynthesis, water relations, soil, biogeochemical cycling, and vegetation dynamics.\nModels with similar structures behaved more similarly over time; we found that model attributes of both fast (e.g. photosynthesis) and slow processes (e.g. vegetation dynamics) affect model long-term predictions. However, the effect of model attributes varies among regions and across time.\nIn addition to model structure, parameter uncertainty among models also appears to contribute to the differences in model output. We are currently working on assimilating paleoecological data into a subset of the terrestrial biosphere models to constrain the key model parameters and state variables, and in turn, to better evaluate the effect of model structure alone on model performance.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Extension are strongly influenced by mesoscale eddies, which have spatial scales of order 10-100 km. The effects of these eddies are poorly represented in many state-of-the-art ocean general circulation models (GCMs) due to the inadequate spatial resolution of these models. In this study we examine the response of the large-scale ocean circulation to the rectified effects of eddy forcing - i.e., the role played by surface-intensified mesoscale eddies in sustaining and modulating an eastward jet that separates from an intense western boundary current (WBC). For this purpose a primitive equations ocean model (the MITgcm) in an idealized wind-forced double-gyre configuration is integrated at eddy-resolving resolution to reach a forced-dissipative equilibrium state that captures the essential dynamics of WBC-extension jets. The rectified eddy forcing is diagnosed as a stochastic function of the large-scale state, this being characterized by the manner in which potential vorticity (PV) contours become deformed. Specifically, a stochastic function based on the Laplacian of the material rate of change of PV is examined in order to compare the primitive equations results with those of a quasi-geostrophic model in which this function has shown some utility as a parameterization of eddy effects (Porta Mana and Zanna, 2014). The key question is whether an eddy parameterization based on quasi-geostrophic scaling is able to carry over to a system in which this scaling is not imposed (i.e. the primitive equations), in which unbalanced motions occur.",

            "abstract": "Many coastlines throughout the world are in a net erosional state due to factors such as climate change and anthropogenic activities. While most coastal erosion occurs episodically during major storms, beaches recover during extended periods of low wave energy. Despite the importance of beach recovery on limiting coastal vulnerability, the mechanisms driving onshore sediment transport are much less well understood than those of storm-driven offshore transport. Intertidal bar (i.e., swash bar) welding to the shoreline is one proposed mechanism of sediment delivery from the nearshore to the backshore. However, studies of swash bars and their contribution to beach building have been scarce because of the sporadic nature of these events and difficulty measuring sediment fluxes in the intertidal zone.\nSeveral beaches in the US Pacific Northwest are prograding rapidly in part due to highly dissipative conditions and an abundant sediment supply. For example, at South Beach State Park (SBSP) in Newport, OR the shoreline accreted at an average of 6 m/yr from 1960 to 2002. To explore the role of intertidal bar welding on supplying sediment to this dynamic backshore, we recently completed a boutique field experiment at SBSP. Topographic and bathymetric surveys carried out over 9 months document the short term (<weekly) through seasonal responses to the nearshore planform (-15m to +10m). A mooring was deployed offshore SBSP to measure waves, currents, suspended sediment concentrations, and the density structure of the water column to characterize the environmental conditions driving the observed morphologic changes. A co-located X-band marine radar and meteorological station provide information regarding spatially complex wave transformations and the forces driving aeolian sediment transport, respectively.\nOur observations at SBSP indicate a dynamic coastal landscape including multiple nearshore bars. During the experiment we observed onshore migration of the subtidal bars, significant changes to the swash bar system, and progradation of the subaerial beach. With this new dataset we are exploring the importance of intertidal bar welding on supplying sediment to the backshore as well as the environmental conditions and physical mechanisms that promote onshore delivery of sediment.",

            "abstract": "Climate change has caused a change in the Sierra Nevada snowpack and the timing of its snowmelt, threatening a valuable water resource that provides for 25 million people and 5 million hectares of irrigated land. Understanding past and future variations in the snowpack is crucial in order to plan future water management. Of particular importance would be an archive of the variability of past snowfall, which can be recorded through the isotopic records found in local paleoproxies (e.g., diatoms). We propose to quantify the relationship between sources of atmospheric moisture in the Sierra Nevada and the isotopic composition of its snowpack to uncover whether isotopic variations recorded in paloearchives are a result of the isotopic composition of the precipitation, thereby showing whether these archives could serve as a reliable source of atmospheric moisture. Preliminary analysis conducted from December 2012 to March 2013 at Sequoia National Park resulted in statistically significant correlations between the isotopic composition of the winter snowfall and storm track trajectories. It was observed that storms originating from more northern latitudes had predominantly lighter isotopes (more negative δ 2H and δ18O) and sub-tropical/tropical Pacific storms showed more positive δ 2H and δ18O. This pattern reflects the isotopic gradient of the Pacific Ocean and can prove useful when interpreting the climatic significance of the δ2H and δ18O values in analyzed proxies.\nWhile our initial investigation was promising, the winter of 2012 -2013 was abnormally dry compared to long-term averages. Before directing our investigation to known paleoproxies, we aim to determine if the correlation between storm tracks and isotopic composition of precipitation holds in years with average and above average precipitation through analysis of archived samples from calendar years 2007 – 2011 from Giant Forest in Sequoia National Park (southern sierra) and Manzanita Lake in Lassen Volcanic National Park (northern sierra).",

            "abstract": "Stunting, when children are shorter than average for their age, poses serious problems for short- and long-term development of individuals, families and communities. Stunting is linked to increase risk or illness or death, reduced educational attainment, reduced earnings and increases the likelihood (for girls) that the next generation of children will be stunted. Stunting occurs as a result of a culmination of inadequate food/calories, experiences with frequent illness, poor care and low weight at birth. Because almost 40% of children under 5 in the developing world suffer from stunting, understanding the community, household and individual components that lead to stunting are vital as these countries aim to improve children’s health and development.\nWe focus this research on childhood stunting in the neighboring countries of Mali and Burkina Faso, two of the poorest and least developed countries in the world. The populations of both countries are heavily reliant on subsistence farming and the share of children under 5 who are stunted hovers around 30%. In this research we aim to explore child stunting with attention to biology, behavior and environment. Specifically we aim to determine why children in some food insecure communities are stunted while others in the same community are healthy and, as an extension, why some low birth weight babies grow into healthy children and others are stunted.\nBecause of the significance of food and nutrition on stunting outcomes, and because no micro-level estimates of food production exist, we use high resolution remotely sensed imagery (~1m) combined with coarser resolution landscape data (rainfall, slope, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to estimate community level food production for each year of the child’s life. We construct a multi-level analysis through the linking of food production data to other community features gathered from Demographic and Health Survey and smaller scale community surveys gathered by USAID’s WA-WASH. We will include type of water source, distance to a road, presence of a health facility, share of educated individuals, as well as maternal height/weight, parental socio-economic characteristics, household size/assets. Finally, we will evaluate the impact of specific characteristics of the child – age, sex, health history, birth order.",

            "abstract": "We present a series of three-dimensional (3D), high-resolution, end-member tectonic configurations of the Central American plate system and use these to solve for the 3D viscous mantle flow and surface plate motions. The 3D geodynamic models test the relative control of the viscosity structure (Newtonian versus Composite), subducting plate geometry (continuous slab versus Cocos-Nazca slab gap), and overriding plate thickness (uniform versus laterally variable) on the predicted motion of the Cocos and Nazca plates and the slab-induced 3D flow field in the upper mantle. Models using the composite viscosity formulation result in increased surface plate motions, which better fit the observed motion of the Cocos and Nazca plates. This is particularly significant because these 3D regional models contain the entire Cocos plate, suggesting the importance of the non-linear rheology in models that aim to predict surface plate motions. Faster flow velocities occur in models using the composite viscosity due to the decreased resistance to subduction and reduced viscous support of the slab as the mantle surrounding the slab undergoes non-linear weakening. A zone of partial decoupling between the uppermost mantle and lithosphere, thus, naturally develops due to the composite viscosity formulation. Models that include a gap between the Cocos and Nazca slabs better fit the mantle flow pathways interpreted from the geochemical signatures, as material is brought from beneath the Cocos plate around the slab edge and northward into the mantle wedge beneath Central America. The mantle-lithosphere decoupling is enhanced in models with the slab gap, wherein the mantle flow field contains both counter-clockwise toroidal flow around the Cocos slab edge and clockwise toroidal flow around the northern Nazca slab edge, both of which are non-parallel to surface motions. The models also demonstrate that overriding plate thickness places a control on both the predicted surface motion and underlying mantle flow field, consistent with global models. In addition to the broader application of providing a mechanism for localized plate-mantle decoupling, the results imply that high-resolution, geographically referenced geodynamic models can be used to constrain modern plate geometries where unconstrained from seismicity.",

            "abstract": "The efficiency of solar photovoltaic (PV) generators declines sharply with increased temperatures. Peak solar exposure often occurs at the same time as peak temperatures, but solar PV installations are typically designed based on solar angle. In temperate areas, the peak temperatures may not be high enough to induce significant efficiency losses. In some of the areas with the greatest potential for solar development, however, summer air temperatures regularly reach 45 °C and PV panel temperatures exceed the air temperatures. Here we present a preliminary model of a PV array intended to optimize solar production in a hot and arid environment. The model begins with the diurnal and seasonal cycles in the angle and elevation of the sun, but also includes a meteorology-driven energy balance to project the temperatures of the PV panels and supporting structure. The model will be calibrated and parameterized using a solar array at the Desert Research Institute’s (DRI) Renewable Energy Deployment and Display (REDD) facility in Reno, Nevada, and validated with a similar array at DRI’s Las Vegas campus. Optical fibers will be installed on the PV panels and structural supports and interrogated by a distributed temperature sensor (DTS) to record the spatial and temporal variations in temperature. Combining the simulated panel temperatures, the efficiency-temperature relationship for the panels, and the known solar cycles at a site will allow us to optimize the design of future PV collectors (i.e., the aspect and angle of panels) for given production goals.",

Usability is often misunderstood and seen as common sense or common knowledge, but it is actually an important and challenging piece of product development.\nThis paper describes the National Snow and Ice Data Center's process to usability test the Arctic Data Explorer (ADE). The ADE is a federated data search tool for interdisciplinary Arctic science data that has been improved in features, appearance, functionality, and quality through a series of strategic and targeted usability testing and assessments.

Tabulations span from zip code to national levels. Notable patterns include the strong concentration of exposure across multiple scales, with a small number of states accounting for most of the total national exposure; and a small number of zip codes accounting for a large proportion of the exposure within many states. Additionally, different features show different exposure patterns; in one example, land and road miles have relatively high exposure but population and property have relatively low exposure in North Carolina.\nThe assessment further places this exposure analysis in the context of localized sea level rise projections integrated with coastal flood risk.",

The associations became stronger for people with hypertension or pulmonary functional diseases, which indicates that these people are more sensitive to air pollution. Among three pollutants which API measures, that is inhalable particles (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), PM10 is most statistically associated with blood pressure increase and vital capacity decrease.\nFurther study will focusing on the following two questions.

            "abstract": "The single largest uncertainty in climate model energy balance is the surface latent heating over tropical land. Furthermore, the partitioning of the total latent heat flux into contributions from surface evaporation and plant transpiration is of great importance, but notoriously poorly constrained. Resolving these issues will require better exploiting information which lies at the interface between observations and advanced modeling tools, both of which are imperfect. There are remarkably few observations which can constrain these fluxes, placing strict requirements on developing statistical methods to maximize the use of limited information to best improve models. Previous work has demonstrated the power of incorporating stable water isotopes into land surface models for further constraining ecosystem processes. We present results from a stable water isotopically-enabled land surface model (iCLM4), including model experiments partitioning the latent heat flux into contributions from plant transpiration and surface evaporation. It is shown that the partitioning results are sensitive to the parameterization of kinetic fractionation used. We discuss and demonstrate an approach to calibrating select model parameters to observational data in a Bayesian estimation framework, requiring Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior distribution, which is shown to constrain uncertain parameters as well as inform relevant values for operational use. Finally, we discuss the application of the estimation scheme to iCLM4, including entropy as a measure of information content and specific challenges which arise in calibration models with a large number of parameters.",

In this work, we consider how seasonal variability in river discharges control phosphorous loads and how climate change will impact discharges and corresponding phosphorus loads. We focus on 14 watersheds in the U.S. Great Lakes Basin, given the potential for riverine phosphorus exports to contribute to ecosystem impacts in the Great Lakes. The 14 watersheds vary in terms of land use and hydrologic regimes. Seasonal load-discharge relationships were estimated using a linearized form of a power law functions for each watershed, based on historical data from 1961-1999. Best-fit seasonal periods ranged from monthly to three months. Estimates of the leading coefficient ranged over more than 11 orders of magnitude, over the seasons and study watersheds. Estimates of the power ranged slightly less than unity to greater than two, reflecting wide differences in the linearity of the load-discharge relationship.\nFor the future climate periods (2046-2065 and 2081-2100), a suite of 9 bias corrected projections were made using the CMIP3 database, generating precipitation and temperature inputs to the Large Basin Runoff Model (LBRM). The LBRM is a calibrated, lumped parameter model that predicts discharges for large watersheds in the Great Lakes. In this case, LBRM discharge predictions were used as inputs to the phosphorus load discharge relationships. In general, median flows are predicted to change little, but low flows (characterized by Q5) are predicted to decrease on average by 12% and 19%, and high flows (characterized by Q95) are predicted to increase on average by 9% and 12% over the near- and far-future periods, respectively. For most watersheds, median phosphorous loads change linearly with respect to changes in median discharges. However, for a few watersheds, median phosphorous loads are predicted to increase proportionally greater than increases in discharge. This outcome is explained by concurrence between increases in high seasonal flows and seasonally-high values of the power law coefficient. These results illustrate the importance of considering seasonality in water quality modeling, especially when assessing the impacts of climate change.",

            "abstract": "Very few records depicting orbital timescale variability exist for the Southern Hemisphere during the Pliocene Warm Period (pWP, ~ 2.8-4.1 Ma.). The pWP is of particular interest as it poses a natural laboratory in which to understand climate variability in a world with only a permanent Southern Hemisphere polar ice sheet, poised near a fundamental shift in the Earth system. We report here proxy records that monitor sea surface temperature (alkenone unsaturation), surface productivity (C37total), and intermediate water density and chemistry (benthic foraminifera stable isotopes) from ODP Site 1125 and DSDP 594 (North and South of Chatham Rise, respectively) for the pWP.\nSurface thermal gradient between sites suggests the Subtropical Front was in place and stationary between sites for most of the pWP, much like it has been during the late Quaternary. All datasets surrounding the northernmost edge of the Southern Ocean show pacing by short Eccentricity (~100kyr) in the pWP at this location. The presence of a substantial ~100 kyr component in paleoclimatic variability contrasts with prior reports of ~ 41 kyr dominance in Pliocene climate cyclicity.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence for the existence of large channels incised beneath ice shelves in West Antarctica. However, the genesis of these channels is still not clear. Measurements from the floating tongue of Pine Island Glacier show that sub-shelf channels formed by localized melting (Stanton et al., 2013); oceanographic models of flow in sub-ice-shelf cavities are capable of producing sub-shelf channels through non-linear feed-back mechanisms (Gladish et al. 2012; Sergienko, 2013). On the other hand, other evidence suggests that sub-shelf channels can initiate at locations where melt water beneath grounded ice crosses the grounding line (Le Brocq et al. 2013).\nHere we use ground-based radar to map a channel incised into the base of the Ross Ice Shelf proximal to the grounding zone of Beardmore Glacier, West Antarctica. Results show that in the grounding zone (ice thickness is 1150m), the channel is 100m deep and 0.5 km wide. On the shelf, the channel widens and deepens down stream; 8km down from the grounding line (ice thickness is 600-800 m), the channel is 200m deep and 1 km wide (see Figure); apparently in this case, the channel originates from beneath the grounded ice.\nAlthough there is some indication of radar-detected internal stratigraphy dipping toward the channels indicative of meltin, the pattern of the stratigraphy suggests significant accumulated strain (see Figure). Further, vertical strain-rates calculated from repeat measurements using phase-sensitive radar (pRES), show a more complex pattern over melt-channels than is usually assumed for ice shelves. Specifically, 57 of the 69 pRES measurements exhibit a pattern of compression in the upper 75% of the ice column and extension in the lower 25%. This observation is important because such a pattern affects the ratio of surface- to mean-velocity, which is usually assumed to be unity in shelf-mass balance calculations.\nFIGURE CAPTION: Unmigrated, across-channel radar profile 8km downstream from the grounding line. The vertical reflector at km-2 comes from a shot hole drilled for a seismic survey. Here, the shelf is generally ~800m thick, but at km-2 a channel that is 200m deep and 1km wide is incised into the base of the shelf. The off-axis reflectors below 800m indicate that the ice-ocean interface is rough.",

            "abstract": "The AuScope VLBI array was built with the purpose to improve the terrestrial (TRF) and celestial reference frames in the southern hemisphere. Since 2010 the three 12-m antennas in Hobart (Tasmania), Katherine (Northern Territory) and Yarragadee (Western Australia) heavily contribute to the global VLBI observations coordinated by the International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry. In 2011, the AUSTRAL VLBI program was started, with more than 40 sessions being observed so far. In the AUSTRALs, the three AuScope antennas observe together with the new 15-m dish in Hartebeesthoek (South Africa) and the 12-m antenna in Warkworth (New Zealand). Recently, the planned observations have been expanded again, with 50 additional sessions scheduled until mid-2015, along with 3 continuous campaigns covering 15 days each. All AUSTRALs are recorded with an increased data rate of 1 Gbps, allowing to compensate for the reduced sensitivity of the generally smaller dish size.\nWe evaluate the positive impact of the AuScope VLBI program on the global TRF. This is due to the increased number of observations and the improved homogeneity of the global VLBI network. All data collected within this intense observing program is analysed and geodetic results are presented. This includes time series of baseline lengths and station coordinates of the contributing stations. We compare the results obtained within the regional AUSTRAL sessions with the ones of the classical global VLBI networks and identify superiorities and shortcomings of both. The high number of sessions gives high accuracies and good repeatabilities of the determined parameters. Additionally, remaining variations of baseline lengths can be identified and are compared against by default un-modelled station motions due to hydrology and atmosphere loading.\nFinally, we give an outlook on future plans for the AuScope antennas and the AUSTRAL observing program: on future operations, expected improvements through hardware upgrades as well as research on the use of sibling telescopes available at two sites within the AUSTRAL array (Hobart and Hartebeesthoek).",

            "abstract": "Since 2004, a sequence of devastating tsunamis has taken the lives of more than 300,000 people worldwide. The path of destruction left by each is typically measured in hundreds of meters to a few kilometers and its breadth can extend for hundreds even thousands of kilometers, crossing towns and countries and even traversing an entire oceanic basin. Tsunami disasters in Indonesia, Chile, Japan and elsewhere have also shown that the almost binary nature of tsunami impacts can present some unique risk reduction, response, recovery and rebuilding challenges, with transferable lessons to other tsunami vulnerable coastal communities around the world. In particular, the trauma can motivate survivors to relocate homes, jobs, and even whole communities to safer ground, sometimes at tremendous social and financial costs. For governments, the level of concentrated devastation usually exceeds the local capacity to respond and thus requires complex inter-governmental arrangements with regional, national and even international partners to support the recovery of impacted communities, infrastructure and economies. Two parallel projects underway in California since 2011—the SAFRR (Science Application for Risk Reduction) tsunami scenario project and the California Tsunami Policy Working Group (CTPWG)—have worked to digest key lessons from recent tsunami disasters, with an emphasis on identifying gaps to be addressed in the current state and federal policy framework to enhance tsunami risk awareness, hazard mitigation, and response and recovery planning ahead of disaster and also improve post-disaster implementation practices following a future California or U.S. tsunami event.",

It has been proposed that the NAL and CF phases contains approximately 12 mol% Fe. Most of previous studies on the NAL and CF phases have focused on their crystal structural stability and transitions\n1\n,\n2\n, while, their spin and valence states of Fe as well as the Fe effects on the behavior of Al-rich phases remain unclear. The spin transition of Fe-bearing phase in the lower mantle has significant effects on density, compressibility, elasticity and sound velocity of the host mineral, and that is important to understand the geophysics and geodynamics of the Earth’s mantle\n3\n. Here we have investigated the iron spin and valence states of the NAL and CF phases up to 85 GPa via high-pressure nuclear forward scattering and X-ray diffraction measurements. Our results show that both Fe2+ and Fe3+ valence states exist in the NAL phase structure, and that Fe3+ in the octhahedral site undergoes a high-spin to low-spin transition at approximately 30 GPa. X-ray diffraction results further reveal the effects of the spin and valence states on the equation of state parameters of the NAL phase. These results are applied to understand how the spin transition affects the behavior of the NAL and CF phases in the subducted slabs in the Earth’s lower mantle. And the spin transition of Al-rich phases may play a significant role on the subduction behavior of the slabs in the Earth’s lower mantle.\n",

            "abstract": "Quaternary large-volume travertine deposits in New Mexico and Arizona occur along the Rio Grande rift and on the southeastern Colorado Plateau. Travertines are natural analogues for CO2 leakage along fault systems because they form due to the degassing of CO2 from carbonic groundwater that migrates up fault systems. Travertine volumes can be used to infer integrated CO2 leakage along faults, which includes: (1) CO2 that becomes fixed in CaCO3/travertine (tons of carbon converted into tons of carbonate), (2) the amount of CO2 that degassed into the atmosphere (twice the amount of (1), based on reaction stoichiometry), (3) dissolved CO2 that is carried away with the water discharging from a spring (based on modern spring discharge and dissolved carbon content), and (4) CO2 that escapes through the soil (based on modern soil flux measurements). The total CO2 leakage (1 and 2) calculated in this study is estimated as ~6 Gt (gigatons) whereas the integrated CO2 leakage (1-4) is estimated as ~128 Gt over ~450,000 years of travertine accumulation. U-series dating of the travertines shows that the deposits formed episodically which implies that CO2 leakage occurred episodically. Better understanding of integrated CO2 leakage along fault systems is needed to better constrain global estimates of natural CO2 fluxes, and to help in risk assessment of CO2 sequestration sites designed to effectively store anthropogenic CO2 in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "This study describes the ongoing efforts in analysis of the intense sequence of complex seismic events associated with the formation of a large sinkhole at Napoleonville Salt Dome, Assumption Parish, Louisiana in August 2012. We investigate source mechanisms of these events, represented by a general 2nd order point source centroid seismic moment tensor (MT) using data from a temporary network of broadband stations established by the United States Geological Survey. We have implemented a grid-search technique to detect and compute the centroid hypocenter and MT solution of events using low frequency (0.1-0.3 Hz) 25-second duration displacement waveforms and 1D velocity models for the salt dome and the surrounding sediment sequence. Application of this technique to data extending up to 17 days before and after the appearance of the sinkhole yields a catalog of > 1200 events. We describe the evolution of the seismicity in time with respect to hypocenters, source-types, and magnitudes. We also examine the Gutenberg-Richter statistics and relationship between inter-event times and magnitudes. Since fewer stations were operational during the time period preceding the appearance of the sinkhole, we perform various sensitivity tests to examine the effects of decrease in station coverage from a 5-station network to a 3-station network on location, source-type and magnitude uncertainties. We also apply a finite source MT inversion approach using grid-search to isolate specific larger-magnitude events that occur in rapid succession resulting in overlapping waveforms. The MT analysis is supplemented by a separate waveform cross-correlation analysis to study smaller magnitude events that have poor signal-to-noise ratios at low frequencies. We also explore the role of fluids, possible a natural gas-water mixture, in the spectral peaks observed in the seismic signals.",

            "abstract": "When the IMF turns from Bz- to Bz+, dayside merging forms open lobe field lines at low latitudes. These lobe lines are populated with shocked solar wind and dayside magnetospheric plasma from the reconnection inflow. As those lobe flux tubes pass tailward over the polar caps, they are also populated with outflow from the north and south polar cap ionospheres. As the lobe lines move tailward, they acquire a convex curvature that blocks the westward-flowing cross-tail current (XTJ). This constitutes the first stage of XTJ disruption, and it begins less than 10 min after the frontside merging.The disrupted XTJ closes dawn-to-dusk in the transition plasmasheet (TPS), where it produces a downward FAC to the ionosphere. This causes the proton arc, which is seen for the period from about 10 – 80 min after frontside merging begins at time t=0. The lobe lines eventually reconnect well downtail at about t=30 minutes. The middle section that closes the lobe lines has concave curvature and is called the Neutral Sheet (NSh). The resulting stretched field lines thus have a central NSh which separates the two convex-curvature regions to the north and south, regions which are called the Disruption Zones (DZs); the overall combination of the NDZ, NSh and SDZ is called the Stretched Plasmasheet (SPS). As the SPS continues to grow and the stretched lines are pulled earthward to relieve the magnetic tension, the filling of the NSh occurs both from the DTNL with the higher energy magnetospheric particle population on the lobe lines, but eventually also at about 25 earth radii when the polar cap ionospheric outflow (PCO) component finally reaches the NSh. A NSh FAC system forms, from which electrons flow down to the auroral ionosphere to create the pre-onset arc, starting at about t=65 min. At the same time, the Lyons-Speiser mechanism is initiated in the inner NSh, causing the PCO ions to become trapped and accelerated in the inner NSh region. Eventually, when the SPS grows earthward sufficiently that the NSh reaches the outer radiation belt at about t=85 min, the ionospheric conductivity has grown sufficiently that the XTJ disrupted by the DZs changes its dawn-to-dusk closure by travelling through the ionosphere. This second stage of disruption is the Substorm Current Wedge (SCW). Onset follows at about t=88 min.",

            "abstract": "During slope-scale erosion events, soil fractions and the associated soil organic carbon (SOC) will be transported away from eroding sites mainly by overland flow. Eroded soil will be either gradually re-deposited along hillslopes or further transferred to river systems. However, the re-distribution of eroded SOC during transport is not always uniform, but very often affected by preferential deposition. Under given flow conditions, the site of SOC deposition depends on the transport distances of sediment particles where the SOC is stored. Very often, soil and SOC erosion risk is assessed by applying the mineral particle specific SOC distribution observed either from eroding sites or colluvial depositional sites. However, soil is not always eroded as dispersed mineral particles, but mostly in form of aggregates. The aggregates possibly have distinct settling velocity from individual mineral particles, which may considerably change the transport distance of the associated SOC. Yet, little has been known about the potential effects of aggregation onto the movement and mineralizing susceptibility of eroded SOC.\nA simulated rainfall was applied to two soils of different texture, structure and SOC content. The generated sediments were fractionated by a settling tube apparatus according to their likely transport distances. The long-term mineralization potentials of the fractionated sediments were measured for 50 days. The results show: 1) the re-deposition of eroded SOC into the terrestrial system was increased up to 64% compared to the likely re-distribution suggested by the mineral particle specific SOC distribution. This indicates that using mineral particle size distribution and the associated SOC as in current erosion models would under-estimate terrestrial deposition of SOC. 2) Over 50 days, the mineralization of the sediment from the silty loam was doubled when compared to the original silty loam. The mineralization of the sediment from the silty clay roughly equaled that from the original Movelier soil. This requires investigation on the potential effects of different degrees of aggregation onto the fate of eroded SOC. Overall, the results observed from this study suggest that soil erosion is more likely to be a source of atmospheric CO2.",

Surveys revealed a dominance of woody seedlings over older established saplings, and high frequencies of species with alternative forms of propagation that tolerate high flows such as sandbar willow (Salix interior), and beggarticks (Bidens sp.). Surveys also showed in increase in elevation of plant establishment from measurements taken in 1979, resulting in higher area of exposed pointbar and easier mobilization of sediment. Geospatial analysis completed at each sampling location found decreased area of exposed pointbar in association with increases in pointbar vegetation between lower flow years and increased area of exposed pointbar in association with decreased pointbar vegetation between higher flow years.\nAn experimental approach addresses implications of vegetation loss on pointbar sediment storage. In a 1.5m x 6m flume, we are conducting experiments to measure the efficiency of bar vegetation in trapping fine sediment as a function of stem density. Self-formed pointbars are vegetated at varying densities with Medicago sativa (alfalfa) sprouts to represent riparian woody saplings, then flooded with fine sediment-rich water to simulate summer flooding. Sediment deposited at each stem density is then measured to estimate efficiency. While results of these experiments are currently ongoing, we hypothesize that a threshold density exists at which trapping efficiency declines substantially.\nPreliminary results from this study demonstrate the biogeomorphic relationships between hydrologic regime, vegetation establishment, and sediment storage within the MRB. An understanding of these relationships will aid in development and implication of management actions necessary to address sediment related impairments in the MRB.",

            "abstract": "Magnesium silicate perovskite (Pv) is the most abundant phase in the Earth’s lower mantle and can make up to 75% in volume of the lower mantle in a pyrolitic compositional model. The electronic spin and valence states of iron (Fe) in Pv directly influence its physical and chemical properties, and therefore it is important to study the electronic spin and valence states of Fe in Pv at conditions corresponding to the Earth’s lower mantle. Numerous studies have been dedicated to understanding the electronic spin and valence states of Fe in Pv at high pressures using experimental and theoretical techniques. However, experimental results and possible interpretations remain highly debated due to the multiple valence states and site occupancies of Fe in Pv. Previous studies also showed the incorporation of aluminum (Al) into a Fe-bearing Pv can affect the placement of Fe3+ and further complicate interpretations of experimental results. Here we present the experimental result on electronic spin and valence states of Fe using well-characterized single-crystal Fe-bearing and Al-Fe-bearing Pv to the pressures relevant to the lower mantle by synchrotron X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) and Mössbauer spectroscopy (SMS). The samples used in this experiment were first characterized by Mössbauer spectroscopy (MS) at ambient conditions to identify the initial Fe electronic spin and valence states before performing high-pressure experiments. The XES spectra were analyzed using a new analytical method, integrate relative difference (IRD) method. The new IRD method had been shown in the previous study to be a more effective method of probing the pressure range of Fe spin transition and can avoid the influence of peak broadening on the interpretation of the spin states of Fe at high pressures. Our study will assist the comprehension and interpretation of the electronic spin and valence states of Fe on the major lower-mantle mineral. The result has implications to deep Earth geophysics and geochemistry, including elasticity, element partitioning, diffusion, and transportation properties.",

This dataset was obtained as part of the intensive Texas Air Quality Study in summer of 2006 (TexAQS06). During the project, the ship, the R/V Ronald H. Brown, cruised in tracks in the Gulf of Mexico along the Texas coast, in Galveston Bay, and in the Houston Ship Channel obtaining air chemistry and meteorological data, including vertical profile measurements of wind and temperature. The primary observing system used in this paper is NOAA/ESRL’s High Resolution Doppler Lidar (HRDL), which features high-precision and high-resolution wind measurements and a motion compensation system to provide accurate wind data despite ship and wave motions. The boundary layer in this warm-water region was found to be weakly unstable typically to a depth of 300 m above the sea surface. HRDL data were analyzed to provide 15-min averaged profiles of wind flow properties (wind speed, direction, and turbulence) from the water surface up to 2.5 km at a vertical resolution of 15 m. The paper will present statistics and distributions of these parameters over a wide range of heights and under various atmospheric conditions. Detailed analysis of the BL features including LLJs, wind and directional ramps, and wind shear through the rotor level heights, along with examples of hub-height and equivalent wind will be presented. The paper will discuss the diurnal fluctuations of all quantities critical to wind energy and their variability along the Texas coast.",

They can rapidly transit to anywhere in the Arctic making continuous measurements of ice draft, sea floor depth, temperature, salinity and other properties. They can also collect water samples for a variety of chemical and biological measurements and can be a valuable component of the Arctic Observing System. An agreement with the US Navy continues scientific measurements on transit legs of submarines crossing the Arctic Ocean as phase II of the SCICEX program that was begun in the 1990s. We present results from this program collected during a period of complete ice cover in the western Arctic in spring 2014 by two submarines. Continuous data were recorded with the hull-mounted CTD along 4 crossings of the Canada Basin totaling over 6500 km. Vertical profiles of temperature and salinity were obtained at multidepth stations where the submarine changed depths and from periodic XCTDs. Fresher, Pacific water dominated the upper 150 m of the Canada Basin, but shoaled significantly across the Makarov Basin and onto the Lomonosov Ridge. Discrete water samples also were collected with a horizontal spacing of about 60 km along track and during 12 multidepth stations with 6 sampling depths in the upper 250 m. The water samples are being measured at shore based labs for oxygen isotopes, nutrients, tritium, helium-3, CFCs, SF6, carbonate system variables, particulate carbon and nitrogen and chlorophyll levels. These results will be presented in the context of the hydrographic measurements to provide a unique view of the biogeochemical and physical state of the western Arctic at the end of winter.",

            "abstract": "Vigorous convection within Earth’s outer core drives a dynamo that has sustained a global magnetic field for at least 3.5 Gyr. Traditionally, people invoke three energy sources for the dynamo: thermal convection from cooling and freezing, compositional convection from light elements expelled by the growing inner core, and, perhaps, radiogenic heating from potassium-40. New theoretical and experimental work, however, indicates that the thermal and electrical conductivities of the outer core may be as much as three times higher than previously assumed. The implied increase in the adiabatic heat flux casts doubt on the ability of the usual mechanisms to explain the dynamo’s longevity. Here, we present a quantitative model of the crystallization of magnesium-bearing minerals from the cooling core—a plausible candidate for the missing power source.\nRecent diamond-anvil cell experiments suggest that magnesium can partition into core material if thermodynamic equilibrium is achieved at high temperatures (>5000 K). We develop a model for core/mantle differentiation in which most of the core forms from material equilibrated at the base of a magma ocean as Earth slowly grows, but a small portion (~10%) equilibrated at extreme conditions in the aftermath of a giant impact. We calculate the posterior probability distribution for the original concentrations of magnesium and other light elements (chiefly oxygen and silicon) in the core, constrained by partitioning experiments and the observed depletion of siderophile elements in Earth’s mantle. We then simulate the thermochemical evolution of cores with plausible compositions and thermal structures from the end of accretion to the present, focusing on the crystallization of a few percent of the initial core as ferropericlase and bridgmanite. Finally, we compute the associated energy release and verify that our final core compositions are consistent with the available seismological data.",

We model the small-scale heterogeneous nature of the earth’s crust using a fractal distribution to represent the realistic variation observed in ground motion records. To investigate the effects of wave propagation through the realistic velocity structures we use finite-difference solutions to the 3D wave equation including frequency-dependent anelastic attenuation. We simulate 0 – 2.5 Hz linear viscoelastic waves in 1D and 3D velocity structures derived from the Southern California Earthquake Center Community Velocity Model CVM-SI 4.26 with different seismic source descriptions. Our modeling demonstrates unique amplification patterns caused by scattering due to the heterogeneous structure of the shallow crust. In particular, we find that shallow sources located on the boundary to a sedimentary basin generate bands of strong amplification aligned in the direction of the ray paths. The nature of these bands depends strongly on the incidence angle of the waves into the sediments. Moreover, this banded amplification pattern is absent for sources deeper than 1-2 km. We find that the majority of the scattering recorded in ground motions originates as a path effect as the waves propagate through the basins, while local site-specific scattering in the immediate vicinity of a ground motion record at the earth’s surface tends to play a smaller role. Our results imply that surface rupture on a range-bound fault (e.g, the San Andreas fault by the San Bernardino Basin) may generate a different patterns of ground motion shaking along lines parallel to the fault as compared to profiles perpendicular to the fault.",

            "abstract": "It is important to develop a forecast model to predict the trajectory of sediment particles when extreme flow events occur. In extreme flow environments, the stochastic jump diffusion particle tracking model (SJD-PTM) can be used to model the movement of sediment particles in response to extreme events. This proposed SJD-PTM can be separated into three main parts — a drift motion, a turbulence term and a jump term due to random occurrences of extreme flow events. The study is intended to modify the jump term, which models the abrupt changes of particle position in the extreme flow environments. The frequency of extreme flow occurrences might change due to many uncertain factors such as climate change. The study attempts to use the concept of the logistic regression and the parameter of odds ratio, namely the trend magnitude to investigate the frequency change of extreme flow event occurrences and its impact on sediment particle movement. With the SJD-PTM, the ensemble mean and variance of particle trajectory can be quantified via simulations. The results show that by taking the effect of the trend magnitude into consideration, the particle position and its uncertainty may undergo a significant increase. Such findings will have many important implications to the environmental and hydraulic engineering design and planning. For instance, when the frequency of the occurrence of flow events with higher extremity increases, particles can travel further and faster downstream. It is observed that flow events with higher extremity can induce a higher degree of entrainment and particle resuspension, and consequently more significant bed and bank erosion.",

            "abstract": "The Republic of the Marshall Islands is comprised of 1156 islands on 29 low-lying atolls with a mean elevation of 2 m that are susceptible to sea-level rise and often subjected to overwash during large wave events. A 6-month deployment of wave and tide gauges across two shore-normal sections of north-facing coral reef on the Roi-Namur Island on Kwajalein Atoll was conducted during 2013-2014 to quantify wave dynamics and wave-driven water levels on the fringing coral reef. Wave heights and periods on the reef flat were strongly correlated to the water levels. On the fore reef, the majority of wave energy was concentrated in the incident band (5-25 s); due to breaking at the reef crest, however, the wave energy over the reef flat was dominated by infragravity-band (25-250 s) motions. Two large wave events with heights of 6-8 m at 15 s over the fore reef were observed. During these events, infragravity-band wave heights exceeded the incident band wave heights and approximately 1.0 m of set-up was established over the innermost reef flat. This set-up enabled the propagation of large waves across the reef flat, reaching maximum heights of nearly 2 m on the innermost reef flat adjacent to the toe of the beach. XBEACH models of the instrument transects were able to replicate the incident waves, infragravity waves, and wave-driven set-up across the reef when the hydrodynamic roughness of the reef was correctly parameterized. These events led to more than 3 m of wave-driven run-up and inundation of the island that drove substantial morphological change to the beach face.",

            "abstract": "One of the earliest ocean-related flights was that of Amundsen to be first across the North Pole and Arctic from Svalbard to Alaska in the airship Norge in 1926. Twenty five years later Cox & Munk flew a B-17G \"Flying Fortress\" bomber over Hawaiian waters measuring sea surface slope statistics from photographs of sun glitter and wind speed from a yacht. The value of Cox & Munk's \"airborne oceanography\" became apparent another twenty five years later with the short-lived Seasat microwave remote-sensing mission, since interpretation of the Seasat data in geophysical variables required scattering theories that relied on their data. The universal acceptance of remote sensing in oceanography began in 1992 with the launch of, and successful analysis of sea surface height data from, the Topex/Poseidon radar altimeter. With that and the development of more realistic coupled atmosphere-ocean models it became apparent that our understanding of weather and climate variability in both the atmosphere and the ocean depends crucially on our ability to measure processes in boundary layers spanning the interface.\nTen years ago UNOLS formed the Scientific Committee for Oceanographic Aircraft Research (SCOAR) \"...to improve access to research aircraft facilities for ocean sciences\"; an attempt to make access to aircraft as easy as access to research vessels. SCOAR emphasized then that \"Aircraft are ideal for both fast-response investigations and routine, long-term measurements, and they naturally combine atmospheric measurements with oceanographic measurements on similar temporal and spatial scales.\" Since then developments in GPS positioning and miniaturization have made scientific measurements possible from smaller and smaller platforms, including the transition from manned to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Furthermore, ship-launched and recovered UAVs have demonstrated how they can enhance the capabilities and reach of the research vessels, \"projecting\" research and science, just as aircraft carriers \"project force\". Now we can measure winds, waves, temperatures, currents, radiative transfer, images and air-sea fluxes from aircraft over the ocean.\nI will review some of the history of airborne oceanography and present examples of how it can extend our knowledge and understanding of air-sea interaction.",

Recent observations captured strong changes in the Eurasian and Makarov basins (EMB); understanding the transition requires tracing the intensity of this major subsurface transport system. Responding to urgent needs for a long-term observation system for understanding rapid high-latitude climate change, an EMB observational network is implemented as an element of the Arctic Observing Network (AON). The overarching goal of this AON program is to compile a cohesive picture of the state and transformations of water masses (particularly, Atlantic Water, AW) in the EMB. NABOS (=Nansen and Amundsen Basins Observational System) was the predecessor of this AON program. Observations provided by the program were critical for understanding the large-scale structure and temporal variability of an oceanic boundary current. Fourteen years long observations were instrumental for documenting all stages of the AW warming providing evidence for the anomalous state of the ocean in the 2000s. For example, the prevailing anticyclonic circulation in 2008-10 over the central Laptev Sea slope was documented — a deviation from the classical shallow-to-right circulation paradigm. This program naturally complements the existing AON infrastructure in a synergistic way working hand-in-hand with other elements of the AON, which is vital for interpreting and assessing polar climate change.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol particles are omnipresent in the Earth’s atmosphere and have important impacts on weather and climate by their effects on the atmospheric radiative balance. With the advent of more and more sophisticated representations of atmospheric processes in earth system models, the lack of reliable input data on aerosols leads to significant uncertainties in the prediction of future climate scenarios. In recent years large discrepancies in radiative forcing estimates from aerosol layers in modeling studies have been revealed emphasizing the need for detailed and systematic observations of aerosols. Airborne in-situ measurements represent an important pillar for validating both model results and retrievals of aerosol distributions and properties from remote sensing methods on global scales. However, detailed observations are challenging and therefore are subject to substantial uncertainties themselves.\nHere we use data from airborne in-situ measurements of elevated aerosol layers from various field experiments in different regions of the world. The data set includes Saharan mineral dust layers over Africa, the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean from the SALTRACE and the SAMUM campaigns as well as long-range transported biomass burning aerosol layers from wild fires in the Sahel region and North America measured over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, Europe and the Arctic detected during SAMUM2, CONCERT2011, DC3 and ACCESS 2012. We aim to characterize the effects of the measured aerosol layers, in particular with respect to ageing, mixing state and vertical structure, on the overall atmospheric radiation budget as well as local heating and cooling rates. We use radiative transfer simulations of short and long-wave radiation and aerosol optical properties derived in a consistent way from the in-situ observations of microphysical properties using T-matrix calculations. The results of this characterization will help to improve the parameterization of the effects of elevated aerosol layers in earth system models. In addition, we assess uncertainties in radiative forcing estimates introduced by uncertainties in the measured aerosol properties.",

            "abstract": "Some studies suggest that slow slip events (SSEs) may play a role in triggering dangerous megathrust earthquakes by increasing stress on the adjacent locked, seismogenic portion of the plate boundary. However, the role that earthquakes play in the evolution and occurrence of SSEs themselves is not clear, although there is some evidence that SSEs can be triggered by local or regional earthquakes. We show for the first time that stress changes induced by a local earthquake can arrest an ongoing SSE, using a recent example from the Hikurangi subduction margin, New Zealand. The Kapiti SSE is a large (Mw > 7.0), long-term slow slip event that began at the southern Hikurangi margin in early 2013, and continued into 2014. We show that an abrupt halting of the Kapiti SSE observed at cGPS sites in late January 2014 occurred due to an increase in the normal stress (~0.1 MPa) and a decrease in Coulomb failure stress (~.02-.03 MPa) in the SSE source area, induced by a nearby Mw 6.3 intraslab earthquake that occurred on January 20, 2014. We also show that stress changes induced by the Kapiti SSE may have promoted the occurrence of the Mw 6.3 earthquake, revealing surprising feedbacks between SSE evolution and local earthquake occurrence.\nHalting of the Kapiti SSE via small changes in stress suggests that stresses needed to drive SSEs are relatively small--not much larger than 0.01 MPa. Moreover, a decrease in SSE slip rate due to an increase in normal stress can also be explained in terms of the direct effect in rate and state friction laws. Our observation of an abrupt halting/slowing of the SSE in the stress shadow of a local earthquake also adds to the debate over dynamic vs. static stress triggering as drivers for earthquake aftershocks, and supports the premise that static stress changes are an important ingredient in triggering (or delaying) fault slip.",

            "abstract": "On February 6, 2013 a Mw8.0 interplate earthquake occurred in the Santa Cruz Islands region. The epicenter is located near a complex section of the Australia-Pacific plate boundary, where a short segment of dominantly strike-slip plate motion links the Solomon Trench to the New Hebrides Trench. In this region, the Australia plate subducts beneath the Pacific plate with a convergence rate of ~9cm/yr.\nThis earthquake generated a tsunami that struck the city of Lata and several villages located on the Nendo island with tsunami height exceeding 11m (Fritz et al.,2014). The tsunami has been distinctly recorded by 5 DART buoys in the Pacific Ocean and by some tide-gauges at Solomon Islands, Fiji Islands, and New Caledonia.\nIn this work we retrieve the source of the tsunami by inverting the signals recorded by both DART buoys and tide-gauges, and using an earthquake fault model that accounts for the variability of the subduction plate geometry. We compare and discuss our tsunamigenic slip model with previous coseismic slip models obtained by teleseismic data (Hayes et al.,2013) and telesismic data constrained by tsunami records (Lay et al.,2013). Our preferred tsunami source (maximum slip value of ~10m) is located southeast from the hypocenter and the slip direction is in agreement with the convergence direction that becomes progressively more oblique in the NW segment. We find a tsunami source roughly consistent to a possible source of low frequency radiation (http://www.iris.edu/spud/backprojection) and/or to the region of aseismic slip argued by Hayes et al. (2013). However, we do not find significantly tsunamigenic slip in the region of seismic high frequency radiation around the hypocenter.",

Productivity is controlled primarily by seasonal upwelling that starts in the fall (early November) and extends into the spring. We are using a new microfluorination method (Menicucci et al., 2013) to analyze diatom samples for their oxygen isotopic composition from a GB sediment trap, that was moored at approximately 500m water depth, just above the anoxic zone. The trap collected samples every 2 weeks between 1990-98 as part of a long term program to study the relationship between sediment fluxes and climate forcing in the Gulf of California. Samples from 1996-1997 with the highest observed opal fluxes (fall through summer) have been processed and are currently being analyzed for diatom δ18O.\nWe will present diatom oxygen isotope data from a full year of samples, where sufficient material is available. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that the diatoms in the sedimentary record are heavily influenced by seasonal productivity differences at this location, and likely represent a record of water column variability that is biased towards the bloom periods. Variability through time is thought to be related to the timing of upwelling and seasonal temperature variability in the chlorophyll maximum. The required time to for sinking frustules to reach the seafloor is also thought to be a contributing factor, imparting a time-lag from time of death to sedimentation. δ18O data will be converted to temperature using existing calibrations and directly compare to previously published SST records.",

            "abstract": "The goal of this study was to quantify interannual variation of gross primary production (GPP) and evaluate potential drivers of GPP with global change using the Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment (PHACE) experiment in semiarid grassland in southeastern Wyoming. PHACE consists of the treatments: control, warming only, elevated CO2 (eCO2) only, eCO2 and warming, and irrigation only. We expected that GPP would be most strongly influenced by interannual variability in precipitation under all PHACE treatments, soil water availability under eCO2, and nitrogen availability. GPP data were obtained from paired measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (Reco; GPP = Reco – NEE) made on 2-4 week intervals over six growing seasons (2007-2012). Soil temperature (T), soil water content (SWC), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were continuously recorded at the plot (T, SWC) and site (VPD, PAR) scales. Annual, plot-level aboveground plant nitrogen content (N) was measured during peak biomass. We fit a non-linear light-response model to the GPP data within a Bayesian framework, and modeled the maximum GPP rate (Gmax) and canopy light-use efficiency (Q) as functions of N and current and antecedent SWC, T, and VPD. The model fit the GPP data well (R2 = 0.64), and regardless of the PHACE treatment the most important drivers of GPP were N (for Gmax), VPD (Gmax and Q), antecedent T (Gmax), and antecedent VPD (Q). Model simulations predicted that annual GPP increased on average by about 16% with eCO2, 14% with warming, 12% with eCO2 and warming, and 23% with irrigation. For four of the six years, annual GPP was significantly affected by either eCO2 alone or when combined with warming. The increase in annual GPP under irrigation was similar to the increase under eCO2 during a dry year (2012), but irrigation stimulated GPP to a greater degree than eCO2 during wet years (2008, 2009). Hence, increases in GPP under eCO2 appear to be indirectly due to increases in SWC, especially under dry conditions. These results suggest that future climate scenarios will lead to more productive grasslands in semiarid regions, but the overall response of the C cycle and the potential for these systems to sequester greater C will depend on the magnitude and direction of both the Reco and GPP responses.",

            "abstract": "Coherent large-scale sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic are present in the observed record on interannual to decadal timescales and often linked to the large-scale meridional overturning circulation. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of the low-frequency variability are poorly understood, including the relative contributions of atmospheric forcing and the ocean circulation. Using observations of ocean temperature and atmospheric pressure anomalies in the Atlantic basin from 1871 to 2013 and a suite of numerical experiments, we reconstruct the observed variability in the North Atlantic using a statistical multivariate regression model. The relative roles of ocean and atmospheric dynamics on the Atlantic variability and on its predictive skill are highlighted as function of the different timescales. For example, the role of air-sea coupling, via the North Atlantic Oscillation, is shown to increase the predictive skill in the North Atlantic on interannual timescales while the imprint of large-scale overturning circulation onto surface variability is shown to emerge on decadal timescales.

Trace gas emission at these locations demonstrate unique light stable isotope signatures that provide information to enable source identification of the material. Light stable isotope detection through surface monitoring, offers the ability to distinguish between trace gases emitted from sources such as, biological (fertilizers and wastes), mineral (coal or seams), or liquid organic systems (oil and gas reservoirs). To make light stable isotope measurements, we employ the ultra-sensitive technique, frequency modulation spectroscopy (FMS). FMS is an absorption technique with sensitivity enhancements approximately 100-1000x more than standard absorption spectroscopy with the advantage of providing stable isotope signature information. We have developed an integrated in situ (point source) system that measures carbon dioxide, methane and hydrogen sulfide with isotopic resolution and enhanced sensitivity. The in situ instrument involves the continuous collection of air and records the stable isotope ratio for the gas being detected. We have included in-line flask collection points to obtain gas samples for validation of isotopic concentrations using our in-house isotope ratio mass spectroscopy (IRMS). We present calibration curves for each species addressed above to demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of the system. We also show field deployment data demonstrating the capabilities of the system in making live dynamic measurements from an active source.  ",

            "abstract": "The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica, represent a unique geologic setting where permanent lakes, ephemeral streams, and subglacial waters influence surface hydrology in a cold polar desert. Past research suggested that the MDV are underlain by several hundreds of meters of permafrost. Here, we present data collected from an Airborne EM (AEM) resistivity sensor flown over the MDV during the 2011-12 austral summer. A focus of our survey was over the Taylor Glacier where saline, iron-rich subglacial fluid releases at the glacier snout at a feature known as Blood Falls, and over Taylor Valley, where a series of isolated lakes lie between Taylor Glacier and the Ross Sea. Our data show that in Taylor Valley there are extensive areas of low resistivity, interpreted as hypersaline brines, beneath a relatively thin layer of high resistivity material, interpreted as dry- or ice-cemented permafrost. These hypersaline brines remain liquid at temperatures well below 0°C due to their salinity. They appear to be contained within the sedimentary fill deposited in Taylor Valley when it was still a fjord. This brine system continues up valley and has a subglacial extension beneath Taylor Glacier, where it may provide the source that feeds Blood Falls. By categorizing the resistivity measurements according to surficial land cover, we are able to distinguish between ice, permafrost, lake water, and seawater based on characteristic resistivity distributions. Furthermore, this technique shows that areas of surface permafrost become increasingly conductive (brine-filled) with depth, whereas the large lakes exhibit taliks that extend through the entire thickness of the permafrost. The subsurface brines represent a large, unstudied and potentially connected hydrogeologic system, in which subsurface flows may help transfer water and nutrients between lakes in the MDV and into the Ross Sea. Such a system is a potential habitat for extremophile life, similar to that already detected in the Blood Falls outflow, and may serve as a terrestrial analogue to potential extraterrestrial habits, where liquid surface waters are not expected to exist.",

            "abstract": "Ong Valley, in the Central Transantarctic Mountains, contains three distinct glacial drifts deposited by past advances of the Argosy glacier into the valley. Massive ice occurs below two of the till deposits. Potentially, such buried ice under shallow regolith cover could provide access to past climate and biological records more easily than deep ice coring. We measured cosmic-ray produced 21Ne in these tills as a means of constraining the age and stability of the three drifts, as well as the ice below them. We collected samples in vertical profiles from two hand-dug sections through each drift. The pits from two drifts overlying buried ice extended to the buried ice surface. The hypothesis that these are sublimation tills implies that 21Ne concentrations are a function of i) any inheritance from prior exposure; ii) the age since emplacement of the ice and till; iii) the sublimation rate of the ice; and iv) the surface erosion rate of the till.\n21Ne concentrations in the youngest drift are ca. 10 M atoms/g and invariant with depth, indicating that they are predominantly due to inheritance, and provide only a weak maximum age constraint of ca. 0.1 Mya. The two older drifts have surface 21Ne concentrations of 200-250 M atoms/ g and depth concentration profiles consistent with a sublimation till origin. Given that 21Ne concentrations in the deepest samples in each of the two older drifts provide an upper limit on the inherited 21Ne concentration, these imply minimum ages of 1 Mya for the middle drift and 1.6 Mya for the oldest. This implies a 1 Mya minimum age for the ice underlying the middle drift.",

            "abstract": "The Rifle Site consists of a floodplain along the Colorado River that was remediated through the removal of surface material underlying former uranium-vanadium mill tailings. The semi-arid (precip. = ~30 cm/year) catchment for the site has an area of ~1km2. The Rifle Site provides an excellent field laboratory for the study of the fluxes of water and carbon from the vadose zone to groundwater (LBNL SFA2.0, http://esd.lbl.gov/research/projects/sssfa2/). A network of monitoring wells, particularly a set instrumented in the vadose zone, provide the opportunity to closely sample groundwater and vadose zone porewater both in space and time. In order to better understand the spatial and temporal variation of vadose zone interaction with groundwater within the Rifle floodplain and provide constraints for a Rifle hydrological model, we have analyzed the Sr isotopic compositions, 234U/238U activity ratios, and d238U of groundwater, vadose zone porewater (sampled through depth-distributed lysimeters) and surface water including the Colorado River. Significant contrasts in 87Sr/86Sr and 234U/238U allow the identification of different sources contributing to Rifle groundwater, while d238U provides an additional tracer and insights into redox processes.\nVadose zone porewater is characterized by high 87Sr/86Sr and Sr concentrations and falls at one end of a mixing line with Rifle groundwater, while upgradient groundwater with lower 87Sr/86Sr and Sr concentrations falls at the other end. A mixing model using vadose zone porewater and upgradient groundwater as endmembers suggests that the contribution of vertical recharge through the floodplain increases to ~20% systematically across the floodplain towards the Colorado River. An exception to this pattern is a well located 150m from the river with recent high U concentrations (>300 ppb) and U and Sr isotopic compositions consistent with a 38% vadose zone contribution. U and Sr isotopes show that an irrigation-return ditch that cuts the site near its eastern edge has significant hydraulic connectivity with the aquifer affecting nearby wells and constraining the boundary conditions for the Rifle hydrologic model. Vadose zone porewater has d235U ranging from 0.03 to 0.6‰ reflecting local smear-zone redox processes or the history of ore sources processed at the Rifle Mill.",

            "abstract": "As in other semi-arid plains of the world, long-scale deforestation to establish croplands in the South American Chaco may disrupt the regional water balance. As annual crops use less water than the native perennial system, water in excess usually translates into serious degradation processes such as run-off driven erosion, or the onset of groundwater recharge which can develop flooding and dryland salinization. Agriculturally, water excess could be reduced by using more intensive crop systems which consume water exhaustively. We used MODIS imagery (2000-present) from Bandera, Argentina (28.8S 62.2W), a major agricultural cluster in the region, to assess deforestation, to identify the main crop systems, and to analyze the impact of crop expansion and phenological shifts on the regional water balance. Three cover classes (Dry Forest DF, Agriculture AG, and Pastures PA) and five AG crop types were distinguished (winter W, spring Sp,summer S, and late-summer LS single crops, winter/summer DCWS and spring/summer DCSpS double crops). Each season, water use (annual evapotranspiration, ET) for each cover/crop type (10 pixels/class) was computed with a daily water balance based on meteorological data and 2 remote sensing-derived indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, to capture canopy conditions, and Dead Fuel Index to represent mulch cover conditions. Throughout 14 crop seasons AG expanded from 20 to 50% of the study area (1M ha) mostly replacing DF. Also, AG gradually evolved from a more intensive and diversified pattern dominated by DC (45-50%), S (28%) and Sp (16%) systems, to a more water-conservative system dominated by LS (60-80% in the last 3 seasons). Crop type differences in ET (DCWS≈DCSpS≈FG>S>Sp>LS≈W) were stronger in wet years (>1000mm) but nil in dry ones (<550mm). As a result, water excess (precipitation-ET) ranged from 0mm for most crop types in the driest year to >250mm for the less intensive W and LS in wet years. Weighting each cover/crop class by their area, we found that the current expansion and reduced intensity of cultivation has cut regional ET of wet years by 50-100mm (compared to early 2000s land cover/crop pattern in similar weather conditions), generating a growing water excess that is likely contributing to drive the water table rises and more frequent floods observed in this region.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC), as a strongly absorbing aerosol, is distinct from most other climate forcers, as it not only has positive top of atmosphere (TOA) radiative forcing, but also redistributes the absorbed radiation vertically through surface dimming and enhancement of atmospheric absorption. Internal mixing (IM) between BC and other aerosol species, e.g. sulfate and organic carbon (OC), primarily from fossil fuel and biomass burning respectively, further enhances its absorbing ability. Most studies of BC focus on particle-scale changes or TOA radiative forcing enhancement. Our work identifies three layer-scale radiative fluxes (at TOA, atmospheric absorption, and at the surface) due to IM and connects them to particle-scale effects through a new conceptual radiative transfer model (RTM). We also employ a Mie calculation for particle-scale effects and a comprehensive RTM for evaluation of the conceptual model. We find that, although scattering decreases and absorption increases by the same amount at the particle scale due to IM, a weakening in scattering is one order of magnitude less at the layer scale, and thus can be neglected to simplify the conceptual RTM. Our result after simplification indicates that IM enhances atmospheric absorption by increasing TOA forcing and decreasing surface forcing the same amount. This is supported by similar findings both globally and over major BC source regions using the comprehensive RTM. Our conceptual RTM well captures layer-scale radiative effects of IM by reducing the complexity of computing and understanding IM-radiation interactions. Using the conceptual RTM, we estimate a global average increase of 0.42 W/m2 when internal mixing of BC with sulfate and OC is included relative to a case where internal mixing with OC is absent. We conclude that including OC in IM with BC is important, especially when analyzing the climate effects of biomass burning and sulfate mitigation.",

            "abstract": "Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are key microorganisms in the transformation of nitrogen intermediates in most all environments. Until recently there was very little work done to elucidate the physiology of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria cultivated from variable trophic state environments. With a greater variety of ammonia-oxidizers now in pure culture the importance of comparative physiological and genomic analysis is crucial. Nearly all known physiology of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria lies within the Nitrosomonas genus with Nitrosomonas europaea strain ATCC 19718 as the model. To more broadly characterize and understand the nature of obligate ammonia chemolithotrophy and the contribution of AOB to production of nitrogen oxides, Nitrosomonas spp. and Nitrosospira spp. isolated from variable trophic states and with sequenced genomes, were utilized. Instantaneous ammonia- and hydroxylamine-oxidation kinetics as a function of oxygen and substrate concentration were measured using an oxygen micro-sensor. The pathway intermediates nitric oxide and nitrous oxide were measured in real time using substrate-specific micro-sensors to elucidate whether production of these molecules is stoichiometric with rates of substrate oxidation. Genomic inventory was compared among the strains to identify specific pathways and modules to explain physiological differences in kinetic rates and production of N-oxide intermediates as a condition of their adaptation to different ammonium concentrations. This work provides knowledge of how nitrogen metabolism is differentially controlled in AOB that are adapted to different concentrations of ammonium. Overall, this work will provide further insight into the control of ammonia oxidizing chemolithotrophy across representatives of the Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira genus, which can then be applied to examine additional genome-sequenced AOB isolates.",

Nutrient deposition may alter C utilization in the estuarine water column, associated sediments and surrounding wetlands. In these anaerobic systems, we hypothesize that microbial activity is limited by the availability of easily-degradable C (not electron acceptors), which acts as a co-metabolite and provides energy for organic matter decomposition. Sporadic transport of highly C enriched storm derived runoff may substantially enhance greenhouse gas (GHG) production rates through the utilization of stored C pools. To test our hypothesis carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) process rates (1) were evaluated from soil cores removed from three distinct HRE wetland sites (Saw Mill Creek, Piermont, and Iona Island Marsh(s)) across a salinity gradient and incubated under varying nutrient treatments. Further, CO2 and CH4 surface water effluxes (2) were quantified from multiple river cruises spanning two years at varying distance from nutrient sources associated with NYC. Incubation experiments from wetland soil core experiments demonstrated that readily degradable C but not inorganic N additions stimulated GHG production (200 - 350 ug C g-1 of dry soil day-1) threefold compared to negative controls. The HRE was found to be both a CO2 and CH4 source under all conditions. The greatest GHG efflux (300 – 3000 nmoles C m-2 day-1) was quantified in mid-channel, tributary, and near shore sites in close proximity to NYC which following precipitation events demonstrated 2-20X increased GHG efflux. These results demonstrate that anthropogenic C additions associated with dense urban centers have the potential to enhance anaerobic microbial degradation of organic matter and subsequent GHG production.",

            "abstract": "Gem Sciences are scientific studies of gemstones – their genesis, provenance, synthesis, enhancement, treatment and identification. As high quality forms of specific minerals, the gemstones exhibit unusual physical properties that are usually unseen in the regular counterparts.\nMost gemstones are colored by trace elements incorporated in the crystal lattice during various growth stages; forming coloration zones of various scales. Studying the spectral and chemical contrast across color zones helps elucidating the origins of colors. These are done by UV-visible spectrometers with microscope and LA-ICPMS in modern gemological laboratories.\nIn the case of diamonds, their colored zones arise from various structural defects incorporated in different growth zones and are studied with FTIR spectrometers with IR microscope and laser photoluminescence spectrometers. Advancement in modern synthetic techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has created some problem for identification. Some exploratory experiments in carbon isotope mapping were done on diamonds using SIMS.\nThe most important issue in pearls is to identify one particular pearl being a cultured one or a natural pearl. The price difference can be enormous. Classical way of such identification is done by x-ray radiographs, which clearly show the bead and the nacre. Modern cultured pearl advancement has eliminated the need for an artificial bead, but a small piece of tissue instead. Nowadays, computer x-ray tomography (CT) scanning devices are used to depict the clear image of the interior of a pearl.\nIn the Chinese jade market, filling fissures with epoxy and/or wax are very commonly seen. We are currently exploring Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique to map the distribution of artificial resin within a polycrystalline aggregates.",

            "abstract": "Because the nutrients upwelled in the Central Equatorial Pacific are primarily sourced from the Southern Ocean, changes in paleoproductivity can reflect the ocean’s dynamical response to paleoclimate change. To reconstruct the productivity in the Central Equatorial Pacific, we will present new opal flux, 231Pa/230Th, and foram-bound δ15N records, along with dust flux data, from six cores from the Line Islands (160˚W, 0-7˚N) at two time slices: the Modern (0-10,000 years before present) and the LGM (17,000-27,000 years before present). We observe a latitude-dependent decrease in both opal flux and 231Pa/230Th during the LGM, with the strongest response at the equator and almost no change at the more northerly cores. These data are indicative of decreased surface productivity, despite contemporaneous increases in dust fluxes and, potentially, iron deposition. Furthermore, relatively constant δ15N of planktic foraminifera across the two time slices imply that nutrient utilization did not increase in the Central Equatorial Pacific during the LGM. Decreased productivity coupled with static nutrient utilization suggests that the overall nutrient concentration in upwelling waters may have decreased. Lower nutrient concentrations in waters feeding the low latitudes are consistent with recent evidence for higher nutrient utilization at high latitudes, and this coupling provides further evidence for the feedback between polar and tropical climate change.",

            "abstract": "In order to establish a foundation for studies of faulting in Martian rocks and soils in volcanic terrain, the distribution of brittle strain around faults within the North Menan Butte Tuff in the eastern Snake River Plain, Idaho and the Joe Lott Tuff Member of the Mount Belknap Volcanics, Utah, has been recently described. These studies employed a combination of macroscopic and microscopic observations, including measurements of in situ permeability as a proxy for non-localized brittle deformation of the host rock. In areas where the tuff retained its primary granular nature at the time of deformation, initial plastic yielding in both tuffs occurred along deformation bands. Both compactional and dilational types of deformation bands were observed, and faulting occurred along clusters of deformation bands. Where secondary alteration processes imparted a massive texture to the tuff, brittle deformation was accommodated along fractures. Host-rock permeability exhibits little variation from non-deformed values in the North Menan Butte Tuff, whereas host rock permeability is reduced by roughly an order of magnitude through compaction alone (no alteration) in the Joe Lott Tuff.\nTo create a bridge between these observations in tuff and the more substantial body of work centered on deformation band formation and faulting in quartz-rich sandstones, the same techniques employed in the North Menan Butte Tuff and the Joe Lott Tuff have also been applied to a kilometer-scale fault in the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone in the Waterpocket Fold, Utah. These observations demonstrate that the manifestation of strain and evolution of faulting in the Mars-analog tuffs are comparable to that in quartz-rich sandstones. Therefore, current understanding of brittle deformation in quartz-rich sandstones can be used to inform investigations into fault growth within porous tuffs on Mars. A discussion of these observations, practical limitations, and directions for future work are presented here.",

            "abstract": "Observations of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko carried out by the VIRTIS spectrometer in the pre-landing phase of the Rosetta mission are analyzed to infer composition of the surface and coma [1]. Minerals, dust, ice mixtures and organic materials produce characteristic absorptions at the surface; similarly, typical emission features result from the de-excitation of the main gases in the coma. However, like all dark objects, the surface of 67P displays very reduced spectral contrast, and coma emissions are equally difficult to characterize at large solar distance.\nThe MULTiScale Unimixing Method for Extraction of Spectral Components (Mulțumesc) was devised to address this problem: extracting small spectral features in the presence of noise, and providing quantitative detection criteria [2]. The method does not assume any spectral characteristics or composition of the object, and only requires a realistic estimate of the noise level. It has previously been used to confirm marginal detections of ices on TNOs [2], and to derive an upper limit on the abundance of pyroxenes on Mercury [3].\nThe method is applied to the M–IR (1-5 µm, R~300) and H (2-5 µm, R~3000) channels of VIRTIS. In the case of the H channel, which is an échelle spectrometer, the method is applied to individual grating orders in order to preserve spectral resolution. Spectral features are required to have a minimum spectral and spatial extension in order to filter transient effects in the detector. The noise estimate is derived from the analysis of dark current measurements. Longward of ~3.5 µm, spectra of the surface are first inverted to corrected from thermal emission [4]; this is needed only to study broad features which could be significantly modified by the onset of the thermal emission. Results from the pre-landing phase will be presented at the meeting.\nVIRTIS is supported by ASI, CNES and DLR. Support from the Rosetta and VIRTIS science, instrument, and operation teams is gratefully acknowledged.\n",

            "abstract": "Data from TRMM, the A-Train satellites, and the Worldwide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) have been used to study extreme weather throughout low latitudes, from deep convection over the Himalayas to oceanic mesoscale systems associated with the MJO. This study presents a more in-depth examination of convection over the Maritime Continent (Indonesia and Malaysia). During November to February, this area is the rainiest regional climate on Earth, thus constituting one of the atmosphere’s primary heat sources. On multiple temporal and spatial scales, it is a complex region with clouds and precipitation having both oceanic and orographic influence. The November-February season encompasses both the eastward propagation of the MJO through this region and rainfall associated with the Asian-Australian monsoon. More specifically, the precipitation in this region is strongly modulated by MJO phases, pulsations of the monsoon, and the powerful diurnal effects of the islands and ocean. Through a feature-based analysis of convective and stratiform components of storms, the evolution of precipitating clouds in this region will be described using data from the November-February time period over multiple years. This analysis leads to an increased understanding of the characteristics of convection associated with the intraseasonal and diurnal variability during these months over the Maritime Continent. Previous work using A-Train data noted the prevalence of smaller separated MCSs over the region during the locally active phase of the MJO, and WWLLN data have shown a peak in lightning density as convection becomes deeper and more numerous leading up to this active period. By applying the analysis of the TRMM data in addition to the A-Train and WWLLN datasets, the relative roles of convective and stratiform components of MCSs to the behavior of convection can be determined during the MJO and monsoonal maxima of rainfall over the Maritime Continent.",

            "abstract": "We present an analytical solution to the steady state upward-concave bed profile, as well as downstream fining, for a river dominated by gravel and sand. The model is based on (i) the conservation equation of streamwise momentum of the flow, (ii) the conservation equation of the mass of each grain size fraction in the surface layer of the bed (the Hirano equation) yet including sediment abrasion, and (iii) the conservation equation of total sediment mass (the Exner equation). The model includes downstream fining induced by abrasion as well as by grainsize-selective transport of gravel and sand. In order to arrive at an analytical solution, the model is deliberately kept simple through assumptions such as a constant width and no tributaries. The model is then reduced to the case of steady state conditions, which means that all time derivatives in the equations are set to zero. We find a solution to the steady state streamwise profile of both the bed slope and the volume fraction of gravel in the surface layer of the bed. Like existing empirical predictors, the analytical solution is of an exponential type. The main variables that affect the solution are the total load at the upstream boundary, the gravel fraction in this upstream load, the abrasion coefficient, the grain sizes of the sediment, and the water discharge at the upstream boundary. The below image shows an example of how the gravel fraction in the upstream load affects the solution to the longitudinal profiles of, respectively, bed slope (S), the gravel fraction at the bed surface (Fg), and the mean grain size of the sediment at the bed surface (Dgs). We can see how an increase in the gravel fraction in the upstream load results in a larger overall slope and an increase in profile concavity. It also induces an increase of the gravel fraction at the bed surface.",

            "abstract": "Recently published and ongoing research at several of the circum-Pacific oceanic arcs (Izu-Bonin-Marianas, Tonga) has led to the development of tectonic models for how these subduction zones have formed and evolved since the Eocene. An outstanding question that has yet to be answered is how the timing of initiation and evolution of the Aleutian arc is linked to these current tectonic models. More than 70 new 40Ar/39Ar ages and over 100 major and trace element analyses of lavas and plutons exposed on numerous central and western Aleutian islands have been determined as part of a reconnaissance effort to address this question. Exposures of > 42 Ma rocks remain elusive, and likely require a concerted sampling campaign in the submarine forearc. The new geochemical and geochronologic data support the suggestion that initial growth of the Aleutian arc was rapid and subsequent growth occurred in three distinct pulses (37-29, 17-11, 6-0 Ma) (e.g., Jicha et al., 2006), a trend also observed in other circum-Pacific arcs. Eocene-Oligocene lavas and gabbroic plutons of the western Aleutians are tholeiitic with island arc-like trace element patterns that can be light rare earth element (LREE) depleted. These compositions are distinctly different from the calc-alkaline, light rare earth element (REE) enriched and variably heavy REE depleted, Pleistocene to Holocene primitive andesites and dacites found atop the thinner, faulted crust of the western Aleutians. Widespread calc-alkaline magmatism does not appear to commence until the Miocene, although some Oligocene calc-alkaline lavas and plutons have been found throughout the arc and along the Bowers Ridge (Wanke et al., 2012). A major transition in post-Pliocene arc chemistry occurs as a sediment melt component, which was not available early in the development of the Aleutian Arc becomes important in the Pleistocene (e.g., Kay and Kay 1994; Schaen, 2014).",

            "abstract": "Rhyolites are a significant component of continental magmatism of Oregon for the last 40 million years. Rhyolites of all time slices are compositionally diverse ranging from low to high-silica rhyolites, from less fractionated rhyolites with high Ba concentrations (≥1300 ppm Ba) and weak Eu anomalies (>0.4 Eu/Eu*) to strongly fractionated rhyolites with very low Ba contents (≤100 ppm) but strong Eu anomalies (≤0.2 Eu/Eu*), and rhyolites range from Fe-rich, A-type rhyolites to calc-alkaline varieties. In this study, we focus on one compositional end member of rhyolites that is characterized by very low concentrations of high field strength elements (HFSE) designated here as low HFSE rhyolites. Such low HFSE rhyolites contain Nb and Ta contents of 8–13 ppm and 0.8–1.1 ppm, respectively, and Zr and Hf concentrations of 60–150 ppm and 2.5–4 ppm, respectively. The significance of these low HFSE concentrations is that they are consistent with partial melting of observed crustal rocks but not with fractionation of observed mafic magmas.\nCompilation of chemical data of Cenozoic mafic magmas across Oregon indicate that the vast majority of basaltic rocks contain Nb and Zr contents in excess of 5 and 100 ppm, respectively. Only the most primitive high-Al olivine basalts have concentrations as low as 1 and 40 ppm. Basaltic magmas generate rhyolitic liquids after ~90-95% crystallization (e.g., as seen in lava lakes). After such high amounts of crystallization using basaltic magmas from Oregon, Nb and Zr contents would be far in excess of what is observed in these low HFSE rhyolites as both elements will behave incompatibly (strongly to moderately) during fractionation to rhyolites. Also, there are chemical and petrographic arguments that neither late titanite nor zircon fractionation in rhyolites caused low HFSE contents. Although lesser amounts of fractionation would be needed starting with an andesitic composition, HFSE contents of most andesites are already on levels as in low HFSE rhyolites. This indicates pure fractionation scenarios from mafic magmas to yield low HFSE rhyolites are implausible. On the other hand, there are intermediate to silicic crustal rocks with appropriately low HFSE contents that can yield rhyolite liquids during partial melting with or without restitic zircon.",

In contrast, the interstellar medium reflects current galactic conditions. The departure of current abundances from the primordial and protosolar values may help trace the processes that drive the nucleosynthesis evolution of the galaxy. Here, we use the solar He 58.4 nm line measured by the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) to derive the He abundance inside the focusing cone. We also use Hubble Space Telescope, SOHO, and Voyager observations to constrain the properties of the interplanetary hydrogen flow, particularly at the heliospheric interface. Finally, we compare H and He abundances derived here with primordial and protosolar values, stressing the unique opportunity offered by inner heliosphere observations and future Voyager in situ local interstellar medium measurements to derive the He abundance in the very interstellar cloud in which we reside.",

            "abstract": "Laser-shock compression on four alkali halides has been used to probe the transition from insulating to metallic states, a high-pressure transition in chemical bonding that has fundamental implications for planetary formation and structure. Collectively, pressures up to 450 GPa were explored across a total of fourteen single-crystal samples of CsI, CsBr, KBr and NaCl. Velocity interferometry (VISAR) was used to record shock velocities and reflectivities at 532 nm during decaying shock compression. The data show up to three-fold increases in density as well as significant increases in optical reflectivity in response to high pressures and temperatures. Using a Drude model to estimate conductivities from the measured reflectivities, we investigate the onset of metallic conductivities for each compound.\nIonic salts are simple model systems amenable to first-principles theory and serve as analog materials for predicting whether specific chemical constituents can reside in the rocky mantles or metallic cores of planets. A key objective is to disentangle the complementary roles of temperature and compression in transforming ionic into metallic bonding. Furthermore, at high pressures CsI becomes analogous to Xe: they are isoelectronic and follow matching equations of state. Therefore, studies on CsI can inform understanding of noble-gas geochemistry at conditions deep inside planets (e.g., the likelihood of Xe solubility in planetary mantles or cores). Our experiments were conducted using the Janus laser of the Jupiter Laser Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",

            "abstract": "It is widely known that earthquakes can trigger each other. Most explanations attribute this interaction to either static or dynamic stress changes caused by coseismic slip, although other mechanisms of interaction exist. Motivated by the interactive behavior of small repeating earthquake sequences (RES) on the creeping section of the San Andreas Fault, we study, through numerical modeling of rate-and-state faults, how clustered small seismogenic zones embedded into creeping fault areas trigger seismic events on one another.\nOur work has shown that, for a wide range of laboratory-motivated fault properties, static stress changes due to postseismic slip is more important in triggering seismic events than the coseismic stress changes. Such finding is based on the comparison of our simulations and the fault failure models that only account for the static coseismic stress changes. The time advance of triggered events is much larger and the interaction of RES extends much farther than would be predicted based on static stress changes from coseismic slip alone.\nIn this study, we investigate how the interaction of the repeating sequences depends on the properties of the creeping segment. Our results indicate that more velocity-strengthening faults, i.e. faults with larger values of the rate-and-state parameter (a-b), suppress propagating creep fronts and reduce interaction. Further, triggering time is determined by the propagation speed of postseismic creep, which depends on the frictional properties and the co-seismic stress increase on the creeping area. The latter quantity is related to the stress drop of the seismic event and can be estimated from coseismic slip. Hence, with known stress drops and triggering times, it should be possible to infer the frictional properties of the creeping region.\nOur models also show that interaction of seismogenic patches of different sizes leads to significant irregularity in the recurrence time and magnitude of the resulting seismic events, even though each patch would produce a perfect repeating sequence on its own. Such irregularity is observed for natural repeating sequences. While spatial and/or temporal variability in fault properties may be responsible for such behavior, our simulations show that the irregularity may be at least in part due to the interaction.",

            "abstract": "Pyrope (Mg3Al2Si3O12) rich garnet is the most important secondary mineral phase with volume fractions ranging between 20 % in the shallow upper mantle to 40 % in the lower part of upper mantle. The volume fractions of garnet in subducted oceanic crusts are as high as 80 %. However, our understanding of the incorporation of water in garnet as proton defect is rather limited. Experimental studies conducted at pressures and temperatures relevant to the deep lower mantle have resulted in wide range of water contents ranging between 0 wt % to ~ 0.8 wt %. In a pyriolyte composition representative of the upper mantle, unlike olivine (Mg2SiO4), which remains largely iso-chemical upon compression, garnet undergoes solid solution with pyroxene (MgSiO3) and as a result there is a continuous evolution of the chemistry of garnet as a function of pressure. This complicates the analysis of proton defects using conventional thermodynamics expressing water solubility as a function of water fugacity, oxide activity, and activation volume.\nTo circumvent this issue, we use first principles simulations to explore the relative energetics of the formation of protons in Mg, Al, and Si sites. Preliminary results at ambient conditions indicate positive enthalpy changes for the proton defects in all the sites, with silicon site being the most favorable. We intend to explore the effect of pressure and temperature on the defect formation energies.\nAcknowledgement- MM is supported by the US National Science Foundation grant (EAR-1250477).",

            "abstract": "Earth structure beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet is characterized by significant lateral variability. A stable, thick craton exists in the east, while the west is underlain by a large continental rift system and a relatively thin lithosphere. Moreover, high resolution seismic tomography indicates slow wave speeds in the shallow mantle below WAIS, suggesting a hot, low viscosity asthenosphere. Variations in viscoelastic Earth structure can impact predictions of relative sea-level change and present-day crustal deformation rates by: 1) altering the timing and geometry of load-induced Earth deformation; and 2) perturbing, via a sea-level feedback (Gomez et al., EPSL, 2013), the timing and extent of the ice-sheet retreat. In this talk we use a coupled ice sheet – sea level model to explore the sensitivity of predictions of glacial isostatic adjustment and ice-sheet evolution in the Antarctic region to variations in Earth model parameters. We begin with a large suite of simulations in which 1-D (depth dependent) viscosity structure is varied over ranges that capture depth profiles inferred beneath the West and East Antarctic. We also present a simulation that incorporate 3-D variations in lithospheric thickness and mantle viscosity. The calculations will focus both on the evolution of the region since the Last Glacial Maximum and on projections of future, climate change driven ice-sheet retreat.",

Additionally, as yet there does not exist a calcite standard reference material for inter-laboratory accuracy and precision comparison, with most laboratories using their own in-house standard material and focussing largely on application to paleoclimate studies (e.g. corals and speleothems). In actively deforming regions, high-pressure hydrothermal fluids play an important role in faulting and vein formation, and commonly fault rupture is followed by rapid sealing through mineral precipitation. Therefore, precise dating of vein growth is of special importance to our understanding of the complex interplay between seismic events and fluid flow in the upper crust, and opens up a new field of study using U-Th techniques. The ability to accurately date fault-filling calcite within such settings has the power to elucidate the connection between structure and fluid flow in the development of geothermal systems, and provide valuable information on the longevity of the heat/water source, in addition to regional magmatic history. We are developing U-Th measurements and ages of vein calcite from geothermal systems using a Neptune Plus MC-ICP-MS (with 5 CDDs and 3 SEMs) coupled to an excimer 193nm Photon Machines laser. We will be comparing our results with an 189ka in-house flowstone calcite standard previously dated by TIMS, as well as developing a geothermal calcite standard.",

At early times, within a few ion cyclotron oscillations from the peak reconnection,\nelectron orbit dynamics dominate, and the Hall electric field layer assumes the width of the electron current layer.\nAs the pre-existing current sheet ions are accelerated and jetted away, inflowing ions form an ion phase space hole structure.\nThe ion hole structure is self-consistently supported by the Hall electric field. The ion meandering orbit width increases\nover the course of about 10 ion cyclotron oscillations from several to approximately 40 electron skin depths (two ion skin depths,\nwhere the skin depth is based on the initial current sheet density), and the\nHall electric field layer widens in the same manner to become much broader than the electron diffusion region.\nThe electron velocity distributions upstream of the electron diffusion region and within the region\nof counter streaming ions become fragmented as the ion hole establishes itself.\nThe fragmentation is carried into the electron diffusion region, and through the electron outflow jet, leading to a multitude of arcs in the electron distributions at the end of the jet. The broadening of the Hall electric field layer resolves a longstanding discrepancy concerning whether the narrowest width of the layer is of the electron [Chen et al., 2008] or ion [Mozer et al., 2002] scale.

This dataset shows a subsidence signal over western Christchurch that occurred over a long period of almost 6 years prior to the Christchurch earthquake. The subsidence occurs immediately west of the transition from unconfined to confined aquifers, in an area where the water table is locally deep (exceeding 6 m), unconfined groundwater is downwards flowing and levels are highly variable (van Ballegooy et al. 2014).\nSecond, two differential interferograms in an ascending orbit between 6 September 2010 and 22 September 2010 and in a descending orbit between 13 September 2010 and 29 September 2010 help us to distinguish between horizontal and vertical components of deformation. In addition, 11 COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) SAR acquisitions in an ascending orbit from October 2010 to February 2011 over the eastern end of the Greendale fault have been processed (Motagh, Beavan et al. 2014). This dataset shows a spectacular time-varying subsidence signal over a previously recognized step-over between the right-lateral eastern and central Greendale faults. A variety of geophysical models, including afterslip and poroelastic rebound have been used to understand the ground deformation. The other feature has also been observed by differential satellite interferometry using TerraSAR-X (TSX) data in a descending orbit between 7 September 2010 and 18 September 2010, following the Darfield earthquake. This dataset shows the ground deformation connecting the eastern end of the Greendale fault towards the city of Christchurch.\nFinally, 66 TerraSAR-X (TSX) SAR acquisitions in a descending orbit between February 2011 and April 2014 show approximately three years of postseismic deformation following the Christchurch earthquake. Subsidence signals within the coastal region of Christchurch city and at the end of the eastern Greendale fault are the pronounced anomalies that have been detected.",

            "abstract": "A new study of the 3-D velocity structure of Taiwan, using a new tomographic model (Vp and Vs; Huang et al., 2014), suggests that subducted continental crust is delaminated from the subducting mantle of the Eurasia plate and progressively deformed by the subducting Philippine Sea plate. In southern Taiwan, vertical sections show an east-dipping, asymmetric lobe of low velocity that projects down dip to a band of seismicity interpreted as the Wadati-Benioff zone of the subducting Eurasian plate. Seismic tremors in the mid-crust also suggest dehydration (Chuang et al., 2014), consistent with prograde metamorphism of crustal materials. In central Taiwan, however, the seismicity of the W-B zone progressively disappears and the low velocity lobe shallows and broadens. The velocity structure of the lower and middle crust (represented by the 7.5 and 6.5 km/sec isovelocity surfaces, respectively) also appear distinctly out-of-phase, with the lower crust forming a broad, smooth synformal structure that contrasts with the higher amplitude undulations of the middle crust. These mid-crust structures appear as smaller irregular lobes separated by patches of higher velocity. In northern Taiwan, the velocity structure of the lower and middle crust again appear “in phase” and form a symmetrical crustal root centered beneath the Central Range. Seismicity patterns and 3-D analysis of the velocity structure also show the western edge of the PSP subducting beneath the eastern Central Range. We interpret these south-to-north changes to reflect the partial subduction (southern Taiwan), delamination (central Taiwan) and deformation (northern Taiwan) of continental-like crust. Support for these interpretation comes from: 1) unusually high rates of surface uplift (up to 15 mm/yr; Ching et al., 2011); 2) Vp and Vs attenuation studies that suggest anomalously high temperatures; 3) evidence for NE-SW extension; and 4) anomalous areas of low topographic relief.",

            "abstract": "Hydrometeorological events (i.e. floods, droughts, precipitation) are increasingly being forecasted probabilistically, owing to the uncertainties in the underlying causes of the phenomenon. In these forecasts, the probability of the event, over some lead time, is estimated based on some model simulations or predictive indicators. By issuing probabilistic forecasts, agencies may communicate the uncertainty in the event occurring. Assuming that the assigned probability of the event is correct, which is referred to as a reliable forecast, the end user may perform some risk management based on the potential damages resulting from the event. Alternatively, an unreliable forecast may give false impressions of the actual risk, leading to improper decision making when protecting resources from extreme events. Due to this requisite for reliable forecasts to perform effective risk management, this study takes a renewed look at reliability assessment in event forecasts. Illustrative experiments will be presented, showing deficiencies in the commonly available approaches (Brier Score, Reliability Diagram). Overall, it is shown that the conventional reliability assessment techniques do not maximize the ability to distinguish between a reliable and unreliable forecast. In this regard, a theoretical formulation of the probabilistic event forecast verification framework will be presented. From this analysis, hypothesis testing with the Poisson-Binomial distribution is the most exact model available for the verification framework, and therefore maximizes one’s ability to distinguish between a reliable and unreliable forecast. Application of this verification system was also examined within a real forecasting case study, highlighting the additional statistical power provided with the use of the Poisson-Binomial distribution.",

            "abstract": "In order to study the mantle transition zone structure near the Tonga subduction zone in the southwestern Pacific, we analyzed receiver functions from teleseismic P waves recorded by 17 seismic stations on islands and 50 ocean bottom seismographs deployed as part of the RIDGE2000 Lau Basin Imaging Project. The orientations of the OBSs were derived from a combination of the results of ambient noise correlation and Rayleigh-wave polarization orientation methods. These orientations were used to rotate the seismograms into a ray-centered (LQT) coordinate system, and receiver functions were calculated with an iterative deconvolution in the time domain [Ammon, 1999]. Then a 3-D stacking approach [T. J. Owens, 2000] was adopted to stack those receiver functions for all station-event pairs. We binned the study area in 0.25° by 0.25° regions and stacked the traces within 1.25° radius from each bin at depths with a 5-km increment. The Tonga slab subducts with the fastest known convergence velocity, and a flat slab with scattered seismicity is found to the west of the main Tonga slab in tomographic models. A shallowing of the 410-km and a depression of the 660-km discontinuities are expected at and near the slab since the olivine transitions are perturbed by the cold slab at these depths, although metastabliity of the phase transitions may produce additional complications. We will present preliminary results for the variation of the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities in the region.",

Two methods of parameterizing the large scale dynamics are used; the Weak Temperature Gradient (WTG) approximation and the Damped Gravity Wave (DGW) method.\nIt is found that, when stating with moist initial conditions, an increment in surface fluxes produce more precipitation than equal amount of increment of column-integrated radiative cooling. A simple scaling argument based on the normalized gross moist stability is introduced.\nWhen starting with dry initial conditions, the atmosphere in WTG exhibits multiple equilibria of a wet and a dry states for a wide range of net energy input to the atmospheric column. The persistence of the dry state lasts longer when surface fluxes are perturbed, in the time mean as well as in the time evolution. The DGW method, however, shows no multiple equilibria.",

More than 43 different PAN species are known; their relative abundances are chemical markers of the types and quantities of the VOCs involved in the O3-formation process. For example, MPAN (R: CH2=C(CH3)-) is primarily derived from isoprene and thus a marker of biogenic VOC oxidation, whereas PPN (R: C2H5-) is a photo-oxidation byproduct of anthropogenic VOCs.\nIn the summer of 2013 an intensive air quality measurement campaign was conducted to investigate the impacts of emissions from the Alberta oil sands mining operations on the chemical composition of ambient air. As part of this effort, several peroxycarboxylic nitric anhydrides, specifically PAN (R: CH3-), PPN, MPAN, APAN (R: CH2=CH-), and PiBN (R: iC3H7-), were quantified by gas chromatography with electron capture detection at the AMS13 ground site near Fort McKay, Alberta. Furthermore, total peroxyacyl nitrates (ΣPAN) were quantified by thermal dissociation cavity ring-down spectroscopy (TD-CRDS).\nPAN mixing ratios typically peaked in the mid-afternoon (maximum PAN mixing ratio of 0.85 ppbv), constituting up to 25% of total odd nitrogen (NOy), and were usually below detection limits at night. ΣPAN was generally greater than the amount calculated by summation of individually measured PANs (SPANi) suggesting the presence of PAN species not measured by GC. During times of active photo-oxidation chemistry, the PPN:PAN and MPAN:PAN ratios varied considerably between days, depending on air mass origin and VOC composition. A linear combination model (LCM) was used to assess regional O3 production from the oxidation of biogenic hydrocarbons (via MPAN) relative to that of anthropogenic hydrocarbons (via PPN). The relative contribution of anthropogenic VOCs to regional O3 production varied between 20% and 80%. A box model using a subset of the Master Chemical Mechanism was used to investigate how measurements of APAN and PiBN may be incorporated in the LCM framework.",

            "abstract": "Microbial communities from acid mine drainage environments are exposed to multiple stressors to include low pH, high dissolved metal loads, seasonal freezing, and desiccation. The microbial and algal communities that inhabit these niche environments have evolved strategies that allow for their ecological success. Metagenomic analyses are useful in identifying species diversity, however they do not elucidate the mechanisms that allow for the resilience of a community under these extreme conditions. Many known or predicted genes encode for protein products that are unknown, or similarly, many proteins cannot be traced to their gene of origin. This investigation seeks to identify genes that are active in an algal consortium during stress from living in an acid mine drainage environment. Our approach involves using the entire community transcriptome for a functional screen in an Escherichia coli host. This approach directly targets the genes involved in survival, without need for characterizing the members of the consortium.\nThe consortium was harvested and stressed with conditions similar to the native environment it was collected from. Exposure to low pH (< 3.2), high metal load, desiccation, and deep freeze resulted in the expression of stress-induced genes that were transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA). These mRNA transcripts were harvested to build complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries in E. coli. The transformed E. coli were exposed to the same stressors as the original algal consortium to select for surviving cells. Successful cells incorporated the transcripts that encode survival mechanisms, thus allowing for selection and identification of the gene(s) involved. Initial selection screens for freeze and desiccation tolerance have yielded E. coli that are 1 order of magnitude more resistant to freezing (0.01% survival of control with no transcript, 0.2% survival of E. coli with transcript) and 3 orders of magnitude more resistant to desiccation (0.005% survival of control cells with no transcripts, 5% survival of cells with transcript).\nThis work is transformative because genetic functions can be selected without having prior knowledge of the genes or of the organisms involved. Work continues to identify the genes responsible for tolerance to extreme conditions and the bio-mechanisms involved.",

Recently we used WRF model together with VOCALS observations to illustrate that the aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions may lessen the SST bias. However, that study used prescribed SST and thus did not allow proper atmosphere-ocean coupling, which past studies have shown to be important. Here we further examine the aerosol-cloud-radiation interaction by allowing SST feedback, using the WRF model coupled with a simple ocean-mixed layer scheme.The study will provide insight into the importance of SST feedback to the aerosol-cloud-radiation interaction.",

            "abstract": "Aluminum and Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates, as well as sulfates, are abundant in the layered sediments of the central mound of Gale Crater on Mars. Each of these mineral types are useful indicators of depositional conditions regarding pH, where Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates form in higher pH waters, while Al-phyllosilicates and sulfates form in more acidic waters. A general succession from higher pH aquatic environments to lower pH environments is evident during the Noachian and early Hesperian (3.6~3.8 Ga). However, substantial interbedding of these mineral groups is also observed at Gale, indicating pH boundaries that existed contemporaneously at the time of deposition. This is consistent with mineral distributions that are observed in ephemeral lakes on Earth, making them useful as analogs to the geochemistry of Gale Crater. This study will analyze the surficial mineral depositional patterns at Lake Gilmore, WA, to better understand how pH gradients are represented in contemporaneous sediment deposits. This will be performed by identifying minerals based on their unique reflectance signatures in the visible to near-infrared range (0.5-2.5 mm). Reflectance data collected by the HyMap™ hyperspectral scanner will be analyzed using the ENVI software to map the predominant minerals present on the lakebed surface. We expect to see minerals associated with a pH gradient that is related to lake depth, with Fe and alkali earth phyllosilicates representing deeper, less acidic waters, and aluminous phyllosilicates and sulfates representing near surface waters that are more acidic. This is potentially due to the circulation of upwelling groundwaters, or the change in chemistry may have arisen due to microbial activity, an intriguing possibility that would have significant implications for evidence of past microbial life on the Martian surface and would provide a more detailed picture of the paleoenvironment at Gale Crater.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of atmospheric turbulence made at two different sites located near the coast of the Arctic Ocean at Eureka (Canadian territory of Nunavut) and Tiksi (East Siberia) are used to study turbulent fluxes, scaling laws for turbulent mixing, dissipation rates, and structure parameters of various scalars (temperature, water vapour, and carbon dioxide). Turbulent fluxes along with other turbulent statistics and mean meteorological data were measured continuously throughout the year and reported hourly at various levels on 10-m (Eureka) and 20-m (Tiksi) flux towers. According to our data, strong upward sensible and latent heat fluxes are observed throughout the summer months indicating unstable stratification on average. During the Polar winter and cold seasons when the air temperature falls below freezing, the near-surface environment is generally stably stratified (downward sensible but upward latent heat fluxes). It is found that observed temporal variability of the carbon dioxide vertical flux for both sites was generally in phase with Monin-Obukhov stability parameter, z/L (L is the Obukhov length scale). On average the turbulent flux of carbon dioxide was mostly negative (uptake by the surface) for z/L < 0 and vice versa. Our study also analyses the similarity between the turbulent mixing of sensible heat, water vapour, and carbon dioxide with a specific focus on the difference between the similarity functions for the dissipation rates.

            "abstract": "The growth process of old ocean lithosphere has long been debated. Thermal models have included half-space conductive cooling, constant thickness cooling plate models with heat supplied to the base of the lithosphere by small-scale convection, and half-space cooling disrupted by impinging plumes. Seafloor subsidence and heat flux values for seafloor ages above 80 Ma are satisfied by the plate model, but previous Rayleigh wave studies have shown that thickening of the plate extends deeper than expected for those models. However, there is a lack of data from sufficiently old seafloor to describe end-member upper mantle structure in areas that have not been reheated by hotspot activity. We analyze Rayleigh wave data obtained from the PLATE project (Pacific Lithosphere Anisotropy and Thickness Experiment), where the seafloor is 150-160 Ma and has not been resurfaced by subsequent volcanism. Rayleigh wave phase velocities for periods from 18 to 125 s are inverted for shear wave velocities to study upper mantle structure. Shear velocities in the western region of our study area reach approximately 5.0 km/s in the top 20 km of the lithosphere and slightly higher in the eastern region. These velocities are higher than any reported in regional or global studies of the oceanic lithosphere that have poorer lateral resolution. These velocities are consistent with those predicted for conductive cooling of old, dehydrated oceanic lithosphere in previous petrologic studies. Shear wave velocities show a negative velocity gradient from 30 to 150 km depth, reaching a minimum velocity of ~4.3 km/s in the asthenospheric low velocity zone. Overall, the velocity structure for our study area beneath old oceanic seafloor is very similar to that predicted for a cooling half-space.",

            "abstract": "Urbanizing basins (i.e. basins under urban growth) typify coupled human-natural (CHN) systems, which are said to be complex. Furthermore, the level of complexity of these basins could be assumed to depend on how much the natural environment has been disturbed. In this study we attempt to characterize these systems by quantifying their statistical complexity and its linkage with the degree of urbanization. To perform this quantification, we use both multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MDFA) and permutation entropy (PE). MDFA is used to determine long-term dependencies, the Hurst exponent, and the level of multifractality in the hydrological records. On the other hand, PE is used to characterize short-term dependencies and determine the degree of statistical complexity in the records using a metric that depends non-trivially on entropy. The MDFA and PE analysis were applied to long-term hydrologic records (streamflow, baseflow, and rainfall) from 20 urbanizing basins located in the metropolitan areas of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Washington DC, US. Results show that streamflow in urbanizing basins displays scaling over a wide range of temporal scales, as well as multifractal properties. More relevantly, we found that the scaling and the strength of the multifractality tend to weaken as the basins become more urbanized (i.e. streamflow records become more similar to the driving rainfall forcing with increasing urbanization). This interpretation is supported by the non-significant dependency of baseflow on the amount of urban development in the basin. The PE analysis shows that the statistical complexity of streamflow decreases for the most urbanized basins while the entropy increases, thereby suggesting that streamflow become less structured and more random with increasing urbanization. Overall, this study illustrates the potential of the analysis performed and associated metrics to characterize the hydrological impact of urbanization.",

            "abstract": "Effective reaction rates in porous media are controlled by the spatial organization of chemical species concentrations at the pore scale. From high resolution millifluidic pore scale imaging of reactive tracers we report experimental evidence of the formation of well-developed lamellar structures in reactive mixtures transported through porous media (de Anna et al., Environ. Sci. Technol., 2014). The latter are highlighted by a chemioluminescent reaction producing photons that localize along spatially coherent lines, representing hotspots of mixing and reaction at pore scale. These elongated spatial structures are naturally created by the stretching action of the pore scale velocity field, which induces a dynamic deformation of the material elements carrying solutes (Le Borgne et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2013). This particular spatial organization is shown to have a major impact on global reactivity by increasing the surface available for reactive mixing and by enhancing local chemical gradients (de Anna et al., Geophys. Res. Lett. 2014). We quantify this phenomenon for different flow topologies using a reactive lamella representation, which links fluid deformation, diffusion and reaction at the elementary scale. The upscaled reaction rates, estimated by integrating the distribution of local deformation rates, are shown to follow different temporal behavior depending on the distribution of local velocity gradients. This approach allows for the systematic evaluation of the temporal evolution of upscaled reaction rates, and establishes a direct link between the global reaction efficiency and the spatial characteristics of the underlying pore scale flow field.\n",

            "abstract": "Kaau Crater is located on Oahu, Hawaii, and was formed about 1 million years ago. The crater is a wetland about 450 m in diameter, which has been accumulating sediment since at least 25,866 cal yr BP. Sediment accumulation environments suitable for stratigraphic paleoscience studies in tropical mountaintop locations, relatively unaffected by humans, are scarce. This research aims to provide a comprehensive multi-millennial record of environmental change over time, including a reconstruction of precipitation and temperature.\nA continuous 450 cm organic sediment core was raised from Kaau Crater and analyzed for bulk density, organic matter (OM), stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, and sediment accumulation rate as well as fossil pollen. Thirteen radiocarbon measurements show that the profile represents 14,087 years of sedimentation, and continuous sedimentation since ~8000 cal yr BP. Bulk density was typically about 0.17 g cm-3, but is particularly high (0.56 g cm-3) in sediments deposited between 5800 and 4400 cal yr BP. High variability during this time period is also seen in OM, stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, and sediment accumulation rate. The OM content varies greatly throughout the core, from 12 to 94%. The 13C and 15N range -28.3 to -26.1‰ and 0.7 to 5.7‰. Maximum sedimentation and organic matter accumulation is between 6810-3942 cal yr BP, during which time, the organic C accumulation rate is 46.1 g m-2 yr-1. The C:N ratio is most variable during the mid-Holocene and the maximum is at 6326 cal yr BP. Thirty-eight pollen types were identified representing a mixture of dry- to wet-tolerant taxa. A reconstruction of annual precipitation suggests substantial variation on multi-centennial and shorter scales, particularly during the mid-Holocene (-643.4-5654 mm anomaly), but a lack of Holocene-scale wetting or drying. A reconstruction of mean annual temperature shows an overall multi-millennial cooling trend at the crater more pronounced after 5400 cal yr BP, along with diminishing dry-season insolation and a strengthening ENSO and increasing frequency of El Niño events. These results indicate the sensitivity of tropical mountaintop environments to climatic change on centennial and shorter timescales, and the differences in responses on windward versus leeward sides of tropical high islands.",

The sub-ice seawater flow was described by the wave equation (Holdsworth and Glynn, 1978), so the ice-shelf flexures result from the hydrostatic pressure perturbations in sub-ice seawater. The modelling of ice-shelf vibrations was successfully performed in (Holdsworth and Glynn, 1978) by employing of the thin-plate approximation. The numerical simulation has shown that the modelling of the ice-shelf vibrations can be performed in the full model, which links well known momentum equations with the wave equation for non-viscous fluid, i.e. for sub-ice seawater. Nevertheless, the numerical simulation reveals that the numerical solution stability requires the application of an additional method in the numerical approximation. The aim of this work is in an attempt to apply an additional approximation in the boundary conditions to improve the numerical stability of the model. The second purpose is to obtain eigen-frequencies of the system, which includes an ice-self and sub-ice water, and to investigate the ice-shelf geometry impact to the eigen-frequencies (in particular, the crevasses effect on the eigen-frequencies). The numerical experiments were carried out for the thin plate of ice with changing ice thickness (with trapezoidal profile along the center line) and with different spreads, and for harmonic temporal and spatial ingoing pressure perturbations.",

            "abstract": "Mars does not have a global intrinsic magnetic field but has localized crustal magnetic anomalies particularly in the southern hemisphere. Several studies have reported that heavy ion escape rates are highly dependent on the orientation of magnetic anomalies to the Sun, although significant uncertainty remains regarding the magnitude of the changes. Due to modeling complexity, however, all the previously published global studies were conducted based on an oversimplified steady state approximation. Very recently our team incorporated for the first time a time-dependent calculation into a global MHD model by considering the continuous rotation of the crustal field with the planet. The new non-steady-state simulations revealed a general anti-correlation of ion escape with the subsolar magnetic strength when the strongest crustal field region is on the dayside, consistent with previous findings. However, the details of how the rotation of the localized crustal field regulates global ion loss over time are still poorly understood, particularly when the strong magnetic anomalies move into the nightside. In contrast with previous global modeling work, which adopted a steady state approximation and mainly focused on the effects of external drivers (i.e., solar EUV and solar wind plasma), this study aims to improve our understanding of how the internal time-varying perturbation due to the rotation of crustal magnetic anomalies regulates the plasma interaction and ultimately affects planetary ion escape.",

Active faults and tectonics of Georgia (Sothern Caucasus) have been investigated in numerous scientific studies. The Caucasus consists of different geological structures with complex interactions. The major structures trend WNW-ESE, and focal mechanisms indicate primarily thrust faults striking parallel to the mountains. It is a part of the Alpine – Himalayan collision belt and it is well known for its high seismicity. Although the geodynamic activity of the region, caused by the convergence of the Arabian and the Eurasian plates at a rate of several cm/year, is well known, different tectonic models were proposed as an explanation for the seismic process in the region. The recent model on seismic sources for the Caucasus and derives from recent seismotectonic studies performed in Georgia in the framework of different international projects.\nWe have analyzed previous studies and recent investigations on the bases of new seismic (spatial distribution, moment tensor solution etc), GPS and other data. As a result data base of seismic source models was compiled. Seismic sources are modeled as lines representing the surface projection of active faults or as wide areas (source zones), where the earthquakes can occur randomly.

            "abstract": "This study employs a variety of geophysical, biological, hydrological, and pedological methods to expand on the understanding of how contrasting aspects, lithologies, and vegetation influence critical zone structure and evolution. We performed shallow seismic refraction (SSR) and time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys across two geologically distinct valleys within the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory in southwestern Idaho. We also quantified vegetation density, soil pH, and subsurface stratigraphy (by manual sampling) across opposing north-facing (forested) and south-facing (unforested) aspects to better understand the relationship between lithology, vegetation, seasonal moisture dynamics, and saprolite genesis within the critical zone. The first study sub-site, Upper Johnston Draw, resides on late Cretaceous granitic bedrock associated with the Idaho Batholith. The second study sub-site, Upper Sheep Creek, resides on Miocene basaltic bedrock. In the granitic Upper Johnston Draw there is a sharp contrast in depth to unweathered bedrock (regolith thickness) between the north-facing aspect (average depth of 18.6 m) and the south-facing aspect (average depth of 8.2 m). In the basaltic Upper Sheep Creek there is only a marginal contrast in depth to unweathered bedrock between the north-facing aspect (average depth of 14.4 m) and the south-facing aspect (average depth of 12.0 m). These observed relationships between the contrasting lithologies of Upper Johnston Draw and Upper Sheep Creek, coupled with our time-lapse ERT surveys, vegetation density tests, soil pH tests, and subsurface augering data, provide new understanding about the causes of symmetry or asymmetry in saprolite development on north-facing and south-facing slopes. Specifically, these findings suggest that abiotic chemical weathering via hydrolysis may be the dominant control creating the symmetrical pattern of saprolite genesis (north vs. south aspects) observed within the basalt-parented site. While conversely, within the critical zone of the paired granitic site, ecohydrologically-influenced chemical weathering via oxidation and organic acidification may instead be the dominant control creating the distinct asymmetrical pattern of saprolite genesis observed.",

            "abstract": "Heat transfer between the atmosphere and Earth’s surface represents a key component to understanding Earth energy balance, making it important in understanding and simulating climate. Arguably, the oceanic air-sea interface and Polar sea-ice-air interface are amongst the most challenging in which to measure these fluxes. This difficulty results partially from challenges associated with infrastructure deployment on these surfaces and partially from an inability to obtain spatially representative values over a potentially inhomogeneous surface.\nTraditionally sensible (temperature) and latent (moisture) fluxes are estimated using one of several techniques. A preferred method involves eddy-correlation where cross-correlation between anomalies in vertical motion (w) and temperature (T) or moisture (q) is used to estimate heat transfer. High-frequency measurements of these quantities can be derived using tower-mounted instrumentation. Such systems have historically been deployed over land surfaces or on ships and buoys to calculate fluxes at the air-land or air-sea interface, but such deployments are expensive and challenging to execute, resulting in a lack of spatially diverse measurements. A second (“bulk”) technique involves the observation of horizontal windspeed, temperature and moisture at a given altitude over an extended time period in order to estimate the surface fluxes.\nSmall Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) represent a unique platform from which to derive these fluxes. These sUAS can be small (~1 m), lightweight (~700 g), low cost (~$2000) and relatively easy to deploy to remote locations and over inhomogeneous surfaces. We will give an overview of the ability of sUAS to provide measurements necessary for estimating surface turbulent fluxes. This discussion is based on flights in the vicinity of the 1000 ft. Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) tower, and over the US Department of Energy facility at Oliktok Point, Alaska. We will present initial comparisons between UAS-derived turbulent fluxes and those derived from tower-based instrumentation and discuss differences in the context of sensor technology and flight patterns employed to collect data.",

            "abstract": "The March 10, 2014, the Mw6.8 Ferndale earthquake occurred off the coast of Northern California, near the Mendocino Triple Junction. Aftershocks suggest a northeast striking fault plane for the strike-slip earthquake, oriented such that the California coast is roughly perpendicular to the rupture plane. Consequently, large amplitude Love waves were observed at seismic stations and continuous GPS stations throughout Northern California. While GPS is less sensitive then broadband instruments, in Northern California their station density is much higher, potentially providing valuable detail.\nA total of 269 GPS stations that have high-rate (1 sps) data available were used to generate GPS-seismograms. These include stations from the Bay Area Regional Deformation (BARD) network, the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO, operated by UNAVCO), and the USGS, Menlo Park. The Track software package was used to generate relative displacements between pairs of stations, determined using Delaunay triangulation. This network-based approach allows for higher precision than absolute positioning, because common noise sources, in particular atmospheric noise, are cancelled out. A simple least-squares network adjustment with a stable centroid constraint is performed to transform the mesh of relative motions into absolute motions at individual GPS stations. This approach to generating GPS-seismograms is validated by the good agreement between time series records at 16 BARD stations that are co-located with broadband seismometers from the Berkeley Digital Seismic Network (BDSN).\nWhile the distribution of peak dynamic displacements is dominated in long periods by the radiation pattern, at shorter periods other patterns become visible. In particular, stations in the San Joaquin Delta (SJD) region show higher peak dynamic displacements than those in surrounding areas, as well as longer duration shaking. SJD stations also have higher dynamic displacements on the radial component than surrounding areas, implying that energy has been scattered into the radial direction within the SJD.",

            "abstract": "Utilizing diurnal fluctuations of shallow groundwater tables to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) is a well established approach. This approach is advantageous in that ET can be estimated with little infrastructure and at relatively low cost. Most studies that use this method rely on some estimation of the specific yield, Sy, of the soil. Specific yield is the volume of water drained form a soil or rock divided by the volume of soil from which it drained. Established methods for determining Sy include field and laboratory approaches that either measure the volume of water drained from a known volume of soil or measuring the change in groundwater elevation after some perturbation, such as a precipitation or pumping event, of known water volume. Most methods for determining Sy result in a single value for a given soil volume. In shallow water table environments, soil specific yield is transient by nature, varying with depth to groundwater, time allowed for drainage, and whether the soil is experiencing wetting or drying conditions. When applied in ET calculations, inadequate estimates of Sy can result in large errors in calculated ET. We utilize eddy covariance techniques, in situ soil moisture sensors, and meteorological data to constrain specific yield values for soils in ten montane meadows in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, CA. Meadows conditions range from relatively pristine meadows to degraded and restored meadow systems. Quantifying ET in these meadows is important for understanding the meadow hydrology and connection to the greater catchments. Results from our approaches highlight the transient nature of soil specific yield. Calculated values of specific yield ranged from 0.03-0.16; higher values were obtained when using meteorological data to calculate Potential ET and lower values were obtained with eddy covariance techniques. Specific yield values determined from this study were subsequently used to train neural network models for estimating soil specific yield and meadow ET. Meteorological parameters, day of year, time of day, and depth to water are among the input values used in the neural network models. These models allow us to better calculate ET in the meadows for the duration of the input parameter time series; ET was calculated as far back as 2008.",

            "abstract": "The island of Taiwan is currently under construction due to the collision of the northwestern corner of the Philippine Sea plate and the embedded Luzon island arc with the larger continental Eurasian plate. This collision is responsible for the current growth of the Central Range that dominates the eastern half of the island. An international collaboration involving several USA and Taiwan universities and academic institutions was formed to study how the orogen evolves through time and to understand the role of a colliding island arc in mountain building. The project, Taiwan Integrated Geodynamics Research (TAIGER), was funded by NSF-Continental Dynamics and Taiwan National Science Council.\nThe Central Range grows at one of the most rapid rates of uplift in the world, exposing metamorphic rocks that were once at least 10 km deep. The range offers unique opportunities for studies of crustal seismic anisotropy for two major reasons: (1) its geological makeup is conducive for producing crustal seismic anisotropy; that is, the rocks are highly foliated; and (2) a seismological data volume of significant breadth offers extensive coverage of sources and recording stations throughout the region.\nWe carried out a crustal shear wave splitting study by data mining 3300 local earthquakes collected in the TAIGER 2009 sea-land experiment. We used an automated P and S wave arrival time picking method (Ross and Ben-Zion, 2014) applied to over 100,000 event-station pairs. These data were analyzed for shear-wave splitting using the MFAST automated package (Savage et al., 2010), producing 3300 quality shear wave split measurements. The splitting results were then station-averaged. The results show NNE to NE orientation trends that are consistent with regional cleavage strikes. Average crustal shear wave split time is 0.244 sec. These measurements are consistent with rock physics measurements of Central Range slate and metamorphic acoustic velocities. The splits exhibit orientations correlative with and serve as a proxy for the geological regional fabrics. The results also have the potential of offering information about strain at depth. In addition, the presence of significant rock anisotropy could negatively affect conventional seismic analyses that are based on an assumption of isotropic earth media.",

The first of these, iMUSH, is acquiring wideband MT data at 150 sites, as well as active and passive seismic data in SW Washington (including Mounts Saint Helens, Adams and Rainier). iMUSH seeks to determine details of crustal magma transport and storage, and to resolve major tectonic controls on volcanism along the arc. iMUSH may help to settle a debate over the origin of the SW Washington Crustal Conductor (SWCC), which covers ~5000 km2and that has alternately been attributed to accreted Eocene metasediments or to an extensive region of partial melt in the lower crust beneath the three volcanoes.\nThe iMUSH array is continguous with an amphibious ~150 station MT experiment (MOCHA) onshore and offshore of the Washington and Oregon forearc. MOCHA iwill image the crust and upper mantle of the subduction system in 3D, constraining the fluid input to the system from offshore and the distribution of fluids released from the down-going slab, including along the transitional zone where Episodic Tremor and Slip occurs. Our goal is to refine our understanding of the segmentation, structure and fluid distribution along the convergent margin segments, and their relationship to the spatial pattern of ETS.\nIn contrast to the active Cascadia margin, the Mid-Continent Rift (MCR) is the trace of a massive igneous event that nearly split North America 1.1 billion years ago. Initial results from 3D inversion of MT Transportable Array data show less fine-scale heterogeneity in the upper mantle (250 km depth) than is evident in western, tectonic North America, but a division at the base of thick lithosphere, with higher conductivities beneath and immediately south of the Great Lakes, than to the south. From the base of the lithosphere to the Moho, this high conductivity feature narrows, ultimately disappearing in the mid-crust. In the upper crust above this feature, an E-W elongated conductive feature appears that maps to surface expressions of the MCR. The significance of this deep feature, and its relationship to the failed rifting event of the mesoproterozoic era will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Upwelling regions of the world’s oceans are home to some of the most productive fisheries. Yet these coastal areas provide unique challenges for remote sensing from satellite platforms because of both their proximity to land (radar interference) and typically small horizontal scales (< 50km) of upwelling processes.\nComparisons are performed on the gradient of sea surface temperature (SST) fields derived from multiple sources:\n1) the 0.25 degree resolution National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) Optimally Interpolated AVHRR+in-situ or AVHRR_OI, data set.\n2) the 1km resolution Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) gridded SST data set,\n3) the 0.25 degree resolution SST derived from the WindSat microwave sensor,\n4) a 2km version of the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Model (HECCO2).\nTemporal and spatial correlations between HECCO2 and MUR, as well as between HECCO2 and NCDC, are examined through the dominant singular vectors (eigenmodes) of the covariance matrix for each pair of data sets. In both cases the first mode of covariability accounts for over 90% of the total variance. A simple technique based on SST gradients is then applied to the first mode to determine the upwelling scales based on HECCO2, MUR, and NCDC.\nLongitudinal sections at 8S, 20S, and 30S indicate that the upwelling scale decreases between 8S and 20S. At 20S the first mode of covariability between MUR and HECCO2 indicate an upwelling scale between 25 and 50km. Results are consistent when compared with chlorophyll-a data from MODIS-Aqua. Such upwelling scales are not seen in the WindSat data and reduced in the NCDC data. A reduction of the upwelling scale by a factor 0.2 between 8S and 20S is consistent with a dependence on the Coriolis parameter. A major conclusion of the work is that magnitudes of SST gradient and upwelling scales derived from MUR are consistent with those of the HECCO2 for the test period of October-November 2011. Additionally, it is shown that to resolve upwelling scales near the coast high resolution infrared data must be used in the analysis. Microwave derived SSTs, such as those from WindSat are of limited value when upwelling scales are less then 50km.",

            "abstract": "The VIIRS Day-Night Band provides the first calibrated observations of nocturnal low-light visible/near-infrared (~500-900 nm response, 710 nm central wavelength) radiances, including reflected moonlight down to values of 3 × 10−5 W·m−2·sr−1. These novel measurements afford the first opportunity to attempt nighttime retrievals of optical depth for optically thick clouds when moonlight is available, thereby advancing our ability to observe the diurnal cycle of such structures as marine stratocumuli which are thought to play an important role in determining climate and climate feedbacks. In order to leverage the Day-Night Band measurements in this capacity, we must first convert the upwelling top-of-atmosphere radiances to equivalent values of reflectance. Doing so requires a detailed knowledge of the down-welling top-of-atmosphere lunar spectral irradiance which, unlike sunlight, varies significantly over the course of the ~29.5 day lunar cycle.\nThis research summarizes the ongoing development, validation, and refinement of a lunar irradiance model designed to convert Day-Night Band radiances to equivalent lunar reflectance. Comparisons between daytime and nighttime Day-Night Band reflectance for vicarious calibration targets offering radiometric stability (e.g., White Sands, Salar de Uyuni, Dome-C, and snow fields) confirms the model’s performance to within an expected ~10% uncertainty. An observed lunar-phase-dependent trend associated with the model’s assumption of a disk-averaged albedo was addressed via analysis of a version of the model adapted for comparison against Meteosat Second Generation SEVIRI lunar measurements. The analysis resulted in a phase-dependent 6th order polynomial correction to the model and expected model uncertainty improvements to within ~5%. Examples of lunar reflectance imagery for operational applications and the provisional quantitative application of Day-Night Band lunar reflectance to nighttime cloud optical property retrievals, bearing relevance to the diurnally resolved global climate data record, are shown.",

            "abstract": "In a recent study of observed features of land-atmosphere coupling (LAC) at the ARM Southern Great Plains (ARM SGP) site in northern Oklahoma (Phillips and Klein, 2014 Journal of Geophysical Research), we identified statistically significant interactions between 1997-2008 summertime daily averages of soil moisture (at 10 cm depth) and a number of surface atmospheric variables, such as surface evaporation, relative humidity, and temperature. Here we will report on an evaluation of similar features of LAC simulated by version 5 of the global Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5), coupled to its native CLM4 land model, and downscaled to the vicinity of the ARM SGP site. In these case studies, the CAM5 was initialized from a 6-hourly atmospheric reanalysis for each day of the years 2008 and 2009 (where the CLM4 land state was equilibrated to the atmospheric model state), thus permitting a close comparison of the modeled and observed summer daily average features of the LAC in these years. Correlation coefficients R and “sensitivity indices” I (a measure of the comparative change of an atmospheric variable for a one-standard-deviation change in soil moisture) provided quantitative measures of the respective coupling strengths.\n Such a comparison of observed versus modeled LAC is complicated by differences in atmospheric forcings of the land; for example, the CAM5’s summertime precipitation is too scant, and thus the model’s upper soil layer often is drier than observed. The modeled daily average covariations of soil moisture with lower atmospheric variables also display less coherence (lower R values), but sometimes greater “sensitivity” (higher I values) than are observed at the ARM SGP site. Since the observational estimate of LAC may itself be sensitive to soil moisture measurement biases, we also will report on a planned investigation of the dependence of LAC on several alternative choices of soil moisture data sets local to the ARM SGP site.\n Acknowledgments\nThis work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science and was performed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

GRS is sensitive to bulk concentrations of H, C, O, S, Fe, and Si among other elements. As these elements are also diagnostic of major carbonaceous and ordinary chondritic meteorite classes, we have simulated the science performance of a HPGe experiment in orbit around asteroids with model compositions corresponding to those of volatile-rich CI and CO carbonaceous chondritic meteorites. A circular orbit around a spherical asteroid was considered, with the altitude of the orbit equal to the radius of the asteroid (similar to the Dawn low-altitude mapping orbit \"LAMO\").\nWe simulated the gamma-ray and neutron emission from CI-like (~17 wt%\nstructural H2O) and CO-like (<2 wt% structural H2O) asteroids using\nthe MCNPX Monte-Carlo radiation transport code. The spacecraft\nbackground (based on a Dawn-like spacecraft model) was also modeled\nusing MCNPX: this included background due to direct GCR/spacecraft\ninteractions and also background due to asteroidal neutron flux on the\nspacecraft.\nThe detector model was based on the Mars Odyssey Gamma Ray Spectrometer (\"MOGRS\"; Boynton et al. 2004, 2007), the largest HPGe detector flown to date. The spectra from the MCNPX output were broadened to a resolution based on the in-flight performance of MOGRS, FWHM = 4.1 keV at 1332 keV (Evans et al. 2006). Doppler broadening was also modeled where applicable. Line fluxes were then extracted from the combined background + asteroid spectrum and statistical uncertainties evaluated.\nOur simulations show that asteroids can be identified as having\nCI-like vs. CO-like compositions in H/Si, O/Si, S/Si, and C/Si with\nMOGRS within 4.5 months in a Dawn LAMO-like orbit.

The magnitude-9.0 subduction-zone earthquake of March 11, 2011, that occurred in the Japan Trench caused a change in the stress distribution in northern Japan due to the stress released. Such changes alter the mechanical properties of the rock mass, such as strength and deformability, and its hydraulic conductivities, and hence influence contaminant pathways.In this study, a true triaxial compression test was carried out under various stress conditions. The rock tested was a damaged sedimentary rock that had many fractures. Samples were subjected to various stress conditions, and permeability was measured after the required stress conditions had been reached. After the experiment, we determined the fracture geometry by using the crack tensor (Oda, 1983), and estimated the permeability tensor. As a result, measured permeability was different by a factor of 2 due to the change in the direction of the principal stress, even when the mean stress remained the same. In addition, the estimated permeability was in close agreement with the measured permeability, and it is suggested that we can estimate hydro-mechanical behavior by using fracture geometries obtained by observation. The directions of the fracture and principal stress axes are important factors for estimation of the long-term stability of the hydro-mechanical properties of a fractured rock mass.",

Mountain pine beetles experience higher survival rates due to milder winters, allowing for greater frequency and severity of attacks and in turn causing more widespread pine tree mortality. Meanwhile, the arid conditions created by this temperature increase have been conducive to a surge in wildfires. Although many investigations have been carried out on the soil biogeochemistry in areas hit by one or the other, no study to our knowledge has explicitly researched the compound effects of these disturbances. This study examined soil levels of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) as well as the C/N ratios of pine and fir soil communities that have been affected by both beetle and fire disturbance. Our results show that no significant differences were found in the C/N ratios in response to all modes of disturbance. However, significant C losses from the O horizon, but not the M horizon, were observed following wildfire. Similarly, losses in N from just the O horizon were observed, but these were not significant. In conclusion, fire resulted in marked declines in soil C, and forests impacted by beetle infestation and fire experienced C losses similar to fire alone.",

A real-time dust-only NGAC has been operational since September 2012. Evaluation of NGAC dust forecast for the summer 2013 utilizes Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) AOD retrievals and VIIRS dust mask index. While AOD retrievals are quantitative indicating column atmospheric aerosol loading, dust mask index is a qualitative flag indicating the presence of dust and dust intensity in the atmosphere. The combination of dust flag and AOD from VIIRS enables the comparison between NGAC dust AOD versus VIIRS dust AOD. The performance NGAC will be evaluated with these comparisons on a global and regional scales near and downwind of dust sources.",

            "abstract": "Although the Earth today is segregated into two distinct compositional regions of a silicate mantle and metallic core, the process of differentiation from their original chondritic form is not clear. Continuous meteorite bombardment melted impactors and target bodies causing dissociation of metal from silicates which may have formed magma reservoirs or oceans. The heavy liquid metal phase will sink quickly through a silicate magma ocean and settle at the base as a metal pond. A high density metal pond will be unstable and is expected to sink as a Rayleigh-Taylor instability descending as liquid metal plumes to the core. Previous experiments have shown that lighter silicate material from the magma ocean becomes entrained as a conduit that trails behind sinking metal diapirs. These silicates are then transported to the base of the mantle with implications for mantle and core composition. We perform laboratory fluid experiments which model this process of entrainment and differentiation using glass and gallium spheres in high viscosity liquid sucrose solutions. We use high speed photography and dye to visualize and measure conduit formation and entrainment surrounding a descending sphere. Preliminary experiments indicate that the volume of material that surrounds a sphere is highest at the top of the box when the sphere begins its descent. As the sphere sinks, the entrainment of dyed fluid around the sphere decreases exponentially with falling distance. We suggest this is the result of drag forces acting on walls of the conduit. The volume of entrained material reduces by 80% in the upper 1/3 of the drop trajectory. As much as 8-10% of the original fluid volume is carried to the base of the box and will segregate from the sphere or diffuse after it settles. Higher viscosity fluids are observed to entrain more material on average compared to lower viscosity fluids. These results have important implications for delivery of silicate materials to the base of the mantle and perhaps into the core itself during early formation.",

            "abstract": "Over the past three years, we have developed and implemented a collaborative summer science program for Mashpee Wampanoag youth that engages tribal elders, parents, educators, and local scientists to connect tribal youth with the ecology and geology of their traditional homelands. This collaboration, called Native Youth in Science: Preserving our Homeland (POH), involves the Mashpee Wampanoag Education and Natural Resource Departments, an experienced team of tribal elders and scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey’s Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, U.S. Forest Service, and NOAA National Marine Fisheries. The team has developed and implemented a curriculum that stresses the ancestral relationships of Wampanoag people to their land. Through hands-on activities at locations of cultural significance, our efforts focus on presenting topics in environmental science from both western science and Wampanoag perspectives to 5th-8th grade students from the Wampanoag Tribe. Overarching themes focus on local land use history and its impact on traditional food sources such as shellfish and herring. Lessons typically address hydrology, water quality, fish and shellfish biology, botany, and local geology. To present these topics, scientists are paired with Wampanoag Tribe culture keepers to develop lessons that present science topics side-by-side with cultural knowledge. The primary goals of POH are to (a) connect and reinforce science concepts learned in conventional school settings for tribal youth; (b) demonstrate the use of science as a tool for understanding and preserving the ecosystems and homelands of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe; and (c) how indigenous traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and western science complement each other. In the long-term, this program begins to prepare tribal students for more advanced programs supporting their pursuit of higher education.",

J. 747, 109, 2012], we have concluded that the Parker model of coronal heating can provide enough heating, independent of Lundquist number, for the quasi-equilibrium case with the coronal loop length L much shorter than VAtc, the distance travelled by Alfven waves during one correlation time of random photospheric motions. We have now generalized our simulations with cases to longer L. We will present most recent results from a series of three-dimensional simulations based on the equations of reduced magnetohydrodynamics for the time-averaged energy dissipation rate <W> as a function of L. In the limit of L >> VAtc, we show that <W> is given by the photospheric Poynting flux required to launch Alfven waves. In the intermediate range of L ~ VAtc, <W> is well described by a scaling based on the Kolmogorov turbulence energy cascade, rather than the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan cascade. For the whole range of L we considered, we will show that <W> can be modeled by combining the Parker heating and the Alfven wave launching power. This work is supported by a NSF grant AGS-0962477.",

            "abstract": "Mediterranean-type ecosystems are structured by fire. In California chaparral, fires uncouple N production and consumption by enhancing nitrification and reducing plant uptake. NO3- that accumulates after fire is vulnerable to leaching. However, the extent to which fires decouple N fluxes can vary spatially and with timing of fire, and the specific mechanisms controlling N metabolism in recovering chaparral are not well understood. We combined empirical analysis and modeling in two chaparral watersheds to better understand how these systems recover from fire, and to explore their sensitivity to changing climate and fire regimes. To evaluate how pH, charcoal, and NH4+ supply influence N cycling, we measured mineralization and nitrification rates in chaparral soils that burned 1, 4, 20 and 40 years prior to sampling. We then experimentally adjusted pH, charcoal, and NH4+ concentrations for all soils in a factorial design, and incubated them for 8 weeks. Each week, we measured respiration, exchangeable NH4+ and NO3- content, nitrification potential, microbial biomass, and pH. Then to project the effects of altered precipitation patterns and fire timing on nitrogen dynamics and recovery, we used the hydro-biogeochemical model RHESSys. Fires were imposed at the beginning and end of the growing season under various climates.\nNO3- production was highest in soils collected from the most recently burned sites. Also, NO3- concentrations increased over the course of incubation in soils from all sites, especially at high pH, and with NH4+ addition. Charcoal slightly augmented the effects of elevated pH and NH4+ on NO3- production iduring the early stages of incubation in 1 and 4-year old sites, while it slightly dampened their effects by week 8. However, in 20 and 40-year old sites, charcoal had no effect. Overall, nitrification was most powerfully constrained by NH4+ supply. However, increases in pH that occur after fire may enhance nitrification rates when substrate is available. Also, charcoal might enhance N cycling immediately after fire, perhaps by supplying C to microbes, but impacts are short-lived. Modeling results suggest that soil acidity and rapid plant recovery reduce leaching. However, during drought and temperature extremes nutrients pools recover more slowly when fires occur prior to the hot, dry summer.",

            "abstract": "Projected future climate changes are likely to be rapid, and large enough in magnitude to lead to situations where the climates of many locations may lack analogues to present-day climate. Moreover, climates now widely expressed on the landscape may become infrequent, while other “novel” climates may become widespread. The implications of the speed and magnitude of the projected future climate changes for species distributions is not clear; while climate changes seem too large for species to “track,” paleoecological records suggest that species have successfully negotiated multiple large, rapid, climate changes in the past.\nWe examine the speed and magnitude of past climate changes using TraCE-21k transient climate simulations (at annual and decadal time steps) and PMIP3/CMIP5 “time-slice” simulations for 6 and 21 ka. The transient simulations allow the rate of climate change (over different time intervals) to be measured, along with the similarity (or lack thereof) of past climates with the present to be mapped, while the time-slice simulations provide a gauge of uncertainty in the estimates related to variations among models (or projections).\nUsing Euclidean distances calculated from seasonal and annual (land only) temperature variables, the climates of recent decades compared with those over the last 22 kyr show an expexted increase in dissimilarity with the present climate as one goes farther back in time, with some important regional and temporal variations. Southern Hemisphere temperatures are more like those at present back to 11 ka than those in the Northern Hemisphere and tropical temperatures are less different from present during glacial times than those at mid- and high-latitudes. In both hemispheres, abrupt millennial time-scale variations are evident, with Antarctic Cold Reversal and Younger Dryas chronozones temperatures as different from present as those during the LGM. In the Northern Hemisphere, late-Holocene decadal-to-centennial variations frequently result in climates as different from present as those in the early Holocene or late glacial. Overall, the paleo record shows numerous examples of rapid, large-magnitude climate changes and we describe the significance of these changes for improving understanding of potential future climate change.",

JEM-GLIMS started continuous orbital observations from November 2012 and has succeeded in detecting thousands of lightning events including TLEs. The global distribution of the detected lightning events clearly shows that most of the events were detected over continental regions. In addition, the global distributions of these lightning events show clear seasonal variations and were centered in the local summer hemisphere. To identify the sprite occurrences, it is necessary to perform the following data analysis: (1) a subtraction of the appropriately scaled wideband camera (LSI-1) image from the narrowband camera (LSI-2) image; (2) a calculation of intensity ratio between different spectrophotometer channels; and (3) an estimation of the polarization and charge moment changes for the parent CG discharges of the event using ground-based ELF measurement data. From a synthetic comparison of these results, we confirmed that JEM-GLISM succeeded in detecting sprite events. The VHF receiver onboard JEM-GLIMS uses two patch-type antennas separated by a 1.6-m interval and can detect VHF pulses emitted by lightning discharges in the 70-100 MHz frequency range. Using an interferometric technique, we successfully identified the source locations of VHF pulses excited by lightning discharges. At the presentation, we will show detailed spatiotemporal characteristics of sprite events detected by JEM-GLIMS optical instruments and the relation between the spatial distribution of sprites and source locations of VHF pulses excited by the parent lightning discharges of sprites.",

Our project analyzes how flow statistics change with land-cover change for 30-year increments of model-simulated streamflow hydrographs for three watersheds of concern to the National Park Service: the East Branch, West Branch, and main stem of the Delaware River. We use four treatments for land cover ranging from historical high to low forest cover. We subject each land cover to adjusted GCM climate scenarios for 1600, 1900, 1940, and 2040 to isolate land cover from potential climate-change effects. Hydrographs are simulated using the Water Availability Tool for Environmental Resources (WATER), a TOPMODEL-based United States Geological Survey hydrologic decision-support tool, which uses the variable-source-area concept and water budgets to generate streamflow. Model parameters for each watershed change with land-use, and capture differences in soil-physical properties that control how rainfall infiltrates, evaporates, transpires, is stored in the soil, and moves to the stream. Our results analyze flow statistics used as indicators of hydrologic alteration, and access streamflow events below the critical flow needed to provide sustainable habitat for dwarf wedgemussels. These metrics will demonstrate how changes in climate and land use might affect flow statistics. Initial results show that the 1940 WATER simulation outputs generally match observed unregulated low flows from that time period, while performance for regulated flow from the same time period and from 1600, 1900, and 2040 require model input adjustments. Our study will illustrate how increased forest cover could potentially restore in-stream habitat for the endangered dwarf wedgemussel for current and future climate conditions.",

            "abstract": "Soil particles emitted during agricultural activities is a major recurring source contributing to atmospheric aerosol loading. Emission inventories of agricultural dust emissions have been compiled in several regions. These inventories, compiled based on historic survey and activity data, may reflect the current emission strengths that introduce large uncertainties when they are used to drive chemical transport models. In addition, there is no global emission inventory of agricultural dust emissions required to support global air quality and climate modeling. In this study, we present our recent efforts to develop a global emission inventory of PM10 and PM2.5 released from field tillage and harvesting operations using an emission factors-based approach. Both major crops (e.g., wheat and corn) and forage production were considered. For each crop or forage, information of crop area, crop calendar, farming activities and emission factors of specified operations were assembled. The key issue of inventory compilation is the choice of suitable emission factors for specified operations over different parts of the world. Through careful review of published emission factors, we modified the traditional emission factor-based model by multiplying correction coefficient factors to reflect the relationship between emission factors, soil texture, and climate conditions. Then, the temporal (i.e., monthly) and spatial (i.e., 0.5º resolution) distribution of agricultural PM10 and PM2.5 emissions from each and all operations were estimated for each crop or forage. Finally, the emissions from individual crops were aggregated to assemble a global inventory from agricultural operations. The inventory was verified by comparing the new data with the existing agricultural fugitive dust inventory in North America and Europe, as well as satellite observations of anthropogenic agricultural dust emissions.",

            "abstract": "In this work we apply a Bayesian methodology to reconstruct historical SWE estimates over two test watersheds in the semi-arid Andes (33°S). The approach combines climatological reanalysis forcing data, in-situ precipitation, a Land Surface Model (LSM) and a snow depletion model to generate ensembles of prior SWE for each pixel over the watersheds. The precipitation forcing data is then updated by assimilating fractional snow covered area (fSCA) from the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites using an Ensemble Kalman Smoother approach, generating new precipitation fields that are then used in a posterior LSM simulation. The resulting (posterior) SWE estimates are validated using in-situ snow depth measurements surveyed during 2009 to 2013. Results show significant improvements in error statistics, including an increase in correlation, a reduction in bias and a reduction in Root Mean Square error. After assimilation the posterior fSCA temporal evolution is consistent with the remotely sensed fSCA data, showing significant differences with the original prior estimates generated in the open-loop model simulation. The framework is robust to negative and positive biases in prior precipitation, resulting in similar posterior metrics regardless of the initial bias level. The resulting SWE fields are analyzed in terms of spatial distribution and relation with physiographic characteristics. A high correlation with slope suggests that gravitational distribution mechanisms play a significant role in snow distribution over these watersheds. Despite the fact that the LSM has no gravitational redistribution algorithm, the assimilation framework was able to capture this source of variability.",

            "abstract": "High-energy ultraviolet (UV-C) radiation is a significant challenge to life in environments such as high altitude areas, the early Earth, the Martian surface, and space. As UV-C exposure is both a selection pressure and a mutagen, adaptation dynamics in such environments include a high rate of change in both tolerance-related and non-tolerance-related genes, as well changes in linkages between the resulting traits. Determining the relationship between the intensity and duration of the UV-C exposure, mutation rate, and emergence of UV-C resistance will inform our understanding of both the emergence of radiation-related extremophily in natural environments and the optimal strategies for generating artificial extremophiles.\nIn this study, we iteratively exposed an Escherichia colistrain to UV-C radiation of two different fluxes, 3.3 J/m^2/s for 6 seconds and 0.5 J/m^2/s for 40 seconds, with the same overall fluence of 20 J/m^2. After each iteration, cells from each exposure regime were assayed for increased UV-C tolerance as an adaptive trait. The exposed cells carried a plasmid bearing a TEM beta-lactamase gene, which in the absence of antibiotic treatment is a neutral reporter for mutagenesis. Sequencing of this gene allowed us to determine the baseline mutation frequency for each flux. As an additional readout for adaptation, the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase mutations was tested by plating UV-exposed cultures in cefotaxime plates.\nWe observed an increase of approximately one-million-fold in UV-C tolerance over seven iterations; no significant difference between the two fluxes was found. Future work will focus on identifying the genomic changes responsible for the change in UV-C tolerance; determining the mechanisms of the emerged UV-C tolerance; and performing competition experiments between the iteration strains to quantify fitness tradeoffs resulting from UV-C adaptation.",

            "abstract": "Fluid flow rates through high-temperature mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal vents are likely quite sensitive to poroelastic forcing mechanisms such as tidal loading and tectonic activity. Because poroelastic deformation and flow perturbations are estimated to extend to considerable depths within young oceanic crust, observations of flow rate changes at seafloor vents have the potential to provide constraints on the flow geometry and permeability structure of the underlying hydrothermal systems, as well as the quantities of heat and chemicals they exchange with overlying ocean, and the potential biological productivity of ecosystems they host.\nTo help provide flow rate measurements in these challenging environments, we have developed two new optical flow oriented technologies. The first is a new form of Optical Plume Velocimetry (OPV) which relies on single-frame temporal cross-correlation to obtain time-averaged image velocity fields from short video sequences. The second is the VentCam, a deep sea camera system that can collect high-frame-rate video sequences at focused hydrothermal vents suitable for analysis with OPV.\nDuring the July 2014 R/V Atlantis/Alvin expedition to Axial Seamount, we deployed the VentCam at the ~300C Phoenix vent within the ASHES vent field and positioned it with DSRV Alvin. We collected 24 seconds of video at 50 frames per second every half-hour for approximately 10 days beginning July 22nd. We are currently applying single-frame lag OPV to these videos to estimate relative and absolute fluid flow rates through this vent. To explore the relationship between focused and diffuse venting, we deployed a second optical flow camera, the Diffuse Effluent Measurement System (DEMS), adjacent to this vent at a fracture within the lava carapace where low-T (~30C) fluids were exiting. This system collected video sequences and diffuse flow measurements at overlapping time intervals. Here we present the preliminary results of our work with VentCam and OPV, and comparisons with results from the DEMS camera.",

            "abstract": "Diffuse-reflectance Fourier-transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (MidIR) was used to (1) investigate soil quality along a latitudinal gradient of Alaskan soils, and in combination with soil incubations, (2) to assess the relative lability of soil organic matter in the active layer and upper permafrost for some of those soils. Twenty nine sites were sampled along a latitudinal gradient (78.79 N to 55.35 N deg). The sites included 8 different vegetation types (moss/lichen, non-acidic and acidic tundra, shrub areas, deciduous forests, mixed forests, coniferous forests, and grassland). At each site, soils were separated by soil horizons and analyzed for pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic and inorganic C, and total N. Samples were also scanned to obtain MidIR spectra, and ratios of characteristic bands previously suggested as indicators of organic matter quality or degradation level were calculated. Principal component analysis showed that axis 1 explained 70% of the variation and was correlated with the general Organic:Mineral ratio, soil organic C, total N, and CEC, but not with vegetation type. Axis 2 explained 25% of the variation and was correlated with most of the band ratios, with negative values for the condensation index (ratio of aromatic to aliphatic organic matter) and positive values for all humification ratios (HU1: ratio of aliphatic to polysaccharides; HU2: ratio of aromatics to polysaccharides; and HU3 ratio of lignin/phenols to polysaccharides) suggesting that axis 2 variations were related to differences in level of soil organic matter degradation. Active organic, active mineral and permafrost layers from selected tundra sites were incubated for two months at -1, 1, 4, 8 and 16 ⁰C. The same band ratios were correlated with total CO2 mineralized during the incubations. Data from 4⁰C showed that the cumulative respired CO2 from the active organic layer across all sites was negatively correlated with the HU1 humification ratio, suggesting that HU1 might be a good indicator of lability for comparing active layer organic soils. We will explore correlations at the other incubation temperatures and further evaluate the utility of MidIR band ratios for predicting the potential decomposability of organic matter in permafrost-region soils.",

To quantitatively study its color, a representative gray-purple nephrite with typical color change from light to dark color was chosen as the experiment sample. By combination of the UV-VIS transmittance spectra and 1976 CIE L*a*b* Colorimetric parameters, we first realized the quantitative expression and color rehabilitation of the transmitted light color of this nephrite with a specific thickness (1.0 mm). Besides, according to the typical emission peak centered at 580 nm of photoluminescence spectra, and the absorption peak centered at 530 nm, as well as the contents of Mn element increased with the purple becoming darker, we can inferred that the purple color of nephrite was mainly caused by Mn2+. This conclusion was confirmed by our EPR spectroscopy results. For the famous color pattern “stream line” in the dark region, shown as color stripes with 100~10 μm size, we will also use micro-XRD mapping and in the future XANES mapping to determine the phase and chemical composition. This research method could offer valuable references to the color quantitatively expression and coloration mechanism research of other jewelries.",

Additionally, the transfer of material into the sedimentary archive can further degrade environmental signals. Presently we have a poor understanding of the rates, scales, and types of sedimentary processes that influence the stratigraphic filter in natural systems. A set of statistical tools has been developed for estimating the spatial and temporal scales over which the sedimentary filter operates from preserved stratigraphy. These tools, such as the compensation index, have been applied to experimental data and numerical models, with only limited use on outcrop data. Experimental datasets commonly have several orders of magnitude more data than even the most well exposed ancient outcrops; consequently, the ability to confidently use tools in natural systems is limited. Here we present an evaluation of the suitability of the compensation index for measuring and interpreting sedimentary outcrops. In order to constrain uncertainty due to data-set-size limitations, we model the degree to which measurement error, small data sets, and incomplete sampling influence attempts to quantify stratigraphic architecture. We demonstrate the potential for measuring the stratigraphic filter in ancient deposits by evaluating well-exposed deltaic deposits in the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway that have been interpreted as having different degrees of to wave, tide, and river influence. Ultimately our results underscore how powerful quantitative tools developed in experimental and model datasets must be applied and interpreted with care in ancient deposits where data availability is limited.",

            "abstract": "Many coastal communities worldwide are vulnerable to flooding and erosion driven by extreme total water levels (TWL), potentially dangerous events produced by the combination of large waves, high tides, and high non-tidal residuals. The West coast of the United States provides an especially challenging environment to model these processes due to its complex geological setting combined with uncertain forecasts for sea level rise (SLR), changes in storminess, and possible changes in the frequency of major El Niños. Our research therefore aims to develop an appropriate methodology to assess present-day and future storm-induced coastal hazards along the entire U.S. West coast, filling this information gap. We present the application of this framework in a pilot study at Ocean Beach, California, a National Park site within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area where existing event-scale coastal change data can be used for model calibration and verification. We use a probabilistic, full simulation TWL model (TWL-FSM; Serafin and Ruggiero, in press) that captures the seasonal and interannual climatic variability in extremes using functions of regional climate indices, such as the Multivariate ENSO index (MEI), to represent atmospheric patterns related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).\nIn order to characterize the effect of climate variability on TWL components, we refine the TWL-FSM by splitting non-tidal residuals into low (monthly mean sea level anomalies) and high frequency (storm surge) components. We also develop synthetic climate indices using Markov sequences to reproduce the autocorrelated nature of ENSO behavior. With the refined TWL-FSM, we simulate each TWL component, resulting in synthetic TWL records providing robust estimates of extreme return level events (e.g., the 100-yr event) and the ability to examine the relative contribution of each TWL component to these extreme events. Extreme return levels are then used to drive storm impact models to examine the probability of coastal change (Stockdon et al., 2013) and thus, the vulnerability to storm-induced coastal hazards that Ocean Beach faces. Future climate variability is easily incorporated into this framework, allowing us to quantify how an evolving climate will alter future extreme TWLs and their related coastal impacts.",

Directly estimating light use efficiency from remote sensing can help guide the current approach of constraining a theoretical maximum light use efficiency using meteorological data. We explore the usefulness of a derived light use efficiency at the global scale from remotely sensed records of chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetically active radiation, and canopy leaf area. Our estimates of light use efficiency show good agreement with light use efficiency calculated using Fluxtower data spanning several continents and a wide variety of ecosystems. We further benchmark our approach against the light use efficiency estimated from a variety of ecosystem models, such as BESS.

These phenomena are represented through the main characters who are super heroes or designated Superspheres, such as Hydrosphere (water), Lithosphere (rocks), Biosphere (Polite, a stromatolite and Sarite, the mineral dolomite), Atmosphere (air), which are the 4 components of the Earth System, and the Pyrosphere(fire), which supplies the energy to drive the Earth System through volcanic activity. The characters have each developed super powers that evolved over geological time as they are transformed. They are the basic elements of nature and appear in a specific chronological order.\nWith the emergence of ancient life in the seas, the Biosphere begins to use the energy of the sun, through of the photosynthetic activity of stromatolites, one of the friends of the superheroes, to produce the oxygen for the Atmosphere. Over a vast period of time, the evolution of life continues with the formation of the supercontinent Gondwana. With the arrival of man and his interaction with the Earth, the villain appears in the book as the “Homo incorrectus” (incorrect man), who abuses and tries to destroy the super heroes, the “Superspheres”. The importance of these characters for the living Earth is emphasized, creating a connection between children and the characters. The aim of the story is to create a greater ecological conscience in the children and showing them that they should be helping to save the “Superspheres”, who are in danger and need to be preserved. Projects for primary schools in the State of Rio de Janeiro have been designed and implemented around these characters, focusing on the rescue of each of these “Superspheres” and their importance for the local geological heritage of the region.",

Profiles were collected during the fall of 2013 at 19 stations along the US Peru-Tahiti GEOTRACES transect by pumping water through acrylic cartridges impregnated with MnO2, to trap both Ac and Ra. Because extraction efficiency has been found to vary in past efforts, two cartridges were deployed in series to allow estimation of extraction efficiency for each sample.\nWhile analytical work is still in progress, an analysis of preliminary results indicates several features of interest: 1. Cartridge extraction efficiency (based on 25 replicates) for Ac was approximately 0.7±0.1, quite good given the high pump rate through the fibers (~6.5 L/min). 2. Profiles showed an increase toward the bottom from activities of ~0.3 dpm/m3 at 2000 m (close to expected 231Pa parent activity) to >0.9 dpm/m3 near the bottom. 3. Some isolated maxima appear near 2500 m, west of the East Pacific Rise, which may represent modest input of Ac from hydrothermal sources. In addition to dissolved Ac, there is particulate Ac associated with the Fe rich neutrally buoyant plume particles.\nEstimation of transport rates will be done once the analyses are completed.",

Most proxy reconstructions suggest a cooling in mid-and late Holocene (e.g. Wanner, 2008), whereas climate model simulations show only weak changes or even a moderate warming (e.g. Lohmann et al., 2013).\nIn this study, we used ice wedges as promising permafrost climate archive studied by stable water isotope methods. Ice wedges may be identified by vertically oriented foliations, and they form by the repeated filling of winter thermal contraction cracks by snow melt water in spring. Therefore, the isotopic composition of wedge ice may be attributed to the climate conditions of the cold season (i.e. winter and spring). 42 samples of organic material enclosed in ice wedges have been directly dated by Radiocarbon methods. Here, we present the first terrestrial stable oxygen isotope record of Holocene winter temperatures in up to centennial-scale resolution based on permafrost ice wedges (Lena River Delta; Siberian Arctic).\nThe Lena ice-wedge record shows that the recent isotopic temperatures are the highest of the past 7000 years. Despite similarities to Arctic temperature reconstructions of the last two millennia (Kaufman et al., 2009), it suggests a winter warming throughout the mid and late Holocene, opposite to most existing other proxy records (Wanner, 2008).\nThis apparent contradiction can be explained by the seasonality of the ice-wedge genesis in combination with orbital and greenhouse gas forcing and is consistent with climate model simulations. We conclude that the present model-data mismatch might be an artefact of the summer bias of the existing proxy records and thus, our record helps to reconcile the understanding of the northern hemisphere Holocene temperature evolution. This is particular true for the Russian Arctic significantly underrepresented in Arctic-wide climate reconstructions.\nKaufman, D. S. et al. Science 325, 1236-1239 (2009).\nWanner, H. et al. Quat.

            "abstract": "As water is the primary resource limitation for cropping systems over the inland Pacific Northwest (PNW), water use efficiency impacts regional water availability, crop yields, and net carbon sequestration. Furthermore, nitrogen (N) use efficiency affects the cost of farming and the total N flux to the environment (including leaching to aquatic ecosystems and greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere). Climate change affects water and nitrogen use efficiencies due to the combined effects of warming (reducing snowpack water storage, increasing ET, earlier leaf-on, shortening or lengthening plant growth season, etc.), the CO2 fertilization effects (increasing net primary productivity and leaf-level water and energy use efficiencies for C3 crops), and extreme climate events (drought and flood). Cropland conservation management (rotation, tillage, irrigation, and fertilization) is widely practiced in this region for maintaining high productivity of agricultural lands. To reduce vulnerability to weather extremes and long-term climate change, management regimes will likely need to be adapted for a changing environment. Here, we applied the coupled macro-scale hydrologic and crop growth model (VIC-CropSyst) to study how climate change in the 21st century will change water and nitrogen use efficiencies over the PNW. Simulation experiments with different combinations of management options and climate scenarios are used for attributing effects of climate factors and management options on long-term trends and fluctuations on water and nitrogen use efficiency. Preliminary simulation results indicate that there is a trend of decreasing water and nitrogen use efficiency over the inner PNW domain during the 21th century because of increasing ET, a seasonal shift in water availability, and the intensification of extreme climate events. Effective managements, including no-tillage and conservational tillage and optimized irrigation can eliminate the decrease or even increase water and nitrogen use efficiencies over certain areas but the overall effects are location- and crop-specific. The social and economic consequences of these adaptation and mitigation costs must be assessed before using this information to inform large-scale practices.",

These regional NW-SE striking sets include large seismogenic sources that caused major historical earthquakes (Mw≤7). The faults in the northern part of the study area dip to the southwest; those in the southern part dip to the northeast. The SW-dipping system (Abruzzi Apennines) terminates with the Aremogna-Cinque Miglia source; the NE-dipping system (southern Apennines) terminates with the Boiano Basin source.\nTo test whether the transfer zone model applies to the central-southern Apennines border, we analyzed and relocated seismicity that occurred from 2007 to 2011 between the Aremogna-Cinque Miglia and Boiano Basin sources, where we expect the transfer zone. Seismicity is made of independent events (Md<3.5) and low-magnitude swarms. West of the Apennines, hypocenters are located within the uppermost 12-13 km. Events and swarms that occurred east of the axis affect prevalently the 13-20 km below. West of the chain, focal mechanisms show T-axes striking ~NNW-SSE. East of the chain, T-axes strike ~NE-SW. This trend is consistent with the large scale stress field acting in the Apennine Chain, as suggested by GPS data. The hypocentral distribution of swarms located between the Aremogna-Cinque Miglia and Boiano Basin sources shows a ~NNE-SSW trend, coincident with part of the Ortona-Roccamonfina Line, a regional transverse lineament.\nThe spatial distribution of seismicity, the geometry and kinematics of active faulting in the region, and results from previous geophysical studies, allow us to contend the existence of a transfer zone between these seismogenic normal fault systems. Our data also allow us to recognize the activity of such transfer along the central part of the Ortona-Roccamonfina Line. We infer that reverse in dip polarity between the two normal fault systems could also result from the passage between the diverse tectonic units composing the border between central and southern Apennines.",

Multi-proxy evidence indicates that the exposure of the Sunda shelf has a first-order effect on the climate of the Indo-Pacific warm pool. The climate response involves changes in the Walker circulation driven by a massive reduction in atmospheric deep convection over the Sunda shelf. Few climate models participating in the Paleo Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP) are capable of simulating this response. Using the Community Earth System Model Version 1 (CESM1) we show that a models ability of to simulate this response depends on the formulation of the atmospheric deep convection scheme. Using CESM1 we also find that the Indian Ocean amplifies the response via the Bjerknes feedback. This results in a large reorganization of the climate of the Indian Ocean, which during the LGM resembles the Pacific, with a cold tongue and dry conditions in the east, and warmer SSTs and wetter conditions in the west. Ideas for testing these mechanisms using proxy data will be discussed.",

This study reports the application of ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) to profile molecular components of Arctic SOM collected from the surface water and the mineral horizon of a low-centered polygon soil at Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO), Barrow, Alaska. Soil samples were subjected to anaerobic warming experiments for a period of 40 days, and the SOM was extracted before and after the incubation to determine the components of organic C that were degraded over the course of the study. A CHO index based on molecular composition data was utilized to codify SOM components according to their observed degradation potential. Carbohydrate- and lignin-like compounds in the water-soluble fraction (WSF) demonstrated a high degradation potential, while structures with similar stoichiometries in the base-soluble fraction (BSF) were not readily degraded. The WSF of SOM also shifted to a wider range of measured molecular masses including an increased prevalence of larger compounds, while the size distribution of compounds in the BSF changed little over the same period. Additionally, the molecular profiling data indicated an apparently ordered incorporation of organic nitrogen in the BSF immobilized as primary and secondary amines, possibly as components of N-heterocycles, which may provide insight into nitrogen immobilization or mobilization processes in SOM. Our study represents an important step forward for studying Arctic SOM with improved understanding of the molecular properties of soil organic C and the ability to represent SOM in climate models that will predict the impact of climate change on soil C and nutrient cycling.",

            "abstract": "Environmental and climate changes are important elements of our global challenges. They are observed at a global scale and in particular in the Arctic. In order to give better estimates of the future changes, the Arctic has to be monitored and analyzed by a multi-disciplinary observation system that will improve Earth System Models. The best chance to achieve significant results within a relatively short time frame is found in regions with a large natural climate gradient, and where processes sensitive to the expected changes are particularly important. Svalbard and the surrounding ocean areas fulfil all these criteria. The vision for SIOS is to be a regional observational system for long term acquisition and proliferation of fundamental knowledge on global environmental change within an Earth System Science perspective in and around Svalbard. SIOS will systematically develop and implement methods for how observational networks are to be construed. The distributed SIOS data management system (SDMS) will be implemented through a combination of technologies tailored to the multi-disciplinary nature of the Arctic data. One of these technologies is The Brokering approach or “Framework”. The Brokering approach provides a series of services such as discovery, access, transformation and semantics support to enable translation from one discipline/culture to another. This is exactly the challenges the SDMS will have to handle and thus the Brokering approach is integrated in the design of the system. A description of the design strategy for the SDMS that includes The Brokering approach will be presented. The design and implementation plans for the SDMS are based on research done in the EU funded ESFRI project SIOS and examples of solutions for interoperable systems producing Arctic datasets and products coordinated through SIOS will be showcased. The reported experience from SIOS brokering approach will feed into the process of developing a sustainable brokering governance in the framework of Research Data Alliance. It will also support the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). This is a contribution to increase our global capacity to create interoperable systems that provide multi-disciplinary dataset and products.",

The instrument has been shown to have high spectral resolution (4 cm-1) and temporal resolution (10kHz) resolution in both the mid and near infrared and moderate spectral resolution (14cm-1) in the visible.\nThis instrument has been developed for the remote sensing and in-situ measurements of atmospheric gases. It has been identified that due to the low mass and compact size of the instrument system, that the SIFTS could be deployed as a remote sensing instrument onboard a Earth Observation satellite or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), or conversely as a radiosonde instrument for in-situ measurements of atmospheric gases.\nThe technique is based on a static optical configuration whereby light is split into two paths and made to recombine along a focal plane producing an interference pattern. The spectral information is returned using a detector array to digitally capture the interferogram which can then be processed into a spectrum by applying a Fourier transform.\nAs there are no moving components, the speed of measurement is determined by the frame rate of the detector array. Thus, this instrument has a temporal advantage over common Michelson FTIR instruments. Using a high speed Toshiba CCD line array, sensitive over the spectral region of 400 – 1100nm, spectra have been recorded at a rate of one every 100 microseconds.\nUsing an uncooled microbolometer infrared detector array, sensitive over the spectral region of 2 to 15μm, the gases NH3, O3 and CH4 have been used to demonstrate the sensitivity of the SIFTS instrument. It has been shown that the Signal to Noise of the SIFTSMIR is >1200 using an integration time of 77msec.\nThe novel optical design has reduced the optics to only 3 optical components, and the detector array, to generate and measure the interferogram. The experimental performance of the SIFTS instrument has verified the theoretical models, and it has been shown that the spectral resolution in both the Visible and MIR instruments is 4cm-1 and 14cm-1 respectively.",

This model is driven by a new process-based, spatially resolved OGP CH4 emissions inventory. We employed Bayesian inference to calibrate CMAQ emissions inputs using continuous CH4 measurements at the DOE Southern Great Plains (SGP) central facility and evaluated model predictions against a subset of aircraft and surface flask measurements that are assimilated by NOAA’s CarbonTracker-CH4. Our results suggest that OGP emissions are the largest source of CH4 observed at the DOE SGP site and the largest source of CH4 in TX/OK/KS, constituting ~45% of total CH4 emission in the region. The next largest source in the region is livestock, with other sources being relatively less important. We estimate OGP emissions in TX/OK/KS contribute about one half of national total OGP emissions. Using continuous CH4 measurements, we found evidence of rapid nocturnal transport by the Great Plains low-level jet (LLJ) and sporadic oil and gas emissions. Our study demonstrates the importance of improved knowledge of the spatial and temporal features of oil and gas emissions in reconciling CH4 budgets derived using bottom-up and top-down approaches at regional and national scales.",

Scientists often have a fixed time budget of a few hours spend to perform the monotonous task of scanning through a live stream or data dump of candidates that must be prioritized for follow-up analysis. Today’s and next generation astronomical instruments produce millions of candidate detection per day, and necessitate the use of automated classifiers that serve as “data triage” in order to filter out spurious signals. Automated data triage enables increased science return by prioritizing interesting or anomalous observations for follow-up inspection, while also expediting analysis by filtering out noisy or redundant observations. We describe three specific astronomical investigations that are currently benefiting from data triage techniques in their respective processing pipelines.",

            "abstract": "Fluorine and chlorine are commonly considered together with hydrogen, carbon, and sulfur as volatile elements in volcanic system because molecular species of these elements are found in volcanic gasses. However, fluorine and chlorine do not correlate with H2O and CO2among degassed volcanic glasses, suggesting these halogens are inefficiently degassed, and fractionated during magma ascent. Because Cl is highly soluble in aqueous fluid, and F commonly substitutes in the OH site of hydroxyl-bearing minerals (such as amphiboles, micas, humites, and apatite), they can be ideal geochemical tracers recording fractionation due to aqueous fluid, melt, and/or supercritical fluid in the mantle.\nIn this contribution, we summarize recent experimental results, natural observations, and illustrate prospect of these light halogen as geochemical tracers. Notably, recent partitioning experiments report complex behavior of F. For example, F is incompatible in anhydrous mantle minerals (olivine, pyroxene, and garnet) against aqueous fluid and silicate melts, while F can be compatible in amphibole, and mica against aqueous fluid and/or silicate melt. Furthermore, some studies indicate that F fractionation between liquid and solid is strongly influenced by the nature of the liquid. For all conditions mentioned here, Cl is systematically more incompatible than F. These data provide powerful bases to interpret geochemical correlations found in least degassed basaltic glasses, mainly from olivine-hosted inclusions, of arc, MORB and OIB. In some cases we have a strong indication showing amphibole-aqueous fluid fractionation beneath arc. Lastly, F measurements in oceanic crust and Alpine ophiolites suggest lithology-P-T dependent intake/release of these elements, adding a layer of complexity to global halogen cycles.",

A considerable gap in our knowledge of C3 and C4 grasslands is our understanding of belowground root functional diversity. Our aim was to determine whether root system traits allowed for the identification of functional strategies of grass species and to see if these traits differed along resource gradients (precipitation and nitrogen). The functional root traits (specific root length, diameter, root tissue density, root length density, and % of fine roots) of nine grass species, four C3 and five C4, were evaluated from root samples collected from field plots at 100 -150 m intervals along an elevation gradient in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. An analysis of variance found that there were significant differences in individual root trait values between species (P < 0.000) and photosynthetic pathway (P < 0.025). There was also evidence that the relationships between individual root traits and gradient resources were influenced by photosynthetic pathway (P and r2-values for all interactions were < 0.001 and > 0.625, respectively). A principal component analysis (PCA) found that two components accounted for 86 % of the explainable variation in our data. PCA found that C4 species had larger root diameters, whereas, C3 species had higher % of fine roots and specific root lengths. C3 and C4 species diverged less in root tissue density. C3 species had more resource acquisition root traits, while C4 grasses had a more conservative resource strategy. These results have important implications for how grassland ecosystem dynamics may be altered by shifting patterns of C3-C4 grasses with global change.",

            "abstract": "The nature of an icy satellite's interior relates fundamentally to its composition, thermal structure, formation and evolution history, and prospects for supporting life. Gravity measurements via radio Doppler information during spacecraft flybys constitute an important tool to infer gross interior structure. Liquid water and ice layers have previously been inferred for the interiors of Jupiter's icy satellites Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto on the basis of magnetic field measurements by the Galileo probe. On Europa and Callisto induced magnetic field signatures measured by the Galileo probe provided strong evidence for an ionic aqueous ocean. Among the chief goals of the proposed Europa Clipper mission in returning to Europa is characterizing the structure of the moon's icy shell. A geophysical inverse theory resolution analysis can be calculated at the pre-measurement mission planning stage, contributing planning considerations from the point of view of the search for mass anomalies in the ice shell (meteorites or diapiric upwellings) or near the H2O/rock interface (seamounts). The analysis allows us to assess the location-varying resolution of an icy moon's interior density anomaly distribution that can be estimated from radio Doppler measurements. It considers the tradeoff between the resolution of the estimated density anomaly distribution and its estimation uncertainty, and investigates issues in distinguishing between ocean anomalies (e.g., seamounts) and mass anomalies within or near the surface of the ice layer. We apply the resolution analysis to proposed Europa Clipper trajectories and past Galileo spacecraft trajectories about Europa and Ganymede.",

These events would have affected the biological potential of Mars by melting and fracturing the crust, depositing large amounts of impact ejecta, generating hydrothermal systems, delivering elements essential for life, and likely increasing the temperature of the Martian atmosphere.\nWe model two types of post-accretionary bombardments: (i) a classical exponential decay and (ii) a sawtooth timeline, characterized by faster-than-exponential decay and reduced total mass. Likewise, two types of LHB are modeled: (i) a classic \"spike,\" centered at 3.9 Ga and lasting ~100 Myr, and (ii) a \"sawtooth\" LHB, characterized by a sudden increase in the number of impacts at ~4.1 Ga, overall lower delivered mass, and a longer duration.\nPartial results of these simulations are summarized in Table 1. To estimate habitable volumes in hydrothermal environments, surface temperatures of 1 °C and -63 °C were tested. Even in the latter case, life may have persevered in a global aquifer underneath a layer of permafrost termed the cryosphere. Over 105-106of the impact craters that formed during the LHB and post-accretionary bombardment, respectively, would have accessed this global aquifer via cryospheric melt-through, resulting in a subsurface plumbing network between individual impact-induced hydrothermal systems.\nTable 1.

            "abstract": "Individual SOA experiments on PAHs such as naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes were conducted at the UCR CE-CERT environmental chamber. Measurements were made with a suite of instrumentation that includes HR-ToF-AMS, VTDMA, and APM-SMPS to comprehensively understand the chemical composition characteristics, volatility and density of particles. Our results indicated that the SOA yield from PAHs is large and the elemental and chemical composition analysis of HR-ToF-AMS revealed that oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O/C) increases with oxidation time and also suggested that the SOA from these three PAHs are mostly low volatility OOA. The density of aerosol formed from 1-methylnaphthalene photooxidation under high NOx condition was observed to decrease from 1.5 g/cm3 to 0.7 g/cm3 during the course of experiment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of 1-methylnaphthalene SOA showed that the SOA coagulated after 5~6 hours photooxidation to form fractal-like particles. The sensitivity of SOA formation to varying HC mixtures is further explored. Serial mixtures of PAHs photooxidation experiments were conducted, including naphthalene, 1-methylnapthalene, 2-methylnaphtalene with m-xylene, and/or the surrogate mixture used to develop the Carter O3 reactivity scales. Preliminary results show that the SOA formation from m-xylene and naphthalene mixture photooxidation was found to be suppressed by m-xylene, and the volatility measured as volume remaining fraction (VRF) of the m-xylene and naphthalene mixture increases from 0.2 to 0.4, which indicates the volatility of mixture SOA is dominated by m-xylene SOA.",

            "abstract": "To date, extreme events have been defined by scientists through a top-down approach, relying on observations for current extremes and climate model projections based on future scenarios for their expected changes. These abstract definitions of extreme events are based on a corresponding characterization of what is “normal” and perhaps the choice of a threshold (e.g., a percentile of a historical distribution for a given climate variable), beyond which would represent an extreme event. However, there are not necessarily direct connections between these definitions and what is considered “extreme” in terms of impacts that challenge resource management. Several researchers have suggested that extreme event definitions would also be informed by input from on-the-ground resource managers who are familiar with the systems being impacted, the climate conditions that pose risks to those systems, and their resilience and adaptive capacity.\nThis research will present preliminary survey work designed to solicit input from air and water quality managers in terms of what is considered an extreme event, how these events have been weathered in the past, and planned for in the future. The survey is based on literature review, interviews with air and water quality managers in California, and outreach to the scientific community. This work is the first step of a multistage research effort to link input from resource managers with scientific information to better inform air and water quality management and impacts of extreme events under a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Long-term data sets on stream-water quality and discharge can be used to assess whether best management practices (BMPs) are restoring beneficial uses of impaired water as required under the Clean Water Act. In this study, we evaluated a greater than 20-year record of water quality from selected streams in the Central Valley (CV) of California and Lake Tahoe (California and Nevada, USA). The CV contains a mix of agricultural and urbanized land, while the Lake Tahoe area is mostly forested, with seasonal residents and tourism. Because nutrients and fine sediments cause a reduction in water clarity that impair Lake Tahoe, BMPs were implemented in the early 1990’s, to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus loads. The CV does not have a current nutrient management plan, but numerous BMPs exist to reduce pesticide loads, and it was hypothesized that these programs could also reduce nutrient levels. In the CV and Lake Tahoe areas, nutrient concentrations, loads, and trends were estimated by using the recently developed Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) model. Sufficient data were available to compare trends during a voluntary and enforcement period for seven CV sites within the lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Basins. For six of the seven sites, flow-normalized mean annual concentrations of total phosphorus and nitrate decreased at a faster rate during the enforcement period than during the earlier voluntary period. Concentration changes during similar years and ranges of flow conditions suggest that BMPs designed for pesticides also reduced nutrient loads in the CV. A trend analysis using WRTDS was completed for six streams that enter Lake Tahoe during the late 1980’s through 2008. The results of the model confirm that nutrient loading is influenced strongly by season, such as by spring runoff from snowmelt. The highest nutrient concentrations in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s correlate with high flows, followed by statistically significant decreases in loading from most streams under different flow conditions. The results of the WRTDS model indicate a clear reduction in nutrient loading of nitrogen and phosphorus in all six streams. However, some streams show an increase in nutrient concentrations after 2000, suggesting the possible need for changes to the nutrient reduction management practices.",

On multibeam and seismic reflection data the fault is active based on a continuous seafloor scarp ranging in height from 10 to 40 m. Seismic profiles show that the fault is alternatively downthrown to the north and south typical of strike-slip faults. The sense of most recent strike-slip offset on the fault is right-lateral based on offsets at 4 localities that range from 1.5 to3.5 km. Shallow earthquake swarms are associated with the fault trace in the Virgin Islands area but large segments of the fault are aseismic and appear locked. We propose that this fault system forms the southern boundary of an actively CCW-rotating Puerto Rico microplate that is driven by oblique, left-lateral shear of the North America-Caribbean plate boundary. The northern edge of the microplate is inferred to follow left-lateral faults known in the Puerto Rico trench (Bunce and Bowin fault zones) that close the loop around the crudely circular microplate in the area of the Mona rift. We have modeled these boundaries of the rotating block using the Defnode method of finite elements constrained by GPS and earthquake slip vectors.",

We use an adaptive-mesh hydrocode to study the momentum-enhancement factor, or beta, varying the assumptions regarding the equation of state and the strength of the target. Spall from the back side of the asteroid, which partly counters the favorable effect of ablation, is also included in the calculations. For objects not known to be competent, the nuclear stand-off burst option may be preferable. In this case, crucial questions surround the optimum height of burst and the radiation characteristics of the burst. The same hydrocode, with radiation diffusion included, is used to study this case as well. Figures of merit from both these studies include the bulk momentum imparted to the asteroid and the degree to which the asteroid is disrupted.\nLA-UR-14-26234",

However, conditions may have been far different 4 Gyr ago, when the Sun was fainter and most of the carbon within Venus may have been in solid form, implying a low-mass atmosphere. We investigate how a obliquity would have evolved on a hypothetical rapidly-rotating Early Venus. As with our previous investigation of a Moonless Earth, prograde rotation of our hypothesized Early Venus generally leads to larger variations in obliquity than does retrograde rotation. But this trend is far weaker for Venus than for a Moonless Earth, and doesn't hold for all initial obliquities and spin periods. The possible mechanisms for these variations and implications for early habitability will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Ferropericlase, (Mg,Fe)O, is thought to be the second most abundant component of the Earth's lower mantle. Because of its geological relevance, crystalline (Mg,Fe)O has been extensively studied to assess the effects of Fe on various seismically observable properties. However, the role of Fe in liquid phase remains mostly unknown. Recently, we have initiated the first-principles study of liquid (Mg,Fe)O over relevant broad ranges of pressure and temperature using local spin density approximation (LSDA). We also explore the use of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and Hubbard (U) term. Our results on molten (Mg0.83Fe0.17)O show that for any isotherm the low spin (LS, non-magnetic) and the high spin (HS, magnetic) states have similar compressibility. They also predict the HS to LS transition occurring at much lower pressure of around 10 GPa, with transition pressure being positively correlated to temperature. These trends are generally consistent with the behavior shown by the solid phase. The calculated difference in enthalpy between the HS and LS remains small over wide pressure range indicating the possibility of coexistence of two spin states in the deep mantle melt.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the evolution of relief in active regions in response to climate change is of particular importance because of the potential linkages between climate and tectonics, such as in the case of the highly debated late Cenozoic uplift of the Himalayas and Tibetan plateau in relation to the onset of Quaternary Glaciations (Molnar and England, 1990; Whipple et al., 1999).Using paramagnetic centers in quartz measured by electron spin resonance (ESR) has shown a potential to quantify late-stage exhumation rates in the range of about 10 ka to 1 Ma due to their relatively low closure temperatures (Grün et al., 1999). However, successful field case study has rarely been documented. Here, we explore the potential ESR dating to provide multiple-thermochronometers using the Al and Ti center in quartz in the Kongur Shan, NE Pamir, to measure how the landscape of a tectonically active range has responded to a change in climatic conditions at the timescale of Quaternary glacial cycles.\nThe Kongur Shan is located in NE Pamir, at the western end of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogenic belt, and presents exhumation rates of ~5 mm/a since 7-8 Ma (Robinson et al., 2010). Bedrock samples were collected from an elevation transect (between 3380 m and 4850 m above sea level) across the Kongur Shan normal fault and along the east-flowing Ghez river.\nWe investigated both the ESR Al center (a hole center located at AlO-) and the Ti center (an electron center: Ti3++e- substituting silicon and stabilized by H+, Li+ in channels near the edge of the silicon-oxygen tetrahedron) in quartz. Our preliminary results show that the quartz Al and Ti centers signals are bright enough for dating. There is a clear age offset between samples from the hanging wall and footwall of the fault, suggesting that the fault is still active. In general, the apparent exhumation rate of the footwall from the ESR Al center is quite similar to that of zircon (U-Th)/He (Thiede et al., 2013), however, there is a clear inflection points on ESR Al center age‐elevation plots, the apparent exhumation rate increased to ~22 mm/a around ~75 ka, might be caused by a mix of enhanced fluvial and glacial erosion, normal faulting and bulk exhumation during MIS 5.",

            "abstract": "To understand the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the NY coast, we conducted subsurface and multi-beam analyses, ground-truthed by grab samples, in 3 areas: the western end of Fire Island (FIW), eastern Fire Island (FIE) where a new inlet formed during the storm, and Long Beach (LB). Grab samples yielded sands and muds, a surprise given the shallow (10-25m) water depths. Muds rested on top of sands and were removed for additional analyses. Since percent mud could not be determined absolutely, sediments were washed through a 63 mm sieve, RoTapped for 10 minutes at ¼ Φ, and weight percent calculated for the coarse fraction.\nAt FIW and FIE, fine sands dominate the shallowest depths studied, consistent with previous studies. At FIE, the sedimentary wedge extends to ~15m, with finest sands (peak 3-3.5 Φ) in shallowest waters surveyed (~10m). Slightly coarser (2.5Φ) sediments plus relict gravels are present in swales where the wedge shoals. This supports mapping results indicating sand ridges migrated to the SW. Medium to fine sand is present at the deepest extent of the wedge; the grain size distribution matches a sample taken in the swash zone on the eastern flank of the new breach. Sediments may have been transported shoreward and then reworked post-Sandy. Samples seaward of the new breach were capped by a mud layer, which in turn had a layer of fine sand resting on it, evidence of a nascent ebb tidal deposit. At FIW, sediments in the shallow NE swale are finer (3.5Φ) and better sorted. As the region is underlain by relict sediments, these fine sands may be relicts exposed by storm-driven bedform migration. Deeper water (~22m w.d.) samples at FIW are coarser and contain shell hash. Sand on the lee side of the sand ridge, which CHIRP profiles show did not migrate significantly and accumulated sands, are medium (1.5 Φ), and match the grain sizes found on Fire Island beach. Muds contain heavy metals in concentrations consistent with transport from adjacent estuaries.",

            "abstract": "Most recently developed climate scenarios indicate a potential future increase in water stress in the region of Comahue, located in the North-Patagonia, Argentina. This region covers about 140,000 km2 where the Limay River and the Neuquén River converge into the Negro River, constituting the largest integrated basins in Argentina providing various uses of water resources: a) hydropower generation, contributing 15% of the national electricity market; b) fruit-horticultural products for local markets and export; c) human and industrial water supply; d) mining and oil exploitation, including Vaca Muerta, second world largest reserves of shale gas and fourth world largest reserves of shale-oil. The span of multiple jurisdictions and the convergence of various uses of water resources are a challenge for integrated understanding of economically and politically driven resource use activities on the natural system. The impacts of climate change on the system could lead to water resource conflicts between the different political actors and stakeholders. This paper presents the results of a hydrological simulation of the Limay river and Neuquén river basins using WEAP (Water Evaluation and Planning) considering the operation of artificial reservoirs located downstream at a monthly time step. This study aims to support policy makers via integrated tools for water-energy planning under climate uncertainties, and to facilitate the formulation of water policy–related actions for future water stress adaptation. The value of the integrated resource use model is that it can support local policy makers understand the implications of resource use trade-offs under a changing climate: 1) water availability to meet future growing demand for irrigated areas; 2) water supply for hydropower production; 3) increasing demand of water for mining and extraction of unconventional oil; 4) potential resource use conflicts and impacts on vulnerable populations.",

            "abstract": "The Servita Fault System (SFS) is located in the eastern foothills of the Colombian Andes Eastern Cordillera. This region is a structurally complex area with high seismogenic potential. The refined analysis of the microseismicity registered by a portable seismic network allows to delineate the main active faults and to estimate the direction of the regional tectonic stress.\nWe analyzed a high quality microearthquake data-set consisting of 890 events occurred during 2011-2012 with a local magnitude range between 0.1 and 3.2 and depths up to 40km. The refined locations of the events show a general SW-NE trend that follows the trace of the SFS. Selected focal mechanisms show predominantly right-lateral strike slip motion.\nResults show that seismicity to the northern sector of the SFS is distributed in two groups, one on the axial zone of the cordillera and the other on the eastern flank. Most of the microearthquakes are concentrated in the rupture zone of Quetame earthquake (2008, Mw=5.9). Alignment of hypocenters along the eastern flank and some focal mechanisms suggest a fault plane dipping to the west, which is interpreted as the Servita Fault plane. Southwards of the Rio Negro, seismicity decreases and loses continuity. This feature coincides with the trace of the WSW-ENE Rio Blanco Fault which possibly segments the Servita Fault. Southwards, seismicity is spread over a wider area and exhibits deeper hypocenters compared to the northern sector. Hypocenter distribution and focal mechanisms in this sector suggest two planes dipping to the west which we interpret as segments of the Algeciras Fault and another plane (northwards) steeply dipping to the southeast interpreted as the fault plane of the Altamira Fault.",

This study was conducted to examine how different approaches to basin design, specifically mulching (gravel vs. compost and gravel), influence the water availability of rain basins and the effects this has on the soil microbial activity of the basins. Soil microbes are a driving force of biogeochemical process and may impact the carbon and nitrogen dynamics of rain basin GI. In this study we sampled 12 different residential-scale rain basins, differing in design established at Biosphere 2, Arizona in 2013. Soil samples and measurements were collected before and after the onset of the monsoon season in 2014 to determine how the design of basins mediates the transition from dry to wet conditions. Soil abiotic factors were measured, such as moisture content, soil organic matter (SOM) content, texture and pH, and were related to the microbial biomass size within the basins. Field and lab potential N-mineralization and soil respiration were measured to determine how basin design influences microbial activity and N dynamics. We found that pre-monsoon basins with compost had higher moisture contents and that there was a positive correlation between the moisture content and the soil microbial biomass size of the basins. Pre-monsoon data also suggests that N-mineralization rates for basins with compost were higher than those with only gravel. These design influences on basin-scale biogeochemical dynamics and nitrogen retention may have important implications for urban biogeochemistry at neighborhood and watershed scales.",

            "abstract": "Drought severely impacts biosphere-atmosphere carbon and water fluxes of terrestrial ecosystems by reducing productivity, carbon uptake and water transport to the atmosphere. The 2012 US drought was among the most intense and widespread drought events in the U.S. since the ‘Dust Bowl’ period in the 1930s, and had devastating effects on agricultural production. In addition, 2012 was among the warmest years on record. Using eddy covariance measurements of carbon, water and energy exchange from 25 AmeriFlux sites along with remote sensing products, we show that this summer drought substantially reduced ecosystem productivity, net carbon uptake and water transport to the atmosphere. However, the warm spring with higher ecosystem productivity reduced the impact of the summer drought on annual carbon uptake. Shifts in vegetation activity during spring also triggered feedbacks that contributed to the summer heatwave. Although the drought was exceptional, 2012 was an example of what is expected in terms of future climate change – i.e. warmer temperatures all year and an increased frequency and duration of drought in summer. Understanding the response of ecosystem carbon and water cycling to drought will help to mitigate these changes, and our study provides important new insights for that.",

In this study, we test the consistency of such reconstructions with data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) by applying the aformentioned method to additional active regions with varying amounts of solar activity. To create an initial model of a magnetic field surrounding an active region, we first manually trace the coronal loops on the coronal images in the following wavelengths: 171Å, 193Å, 211Å, 94Å, 131Å, and 335Å. The manually traced loops are then used as a guide for a computer reconstruction of the individual three-dimensional field lines with differing heights and degrees of local twist. The reconstructed field lines are then adjusted by a partially automated algorithm, so that the constructed field line would correspond to a coronal loop on the Sun. These fitted loops serve as a skeleton to create a model of the magnetic field of the active region. We expect that our modeling can be used in future works to predict future solar events. Implications of this ability include being able to prepare a response for a solar event before it happens.",

The data consists of full Stokes profiles in the Ca II 854.2 nm and Fe I 1.56 micron lines. The inversion of these Stokes spectra provides the magnetic, thermal and velocity structure at photospheric and chromospheric heights of sunspots. In this contribution, we present the results on the 3D thermal structure in the super-penumbral canopy of a well rounded sunspot, derived by a novel approach for the inversion of Ca II IR spectra. Tracing individual fibrils in the super-penumbral canopy, we find that about half of them form only short loops of a a few Mm length that return to the photosphere in the close surroundings of the sunspot instead of connecting to more remote magnetic network at the outer end of the moat flow.",

            "abstract": "The GEOGLAM Crop Monitor’s Crop Assessment Tool was released in August 2013 in support of the GEOGLAM Crop Monitor’s objective to develop transparent, timely crop condition assessments in primary agricultural production areas, highlighting potential hotspots of stress/bumper crops. The Crop Assessment Tool allows users to view satellite derived products, best available crop masks, and crop calendars (created in collaboration with GEOGLAM Crop Monitor partners), then in turn submit crop assessment entries detailing the crop’s condition, drivers, impacts, trends, and other information.\nAlthough the Crop Assessment Tool was originally intended to collect data on major crop production at the global scale, the types of data collected are also relevant to the food security and rangelands monitoring communities. In line with the GEOGLAM Countries at Risk philosophy of “foster[ing] the coordination of product delivery and capacity building efforts for national and regional organizations, and the development of harmonized methods and tools”, a modified version of the Crop Assessment Tool is being developed for the USAID Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET).\nAs a member of the Countries at Risk component of GEOGLAM, FEWS NET provides agricultural monitoring, timely food security assessments, and early warnings of potential significant food shortages focusing specifically on countries at risk of food security emergencies. While the FEWS NET adaptation of the Crop Assessment Tool focuses on crop production in the context of food security rather than large scale production, the data collected is nearly identical to the data collected by the Crop Monitor. If combined, the countries monitored by FEWS NET and GEOGLAM Crop Monitor would encompass over 90 countries representing the most important regions for crop production and food security.",

            "abstract": "This contribution provides a new approach to calculate the plagioclase composition of a given igneous rock based on kinetics parameters of crystallization obtained from CSD analyses of plagioclase. The procedure we use includes the following steps: 1) determination of the effective rates of crystal growth and nucleation based on the maximum time interval of mineral crystallization obtained from the CSD segment with the minimum slope and extrapolated to rest of the segments; 2) calculation of the total crystallization time; 3) determination of the time-dependent variation of plagioclase volume fraction based on crystal population density and CSD slopes; 4) calculation of the ideal rates of crystal growth and nucleation; 5) determination of temperature of plagioclase crystallization as a function of the ideal crystal growth rate; 6) determination of plagioclase composition as a function of the ideal crystal growth rate.\nWe apply our model for plagioclase of 17 samples of The Villarrica Volcano 1971 eruption lava flow. All CSD show two segments with a break at 0.3 mm. The first segment is interpreted as the syn-eruptive crystallization and the second as the within-reservoir crystallization. An interval of 1.5 years as a maximum crystallization time for the syn-eruptive stage was estimated from Cashman’s (1993) expression. Crystal growth rates in the reservoir stage took place during two stages. The first stage varies from 10^-8.9 to 10^-9.4 mm s-1 and the second one varied from 10^-9.4 to 10^-9.1 mm s-1. Finally, the crystal growth rate as high as 10^-7.8 mm s-1 were estimated for the syn-eruptive stage. Nucleation rates varies exponentially from 10^-13 to 10^-8 s-1 in the reservoir stage and from 10^-8 to 10^-1 s^-1 in the syn-eruptive stage. The total crystallization interval varies from 120 to 390 years. A mean total volume fraction of plagioclase of 0.55 was obtained (0.98 for all minerals) whereas a mean value of 0.054 was obtained at the onset of the eruption (0.096 for all minerals). An empirical relation between the crystal growth rate and the XAn was obtained for plagioclases of the studied eruption. Thus, a variation of 232° C for the whole plagioclase crystallization history was obtained.",

            "abstract": "Climate regionalization is an important but often under-emphasized step in studies of climate variability and predictions. While most investigations of regional climate or statistical/dynamical predictions do make at least an implicit attempt to focus on a study region or sub-regions that are climatically coherent in some respect, rigorous climate regionalization––in which the study area is divided on the basis of the most relevant climate metrics and at a resolution most appropriate to the data and the scientific question––has the potential to enhance the precision and explanatory power of climate studies in many cases. This is particularly true for climatically complex regions such as the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) and Equatorial West Africa. Here we present an improved clustering method and a flexible, open-source software tool (R package “HiClimR”) designed specifically for climate regionalization. As a demonstration, we apply HiClimR to regionalize the GHA on the basis of interannual precipitation variability in each calendar month and for three-month running seasons. Different clustering methods are tested to show the behavior of each method and provide recommendations for specific problems. This would underscore the applicability of our work to a wide range of climate issues, and enable researchers to easily and quickly learn how to apply our tools to their own problems. Both the proposed methodology and the R package can be easily used for a broad range of climate applications.",

            "abstract": "Arctic tundra contains significant carbon (C) stocks, which are likely to change in response to climate change, depending on the balance of plant production and decomposition responses to warming and thawing permafrost. We modeled terrestrial C over the period 1901-2100 in a 67,000 km2 region of the eastern Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska with four dominant vegetation types: wet sedge, tussock, shrub and heath tundra. The Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) is a biogeochemical model that simulates the C and N dynamics of vegetation and soils in response to climatic drivers. The version of TEM used here includes a dynamic organic soil module that allows the size of the organic soil layer to change through time. We model historical (1900-2010) and future (2010-2100) dynamics for low, intermediate and high CO2 emissions scenarios. During the period 2000-2010, modeled net primary productivity and vegetation C were significantly positively correlated with the MODIS derived normalized difference vegetation index, as were the start and end of the growing season, and the duration of the snow-covered season. Between 1900 and 2100, C storage in vegetation increased most in shrub and tussock tundra (52 % and 43 %, respectively) and somewhat less in wet sedge and heath tundra (15 % and 21 %, respectively), consistent with observed expansion of shrubby biomass across the region. Simulated terrestrial C storage for the study region changed from 40.5 kg C m-2 (soil=39.6, vegetation=1.0) in 1901 to 42.2 kg C m-2 (soil=40.9, vegetation=1.2) in 2010. In the intermediate warming scenario, by 2050, the total terrestrial C storage in the study region increased by 0.5 kg C m-2 but by 2100, 60% of this new C storage was lost, indicating a shift from net C uptake to net C loss in the study region toward the end of the century, driven by a shift in the relative magnitudes of C inputs from litter and losses from heterotrophic respiration. These changes were correlated with a 21 day increase in growing season length and ~20 cm increase in active layer depth between 2010 and 2100, yet the entire region maintained continuous permafrost. These changes suggest the eastern Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska will serve as a net C sink for several more decades before becoming a C source later in the century.",

            "abstract": "This article summarizes recent land subsidence that has occurred in the Houston metropolitan area. Subsidence measurements derived from observations at 11 borehole extensometers and 90 GPS sites during the past 20 years (1993-2012) were investigated in this study. Precise Point Positioning with Single Receiver Phase Ambiguity (PPP-SRPA) resolution employed by the GIPSY-OASIS software package (V6.2) was applied to calculate daily positions of GPS antennas. GPS and extensometer observations indicate that the overall subsidence rate in the Houston metropolitan area has been decreasing since the 1970s, which was when groundwater withdrawal regulations started to be enforced by the Harris-Galveston Subsidence District (HGSD). Currently, the subsidence in the southeast of the Houston metropolitan area has almost ceased. Slight rebound has been observed at several sites along the Houston Ship Channel area since 2005. Nonetheless, a relatively small area within the Houston Ship Channel area that runs northwest from approximately Texas City to League City has continued to subside. There is some evidence that suggest that this subsidence is the result of local oil and gas withdrawal rather than groundwater withdrawal. Subsidence also continues in the west and northwest of the Houston metropolitan area, where groundwater regulations have only recently been implemented. The maximum rate is 2.5 cm/year. It is evident that the groundwater withdrawal regulations enforced by HGSD have successfully reduced the subsidence in the Houston metropolitan area. Long-term GPS observations also indicate that subsidence rates vary spatially and temporally depending on local groundwater withdrawals and the clay-to-sand ratio in subsurface sediments. The ground water and aquifer systems respond slowly to human actions. It took almost two decades (1980s and 1990s) to halt the subsidence in the east part of the Houston metropolitan area after groundwater regulations were implemented in the late 1970s. Therefore, a long-term perspective is needed to manage groundwater resources and control land subsidence. Long-term subsidence monitoring and mapping are critical to the scientific understanding and management of our land and groundwater resources.",

The focus of the course includes the history and rationales for interdisciplinary outdoor education and informal learning environments while promoting successful pedagogical practices to enhance science instruction. Students gain valuable outdoor education field experience through a week of full emersion at a residential environmental learning center at the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont, TN (\nwww.gsmit.org\n) that challenges perceptions of what many believe are “good teaching” practices. Tremont offers multiple overnight educational options for K-12 schools, teacher professional development programs, master naturalists trainings, and citizen science opportunities to the public. Being fully immersed in the outdoors teaching and learning about Earth Science interdisciplinary topics creates a paradigm shift in what is considered to be effective teaching by the graduate and undergraduate participants. Prior to the week at Tremont, students select a Tremont created outdoor educational activity to teach their fellow the graduate and undergraduate students while at Tremont. All activities promote inquiry and hands-on exploration utilizing authentic science process skills in outdoor field research settings that can also be adapted for local school environments. At Tremont the students reside in platform tents located at the center to allow complete immersion in the culture of informal learning unique to outdoor education. In addition to gaining personal experiences leading outdoor science activities, the college students get to actively observe experts in the field of outdoor ecological education model exemplary pedagogical practices of guided inquiry and effective questioning strategies. The impact of the full emersion field experience gained by class participants will be one that they can implement into a variety of science education settings to enrich understanding of the Geosciences to diverse audiences.",

            "abstract": "In building its emerging program, Future Earth has encouraged former Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP) projects to redefine their objectives, priorities and problem approaches so they are aligned with those of Future Earth. These new projects will be characterized by more integrated applications of natural and social sciences as well as dialogue and science integrated across disciplinary boundaries to address a wide range of environmental and social issues. The Global Water System Project (GWSP) has had a heritage of integrating natural and social sciences, and recently started to also look at issues within the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) cluster using similar integrated approaches. As part of the growth of the scientific elements of this cluster, GWSP has approached Future Earth opportunities by addressing the sustainability for Water, Energy, and Food through integrated water information and improved governance.\nIn this presentation the approaches being considered for promoting integration in both water and the WEF cluster will be discussed. In particular, potential contributions of Future Earth to research related to the use and management of water and to issues and science underpinning the W-E-F nexus deliberations will be identified. In both cases the increasing ability to utilize Earth observations and big data will advance this research agenda. In addition, the better understanding of the implications of governance structures in addressing these issues and the options for harmonizing the use of scientific knowledge and technological advances will be explored. For example, insights gained from water management studies undertaken within the GWSP are helping to focus plans for a \"sustainable water futures\" project and a WEF cluster within Future Earth. The potential role of the Sustainable Development Goals in bringing together the monitoring and science capabilities, and understanding of governance approaches, will be discussed as a framework for facilitating the factors that could encourage more coherence in water management and in the WEF cluster.",

We quantified how elevation differences of less than one meter affect sources of water uptake by individual trees in the Mississippi River Delta, Louisiana. Salinity and naturally occurring stable isotopes of water were used as tracers of hydrologic and physiologic processes. Water samples were taken from tree xylem and soil at multiple depths across a range of drought and wet conditions. Hummocks were frequently but temporarily submerged after rainfall (total 9% of the time) and tides influenced inundation (every 46.9 hours). Isotopic composition of surface water and throughfall were similar, and were temporally more variable than was groundwater in hummocks. Salinity was lower but more temporally variable in the upper hummocks than in lower hummocks. Low deuterium excess indicated evaporative concentration in the unsaturated zone. Low deuterium excess (1.9 ± 2.1‰ below the local meteoric water line) and low temporal variability in groundwater suggested long residence time and limited exchange with surface water. The δD/δ18O ratio of xylem water (3.9) matched that of pore water in the unsaturated zone, showing that the water source for trees was the upper portion of hummocks. This study indicates that trees rely on hummocks as refuge from salinity in addition to reducing flood durations.",

            "abstract": "The uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) by grassland ecosystems can be offset by the concurrent emission of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in terms of CO2-equivalents. As a consequence, CH4 and N2O emissions can contribute to an increase of the global warming potential (GWP) of the respective study site. For a full assessment of the climatic impact of grassland ecosystems it is therefore necessary to quantify fluxes of these two compounds in combination with CO2 exchange. Since agricultural management practices and land use change at a given site can have a strong impact on annual CH4 and N2O budgets, both compounds are a frequent topic of discussion when planning GHG mitigation strategies.Here we present an overview of the GHG exchange of eight managed Central European grassland sites along a gradient of elevation and land use intensity. Fluxes of the three major GHGs CO2, CH4 and N2O were quantified using the eddy covariance or chamber technique. The grasslands differed with regard to the amount of fertilizer input, frequency of cuts and grazing duration and intensity, ranging from more intensively managed to very lightly managed and abandoned grassland.\nIn this presentation we focus on time periods when measurements of all three compounds were available for all sites. We investigate common features among observed CH4 and N2O exchange patterns at the different grassland sites in relation to management activities and concurrently measured biotic / abiotic parameters. In addition, we evaluate the impact of CH4 and N2O fluxes on the annual GWP of field sites for which long-term measurements are available.",

            "abstract": "Recent measurements of ocean bottom pressure suggest that hydrothermal flow induces cm-scale periodic ground surface displacement (GSD) at the Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) hydrothermal field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Sohn et al., 2009). The pressure measurements contain spectral peaks and harmonics with periods ranging from 22 to 53 min, none of which can be attributed to oceanographic or Earth tide processes. It is hypothesized that GSD cycles in this system may result from a nonlinear feedback between pore pressure and permeability in the hydrothermal system.\nTo test this hypothesis we have developed a poroelastic convection model representing the upper crustal section at TAG that includes a \"switching\" type pressure-permeability feedback in the stockwork zone of the hydrothermal system. In this zone, the permeability increases when the pressure reaches a critical high value, and decreases when it reaches a critical low value. This behavior simulates the opening and closing of cracks within the hydrothermal system, and is similar to mechanisms that have been proposed for dike propagation in magmatic systems (Buck et al., 2006).\nOur modeling suggests that this mechanism can generate GSD that are similar to those observed at TAG. We are currently using these models to explore the sensitivity of inflation and deflation rates to system properties such as the geometry of the stockwork zone, the temperature of fluid in the upflow zone, the elastic properties of the lithosphere, and the relationship between pore pressure and permeability.",

The focus of this study is to test the validity in field situations of the classical explanation that the residual layer is remnant air from the previous day's upwind convective boundary layer.

The simulation results will be evaluated using observed soundings and lidar measurements taken during this field study. The Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) will then be used to generate back-trajectories of residual layer air to test the hypothesis that residual layer scalar profiles are as classically explained, a result of advection of upwind convective boundary layer air from the end of the previous day. The research fits into a broad stable boundary layer context since it investigates an aspect of the stable boundary layer - the residual layer - that could potentially be underappreciated in explaining stable boundary layer variability.",

It is safe to say that the spot on the planet that mankind knows the least about is somewhere on the ocean floor. But where?  Bathymetry maps are produced from  data that  consists of active acoustic measurements  taken from surface ships at random locations with high horizontal resolution but variable redundancy combined with satellite altimetric  measurements with  low  resolution but very high redundancy. Both data sets leave large areas un-measured (more than 10% of the world ocean floor is greater than 60km from an acoustic measurement, for example) so that grids of calculated depths must be used to map  the unmeasured areas. The least known spot on earth can be calculated from degree of isolation from acoustic measurements, uncertainty in satellite altimetry and reliability of the gridding method used.\n A cruise to the least known spot, collecting more types of data than  bathymetry, would add disproportionately our knowledge of the oceans and may produce other benefits by capturing the imagination of the non-scientific world.",

The catalog is expected to contain about 2600 TGFs and will be released both online, to conveniently provide the community with TGF parameters, and as a publication. Since the launch of Fermi in 2008 the TGF detection sensitivity of GBM has been improved several times, both in the flight software and in ground analysis. Starting in 2010 July individual photons were downloaded for portions of the orbits, enabling an off-line search that found weaker and shorter TGFs. Since 2012 November 26 this telemetry mode has been extended to continuous coverage -- in the first year of this data mode 841 TGFs were detected. The TGF sample is reliable, with cosmic rays rejected using data both from Fermi GBM and from the Large Area Telescope on Fermi. The online catalog will include times (UTC and solar), spacecraft geographic positions, durations, count intensities and other parameters (e.g., see the Bayesian Block analysis by O. Roberts). There will be separate tables for bright TGFs detected by the flight software and Terrestrial Electron Beams (TEBs).",

            "abstract": "The South China Sea (SCS) formed by magma-poor rifting in the Paleogene. The Qiongdongnan basin (QDNB) located at the north margin was thought to completely lack magma activities. Due to the limited amount of deepwater drills, magmas in deepwater area had been ignored in petroleum exploration, and thus our knowledge of basin analysis is far from complete.\nBased on a comprehensive study on seismic profiles and P wave velocity data, 12 intrusion-related seismic reflection anomalies in QDNB have been recognized. In the southwest of QDNB, gas chimneys and gas clouds have been found with a low velocity (<3.4 km/s). In the center area, the intensively deformed strata passing towards the diapir flanks suggest the existence of magma diapirs. However, the velocity within diapirs is neither too high nor too low (3.7–4.6 km/s), and there has been no obvious magnetic anomaly or gravity anomaly be found. Previous researches prove that the temperatures of the crustal melt layers at the time that the basalt solidifies are high (900–950 °C) so that the process can produce magmas representing large degrees of partial fusion of the crust. To judge from the evidence, in the center area these could be mixed magmas. Further east, the diapirs possess typical features of basaltic magma intrusions with a high seismic velocity (>6 km/s), a positive magnetic anomaly and a high gravity anomaly. In addition, according to different dips of marginal facies, three phases of diapirism can be identified (32 Ma, 15.5 Ma and 10.5 Ma). Along a narrow area with hyper-extended crust, those intrusions document the opening of SCS at 32 Ma and the volcanic activities afterwards.\nThe results are corresponding to the fact that all of the intrusions in QDNB occurred during the extreme crustal thinning process and after the cessation of seafloor spreading, and thus the intrusion evolved with time would have major implications for post-rift emplacement.",

            "abstract": "We present the initial results from coupled experimental and numerical study of the response of particles to low-velocity impacts. In this study, laboratory experiments are used to validate and tune a new DEM capable of handling complex particle shapes for simulation of the behavior of planetary regolith. These studies have fundamental applications to granular material science, as well as broader applications to the response to low-energy impacts of surface layers on other planetary bodies, including planetesimals, asteroids, small moons, and planetary ring particles. Knowledge of the velocities and mass distributions of dust knocked off of planetary surfaces is necessary to understand the evolution of the upper layers of the soil, the plasma environment, and to develop mitigation strategies for transported dust. In addition, the fine particles in the regolith pose an engineering and safety hazard for equipment, experiments, and astronauts working in severe environments. Our laboratory experiments consist of impacting a spherical impactor into a bed of particles and tracking the subsequent mass loss and trajectories of the ejected particles. We begin with spherical particles and then we will expand to elongated rods, flake-like particles, and well-characterized aggregates. Complementary discrete element method (DEM) simulations are validated by these experimental studies; in the DEM simulations, the non-spherical nature of these particles will be described using a glued-sphere approach. An initial comparison between the particle ejection velocities observed in the experiments and simulations for spherical particles is shown in the figure. Discrepancies at low velocities are due to the fact that the trajectories of particles with such low ejection speeds are not observable in this setup. The simulations will then be used to gain physical insight and to evaluate a broader range of scenarios than can be easily explored experimentally, such as conditions similar to those present on lunar or small-body surfaces.",

            "abstract": "Discontinuous tephra layers were discovered at Burney Spring Mountain, northern California, USA. Stratigraphic relationships suggest that they are two distinct primary fall deposits. Geochemistry of the tephras from electron probe microanalysis was compared with geochemistry of known layers found in the region, to test for potential correlations, first using traditional binary plots and standard similarity coefficients.\nThen, using principal component analysis, we were able to bound our uncertainty in the correlation of the two tephra layers. After removal of outliers, within the 95% prediction interval, we can say that the lower tephra layer is likely the Rockland tephra, aged 565-610 ka, and the upper layer is likely from Mt Mazama, the Trego Hot Springs tephra, aged ~ 29 ka, based on the majority of the glass shards.\nThe results were used to estimate the erupted volumes of the two deposits, by using the new thickness measurement together with others in the literature. The volume of the Rockland tephra was estimated to be 150-250 cu km, and of the Trego Hot Springs tephra, 10-50 cu km. It was found, however, that reported thickness measurements are not always detailed, and some reworked material is often included in measurements. As a result, the erupted volumes may be greatly over-estimated. Checking measured thickness against expected (model) thickness as a function of isopach area can provide useful information about potential redeposition. This would avoid an over-estimation of primary fall deposit volume, by giving an indication about locations where the original description should be studied in detailed and new thickness measurements made, if possible.",

            "abstract": "Lake Gilmore in Western Australia is an acidic ephemeral lake that is analogous to Martian geochemical processes represented by interbedded phyllosilicates and sulfates. These areas demonstrate remnants of a global-scale change on Mars during the late Noachian era from a neutral to alkaline pH to relatively lower pH in the Hesperian era that continues to persist today. The geochemistry of these areas could possibly be caused by small-scale changes such as microbial metabolism. Two approaches were used to determine the presence of microbes in the Australian dry lake cores: DNA analysis and lipid analysis. Detecting DNA or lipids in the cores will provide evidence of living or deceased organisms since they provide distinct markers for life. Basic DNA analysis consists of extraction, amplification through PCR, plasmid cloning, and DNA sequencing. Once the sequence of unknown DNA is known, an online program, BLAST, will be used to identify the microbes for further analysis. The lipid analysis approach consists of phospholipid fatty acid analysis that is done by Microbial ID, which will provide direct identification any microbes from the presence of lipids. Identified microbes are then compared to mineralogy results from the x-ray diffraction of the core samples to determine if the types of metabolic reactions are consistent with the variation in composition in these analog deposits. If so, it provides intriguing implications for the presence of life in similar Martian deposits.",

            "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant with weak estrogenic activity. BPA is readily biodegradable with oxygen available, but is recalcitrant to microbial degradation under anoxic conditions. However, BPA is susceptible to abiotic transformation under anoxic conditions. To better understand the fate of BPA in anoxic environments, the kinetics of BPA transformation by manganese oxide (d-MnO2) were investigated. BPA was rapidly transformed by MnO2 with a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 0.413 min-1. NMR and LC-MS analyses identified 4-hydroxycumyl alcohol (HCA) as a major intermediate. Up to 64% of the initial amount of BPA was recovered as HCA within 5 min, but the conversion efficiency decreased with time, suggesting that HCA was further degraded by MnO2. Further experiments confirmed that HCA was also susceptible to transformation by MnO2, albeit at 5-fold lower rates than BPA transformation. Mass balance approaches suggested that HCA was the major BPA transformation intermediate, but other compounds may also be formed. The abiotic transformation of BPA by MnO2 was affected by pH, and 10-fold higher transformation rates were observed at pH 4.5 than at pH 10. Compared to BPA, HCA has a lower octanol-water partitioning coefficient (Log Kow) of 0.76 vs 2.76 for BPA and a higher aqueous solubility of 2.65 g L-1 vs 0.31 g L-1 for BPA, suggesting higher mobility of HCA in the environment. Microcosms established with freshwater sediment materials collected from four geographically distinct locations and amended with HCA demonstrated rapid HCA biodegradation under oxic, but not under anoxic conditions. These findings suggest that BPA is not inert under anoxic conditions and abiotic reactions with MnO2 generate HCA, which has increased mobility and is susceptible to aerobic degradation. Therefore, coupled abiotic-biotic processes can affect the fate and longevity of BPA in terrestrial environments.",

            "abstract": "Themis measurements1 in the vicinity of dipolarization fronts in Earth's magnetotail have detected a spectrum of quasi-parallel whistler waves in a band of frequencies roughly between 0.3 and 0.7 times the electron cyclotron frequency. The whistler wave­forms are frequently punctuated by bipolar field structures interpretable as electron phase space holes. It has been sugges­ted1 that the whistlers are driven by (measured) electron temperature anisotropy and that the holes may arise from nonlinear electrostatic trapping associated with the whistlers.\nKinetic theory and simulations are used to study this interpretation in more detail and to explore an alternate explanation in which electron hole quasiparticles drive whistlers by Čerenkov emission, as recently found in reconnection simulations and explained by theory.2 Many features of the observations are consistent with the new explanation, including whistler phase velocities and frequencies.\n*Work supported by NASA MMS-IDS Grant\n1Deng, et al., J.

            "abstract": "New parameterizations of iron scavenging and hydrothermal vent sources have been explored using the Community Earth System Model – Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling Model (CESM-BEC). Implementation of different iron scavenging schemes help to better elucidate dominant removal processes controlling dissolved iron concentrations in the ocean. Inclusion of hydrothermal vent sources allows for a more comprehensive understanding of deep sea iron cycling. Scientific literature suggests that iron binding ligands are an important component of iron cycling in that they reduce iron losses to particle scavenging, and thus increase iron lifetime in the ocean. In this work, we explore three iron scavenging schemes: implicit ligands, explicit ligands at a fixed concentration, and dynamic explicit ligands. Dynamic explicit representation of iron-binding ligands has been included in the CESM-BEC to better understand the control ligands exert on dissolved iron concentrations. This scavenging scheme includes explicit ligands sources and sinks and dynamic cycling with iron. Ligand sources include remineralization of POC, DOC, and refractory DOC, with some reuse of ligands by phytoplankton. Ligand sinks include biological uptake, ligand degradation and particle scavenging. Hydrothermal vents have been shown to be an important source for the deep-sea iron budget. In this work, we use new data from GEOTRACES campaigns that sampled along hydrothermal ridges to better constrain the hydrothermal iron source in the model.",

            "abstract": "Responding effectively to the potential impacts of a changing climate requires individual behavior changes and a scientifically informed populace prepared to address climate-related issues on a community and policy level. This level of behavior change is a non-trivial educational and societal problem; however, behavior change is constrained or supported through a constellation of variables including scientific content knowledge, sociocultural beliefs and values, self-identifications, available infrastructure, economic barriers and opportunities. The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of student and family participation in energy conservation behaviors, and to analyze how a designed social change experience can support interest and motivation around taking action on climate change.\nIn this work, we implemented a Green Ninja Energy Design Challenge in middle school and university classrooms during Fall 2014. The Green Ninja is a superhero designed to inspire youth to take action on climate change. The Green Ninja Project provides tools such as humorous films and associated media products that help students take steps towards a more sustainable world. The project we are studying here focuses on engineering design principles and scientific content related to energy and provides an opportunity for students and families to measure and reduce household energy use while learning energy and climate science concepts. Students use an online energy-tracking tool that leverages PG&E Smart Meter technology to record their daily household energy over a period of time. Students are then challenged to use the data and what they’ve learned in class to holistically re-imagine and re-design their living space to reduce energy use, and continue to track their energy usage after implementing their new designs in their living spaces. We will report on attitudes toward, perceptions of and reported behavioral changes of both control and intervention student groups through surveys, focus groups and a number of home visits. ",

            "abstract": "This presentation discusses a new method to assess vulnerability and resilience strategies for stakeholders of coastal-dependent transportation infrastructure, such as seaports. Much coastal infrastructure faces increasing risk to extreme events resulting from sea level rise and tropical storms. As seen after Hurricane Sandy, natural disasters result in economic costs, damages to the environment, and negative consequences on resident’s quality of life. In the coming decades, tough decisions will need to be made about investment measures to protect critical infrastructure. Coastal communities will need to weigh the costs and benefits of a new storm barrier, for example, against those of retrofitting, elevating or simply doing nothing. These decisions require understanding the priorities and concerns of stakeholders. For ports, these include shippers, insurers, tenants, and ultimate consumers of the port cargo on a local and global scale, all of whom have a stake in addressing port vulnerabilities.Decision-makers in exposed coastal areas need tools to understand stakeholders concerns and perceptions of potential resilience strategies. For ports, they need answers to: 1) How will stakeholders be affected? 2) What strategies could be implemented to build resilience? 3) How effectively would the strategies mitigate stakeholder concerns? 4) What level of time and investment would strategies require? 5) Which stakeholders could/should take responsibility? Our stakeholder-based method provides answers to questions 1-3 and forms the basis for further work to address 4 and 5.\nTogether with an expert group, we developed a pilot study for stakeholders of Rhode Island's critical energy port, the Port of Providence. Our method uses a plausible extreme storm scenario with localized visualizations and a portfolio of potential resilience strategies. We tailor a multi-criteria decision analysis tool and, through a series of workshops, we use the storm scenario, resilience strategies, and decision tool to elicit perceptions and priorities of port stakeholders. Results provide new knowledge to assist decision-makers allocate investments of time, money, and staff resources. We intend for our method to be utilized in other port communities around Rhode Island and in other coastal states.",

            "abstract": "The devastating consequences of recent tsunami events in Indonesia (2004) and Japan (2011) have prompted a scientific response in assessing tsunami hazard even in regions where an apparent low risk or/and lack of complete historical tsunami record exists. Although a great uncertainty exists regarding the recurrence rate of large-scale tsunami events in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) due to sparsity of data, geological and historical evidences indicate that the most likely tsunami hazard could come from a submarine landslide triggered by a moderate earthquake. Under these circumstances, the assessment of the tsunami hazard in the region could be better accomplished by means of a probabilistic approach to identify tsunami sources.\nThis study aims to customize for the GOM a probabilistic hazard assessment based on recurrence rates of tsunamigenic submarine mass failures (SMFs). The Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) technique is employed utilizing matrix correlations for landslide parameters to incorporate the uncertainty related to location/water-depth and landslide dimension based on lognormal/normal distributions obtained from observed data. Along fixed transects over the continental slope of the GOM, slide angle of failure, sediment properties and seismic peak horizontal accelerations (PHA) are determined by publicly available data. These parameter values are used to perform slope stability analyses in randomly generated translational SMFs obtained from the MCS technique. Once the SMF is identified as tsunamigenic for a given PHA recurrence rate, a preliminary tsunami amplitude can be estimated using empirical formulations. Thus, the annual probability of a tsunamigenic SMF is determined by the joint probability of failure with the annual PHA.\nBy using the probabilistic approach, we identified tsunami sources with recurrence rates from few thousands to 10,000 years which produce extreme wave amplitudes for each transect. The most likely extreme tsunamigenic SMF events for a given transect are then modeled to determine hazard to specific coastal locations, including maximum runup heights, inundation depth/extent, and strong currents affecting communities and infrastructure, thus mitigating the impact of tsunamis according to the guidelines of the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program.",

            "abstract": "Partition coefficients (Kd) are critical in quantitative models of magmatic evolution. High-SiO2 rhyolites (HSR) are characterized by saturation in numerous phases, thus requiring a comprehensive Kd dataset, including both major and accessory minerals. While a large body of published Kd exists, most studies are limited to small suites of elements (e.g. REE) in few (2-3) minerals, using various methods, bulk compositions, and conditions. We use SEM-EDS and LA-ICP-MS analysis to determine crystal rim and unaltered glass compositions in a single sample of Peach Spring Tuff HSR, which reflect equilibration between crystals and melt at or near the time of eruption. We present Kd for 45 elements in 8 minerals: sanidine, plagioclase, biotite, amphibole, titanite, apatite, zircon, and chevkinite.\nWe show that titanite strongly partitions REE from melt, with significant preference for middle (MREE) over light (LREE) and heavy (HREE) REE. Apatite and amphibole share a similar MREE-enriched pattern but with absolute Kd up to ~2 orders of magnitude lower than titanite; while apatite displays a slight preference for LREE over HREE, amphibole shows a higher affinity for HREE than LREE. Zircon strongly partitions HREE, Hf, and U, with little affinity for LREE. Chevkinite concentrates LREE and Th significantly more than any other phase. Biotite Kd are generally <10, the highest being for transition metals and Ba. Both feldspars show strong preference for Sr, Ba, and Eu.\nWe find that our dataset is largely consistent with published studies that use similar (in-situ) techniques and compositions (HSR). We observe a large variation in other studies that we partly attribute to contamination from inclusions, particularly for compositions measured by whole-crystal methods. Our Kd suggest that accessory minerals play a dominant role in partitioning trace elements, and in particular they collectively control the distribution of REE and high field strength elements. Large ion lithophile elements (LILE), in contrast, are most dominantly influenced by feldspars, but if abundant, phases such as biotite and apatite may also influence LILE partitioning.",

            "abstract": "Seismic-reflection imaging has long been a mainstay in the oil and gas exploration community with mind boggling advancements in just the last decade, but its application to engineering, environmental, and groundwater problems has not seen the same level of utilization. A great deal of the problem lies in the many assumptions that are valid for deep exploration that are violated in the very complex near surface. Large channel systems with acquisition geometries conducive for both deep and shallow targets are many times assumed to be capable of extending the imaging depth window. In reality, constraints of the source and sensor/recording systems must be considered, where large powerful sources are needed to image exploration depths while low-energy, high-frequency sources are required for the shallow and thin targets in the near surface. Attempts to make one size fit all will result in artifacts that result in bogus images and characterizations in the shallow subsurface.\n\nNarrow optimum offsets, highly attenuative materials, extreme velocity variability, wavefield interference, and low signal-to-noise ratios provide an ideal breeding ground for the generation of artifacts on near-surface seismic-reflection data. With the cost of shallow reflection data being so high relative to other geophysical methods and invasive sampling, sometimes a single failure can hinder the growth in the use of the method. The method is extremely powerful and has the potential to provide vast quantities of information critical to understand the distributed hydrogeological and biogeochemical processes that elude borehole investigations. It is imperative that data be acquired in its rawest possible form and be processed with an eye to each operation. Cost savings sometimes result in one-size-fits-all acquisition and automated processing flows. Attention to detail and following signal from origination to characterization is essential.\n ",

The main challenge for future airborne sampling missions is operation with tight integration of physical and computational resources over wireless communication networks, in complex atmospheric conditions. The physical resources considered here include sensor platforms, particularly mobile Doppler radar and unmanned aircraft, the complex conditions in which they operate, and the region of interest. Autonomous operation requires distributed computational effort connected by layered wireless communication. Onboard decision-making and coordination algorithms can be enhanced by atmospheric models that assimilate input from physics-based models and wind fields derived from multiple sources. These models are generally too complex to be run onboard the aircraft, so they need to be executed in ground vehicles in the field, and connected over broadband or other wireless links back to the field. Finally, the wind field environment drives strong interaction between the computational and physical systems, both as a challenge to autonomous path planning algorithms and as a novel energy source that can be exploited to improve system range and endurance. Implementation details of a complete EA-DDDAS will be provided, along with preliminary flight test results targeting coherent boundary-layer structures.",

Measuring these parameters autonomously in the polar regions is especially challenging. To assess the accuracy of polar measurement networks, we established the Arctic Observing Experiment (AOX) test site in March 2013 at the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation and Meteorology (ARM) site in Barrow, Alaska. We deployed a myriad of data loggers and autonomous buoys, which represent most of the instruments that are commonly deployed by the International Arctic Buoy Programme (IABP) to measure temperature, air pressure and wind. Estimates of temperature over this area have also been analyzed from satellites (e.g., using the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ice-surface temperature (IST)) product, and can complement data from in-situ sensors and provide consistent measurements under clear-sky conditions. Preliminary results reveal that some of the buoys are susceptible to solar heating, icing can block barometers for short periods, and frosting may insulate air temperature sensors and freeze-lock anemometers. Some of these issues may be addressed by simply painting the buoys white to reduce solar heating of the buoys, and using better temperature shields and barometer ports. Nevertheless, frosting of ultrasonic and mechanical anemometers remains a significant challenge. These results will be useful to initiate a protocol to obtain accurate and consistent measurements from the IABP, the Arctic Observing Network (AON), the International Program for Antarctic Buoys, and the Southern Ocean Observing System to monitor polar environments.",

            "abstract": "Soil acidification and metal loading from industrial emissions can limit forest growth and carbon sequestration of Eastern U.S. forests. Tree growth may be limited if the mobility of trace metals found within forest soils is increased to nearly toxic levels due to soil acidification. The iron production boom in central Pennsylvania, which lasted roughly from 1850-1910, would have altered soil compositions of surrounding forests due to large amounts of coal and biomass fuel pollution depositions. The regional collapse of the iron industry by 1910 allows a unique opportunity to observe recovery rates of the surrounding forests and their associated soils over the last century. The pollution history of iron production and rate of soil recovery at this site was determined using tree-ring width measurements and dendrochemical analysis. Six prominent tree species were analyzed for cation and trace metal concentrations retained in the woody structure. Current soil cation and trace-metal concentrations were compared to recent tree-ring chemical compositions. The persistence of soil acidification was determined by observing the changes in major cation concentrations retained in the woody structure over time. This altered soil pH would have mobilized certain trace metals either deposited by the iron production pollution or found naturally in the soil. The effects of soil acidification in the local region are evident in the changes in trace metal concentrations due to increased bioavailability and decreased soil pH. The combined analysis of trace metals and major soil cations yields a specific pollution history and evidence of forest recovery rates from the iron production emissions in central Pennsylvania.",

The most reliable humidity measurements are made by radiosondes, but these do not resolve variability of less than a few hours, or spatial variability of less than tens of kilometers. Highly-resolved humidity measurements are particularly sparse within the Tropics. During the Dynamics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (DYNAMO) field deployment to the equatorial Indian Ocean during October 2011-Febuary 2012, a 21-channel 22-30 GHz radiometer was operated at five frequencies, alternately pointing vertically and scanning horizontally.

            "abstract": "The Rum Layered Intrusion (Scotland) was emplaced 60.53 ± 0.08 Ma ago [1], in response to the proto-Iceland plume [2]. The Unit 9 gabbro cumulates were successively intruded by olivine-phyric picritic sills. Reactive liquid flow produced clinopyroxene-poor gabbro, troctolite and dunite restite, and expelled melt crystallized to form gabbro with poikilitic clinopyroxene and Cr-spinel-rich anorthosite [3]. The Cr-spinel origin is strongly debated (e.g. [4]).\nWe have run one atmosphere, fO2-controlled equilibrium experiments of the Rum parental picritic parental liquid [5]. At NNO-0.8 conditions, Cr- spinel saturates from 1360°C, olivine from ~1330°C, plagioclase from 1240°C and clinopyroxene from 1220°C, systematically ~40°C above MELTS calculations. Natural Cr- spinel grains have a higher Cr/(Cr+Al+Fe3+) ratio (~0.51 to 0.03) than grains crystallized along the picrite NNO-0.8 liquid line of descent (0.38 to 0.06). Fe3+-rich spinel is abundant (~1 vol%) at NNO+1, and Al-rich spinel occurs as trace at NNO-3. In picrite-troctolite hybrid experiments, plagioclase (~An86) saturates from 1280°C and clinopyroxene from 1200°C. Al- spinel crystallizes at high temperature, and gets more Cr-rich upon cooling, reaching the highest measured Cr/(Cr+Al+Fe3+) ratio of ~0.44 at 1225°C, falling to 0.09 at 1200°C. Plagioclase and clinopyroxene stability plays a major role in spinel composition. Increasing the pressure or the parental magma water content would delay plagioclase saturation and result in spinel with lower Cr/Al ratio.\nWe deduce that Unit 9 peridotite, troctolite, anorthosite and also gabbro and poikilitic gabbro Cr-rich spinel did not crystallize from the Rum parental picritic liquid. Instead, they crystallized from a hybrid liquid produced by the mixing of invading picritic liquid with a partially molten plagioclase ± clinopyroxene -rich cumulate, leaving an olivine-rich residue/cumulate.\n[1] Hamilton et al.

            "abstract": "A novel and robust approach is presented that provides near real-time earthquake alarms for critical structures at distributed locations and large facilities using real-time estimation of response spectra obtained from near free-field motions. Influential studies dating back to the 1980s identified spectral response acceleration as a key ground motion characteristic that correlates well with observed damage in structures. Thus, monitoring and reporting on exceedance of spectra-based thresholds are useful tools for assessing the potential for damage to facilities or multi-structure campuses based on input ground motions only. With as little as one strong-motion station per site, this scalable approach can provide rapid alarms on the damage status of remote towns, critical infrastructure (e.g., hospitals, schools) and points of interests (e.g., bridges) for a very large number of locations enabling better rapid decision making during critical and difficult immediate post-earthquake response actions. Details on the novel approach are presented along with an example implementation for a large energy company.\nReal-time calculation of PSA exceedance and alarm dissemination are enabled with Bighorn, an extension module based on the Antelope software package that combines real-time spectral monitoring and alarm capabilities with a robust built-in web display server. Antelope is an environmental data collection software package from Boulder Real Time Technologies (BRTT) typically used for very large seismic networks and real-time seismic data analyses.\nThe primary processing engine produces continuous time-dependent response spectra for incoming acceleration streams. It utilizes expanded floating-point data representations within object ring-buffer packets and waveform files in a relational database. This leads to a very fast method for computing response spectra for a large number of channels. A Python script evaluates these response spectra for exceedance of one or more specified spectral limits, reporting any such exceedances via alarm packets that are put in the object ring-buffer for use by any alarm processes that need them. The web-display subsystem allows alert dissemination, interactive exploration, and alarm cancellation via the WWW.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zones are an important part of global carbon cycling and understanding the agent through which carbon is transported from the slab to the mantle wedge is key. Previous work has constrained the role of P, T, and melt-H2O content on CO2 solubility in a model, slab-derived rhyolitic partial melt [1, 2]. However, the effect of composition, i.e., the variation in cation ratios on CO2 solubility remains unknown. In particular, variation in Na/K, which can be highly variable in rhyolitic melts, can have a large effect on CO2 solubility [3, 4]. Here we investigate the effect of variable alkali ratio on the CO2 solubility in rhyolitic melt at sub-arc depths.\nCO2-saturated experiments were conducted at 3 GPa, 1300 °C on 3 rhyolite compositions, similar to low-degree partial melt of pelitic sediments, with fixed total alkalis (Na2O + K2O ~11.5 wt.%, volatile-free), but molar Na# = Na/(Na+K) varying from 0.15 to 0.88. Experimental run products show glasses with void spaces, suggesting the presence of CO2-rich fluid during experiments. The glasses were analyzed using EPMA and FTIR spectroscopy. All glasses show peaks for H2O at ~3540 cm-1. CO2 is dissolved as molecular CO2 (CO2mol.) at ~2350 cm-1 and carbonate (CO32-). Peaks for CO32- shift in position and shape: high Na# glass peaks are asymmetrical and closely spaced at ~1504 cm-1 and 1439 cm-1, while low Na# glass peaks are symmetrical and separated at ~1425 cm-1 and ~1530 cm-1.\nOur data show a strong positive correlation between Na# and CO2tot. contents from 1.0 wt.% for Na# = 0.15 to 3.0 wt.% for Na# = 0.88, at a fixed melt NBO/T ≈ 0.07. CO2mol./CO2tot. decreases with increasing Na#, from 0.74 to 0.09. These data suggest that Na has a larger effect than K on carbonate dissolution in rhyolitic melts. This is in agreement with the low P experiments on phonotephrite compositions [3], but in contrast with the observation for synthetic nephelinitic compositions [4], possibly indicating the effect of Na/K on CO2 solubility is influenced by other major element concentrations. Our results suggest that compositional variability in silicic melts must be considered to place constraints on the limit of CO2 transfer in subduction zones.\n[1] Duncan & Dasgupta (2014) GCA 124, 328-347.

The goal here is to share ideas, personal experiences, & the rewards, for both students & research professionals, of engaging in science education & public outreach.\nFlagstaff, AZ, “America’s First STEM Community,” has a uniquely rich community of organizations engaged in science & engineering research & innovation, including the Flagstaff Arboretum, Coconino Community College, Gore Industries, Lowell Observatory, Museum of Northern Arizona, National Weather Service, National Park Service, National Forest Service, Northern Arizona University, Northern Arizona Center for Entrepreneurship & Technology, US Geological Survey, US Naval Observatory, & Willow Bend Environmental Education Center. These organizations connect with the Northern Arizona community during the yearly Flagstaff Festival of Science – the third oldest science festival in the world – a 10 day long, free, science festival featuring daily public lectures, open houses, interactive science & technology exhibits, field trips, & in-school speaker programs.\nMany research scientists from these organizations participate in these activities, e.g., public lectures, open houses, & in-school speaker programs, & also volunteer as mentors for science & engineering themed clubs in local schools. An example of a novel, innovative program, developed by a local K-12 science teacher, is the “Scientists-in-the-Classroom” mentor program, which pairs all 7th & 8th grade students with a working research scientist for the entire school year. Led by the student & guided by the mentor, they develop a variety of science / technology projects, which the students then present at year’s end.\nFrom the perspective of an active research scientist, such outreach activities take little time & effort (~ 0.05 FTE), but pay large dividends in the long run, in inciting public support for science & inspiring the next generation of scientists & engineers.",

            "abstract": "Explaining the complex cause-and-effect relationships in hydrologic cycle can often be challenging in a classroom with the use of traditional teaching approaches. With the availability of observed rainfall, streamflow and other hydrology data on the internet, it is possible to provide the necessary tools to students to explore these relationships and enhance their learning experience. From this perspective, a new online educational tool, called RWater, is developed using Purdue University’s HUBzero technology. RWater’s unique features include: (i) its accessibility including the R software from any java supported web browser; (ii) no installation of any software on user’s computer; (iii) all the work and resulting data are stored in user’s working directory on RWater server; and (iv) no prior programming experience with R software is necessary. In its current version, RWater can dynamically extract streamflow data from any USGS gaging station without any need for post-processing for use in the educational modules. By following data-driven modules, students can write small scripts in R and thereby create visualizations to identify the effect of rainfall distribution and watershed characteristics on runoff generation, investigate the impacts of landuse and climate change on streamflow, and explore the changes in extreme hydrologic events in actual locations. Each module contains relevant definitions, instructions on data extraction and coding, as well as conceptual questions based on the possible analyses which the students would perform. In order to assess its suitability in classroom implementation, and to evaluate users’ perception over its utility, the current version of RWater has been tested with three different groups: (i) high school students, (ii) middle and high school teachers; and (iii) upper undergraduate/graduate students. The survey results from these trials suggest that the RWater has potential to improve students’ understanding on various relationships in hydrologic cycle, leading towards effective dissemination of hydrology education ranging from K-12 to the graduate level.

In the same period, the number of local residents only increased 20% (1088 to1362) but the visitors did in 50% from ca. 200,000 to ca. 300,000. In this coastal zone, the phreatic acts as a storage of nutrients and pollutants from sources related to human activity, thus having a chronic run-off towards the reef, with acute episodes during the rainy season, specially during the anomalous rainy season of 2013. Using videotransects for monitoring the benthic reef components, changes were detected: from 2000 to 2013 the algae cover increased 166%, the reef condition and the reef structure indexes decreased in 50%, and coral diseases incidence increased 25% after a spike increment of 150% in 2010. The role of anthropogenic-stress indicators (population, modified land area, nutrients) was explored along reef condition indicators (reef structure and diversity indexes, topographic complexity, benthic cover and coral diseases incidence) via spatial analysis and multivariate statistics. Spatial patterns of the change in reef condition derived from high-resolution satellite imagery also provided insight for the stressors analysis and their relationships along the study period. Stress indicators (land-modified area and population) are correlated to decreases in coral cover and in reef structure. Direct stressors as sedimentation, nutrients and pollutants seem to be related to the decrease in overall reef condition, although time-series data is lacking; the contextual interpretation of their effects, paired with benthic condition characteristics suggest a strong relationship between these stressors and the decrease in the condition of the reef.",

            "abstract": "Although most freshwater resources are used in agriculture, a greater amount of energy is consumed per unit of water supply for urban areas. Therefore, efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of water in cities, including the energy embedded within household uses, can be an order of magnitude larger than for other water uses. This characteristic of urban water systems creates a promising opportunity to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, particularly given rapidly growing urbanization worldwide.\nBased on a previous Water-Energy-CO2 emissions model for household water end uses, this research introduces a probabilistic two-stage optimization model considering technical and behavioral decision variables to obtain the most economical strategies to minimize household water and water-related energy bills given both water and energy price shocks. Results show that adoption rates to reduce energy intensive appliances increase significantly, resulting in an overall 20% growth in indoor water conservation if household dwellers include the energy cost of their water use.\nTo analyze the consequences on a utility-scale, we develop an hourly water-energy model based on data from East Bay Municipal Utility District in California, including the residential consumption, obtaining that water end uses accounts for roughly 90% of total water-related energy, but the 10% that is managed by the utility is worth over $12 million annually.\nOnce the entire end-use + utility model is completed, several demand-side management conservation strategies were simulated for the city of San Ramon. In this smaller water district, roughly 5% of total EBMUD water use, we found that the optimal household strategies can reduce total GHG emissions by 4% and utility’s energy cost over $70,000/yr. Especially interesting from the utility perspective could be the “smoothing” of water use peaks by avoiding daytime irrigation that among other benefits might reduce utility energy costs by 0.5% according to our assessment.",

            "abstract": "Today, the CALIOP lidar and CloudSat radar have collected more than seven years of observations, and will\nhopefully still operate in 2016, after the EarthCARE-ATLID/CPR launch. Lidars and Radars in space provide\ncutting edge information on the detailed vertical structure of clouds: a key element for both the evaluation of\nthe description of clouds in climate models, and the survey of the clouds inter-annual evolution in various\nclimatic conditions (El Nino, variation of North Atlantic Oscillations, polar regions, etc). For this purpose,\nthe observations collected by CALIOP and by ATLID as well as CloudSat and EarthCARE CPR need to be\nmerged into a long-term (15 years) cloud climatology.\nHere, we examine the possibility of building such a climatology, with the aim of defining its accuracy and\nrelevance for cloud inter-annual studies. We examine the differences between the instruments (wavelengths,\nsatellite’s altitudes, telescope fields of view, multiple scattering processes, spatial resolutions) and their\nability to detect the same clouds consistently. Then, we define a set of cloud detection thresholds for ATLID,\nCALIOP, CloudSat and EarthCARE-CPR and test against synthetic cloud scenes (cirrus and shallow\ncumulus) over small areas (about 200km) produced by a lidar and radar instrument simulator (ECSIM)\nrunning on Large Eddy Simulations. Doing so, we verify that the fourth instruments will be able to detect the\nsame clouds despite their differences (e.g. their sensitivities to noise). Finally, we use the COSP lidar and\nradar simulator to predict the global scale cloud cover that ATLID, CALIOP, CloudSat and EarthCARE CPR\nwould observe if they were overflying the same atmosphere predicted by a GCM. Our results suggest that a\nmerged CALIOP/ATLID and CloudSat/CPR cloud climatology could be to be useful for clouds inter-annual\nstudies, if the post-launch sensitivity of EarthCARE instruments is in line with what is predicted today.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is typically the predominant form of carbon exported from headwater streams, it therefore represents a major carbon export from Arctic catchments. The projected deepening of thaw depth in permafrost regions, due to an increase in air temperature, may have a significant effect on the amount of DOC exported from these systems. However, quantification of the impacts of climate driven changes on DOC export are still highly uncertain. Understanding the processes controlling DOC export is therefore crucial in predicting the potential impact of projected environmental changes. The controls of DOC production and transport are heavily influenced by soil and vegetation, which are highly variable across the landscape. To completely understand these systems information regarding spatial variability of plants, soils and thaw depths must be taken into account. In this study sub-weekly sampling of DOC was undertaken throughout 2014 in a headwater (<1 km2) catchment in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Spatial surveys of soil properties, active thaw depth and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were collected and used in conjunction with conservative stable water isotopes tracers and major ions to understand sources, flow pathways and timing of DOC exports from the catchment. Stable isotope tracers act as fingerprints of water allowing sources and pathways to be assessed. Observations reveal changing DOC concentrations throughout the season as the active layer deepens and the connectivity of the soils to the stream network throughout the catchment increases. Linking the DOC data with the conservative tracer response improves the identification of carbon pathways and fluxes from the soils; preliminary analysis indicates DOC is being delivered via deeper more mineral soils later in the season. The results indicate that the active layer depth has a strong influence on the amount of DOC exported from the system, independent of the amount of carbon stored in these deeper soils.",

The development of these types of guidance systems will rely mainly on the Canadian Precipitation Analysis system (CaPA), the Canadian Land Data Assimilation system (CaLDAS) and the deterministic weather prediction system using the GEM atmospheric model and grund-based real-time flow observations. Preliminary results of our MESH land-surface hydrology scheme forced by GEM forecasted precipitation were evaluated for the specific flood event in and around the headwaters of the Eastern flowing tributaries of the Rocky Mountains. Discussion on model performance, calibration of important water balance and routing parameters along with the feasibility of operationalizing these systems with real-time observational networks is discussed.\n ",

We know now that our best available models are not adequate for many sought after purposes. To throw some light on the maximum fidelity expected from a given generation of models, and thereby aid both policy making and model development, we can test the weaknesses of a model as a dynamical system to get an informed idea of its potential applicability at various lead times. Shadowing times reflect the duration on which a GCM reflects the observed dynamics of the Earth; extracting the shortcomings of the model which limit shadowing times allows informed speculation regarding the fidelity of the model in the future. More specifically, by identifying the reasons models cannot shadow we learn the relevant phenomena limiting model fidelity, we can then look at the time scales on which feedbacks on the system (which are not active in the model) are likely to result in model irrelevance. The methodology is developed in the “low dimensional laboratory” of relatively simple dynamical systems, for example Lorenz 95 systems. The results are presented in Lorenz 95 systems as well as GCMs. There are severe limits on the light shadowing experiments can shine on GCM predictions. Never the less, they appear to be one of the brightest lights we can shine to illuminate the likely fidelity of GCM extrapolations into the future.",

Samples will be extracted as deep as 2 meters below the martian surface to minimize effects of radiation and oxidation on organic materials. The core of the MOMA instrument is a dual source UV laser desorption / ionization (LDI) and pyrolysis gas chromatography (pyr-GC) ion trap mass spectrometer (ITMS) which provides the unique capability to characterize a broad range of compounds, including both of volatile and non-volatile species. Samples which undergo GC-ITMS analysis may be submitted to a derivatization process, consisting of the reaction of the sample components with specific reactants (MTBSTFA [1], DMF-DMA [2] or TMAH [3]) which increase the volatility of complex organic species.\nWith the goal to optimize this instrumentation, and especially the GC-ITMS coupling, a series of tests is currently being carried out with prototypes of MOMA instrumentation and with the ETU models wich is similar to the flight model. The MOMA oven and tapping station are also part of these end-to-end experiments. Qualitative and quantitative tests has been done on gas, liquid and solid samples. The results obtained demonstrate the current status of the end-to-end performance of the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry mode of operation. Both prototypes individually meet the performance requirements, but this work particularly demonstrates the capabilities of the critical GC-MS interface.\n",

            "abstract": "The expansion and development of human infrastructure along the coastline of the Pacific Northwest has profound consequences for the habitability and general ecological health of coastal ecosystems. Coos County, one of the most economically critical regions of the Oregon Coast, experienced vigorous timber harvest activity in the aftermath of WWII that declined in the last several decades. This period of extractive land use may have drastically altered the sediment supply in the major catchments of the Coos and Millicoma Rivers and lead to variations in sediment flux into the Coos Bay estuary. Accurate sediment flux histories are critical data for deciphering the relative importance of climate and land use factors such as logging and road construction on sediment production. Reduction of root reinforcement following timber harvest increases the likelihood of shallow landsliding and debris flows. In addition, forest roads increase sediment production due to overland flow and entrainment of fine sediments on hydrologically connected roads. Although these processes have been documented in small watersheds, their compounded effect on estuaries and coastal settings has not been well documented. We use Pb-210 activities derived from sediment cores taken at various locations in the Coos Bay estuary to establish temporal variations in sediment accumulation rates (SARs). Our cores will also be analyzed to assess dissolved oxygen and other proxies for ecosystem functioning. By correlating these SARs with quantitative metrics for timber extraction rate such as board feet per year and qualitative evaluations from historical photos, we propose to document the cumulative effect of historic forest practices. The temporal resolution provided by this technique should allow us to link changes in estuarine sedimentation to changes in land use as well as climatic triggers such as storms. The conclusions of this study will add valuable information regarding the ultimate impact of industry on coastal habitats.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is a subject of concern for the inhabitants of the semi-arid zones because water needs are greatly increasing with population growth. For the Middle East region, the karstic geology of Lebanon with its high and steep mountains makes it a real water tower and promotes an essential snow cover. Studies carried out on snow water equivalent reserve [1] remain still insufficient for the development of continuous monitoring. Modeling the lebanese high plateau made of sinkholes and undulations eases the computations of land capacity for snow retention. It is therefore an interesting testing ground for snow volumes calculations [2]. To improve previous attempts, a research project focuses on snow melting processes. It uses the cessation date of snow melt water infiltration which is crucial in the precocity or the delay of low water level [3]; and geomatics to determinate the major factor for the evaluation of storaged water (spatial or vertical extension of snow cover). The project studies the sensitivity of temporal snow melting variabilities to quantities of snow precipitations and climatic conditions. Field measurements were collected at very high topographic precision [4] in a specific sinkhole and were used to create volumes models for measuring indicators such as: snow water equivalent; melting speed in relation to climatic data; forecast of completed meting date; correlations with springs discharges. Other methodological procedures take into account snow depressions (sinkholes and ripples) capacity retention; daily webcam images to monitor the accumulation and melt rate and remotely sensed Pleiades stereoscopic images to create snow cover elevation model at the time of acquisition.\n[1]Corbane et al., 2004 ; 2005 ; Corbane, 2002 ; Bernier et al., 2001, 2003 ; Shaban et al., 2004; Aouad et al., 2004, Aouad-Rizk et al., 2005 ; Gédéon el al., 2004\n[2] Somma et al ; 2014\n[3] Drapeau et al ; 2013\n[4] Drapeau et al, 2013; Somma et Drapeau, 2011 ; Somma et Luxey, 2006",

            "abstract": "The Húsavík-Flatey Fault (HFF), which is a part of the Tjörnes Fracture Zone (TFZ) in North Iceland, is a ~100 km-long dextral strike-slip fault. The fault has produced many magnitude 6-7 earthquakes in the past; however, the historical earthquake record in the region is mostly limited to the past 300 years. Almost 80% of the HFF is offshore. At the on-land part of the fault, glacial morphology and lack of well-developed fluvial systems limit the number of sites having faulting-related sedimentation, which is required for conventional paleoseismic trenching. Hence, Botnsvatn Lake, located in a small pull-apart basin close to the south-eastern end of the HFF, is a valuable site to study past earthquakes in the region. Several piston cores, maximum 4.1 m-long, were collected from the lake in 2013. The physical and geochemical properties of the sediments were investigated by means of magnetic susceptibility, gamma-ray density, total carbon/nitrogen/sulphur content, grain-size distribution analysis, radiographic images on u-channels and micro-XRF scanning. The chronology of the sediments was constructed by four radiocarbon dates and 62 tephra layers. The well-documented tephrochronology in Iceland provides a robust age control along the cores. Eight sedimentary events have been detected in the sedimentary sequence of Botnsvatn Lake. Some of the events can be attributed to increased sediment influx, probably due to seismically-triggered landslides in the catchment, while the other events appear as soft sediment deformations. The youngest event in the sequence temporally coincides with the historical 1872 AD earthquake (M=6.5) in the region. In the light of preliminary interpretations, “at least” eight earthquakes took place during the last 2400 years. In the coming months, the Botnsvatn sedimentary record will be compared in detail with the paleoclimatological records in the region in order to disentangle the climatic and seismic signals.",

            "abstract": "The ratio of non-bridging oxygen to tetrahedrally coordinated cation (NBO/T) represents the degree of polymerization and is one well-known way of structurally categorizing amorphous silicates. A number of studies show that at ambient temperature ultrasonic sound velocities (both longitudinal and transverse) of SiO2 (Zha et al., 1994; Yokoyama et al., 2010; Kono et al., 2011) and other polymerized silicate glasses, including sodium disilicate which we recently studied (Yu et al., in prep), decrease with increasing pressure and reach minima between 2-3GPa, above which the velocities turn around and display a normal, positive pressure dependence. To systematically study the velocity profile of amorphous silicates and their relationship with the NBO/T value and detailed local structure, synthesized sodium disilicate glass was loaded into a Paris-Edinburgh (PE) cell to investigate pressure induced structure change using X-ray total scattering and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis at the GSECARS 13-ID-C beamline at the APS. X-ray diffraction data of the glass sample has been collected up to 3GPa at ambient temperature by utilizing a 60KeV monochromatic X-ray beam. We used a new multi-channel collimator (MCC; cf., Mezouar et al., 2002) to effectively remove unwanted scattering signal from the surrounding pressure media, and interfaced the Paris-Edinburgh cell (PEC) with the general-purpose diffractometer to decrease data collection time for glass structure measurement by more than one order of magnitude comparing with energy dispersive X-ray diffraction method. Results of our recent silicate glass structure measurements will be presented.

            "abstract": "Ancient volcanic deposits on terrestrial planetary bodies preserve the earliest record of planetary evolution, revealing important information about both the interior evolution and the surface modification history of planetary bodies. On the Moon, ancient volcanic deposits are referred to as cryptomaria and are basalt deposits that have been obscured by impact basin ejecta. As a result, cryptomaria appear as smooth high-albedo plains. This physical appearance can easily be confused with other formations such as the Cayley Plains, hypothesized to have formed from the ponding of impact basin ejecta into topographic lows.\nThe difficulty in differentiating between cryptomaria and the Cayley Plains has led to the development of several recognition criteria. A high concentration of dark-halo impact craters (DHCs), a mafic enhancement in regolith, and an intermediate albedo are all different criteria used to positively identify cryptomaria. DHCs are small impact craters <10 km in diameter that excavate low-albedo basaltic material from beneath high-albedo surface materials. In this study we used multiple lunar datasets (M3, LOLA, LROC, Diviner) to map the distribution of cryptomaria and to determine the mineralogy of the identified cryptomare deposits.\nOf the 27 regions analyzed, 20 cryptomaria were positively identified. All identified cryptomaria cluster on the nearside, within large impact basins and along the periphery of younger mare basalts. The largest cryptomaria are confined to the interior of ancient impact basins (e.g., Schiller-Zucchius). Including cryptomaria, the total surface area of the Moon covered by mare basalts has increased by ~2%. After identification, M3 spectra collected from DHCs were modeled using the Modified Gaussian Model and indicate that the cryptomaria are basalts and have the same mineralogy as exposed maria in the same study region. Crater counts conducted on the largest cryptomaria produce minimum model age estimates between 3.8 and 4.0 Ga. This, combined with the close association between cryptomaria and exposed maria, suggests that the dated cryptomaria formed just prior to this period of time and imply that the process controlling the distribution of mare basalts was in place near this time in lunar history.",

            "abstract": "Saline fluids with moderate concentrations have been sampled and reported in the Armorican basement at the regional scale (northwestern France). The horizontal and vertical distributions of high chloride concentrations (60-1400mg/L) at the regional scale support the marine origin and provide constraints on the age of these saline fluids. The current distribution of fresh and “saline” groundwater at depth is the result mostly of processes occurring at geological timescales - seawater intrusion processes followed by fresh groundwater flushing -, and only slightly of recent anthropogenic activities. In this study, we focus on seawater intrusion mechanisms in continental aquifers. We argue that one of the most efficient processes in macrotidal environments is the gravity-driven downconing instability below coastal salinized rivers. 2‑D numerical experiments have been used to quantify this process according to four main parameter types: (1) the groundwater system permeability, (2) the salinity degree of the river, (3) the river width and slope, and (4) the tidal amplitude. A general expression of the salinity inflow rates have been derived, which has been used to estimate groundwater salinization rates in Brittany, given the geomorphological and environmental characteristics (drainage basin area, river widths and slopes, tidal range, aquifer permeability). We found that downconing below coastal rivers entail very high saline rates, indicating that this process play a major role in the salinization of regional aquifers. This is also likely to be an issue in the context of climate change, where sea-level rise is expected.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty in the magnitude and spatial variations of forest carbon density in tropical regions is due to under sampling of forest structure from inventory plots and the lack of regional allometry to estimate the carbon density from structure. Here we quantify the variation of tropical forest structure by using more than 2.5 million measurements of canopy height from systematic sampling of Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) satellite observations between 2004 to 2008 and examine the climate and edaphic variables influencing the variations. We used top canopy height of GLAS footprints (~ 0.25 ha) to grid the statistical mean and 90 percentile of samples at 0.5 degrees to capture the regional variability of large trees in tropics. GLAS heights were also aggregated based on a stratification of tropical regions using soil, elevation, and forest types. Both approaches provided consistent patterns of statistically dominant large trees and the least heterogeneity, both as strong drivers of distribution of high biomass forests. Statistical models accounting for spatial autocorrelation suggest that climate, soil and spatial features together can explain more than 60% of the variations in observed tree height information, while climate-only variables explains about one third of the first-order changes in tree height. Soil basics, including physical compositions such as clay and sand contents, chemical properties such as PH values and cation-exchange capacity, as well as biological variables such as organic matters, all present independent but statistically significant relationships to tree height variations. The results confirm other landscape and regional studies that soil fertility, geology and climate may jointly control a majority of the regional variations of forest structure in pan-tropics and influencing both biomass stocks and dynamics. Consequently, other factors such as biotic and disturbance regimes, not included in this study, may have less influence on regional variations but strongly mediate landscape and small-scale forest structure and dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The Magallanes–Austral Basin (MAB) is preserved along a >1000 kilometer north–south trending outcrop belt in the southern Patagonia region of Argentina and Chile. The stratigraphic evolution of the MAB has been well documented in the Chilean sector of the basin, however its along-strike counterpart in Argentina is poorly constrained. We present new stratigraphic and geochronologic data from the early basin fill (Aptian–Turonian) from the Argentine sector (49–51°S) of the MAB to document spatial variability in stratigraphic facies and timing of deposition. The initiation of the MAB is marked by the transition from mudstone to coarse-clastic deposition which is characterized by the consistent presence of thick sandstone beds. These sandy facies are interpreted to represent turbidity current deposits in a submarine fan system. This study documents that such facies are present as far north as El Chalten, Argentina (49°S), indicating that facies-equivalent rocks can be traced along-strike for at least 5 degrees of latitude, based on correlation with strata as far south as the Cordillera Darwin (54°S). Detrital zircon U-Pb ages (477 grains from 6 samples) from sandstone within the Argentine sector reveal similar trends to those documented in the Chilean sector. Age populations primarily consist of Aptian–Campanian (126–75 Ma) arc-related grains as well as Cambrian–Triassic ages (600–200 Ma) derived from the East Andean Metamorphic Complex. Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous ages (200–126) representing rift-phase volcanism and early arc magmatism, typically account for less than 5% of the ages. Finally, 6 new U-Pb ages from ash beds, coupled with maximum depositional ages from detrital zircon populations, reveal a southward younging trend in depositional ages. Interpreted ages range from 115 Ma to 95 Ma in the northern sector, but based on previous studies, are not older than 92 Ma and 89 Ma in the central and southern sectors, respectively. The diachronous delivery of coarse detritus into the basin may reflect orogen-parallel variations in pre-existing structures and crustal composition from the earlier tectonic history of this region. These results highlight the influence of tectonic inheritance on patterns of foreland basin initiation in Cordilleran-style margins.",

While experimental work has provided valuable insights into its fine-scale drivers and implications, the contribution of shrub reproductive characteristics to their spatial patterns is poorly understood at broader scales. Building upon our previous work in river valleys in northern Alaska, we developed a C#-based spatially-explicit model that simulates historic landscape-scale shrub establishment between the 1970s and the late 2000s on a yearly time-step while accounting for parameters relating to different reproduction modes (clonal development with and without the “mass effect” and short-distance dispersal), as well as the presence and absence of the interaction of hydrologic constraints using the topographic wetness index. We examined these treatments on floodplains, valley slopes, and interfluves in the Ayiyak, Colville, and Kurupa River valleys. After simulating 30 landscape realizations using each parameter combination, we quantified the spatial characteristics (patch density, edge density, patch size variability, area-weighted shape index, area-weighted fractal dimension index, and mean distance between patches) of the resulting shrub patches on the simulation end date using FRAGSTATS. We used Principal Components Analysis to determine which treatments produced spatial characteristics most similar to those observed in the late 2000s. Based upon our results, we hypothesize that historic shrub expansion in northern Alaska has been driven in part by clonal reproduction with the “mass effect” or short-distance dispersal (< 5 m). The interactive effect of hydrologic characteristics, however, is less clear. These hypotheses may then be tested in future work involving field observations. Given the potential that climate change may facilitate a shift from a clonal to a sexual reproductive strategy, this model may facilitate predictions regarding future Arctic vegetation patterns.",

Particularly the Himalayan mountain forests has been degrading since the 1850s, in the early years of British administration. Consistent country-wide and local level data are needed to show the patterns and processes of degradation as a basis for developing management strategies to halt degradation and ensure long-term sustainability. Realizing the need for developing consistent national and regional databases in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region, with adequate spatial and temporal resolutions to be used by resource managers for informed decision making, time series land cover maps were developed for 1990, 2000, and 2010 based on the Landsat images. Considering forest sector as a primary user, a special attention was given to forest cover interpretation and relevant professional from national forestry institutions of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan were closely engaged in developing standardized data products. With the use of consistent datasets and interpretation methods, this study provides first systematic assessment on forest cover distribution and change patterns during last two decades in these countries. At the same time, the results compiled at sub-district administrative unit, may facilitate institutions in developing appropriate forest conservation strategies, ecosystem vulnerability assessment and ecosystem services valuation at local level. To promote such usages, national forestry institutions are being closely engaged in a number of capacity building activities at national and regional level. In context of Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) initiatives, these datasets are also being evaluated to be considered as baseline for deforestation and degradation rates in the respective countries. To promote easy and open access, a web system was developed which provides functions to understand land cover dynamics in relations to country's ecological distribution and administrative structure.",

The proposed IVS technique termed, bootstrap rank-ordered conditional mutual information for real-valued signals (brCMIr), is multivariate, nonlinear, nonparametric, and probabilistic. The brCMIr method was tested in a case study using water demand time series for two urban water supply system pressure zones in Ottawa, Canada to select the most important historical records for use with each machine learning technique in order to generate forecasts of average and peak UWD for the respective pressure zones at lead times of 1, 3, and 7 days ahead. All lead time forecasts are computed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as the base model, and are compared with Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR), as well as a novel machine learning method for UWD forecasting: the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Results from one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey Honesty Significance Difference (HSD) tests indicate that the LSSVR and ELM models are the best machine learning techniques to pair with brCMIr. However, ELM has significant computational advantages over LSSVR (and ANN) and provides a new and promising technique to explore in UWD forecasting.",

Experimental work was conducted in a small oscillatory flow tunnel at the Sediment Dynamics Laboratory at the Naval Research Laboratory, Stennis Space Center. Six different monochromatic oscillatory forcings, three with velocity asymmetry and three without, were used to investigate sand ripple dynamics using a unimodal grain size distribution with D50=0.65 mm. The experiments represent an extension of previous work using bimodal grain size distributions. A DSLR camera with a 180-degree fisheye lens collected images of the sediment bed profile every 2 seconds to resolve changes in ripple geometries and migration rates resulting from the different flow conditions for over 127 hours (229,388 images). Matlab © algorithms undistorted the fisheye images and quantified the ripple geometries, wavelengths, heights, and migration rates as a function of flow forcing. The mobility number was kept nearly constant by increasing and decreasing the semi-excursion amplitude and the wave frequency, respectively. We observed distinct changes in ripple geometry and migration rate for the pair of oscillatory forcings having nearly identical mobility numbers. The results suggested that the commonly used mobility number might not be appropriate to characterize ripple geometry or migration rates.",

            "abstract": "Regional and continental scale groundwater flow models derive aquifer permeability distributions from datasets based on hydraulic tests and calibrated local and regional flow models, however, much of this data does not account for barrier/conduit effects of fault zones, local and regional geothermal flow cells, and other fault-controlled flow systems. In this study we researched and compiled fault zone permeability and conceptual permeability models in different geologic settings from published multidisciplinary literature (structural- and hydro-geology, engineering geology of tunnels and mines, and geothermal projects among others). The geospatial database focuses on data-rich regions such as North America, Europe, and Japan. Regionalization of the dominant conceptual models of fault zones was regionalized based on geological attributes and tested conceptually with simple numerical models, to help incorporate the effect of fault zones on regional to continental flow models.\nResults show that for large regional and continental scale flow modeling, the fault zone data can be generalized by geology to determine the relative importance of fault conduits vs fault barriers, which can be converted to effective anisotropy ratios for large scale flow, although local fault-controlled flow cells in rift zones require appropriate upscaling. The barrier/conduit properties of fault zones are present in all regions and rock types, and the barrier effect must be properly conceptualized in large scale flow models. The fault zone data from different geologic disciplines have different biases (e.g. outcrop studies, deep drillhole tests, tunnels, etc.) depending on scale of hydraulic tests. Finally, the calibrated recharge estimates for fault controlled flow systems may be lower than for unfaulted flow systems due to predominant barrier (regional anisotropy or permeability reduction), suggesting a “scaling effect” on recharge estimates.",

            "abstract": "Nares Strait is a 30-40 km wide channel between northern Greenland and Canada where we collected time series observation of velocity, subsurface pressure, and salinity from 2003 to 2009 to quantify volume and freshwater flux. Direct sub-surface observations are augmented by ice velocity and dynamical constraints to interpolate observations to the surface. Measurements indicate a mean volume flux of 1.0 +/- 0.08 Sv (Sv=10^6 m^3/s) and a mean freshwater flux of 62 mSv from the Arctic Ocean through Nares Strait to the south. About 20% of the volume and 50% of the freshwater flux reside in the top 30-m of the water column.\nFlux variability peaks at a 20-day time scale and correlates strongly with along-channel pressure gradients which explain more than 80% of the flux variance. Seasonal volume flux variations have an amplitude of about 0.1 Sv and a phase that result in maximal and minimal southward transports in March and November, respectively. Ice cover is usually land-fast in March and mobile in November suggesting that the frictional dynamics in a surface layer under the ice are secondary in importance to the along-channel pressure gradient that peaks in early spring with high sea level in the Arctic and low sea level in the more southerly Baffin Bay.\nObserved changes in the duration of land-fast ice conditions impact ocean stratification and flux through Nares Strait. For example, volume and freshwater fluxes increased by 50% and 100% in years when the ice was mobile almost year-round from 2006 through 2010 as compared to the 2003 to 2006 period when the ice was not mobile for more than 6 month per year on average. Local winds explain almost 50% of the variance during the 2007 to 2009 period of year-round mobile ice when a southern ice arch did not form. This ice arch returned to southern Nares Strait in 2011 resulting in long periods of land-fast ice cover and, we hypothesize, reduced ocean flux.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is predicted to increase the average salinity of the San Francisco Bay-Delta watershed as sea levels rise and alpine snow volume decreases. Wetland soil microbial communities are responsible for cycling greenhouse gases and their response to climate change will heavily influence whether increasing salinity will have a negative or positive effect on the net greenhouse gas budgets of wetlands. To better understand the underlying factors determining the balance of greenhouse gas flux in wetland soils, we targeted the microbial communities along a salinity gradient ranging from freshwater to full seawater in the San Francisco Bay-Delta region. Using DNA and RNA sequencing, coupled with greenhouse gas monitoring, we sampled sixteen sites capturing a range of wetland plant types and restoration states. We determined a suite of soil biogeochemical parameters including moisture, carbon and nutrient contents, pH, sulfate, chloride, and trace metal concentrations. The results of our microbial diversity survey (16S rRNA gene Illumina tag sequencing) showed that salinity and sampling location were the primary drivers of belowground microbial community composition. Freshwater wetland soils, with lower sulfate concentrations, produced more methane than saline sites and we found a parallel increase in the relative abundance of methanogen populations in the high-methane samples. Surprisingly, wetland restoration status did not significantly alter microbial community composition, despite orders of magnitude greater methane flux in restored wetlands compared to reference sites. Deeper metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing in a restored wetland allowed us to further evaluate the roles of methanogen abundance and activity in shaping soil methane production. Our study links belowground microbial communities with their greenhouse gas production, providing a mechanistic microbial framework for assessing climate change feedbacks in wetland soils resulting from sea level rise.",

            "abstract": "Boreal wildfires are a major source of carbonaceous aerosols. Emissions from wildfires in Alaska represent ~ 33% of all open biomass combustion emissions of black carbon (BC) in the United States. BC contributes to atmospheric warming and accelerates melting of ice and snow. With fire frequency and burned area projected to increase in boreal regions, BC has the potential to become an important positive feedback to climate change. Quantifying the emissions, constraining the sources and better understanding the transportation patterns of BC to the polar regions are therefore critical for constraining the strength of this feedback. We present results from direct measurements of BC from wildfires in Alaska during the summer of 2013 collected as a part of NASA’s Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) campaign. Fine aerosol particulate matter (PM2.5) was collected at two locations: Caribou-Poker Creek Research Watershed and Delta Junction Agricultural and Forestry Experimental Site. Using a Sunset OCEC analyzer, we separated BC from organic carbon aerosols, measured concentrations and analyzed the radiocarbon (14C) content with accelerator mass spectrometry. We also analyzed the total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) elemental and stable isotope composition of the bulk PM2.5 with EA-IRMS. We compared the temporal dynamics of BC concentrations and isotopic composition with active fire/thermal anomaly information from MODIS. Our results show that boreal forest fire emissions in interior Alaska increased BC concentrations by up to an order of magnitude above background levels. The mean Δ14C value of fire-emitted BC was 120‰ with a range of +99‰ to +149‰ after correcting for contributions from background BC. This range was in good agreement with measurements of the depth of burn in soil organic carbon layers from interior wildland fires, and Δ14C profiles. High fire periods also corresponded to elevated C:N ratios. The δ15N of the aerosols was significantly elevated during high fire periods, and was likely influenced by the depth of burning in the organic soil horizons and isotope fractionation during combustion. Direct measurements of fire-emitted BC and PM2.5 composition provide independent insight into the potential effects of a changing boreal forest fire regime on the climate system.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the temperature distribution along an active subducting plate interface can improve our understanding of subduction zone dynamics and our ability to estimate seismic hazards. The ‘locking’ mechanism on the fault appears temperature dependent, where the up-dip (shallow) limit of the seismic zone ranges from 100-150°and the down-dip (deep) limit is a transition zone between 350°C and 450°C. Heat flow measurements provide the most direct method for resolving the subduction zone thermal environment. The Cascadia Subduction Zone currently poses the single largest seismic hazard to population centers within the Northwest United States. In August 2013, heat flow data were collected offshore Grays Harbor, WA, along a profile perpendicular to the accretionary wedge. Measurements extend seaward of the Cascadia deformation front and landward over the accretionary wedge and are collocated along line 4 of the 2012 R/V Langseth multi-channel seismology (MCS) profiles. These data consist of 43 long probe (3 m) measurements, 204 ROV Jason II probe (0.6 m) and 27 thermal blanket heat flow measurements Preliminary results indicate a mean heat flow of 110 mW/m2 over the incoming plate, a decrease to 30 mW/m2 at the first deformation ridge, then heat flow varying between 90 to 120 mW/m2 over the lower accretionary wedge. BSR derived heat flow decreases from 90 mW/m2 at the deformation front to 60 mW/m2 60 km landward and up the accretionary wedge. Regionally the heat flow values are consistent with the subduction of a thickly sedimented and young oceanic plate and local heat flow variations likely reflect advective and conductive heat transfer within the shallow portion of the accretionary wedge.",

            "abstract": "Continental collisions displace and deform large volumes of mantle rock, making it seismically anisotropic due to the systematic alignment of olivine crystals under strain. In the India-Asia collision region evidence for deformation-induced anisotropy is widely observed, e.g. in the form of splitting of core-refracted shear waves. Throughout Tibet fast shear wave polarizations (and by inference the direction of mantle deformation) are found to be oriented NE-SW or nearly E-W.\nThis pattern largely holds for the western-most part of the plateau, with one notable exception. Sites at ~82°E display nearly N-S fast directions. A new S wave speed model of the upper mantle beneath western Tibet contains a major fast velocity anomaly. Near-vertical, and columnar in shape, it is located beneath and to the south of the sites with unusual fast directions. Positioned roughly beneath the India-Asia plate boundary, the fast anomaly likely represents down-welling Indian lithosphere.\nObservations of shear wave splitting reflect cumulative influence of anisotropic properties along the ray, and depend on the mutual orientation of the anisotropic symmetry axis and the ray path. In Tibet most clear core-refracted phases arrive from a range of backazimuths (95° – 115°), necessarily biasing the inferred orientation of reported seismic anisotropy axes in the mantle.\nWe investigate lateral and vertical variation of seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle of the western Lhasa Block by developing models of anisotropic parameters for ~30 sites of the western Tibet seismic network operated from 2007 to 2011. We assemble directionally representative suits of SKS, PKS and SKKS phases, and deliberately cull the data in backazimuth range 100°-110°. We use a synthetic seismogram matching technique to invert resulting data sets for anisotropic parameters (fast symmetry axis and strength) of models that contain one or two layers of anisotropy, and where symmetry axes can be inclined from vertical.\nOur unbiased anisotropic structure solutions confirm that fast symmetry axes in most of the western Lhasa block are close to E-W, and nearly horizontal. We find relatively modest (2% over 100 km thickness) levels of anisotropy. We also confirm that the area above the fast shear wave anomaly in the mantle has a distinct anisotropic signature. ",

From 1984–1997, statistically significant negative trends of 5–10% per decade exist throughout the stratosphere (30–50 km). From 1997–present, statistically significant recovery rates of 3–8% per decade exist throughout most of the stratosphere.

            "abstract": "Many datasets have complex structures including hundreds of parameters and numerous vertical levels, grid resolutions, and temporal products. Making these data accessible is a challenge for a data provider. OPeNDAP is powerful protocol for delivering in real-time multi-file datasets that can be ingested by many analysis and visualization tools, but for these datasets there are too many choices about how to aggregate. Simple aggregation schemes can fail to support, or at least make it very challenging, for many potential studies based on complex datasets. We address this issue by using a rich file content metadata collection to create a real-time customized OPeNDAP service to match the full suite of access possibilities for complex datasets.\nThe Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and it’s extension, the Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) datasets produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and hosted by the Research Data Archive (RDA) at the Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at NCAR are examples of complex datasets that are difficult to aggregate with existing data server software. CFSR and CFSv2 contain 141 distinct parameters on 152 vertical levels, six grid resolutions and 36 products (analyses, n-hour forecasts, multi-hour averages, etc.) where not all parameter/level combinations are available at all grid resolution/product combinations. These data are archived in the RDA with the data structure provided by the producer; no additional re-organization or aggregation have been applied. Since 2011, users have been able to request customized subsets (e.g. - temporal, parameter, spatial) from the CFSR/CFSv2, which are processed in delayed-mode and then downloaded to a user’s system. Until now, the complexity has made it difficult to provide real-time OPeNDAP access to the data. We have developed a service that leverages the already-existing subsetting interface and allows users to create a virtual dataset with its own structure (das, dds). The user receives a URL to the customized dataset that can be used by existing tools to ingest, analyze, and visualize the data. This presentation will detail the metadata system and OPeNDAP server that enable user-customized real-time access and show an example of how a visualization tool can access the data.",

Control of sample relative humidity (RH) permits exploration of water uptake by BC-containing particles, an important process that can affect BC-containing aerosol optical properties and lifetime. A Mie and k-Kohler theory framework was developed to relate humidity-dependent changes in BC aerosol optical size to the hygroscopicity parameter (k) of the non-BC content in the particles (which is responsible for any water uptake by these particles). Agreement between the theoretical results and laboratory measurements for the homogenous aerosols validates the experimental methodology, and constrains the range of reasonable use of Mie theory to these ends. We have configured two SP2s sampling in parallel, one dry and one humidified, to permit continuous monitoring of water uptake by materials internally mixed with BC in rapidly changing air masses.

            "abstract": "Flowing foams are used in many engineering and technical applications. A well-known application is oil recovery. Another one is the remediation of polluted soils: the foam is injected into the ground in order to mobilize chemical species present in the medium. Apart from potential interesting physico-chemical and biochemical properties, foams have peculiar flow properties that applications might benefit of. In particular, viscous dissipation arises mostly from the contact zones between the soap films and the walls, which results in peculiar friction laws allowing the foam to invade narrow pores more efficiently than Newtonian fluids would. In most experimental studies no local information of the foam structure is possible, and only global quantities such as the effective viscosity can be measured.\nUsing two-dimensional transparent flow cells, we have previously shown that foam structural [1] and elastic [2] effects significantly impact the flow of foams in porous media. We now present an investigation of foam flow through a two-dimensional (2D) porous medium consisting of circular obstacles positioned randomly in a Hele-Shaw cell (see figure). The foam structure is recorded in time by a video camera and subsequently analyzed by image processing, which provides us with the velocity field and spatial distribution of bubble sizes. The flow exhibits a rich phenomenology, including flow irreversibility, preferential flow paths, local flow intermittency/non-stationarity (despite the imposed permanent global flow rate). Moreover, the medium impacts the nature of the flowing fluid by selecting the bubble size through bubble fragmentation. We investigate how preferential flow paths and intermittency depend on the imposed global flow rate and foam quality (the water content), and show that the spatial distribution of bubble sizes is to some extent correlated with the velocity field. We furthermore measure the evolution, along the flow direction, of the probability density function for bubble sizes, and present a fragmentation model to explain that evolution.\n",

            "abstract": "Most major cities are located on coastlines, vulnerable to the direct impacts of tropical cyclones. Therefore, it is critical to understand and improve prediction of these storms in order to make communities more resilient. Though hurricane warning systems have improved in recent years, these warnings are insufficient, because they fail to account for an indication of tropical cyclone wind asymmetry, or the radial extent of maximum winds in different locations within the cyclone. This study explored the wind asymmetry (defined by magnitude and orientation) among 337 Atlantic tropical cyclones from 1988-2012, utilizing the National Hurricane Center’s (NHC) Extended Best Track Dataset (EBT) and Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS). Asymmetry was defined as the magnitude of the largest difference in the radius of gale-force wind across opposing quadrants, normalized by the average of the four wind radii. The asymmetry orientation pointed along the axis of maximum asymmetry toward the quadrant with the greater gale radius. Relationships between wind asymmetry and various storm characteristics such as geographical location, storm life cycle, intensity, size, storm motion, and vertical wind shear were examined. The magnitude of asymmetry increased in higher latitudes and along coastlines, particularly in smaller storms. Asymmetry was higher at the beginning of a storm’s life, possibly owing to a less well-organized structure, and higher at the end of a storm’s life, coinciding with an increase in vertical wind shear and translation speed. Results from this study may allow for improved tropical cyclone forecasts and warnings to help protect seaside communities.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe first version can be used onboard during the survey to get a quick overview of acquired data, or later, to re-process data with accurate environmental data.\nII. MAIN FUNCTIONALITIES\nThe version shown at AGU-2014 will present several key items :\n- 3D visualization: DTM multi-layers from EMODNet,\n- Water Column echogram, Seismic lines, ...\n- Bathymetry Plug-In: manual and automatic data cleaning, integration of EMODNet methodology to\nintroduce CDI concept, filtering, spline, data gridding, ...\n- Backscatter with compensation,\n- Tectonic toolset,\n- Photo/Video Plug-In\n- Navigation 3D including tide correction, MRU corrections, GPS offsets correction,\n- WMS/WFS interfaces.\nIII. FOCUS ON EMODNET \nOne of the main objectives of the EMODNet European project is to elaborate a common processing flow for gridding\nthe bathymetry data and for generating harmonized digital terrain model (DTM) : this flow includes the definition of the\nDTM characteristics (geodetic parameters, grid spacing, interpolation and smoothing parameters…) and also the\nspecifications of a set of layers which enrich the basic depth layer : statistical layers (sounding density, standard\ndeviation,…) and an innovative data source layer which indicates the source of the soundings and and which is linked\nand collects to the associated metadata.\nGLOBE Software provides the required tools for applying this methodology and is offered to the project partners.\nV. FOCUS ON THE TECTONIC TOOLSET\nThe tectonic toolset allows the user to associate any DTM to 3D rotation movements. These rotations represent the\nmovement of tectonic plates along discrete time lines (from 200 million years ago to now). One rotation is described by its\naxes, its value angle and its date. GLOBE can display the movement of tectonic plates, represented by a DTM, at\ndifferent geological times. The same movements can be operated for geotiff images or GMT files representing grids\nfor any kind of data.\nThe free software GLOBE3D is a product of Ifremer and is funded by Carnot-Edrome",

            "abstract": "Lunar floor-fractured craters are a class of 170 craters characterized by their anomalously shallow, heavily fractured floors; associated floor morphologies include deposits of mare material, pyroclastic deposits, and vents. Floor-fractured craters are located in close proximity to surface mare deposits, and are also closely associated with both the interiors and edges of lunar basins. The interior volcanic features, in conjunction with the morphologic and morphometric characteristics of the craters, suggest a formation consistent with subcrater magmatic intrusion and sill formation. Morphometric data suggests that the areal extent of the intrusion mirrors the dimensions of the crater floor, and that the intrusion does not extend past the crater wall region. The intrusion thickness can be calculated by comparing the observed depth of the craters with the predicted depth of a crater of similar diameter, and the averaged intrusion thickness is ~ 1 km. Thus these intrusions represent large subsurface magmatic provinces. We investigate the evolution of these large magmatic intrusions with emphasis on how the degassing of the intrusion leads to pyroclastic eruptions in certain craters, and whether these eruptions utilize fractures created by the tectonic deformation of the crater floor, or if they instead form from subsidiary diking off of the intrusion. We also investigate the amount of volatiles necessary to produce the pyroclastic eruptions, considering both inherent volatiles in the magma, and volatiles generated by reactions during the shallow subsurface evolution of the magma. The craters Alphonsus and Humboldt serve as ideal study cases to compare and contrast floor morphology, fracture location, and observed volcanic deposits. The results of this analysis have importance for why pyroclastic eruptions occurred in certain locations, and it also has implications for the volatile budget of lunar magmas.",

Two and a half years of continuous ozone data are presented in the context of long-range transport and its potential impact on surface air quality in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV). Past attempts to quantify the impact of transboundary ozone on surface levels have relied on uncertain model estimates, or have been limited to weekly ozonesonde data. Here, we present an observationally derived quantification of the contribution of free tropospheric ozone to surface sites in the San Joaquin Valley throughout three ozone seasons (June through September, 2012-2014). The diurnal ozone patterns at Chews Ridge, and their correlations with ozone aloft over the Valley, have been presented previously. Furthermore, reanalysis data of geopotential heights indicate consistent flow from Chews Ridge to the East, directly over the SJV. In a related airborne project we quantify the vertical exchange, or entrainment, rate over the Southern SJV from a series of focused flights measuring ozone concentrations during peak photochemical hours in conjunction with local meteorological data to quantify an ozone budget for the area. By applying the entrainment rates observed in that study here we are able to quantify the seasonal contributions of free tropospheric ozone measured at Chews Ridge to surface sites in the San Joaquin Valley, and compare prior model estimates to our observationally derived values.",

            "abstract": "The SAIL-Thermique model was developed to simulate thermal infrared (TIR) radiative transfers inside vegetation canopies and land surface emissivity. It is based on the SAIL model developed by Verhoef (1984) for simulating spectral reflectances in the solar domain. Due to the difficulty to measure land surface emissivity, no emissivity model was validated against ground measurements. In this study, several datasets extracted from the literature and from recent databases were used for evaluating emissivity simulations. Model simulations were performed from the knowledge of leaf area index, leaf inclination distribution, direction of viewing, and leaf and soil optical properties. As data on leaf inclination and leaf optical properties were usually not available, stochastic simulations were performed from a priori knowledges on their distribution (extracted from the literature and recent databases). Simulated 8-14 µm emissivities were favorably compared to measurements with a root mean square difference (RMSD) around 0.006 (0.004 when considering only herbaceous species).\nThe model was then used for simulating emissivity spectra for providing information for the interpretation of TIR multispectral data from the ASTER sensor. We used the land surface emissivity simulations for re-assessing the TES algorithm used to separate emissivity and land surface temperature. We showed that the inclusion of vegetated land surfaces significantly modified the relationship between minimum emissivity and minimum maximum difference (εmin- MMD) which is at the heart of the TES algorithm. This relationship was originally established on the ASTER spectral library which did not include vegetated land surface (Schmugge et al. 1998). On a synthetic database, estimations of spectral emissivities and surface temperature were significantly improved when using the new εmin- MMD relationship in comparison to the classical one: RMSD dropped from ~0.012 to ~0.006 for spectral emissivity and from 0.60 K to 0.33 K for surface temperature.\nThis showed the importance of including vegetation canopies when establishing the εmin- MMD relation. The approach can be applied to the development of TES algorithms for any existing TIR multispectral sensors (MODIS, MASTER...) or future sensors (HyspIRI, THIRSTY...).",

We know a considerable amount about the adaptations and extinctions of mammals and plants at the Pleistocene/Holocene (P/H) boundary, but relatively little about changes at the microbial level. Due to permafrost soils’ freezing anoxic conditions, they act as microbial diversity archives allowing us to determine how microbial communities adapted to the abrupt warming at the end of P. Since microbial community composition only helps differentiate viable and extant microorganisms in frozen permafrost, microbial activity in thawing permafrost must be investigated to provide a clear understanding of microbial response to climate change. Current increased temperatures will result in warming and potential thaw of permafrost and release of stored organic carbon, freeing it for microbial utilization; turning permafrost into a carbon source. Studying permafrost viable microbial communities’ diversity and activity will provide a better understanding of how these microorganisms respond to soil edaphic variability due to climate change across the P/H boundary, providing insight into the changes that the soil community is currently undergoing in this modern era of rapid climate change. Modern soil, H and P permafrost cores were collected from Lucky Lady II site outside Dawson City, Yukon. 16S rRNA high throughput sequencing of permafrost DNA showed the same trends for total and viable community richness and diversity with both decreasing with permafrost depth and only the richness increasing in mid and early P. The modern, H and P soils had 50.9, 33.9, and 27.3% unique viable species and only 14% of the total number of viable species were shared by all soils. Gas flux measurements of thawed permafrost showed metabolic activity in modern and permafrost soils, aerobic CH­­4 consumption in modern, some H and P soils, and anaerobic CH­­4 production in one H sample. Soil chemistry analysis showed that older permafrost, P, had higher pH, lower total nitrogen, ammonium, and organic carbon than younger permafrost, H.",

            "abstract": "Evaluating the potential response of the West Antarctic ice streams to changing climatic conditions depends sensitively on the behavior of the shear margins, which play an important role in the force balance of active ice streams. Previous modeling efforts and field observations have raised the possibility of shear-induced melting in ice-stream margins, highlighting the potentially important role of hydrological processes for understanding margin stability. The goal of this paper is to couple the thermomechanical behavior of shear margins to the subglacial hydrology at the bed. An important component of our model is that we solve for the margin positions self-consistently instead of enforcing margin positions apriori.\nOur 2D model represents a cross-section through the ice-stream margin perpendicular to the downstream flow direction. We assume that the ice flows over a bed consisting of Coulomb-plastic till. The position and extent of the ice stream is determined by where the shear stress at the bed attains the local and spatially variable yield stress. If the basal stress falls below the yield stress, the ice is assumed to lock to the bed. While a simplified variation of this model setup can be solved analytically, we adopt a numerical treatment to be able to incorporate a realistic ice rheology.\nThe mechanical, thermal and hydrological model are linked through melt water generation and flow: For a given yield stress at the bed, we compute the margin positions and the anti-plane strain in our mechanical model. The resulting shear heating is then used as a source term in the thermal model to estimate the extent of the temperate zone and amount of melt water produced in the ice. Assuming that the melt water rains down vertically to the bed, we estimate the pore pressure distribution, which in turn determines the yield stress, in our hydrological model. Changing hydrological conditions at the bed are thus intrinsically coupled to the mechanical and thermal properties of the margin and the margin position.",

            "abstract": "Environmental data and models come from disparate sources over a variety of geographical and temporal scales with different resolutions and data standards, often including terabytes of data and model simulations.  Unfortunately, these data and models tend to remain solely within the custody of the private and public organisations which create the data, and the scientists who build models and generate results. Although many models and datasets are theoretically available to others, the lack of ease of access tends to keep them out of reach of many.\nWe have developed an intuitive web-based tool that utilises environmental models and datasets located in a cloud to produce results that are appropriate to the user. Storyboards showing the interfaces and visualisations have been created for each of several exemplars. A library of virtual machine images has been prepared to serve these exemplars. Each virtual machine image has been tailored to run computer models appropriate to the end user. Two approaches have been used; first as RESTful web services conforming to the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Processing Service (WPS) interface standard using the Python-based PyWPS; second, a MySQL database interrogated using PHP code. In all cases, the web client sends the server an HTTP GET request to execute the process with a number of parameter values and, once execution terminates, an XML or JSON response is sent back and parsed at the client side to extract the results. All web services are stateless, i.e. application state is not maintained by the server, reducing its operational overheads and simplifying infrastructure management tasks such as load balancing and failure recovery. A hybrid cloud solution has been used with models and data sited on both private and public clouds. The storyboards have been transformed into intuitive web interfaces at the client side using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, utilising plug-ins such as jQuery and Flot (for graphics), and Google Maps APIs.\nWe have demonstrated that a cloud infrastructure can be used to assemble a virtual research environment that, coupled with a user-driven development approach, is able to cater to the needs of a wide range of user groups, from domain experts to concerned members of the general public.

Altogether we sampled 49 sites on 17 individual basaltic to rhyolitic lava flows of Holocene age. Each individual flow was sampled at a minimum of three sites, allowing a direct comparison of palaeomagnetic and rock magnetic results with location in a lava flow. Estimates of palaeofield directions were obtained from principal component analysis of thermal and alternating field demagnetisation data. Site mean declinations range from 340° (W) to 18° (E) and inclinations range between - 45° and - 85°. The current values in Taupo, New Zealand are: declination 21°, inclination -65°, and intensity 54.5 μT.\nSuccessful palaeointensity estimates were obtained from five flows by combining extensive microwave and thermal experiments following Coe and IZZI Thellier-type protocols. Results were accepted on the basis of stringent quality criteria, agreement between different methods and consistency between sites from each lava flow. Palaeointensities range from 29 to 78 μT.\nThe new data shows that the local field had a generally more easterly declination and was of higher intensity than suggested by the CALS series world models (e.g. Korte et al, 2011). The latter are predominantly based on northern hemisphere data and lack a full dataset from New Zealand. The implications of the new data on global and regional field models are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Many lakes and wetlands exist in the Arctic. They store a part of snowmelt, and influence the surface water and energy budget and surface hydrology including soil moisture and river flow. The storage effects of wetlands have a possibility to improve the surface hydrology simulation and to reduce the surface air temperature bias that exists in the current generation climate model. There are, however, only few global land surface models that incorporate wetlands and the effects upon climate are not yet well investigated. Here, in the present study, we examine a simple wetland scheme that stores part of snowmelt with MATSIRO land surface model in a climate model, MIROC5. First, we conduct offline global land simulations with and without the wetland scheme using meteorological forcing that combines the reanalysis and the observed precipitation dataset. We evaluate the results using satellite based soil moisture dataset, evapotranspiration reference dataset and observed river discharge. Using the offline land model, we show that the wetland scheme improves the underestimation of evapotranspiration in the control simulation. The simulated sensible heat flux decreases corresponding to the increasing latent heat flux. The bias of river discharge simulation is reduced in major Arctic river basins. Further, we conduct a series of on-line AGCM experiment using MIROC5 with climatological monthly SST and sea ice boundary conditions in order to examine the effects of the wetland on the near surface air temperature. The result shows that the impact of wetland scheme upon the reduction of near surface air temperature in summer is significant.",

However, challenges exist for industry experts estimate that for a single $10 million dollar lateral wellbore fracking operation, only 10% of the hydrocarbons contained in the rock are extracted. To better understand how to improve hydrofrac recovery efficiencies and to lower its costs, LANL recently funded the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project: “Discovery Science of Hydraulic Fracturing: Innovative Working Fluids and Their Interactions with Rocks, Fractures, and Hydrocarbons”. Under the support of this project, the LDRD modeling team is working with the experimental team to understand fracture initiation and propagation in shale rocks. LANL’s hybrid hydro-mechanical (HM) tool, the Hybrid Optimization Software Suite (HOSS), is being used to simulate the complex fracture and fragment processes under a variety of different boundary conditions. HOSS is based on the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM) and has been proven to be a superior computational tool for multi-fracturing problems.

Bipolar pulses as important signals of initial breakdown process, were usually used in the research. However, the detectability of the pulses is different in different researches. At the same time, the discharge process from initial breakdown to return stroke is not always the simple BIL model. In the research, using electric field waveforms of lightning discharges observed in Beijing and Guangzhou, the detectable initial breakdown (preliminary breakdown, PB) pulses and the following discharges are analyzed. The results show that, (1) Although, the percentage of detectable PB pulse trains is just as a function of latitude in large range of latitude, the values are similar in Beijing and Guangzhou, which indicate that the characteristic of storm also play a key role in detectable PB besides the latitude. (2)According to the difference in discharge process of following PB pulse, three discharge types, which exhibits PB pulses followed by inverted IC, hybrid flash, leader and RS, can be identified. And the fourth type only exhibits a RS waveform without detectable PB pulses. (3)The discharge with undetectable PB pulse is dominant in Beijing and Guangzhou. But the percentage of each discharge type is obvious different in the two regions. The occurrence of different discharge types and different percentage in Beijing and Guangzhou can be contributed to the difference in low positive charge region.",

            "abstract": "Remote marine clouds, such as those over the Southern Ocean, are particularly sensitive to variations in the concentration and chemical composition of aerosols that serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Observational evidence indicates that the organic content of fine marine aerosol is greatly increased during the biologically active season near strong phytoplankton blooms in certain locations, while being nearly constant in other locations.\nWe have recently developed a novel modeling framework that mechanistically links the organic fraction of submicron sea spray to ocean biogeochemistry (Burrows et al., in discussion, ACPD, 2014; Elliott et al., ERL, 2014). Because of its combination of large phytoplankton blooms and high wind speeds, the Southern Ocean is an ideal location for testing our understanding of the processes driving the enrichment of organics in sea spray aerosol. Comparison of the simulated OM fraction with satellite observations shows that OM fraction is a statistically significant predictor of cloud droplet number concentration over the Southern Ocean.\nThis presentation will focus on predictions from our modeling framework for the Southern Ocean, specifically, the predicted geographic gradients and seasonal cycles in the aerosol organic matter and its functional group composition. The timing and location of a Southern Ocean field campaign will determine its utility in observing the effects of highly localized and seasonal phytoplankton blooms on aerosol composition and clouds.\n",

            "abstract": "Arctic wetlands contain significant stores of organic carbon that are potentially vulnerable to release to the atmosphere as Arctic temperatures increase. Projecting the fate of that carbon is particularly difficult for polygonal tundra because of the strong control that organized microtopography plays in the hydrology and carbon cycle in those regions. A comprehensive microtopography-resolving modeling strategy for projecting the release of carbon from warming polygonal tundra has recently been developed. The strategy combines a novel multifaceted simulation capability, workflows for developing high-resolution computational meshes, and approaches for soil parameter estimation. Central to the approach is the Arctic Terrestrial Simulator, a highly parallel simulation tool that couples models of surface and subsurface thermal hydrology with phase change, surface energy balance, snow thermal processes, snow spatial distribution, and soil carbon dynamics all in an extensible and flexibly configured framework. We will present projections of future carbon release from thawing polygonal ground at the Barrow Environmental Observatory. These simulations, which are driven by climate projections in the RCP8.5 scenario, resolve hydrologic processes at the submeter scale to capture variations in soil moisture and soil carbon dynamics across polygon centers, rims, and troughs. We compare results for high- and low-centered polygons, focusing on the integrated effects of microtopography on hydrology and carbon release.

Fortunately, the outer belt was well sampled by a variety of missions during the event, including the Van Allen Probes, THEMIS, and the Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment (CSSWE). In-situ flux and phase space density observations are used from MagEIS (Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer) onboard the Van Allen Probes, REPTile (Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope integrated little experiment) onboard CSSWE, and SST onboard THEMIS. The observations show a rapid increase in 100’s keV electron fluxes, followed by a more gradual enhancement of the MeV energies. The 100’s keV enhancement is associated with a substorm injection, and the futher energization to MeV energies is associated with wave activity as measured by the Van Allen Probes and THEMIS. Furthermore, the phase space density radial profiles show an acceleration region occurring between 5<L*<6. We investigate the relationship between the substorm-injected seed population, wave activity, and the electron acceleration region. Specifically, a one dimensional data assimilation algorithm is used to reconstruct the phase space density radial profile. The algorithm also estimates electron source rate parameters, which are compared with the radial location of the seed population and to the intensity and radial extent of wave activity.",

The MT data, particularly the electric fields, are frequently contaminated by spurious components that are not due to the plane-wave magnetic signals required for derivation of the MT impedance tensor. We therefore developed interactive graphical software (MTPlot) to plot and analyze the MT signals in the field. MTPlot allows us to quickly examine records in both the time and frequency domain to in order to judge their quality. It also transforms the data into estimates of apparent resistivity and their error in the frequency range 0.001-500 Hz. This has proved very useful for selecting suitable records for subsequent analysis. We then use multi-taper remote reference processing to obtain our final apparent resistivity estimates and their errors. We present preliminary results of one and two dimensional modeling of these estimates to obtain the three-dimensional distribution of subsurface resistivities down to depths of 5 km. The results are compared to temperatures and properties of cores obtained when we drilled a research hole to a depth of 1760 m in this same region.

This improvement has been demonstrated using data from the International Monitoring System (IMS), a sparse, global seismic network. In relocation tests using the IMS network and a set of seismic events with ground truth (GT) levels of 5 km or better, over 80% of the defining arrivals are regional Pn (15%) or teleseismic P phases (65.1%). There is a small percentage of phases that requires a model that supports secondary phase prediction. We plan to update the SALSA3D model to include an S-velocity component as well as an updated P-velocity model using secondary compressional phases.\nOur model is derived from the latest version of the GT catalog of travel-time picks assembled by Los Alamos National Laboratory. The model is represented using the triangular tessellation system described by Ballard et al. (2009), which incorporates variable resolution in both the geographic and radial dimensions. For our starting model, we use a simplified layer crustal model derived from the Crust 1.0 model, overlying a uniform ak135 mantle. Sufficient damping is used to reduce velocity adjustments so that ray path changes between iterations are small. We obtain proper model smoothness by using progressive grid refinement, refining the grid only in areas where it is warranted by the available data. Our approach produces a smooth, multi-resolution model with node density appropriate to both ray coverage and the velocity gradients required by the data.\nWe compare the travel-time prediction and location capabilities of the updated SALSA3D model to standard 1D and 2/2.5D models via location tests on a global event set with GT of 5 km or better. We compare location results using a subset of these events that have a significant number of phases with which to produce random realizations of actual arrival data. In addition, further tests will involve using GT5 or better events and their arrivals specifically for the IMS network, to test the use of a 3D model on an operational network intended for explosion monitoring.",

Ip and Goertz [1983] explained this asymmetry can be caused by a dawn-to-dusk electric field in the Jupiter’s inner magnetosphere. However, the question what physical process can impose such an electric field deep inside the strong magnetosphere still remains. The long-term monitoring of the Io plasma torus is a key observation to answer this question. The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrometer EXCEED onboard the HISAKI satellite was launched in 2013 and observed the Io plasma torus from December 2013 to March 2014 (75 days). We investigated the temporal variation of the dawn/dusk ratio of EUV brightness. Then we compared it to the solar wind dynamic pressure extrapolated from that observed around Earth by using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. As a result we found clear responses of the dawn-dusk asymmetry to rapid increases of the solar wind dynamic pressure. We will present the initial results of this study. ",

            "abstract": "The San Gregorio Fault Zone (SGFZ) is part of the North American–Pacific plate boundary and is thought to accommodate right-lateral offset up to 10 mm/yr. Because much of the SGFZ in Monterey Bay, central California, lies offshore in steep submarine canyon bathymetry, little is known of its recent activity. We provide initial direct evidence for faulting where the SGFZ has been interpreted based on canyon morphology to cross the northern flank of Monterey Canyon. High-resolution multibeam bathymetry and chirp subbottom profiles were acquired during 13 dives with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute’s (MBARI) Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) from 2009-2014 on the northern flank of Monterey Canyon, extending from the shelf edge ~15 km offshore Santa Cruz to ~1850 m water depth. Chirp profiles resolve layered sediments up to ~40 m subsurface in this region, and no fault scarps or seafloor lineaments are visible in the 1-m resolution multibeam bathymetry. At least one subsurface fault is identified within the SGFZ by offset reflections across a discrete, nearly vertical fault. However, this fault is only imaged where mass wasting has exhumed older strata to within ~25 m of the seafloor. Numerous slumps scars on the seafloor and packages of chaotic internal reflectivity in chirp profiles suggest that submarine landslide processes dominate the study area. To constrain the age of reflections offset by the fault, MBARI’s Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Doc Ricketts, sampled faces of slump scars where the offset reflections crop out using vibracores and horizontal push cores. Radiocarbon dating of foraminifera within these core samples is being used to constrain the last recorded movement on the fault. Application of AUV and ROV methods allows detailed neotectonic investigation of significant offshore structures, like the SGFZ, that contribute to hazard assessment.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we examine temporal subsurface relative velocity variations in Yellowstone. This project region has a much larger spatial scaling, as well as a much longer, less abrupt, temporal change than most of the other active settings in which ambient noise temporal velocity variations are measured. By examining the time lag of the ambient Noise Correlation Function (NCF) for a given station pair, we can extract relative velocity variations. These changes represent either subsurface velocity changes (in active settings) or changes due to the seasonal variation in the ambient seismic field. We improve the temporal and spectral stability of the NCFs through a new filter (the adaptive covariance filter – ACF), which allows us to evaluate the main Rayleigh wave arrival rather than coda. By making use of the main arrival the spatial location of these changes can be better understood.\nWe examine all of the available data near the Yellowstone National Park area, including the USArray and the NOISY networks. Using the ACF, we calculate robust NCFs for all station pairs (overlapping in time). We then obtain time-lag estimates of the main arrival for various calendar times throughout the data availability. These lags are then compared to the lags observed at all other spatial station pairs. Using these many combinations of station pairs and lags, we build and perform an inversion, where these relative velocities are compared to a background velocity at subsequently different times. The spatial location of the velocity changes can be observed over time, and it can be ascertained as to whether these observed velocity variations are due to subsurface changes (such as the inflationary uplift from 2004-2010 in Yellowstone), or whether the observed changes are more indicative of the regional changes in the ambient seismic field.",

            "abstract": "The geochemical characteristics of particulate organic matter (POM) transported by rivers has broad implications in our understanding of aquatic nutrient dynamics, the fate of contaminants, environmental change in watersheds, and carbon export to depositional environments. The major fraction of this POM is mobilized during storms, especially in small mountainous river systems (SMRS) producing complex spatial-temporal POM patterns poorly documented due to logistical difficulties. In this study, we examine the use of overbank flood deposits as a surrogate of a quasi-Lagrangian POM sampling scheme to supplement the conventional Eulerian sampling scheme for POM. We report on the geochemical characteristics of 11 overbank deposits created after a significant flood (10 X mean discharge) along 80 km in the Alsea River, a SMRS in the Oregon Coast Range. We measure organic carbon, nitrogen, stable isotopes, and biomarkers such as lignin-derived phenols as well as particle size distribution and surface area of the deposited sediments. We compared those characteristics with the POM sampled during several storms at a fixed location. Our results suggest that despite the differences in local depositional conditions inferred from particle size distributions and texture, the geochemical properties of overbank deposits resemble the properties of the material in transport, mainly derived from a terrestrial source with a clear signal of gymnosperm wood. Furthermore, the normalized ranges of the geochemical indicators measured across space for one single event are comparable to, or even higher than, the normalized range of the same indicators measured along time at the fixed location. The implications of the amount and quality of the additional information offered by the overbank deposits in POM dynamics in watershed is discussed.",

To provide such information, we developed narrative scenarios of future climate change and its impacts on different ecosystems in southwestern Colorado. This multi-institution and trans-disciplinary project seeks to provide useful and useable knowledge to facilitate climate change adaptation in the context of uncertainty. The narratives are intended to provide detailed insights into the range of changes that natural resource managers may face in the future. These scenarios were developed in an iterative process through interactions between ecologists, social and climate scientists. In our scenario development process, climate uncertainty is acknowledged by having multiple scenarios, where each scenario is regarded as a storyline with equal probability as another scenario. Rather than a qualitative narration of the general direction of change and range in responses, we quantified changes in several decision relevant climate and ecological responses based on our best available understanding and provided a tight storyline for each scenario to facilitate (a) a more augmented use of scientific information in a decision-making process, (b) differential responses from stakeholders across the different scenarios, and (c) identification of strategies that could work across these multiple scenarios. This presentation will discuss the process of selecting the scenarios, quantifying climate and ecological responses, and the criteria for building the narrative for each scenario. We will also cover the process by which these scenarios get used, and how the user feedbacks are integrated in further developing the tools and processes.",

Data from 2000-2011 is analyzed, and a snow cover persistence index (SCPI) is computed for each pixel at different resolutions over four test watersheds. The annual SCPI is calculated as the number of acquisitions during a year on which a pixel is covered by a fraction of snow greater than a defined threshold. We calculate the SCPI at the nominal Landsat resolution (30m) and at the MODIS resolution (500m) for each of the pixels of the different watersheds and for different thresholds. Furthermore, for each watershed, the correlation of SCPI with slope, aspect and elevation is calculated for Landsat at 30m, and aggregated at 100m and 500m, and for MODIS at 500m. Both MODIS and Landsat show significant differences in annual SCPI for the 500m resolution. The difference in correlation between SCP and physiographic variables is largest when comparing Landsat 30m to MODIS, suggesting that sensor resolution is an important limiting factor for the analyzed region. Trend analysis using both products show differences in terms of changes in SCPI for the 2000-2011 period, however the conclusions are not robust due to the short period analyzed.",

            "abstract": "We show that predictions of mean annual precipitation, and daily extremes, in the San Francisco Bay region are more reliably based on the state of the Hadley-Walker circulation’s North Pacific branch, than on the basis of the state of ENSO. We suggest the same may apply over the broad North-Central California region, where we document higher correlations of precipitation with monthly values of NOI (Northern Oscillation Index) than with any of the monthly ENSO indices (including MEI, NINO3.4, and SOI). We use the NOI definition by Schwing et al (2002): the difference in sea level pressure anomalies between the North Pacific High and Darwin, Australia – the centers of action of the North Pacific branch of the Hadley-Walker circulation. While NOI is strongly correlated with all of the ENSO indices, on those occasions where NOI and ENSO indices disagree, NOI is most often the better precipitation predictor. When using NOI as a precipitation predictor, the additional use of ENSO indices adds little additional predictive skill. We additionally show that NOI is also a better single predictor of extra-tidal water height in San Francisco Bay (compared to any ENSO index), although NOI-based water height predictions can indeed be improved by the addition of an ENSO index.\nWe show that NOI variability can be used to characterize the San Francisco Bay region’s water resources and flooding risk, and is the controlling factor in obtaining future projections. We use monthly NOI and daily specific humidity at 850 hPa level (HUS) as predictors of precipitation in statistical models: [model 1] a statistical model of precipitation totals for the wet season (Nov.-Mar.); and [model 2] a statistical model of extreme daily precipitation in South S.F. Bay. We also use NOI and SOI as predictors in a statistical model of extreme storm surge height in the South Bay [model 3]. Each of these 3 models is trained with NOI, SOI and HUS from Reanalysis, and is run using projected values of NOI, SOI and HUS by seven CMIP5 GCMs. These models may be useful in water resources and flood protection infrastructure planning, including levees.

            "abstract": "Throughout most of southern California (SCA) annual precipitation totals occur from relatively few storms per season. Any changes to storm frequency or intensity may dramatically impact the region, as its landscapes are prone to various rainfall-induced hazards including landslides and floods. These hazards become more frequent following drought or fire events, conditions also reliant on precipitation and common in SCA. Rainfall forecasts are especially difficult to determine as regional precipitation is affected by numerous phenomena. On synoptic timescales, atmospheric rivers (ARs) are one such phenomenon known to impact SCA rainfall. ARs are channels of high water vapor content found within the lower atmosphere that transport moisture towards midlatitudes. In areas with varying topography, ARs often produce high-intensity precipitation due to orographic forcing. Although much insight has been gained in understanding AR climatology affecting North America’s western coast, the spatiotemporal characteristics and atmospheric forcings driving ARs to SCA need to be further addressed. The goal of this work is to understand the characteristics of ARs that impact SCA and to distinguish them from ARs that impact northern latitudes.\nWe investigate AR characteristics as well as atmospheric features prior to plume initiation for ARs impacting different landfall regions along North America’s western coast between 1998-2008. Dates of AR events are organized according to landfall region using total precipitable water (TPW) fields from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR). Additional CFSR fields are used to create anomaly composites of moist static energy, geopotential height, as well as upper-level zonal and low-level meridional winds for each landfall region on the day of and prior to AR occurrence. ARs that impact SCA display different TPW plume characteristics as well as wave train patterns throughout the AR lifecycle (prior to plume initiation–AR landfall) compared to ARs that landfall further north. This suggests that ARs impacting SCA differ in initiation mechanisms as well as structural qualities from other ARs. Information from these analyses will assist in creating and validating an automatic tool for identifying AR occurrences.",

            "abstract": "Stakeholders in the coastal zone, particularly the urban coasts, are turning to science to get information on future Local Sea Level (LSL) rise. Many scientists and scientific committees respond to this request with a range of plausible trajectories (RPT) defined by a number of possible trajectories each corresponding to a certain scenario. Often these assessments take a starting point in the small number of global sea level trajectories provided by the IPCC. This approach is inherently deterministic. The resulting RPT, which can be quite large, is considered as reflecting “uncertainty in LSL projections.” Non-scientists often use the RPT to select a preferred and much narrower sub-RPT, for which they plan, or they use the “large uncertainty” to justify not taking any measures. In response to societal needs, science focuses on a reduction of the uncertainties through improved deterministic models. This approach has a number of problems: (1) The complexity of LSL as the outcome of many local, regional and global earth system processes, including anthropogenic processes, renders a deterministic approach to prediction invalid. (2) Most assessments of the RPT account for an incomplete set of relevant earth system processes, and for each processes make assumptions that (often arbitrarily) constrain the contribution from this process. (3) LSL is an inherently probabilistic variable that has a broad probability density function (PDF), with a complex dependency of this PDF on the PDFs of the many contributing processes. In particular, the contribution from the large ice sheets has a PDF with low-probability high-impact tails that are generally neglected in deterministic LSL projections and in the sub-RPT used for coastal planning. A fully probabilistic assessment of the risk associated with LSL rise indicates that the standard deterministic assessment not only neglect most of the low-probability, high-risk tail of the PDF but also medium-probability, high-risk parts. This creates a high potential for low or medium-probability events that could challenge a global civilization, which is depending on crucial coastal infrastructure with growing urban coasts built under the principle assumption that future LSL will not change much more than what civilization experienced during the (geologically short) past.",

Time series of water surface elevations were recorded at tide gauges and DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Report of Tsunamis) tsunami sensors in the Pacific Ocean. By comparing the wave spectra of the Iquique event with those of other historical events in this region, we notice the former are characterized with significantly higher energy concentration in high-frequency wave modes. This is an indicator of strong frequency dispersion effects, which can quickly reduce the amplitudes of the leading waves in open ocean. These effects are demonstrated through numerical simulations with a weakly dispersive Boussinesq model. The oceanic propagation of this tsunami is also simulated with MOST (Method of Splitting Tsunami), the numerical simulating tool of NO­AA’s tsunami forecast system, termed SIFT (Short-term Inundation Forecasting of Tsunamis). Though MOST is based on the nonlinear shallow-water theory, the numerical dispersion introduced by its finite difference scheme can be manipulated to compensate the neglected physical frequency dispersion, and makes it applicable to dispersive wave propagations.",

            "abstract": "Anticyclonic circulation has intensified over the Arctic Ocean in summer during recent decades. However, the underlying mechanism is, as yet, not well understood. Here we show that earlier spring Eurasian snowmelt leads to anomalously negative sea level pressure (SLP) over Eurasia and positive SLP over the Arctic, which has strong projection on the negative phase of the Northern Annular Mode (NAM) in summer through the wave-mean flow interaction. Specifically, earlier spring snowmelt over Eurasia leads to a warmer land surface, due to reduced surface albedo. The warmed surface amplifies stationary Rossby waves, leading to a deceleration of the subpolar jet. As a consequence, rising motion is enhanced over the land, and compensating subsidence and adiabatic heating occur in the Arctic troposphere, forming the negative NAM. The intensified anticyclonic circulation has played a contributing role in accelerating the sea ice decline observed during the last two decades. The results here provide important information for improving seasonal prediction of summer sea ice cover.",

            "abstract": "Catastrophe risk models are widely used in the insurance industry to estimate the cost of risk. The models consist of hazard models linked to vulnerability and financial loss models. In flood risk models, the hazard model generates inundation maps. In order to develop country wide inundation maps for different return periods a rainfall-runoff and routing model is run using stochastic rainfall data. The simulated discharge and runoff is then input to a two dimensional inundation model, which produces the flood maps. In order to get realistic flood maps, the rainfall-runoff and routing models have to be calibrated with observed discharge data. The rainfall-runoff model applied here is a semi-distributed model based on the Topmodel (Beven and Kirkby, 1979) approach which includes additional snowmelt and evapotranspiration models. The routing model is based on the Muskingum-Cunge (Cunge, 1969) approach and includes the simulation of lakes and reservoirs using the linear reservoir approach. Both models were calibrated using the multiobjective NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002) genetic algorithm with NLDAS forcing data and around 4500 USGS discharge gauges for the period from 1979-2013. Additional gauges having no data after 1979 were calibrated using CPC rainfall data.

            "abstract": "Ascending hydrous magma in nature often undergoes segregation of vapor phase. Given that this is a fundamental driving force of volcanic eruption, there have been many efforts to understand degassing process of magma. In this study, we have focused on the aspect of Li segregation during degassing simulated in laboratory experiments. Natural rhyolitic obsidian was pre-saturated in H2O at 210 MPa, 800 ˚C giving approximately 6 wt%. Subsequently the pre-saturated samples were isothermally decompressed at the rate of 500 kPa/s. The final pressure before quench was approximately 70 MPa. The pressure of bubble nucleation in these experimental conditions is equal to 90 MPa, so the duration of bubble growth was 40 sec. Some experiments were kept at constant pressure conditions immediately after decompression for up to 3 days.\nIn the sample quenched directly at the end of the decompression step, the Li abundance in degassed melt varies between above and below the initial concentration (71 ppm): from 69 to 74 ppm. The isotopic composition of Li is heavier by 3 to 5 permil compared to the initial. The sample annealed for 3 days shows similar heavy isotope values, but Li abundance is only higher than the initial, no concentration depletion is detected. Numerical simulation accounting for bubble growth and Li diffusion shows profiles in melt that are variable in concentration, with isotopically heavy value due to diffusion fractionation. Specifically, significant variation of Li concentration and shift to the heavy value are favored for the condition at which Li is compatible to gas phase over melt. When Li is incompatible, insignificant quantify of Li leaves the melt thus resulting in negligible isotopic fractionation. The profile caused by degassing relaxes during steady state anneal. This relaxation yields patterns consistent with the composition observed in the degassing-anneal run. Our experimental results also indicate that gas-melt partitioning of Li must be between 1 and 10. Further tuning of the model is required to determine the range of Li partition coefficients and equilibrium isotope fractionation factors that are consistent with observations.",

Mars Express has been in orbit around Mars since December 2003 and the spacecraft and its instruments are still performing very well. After an initial worry about the safety of the spacecraft it has now been established that the risk for damage to the spacecraft is acceptable. A small phasing of the orbit was done in June in order to “hide” the spacecraft behind Mars during the time of the closest approach of the comet. Apart from that no special precautions are planned and a full set of observations of the comet and of Mars will be performed during the days around the closest approach. The cometary activity is being closely monitored and if new information of a possible increased risk appears, a safe spacecraft pointing and switching off non-essential instruments and sub-systems can be performed at a late stage.\nThe planned observations include imaging and taking spectral data of the comet nucleus and the coma, stellar occultation measurements through the coma, and observations of the Martian atmosphere and ionosphere. In situ observations of energetic particles and local plasma density measurements will be performed at several occasions and topside ionospheric sounding will be done. Detection of direct impacts on the spacecraft will be attempted as well as optical detection of meteor showers in the Martian atmosphere and remote observations of the hydrogen corona.\nMars Express instruments involved in the observations include HRSC, SpicaM, Omega, Aspera, MARSIS and PFS.",

            "abstract": "Rivers in semiarid regions are typically ‘ribbons of green’ through otherwise sparsely vegetated landscapes. As these rivers convey water from sometimes distant sources they lose water to shallow riparian aquifers which frequently support a rich phreatophytic vegetation community. In order to monitor the interactions between streamflow, alluvial aquifers, and riparian vegetation, water levels in 3 monitoring wells near the Rio Grande at Escondida, NM, were recorded beginning in May 2013. Two summers of data reveal a strong diel signal in the water table levels, indicating a clear interaction between vegetation transpiration and aquifer storage. Likewise, comparison with stage data from a USGS gage 25 m upstream of the well transect shows a clear aquifer recharge signal. Prior work at this site during fall 2005 has suggested that streambed infiltration rates vary in a daily cycle, possibly due to temperature controls on water viscosity. In order to evaluate the relative roles of the two potential cycles we also monitored near-bed hydraulic gradients and remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs). To measure hydraulic gradient we installed an additional piezometer in the bed of the river, screened 3 feet below the sediment surface, and began logging head in December 2013. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was calculated from Landsat scenes that had clear views of the nearby riparian forest during the monitoring period. Preliminary results indicate that periods with high EVI and high evaporative demand (as estimated from a nearby weather station) correlate with greater water level cycle amplitude and, presumably, vegetation-aquifer interaction. We did not observe any diel signals in the water table data during periods with low leaf cover, casting some doubt on the importance of the previously reported streambed infiltration rate driven cyclicity, however analysis of the near-bed hydraulic gradient data is ongoing and will be compared with residuals of the EVI-cycle amplitude relationship. Additionally, ongoing soil and pump test analyses are expected to give insight into the specific yield of the aquifer, which may enable ET rate estimation for comparison with VI-based methods.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and severity of water limitation, altering terrestrial ecosystems and their carbon exchange with the atmosphere. Here we compare site-level temporal sensitivity of annual carbon fluxes to interannual variations in water availability against cross-site spatial patterns over a network of 19 eddy covariance flux sites. This network represents one order of magnitude in mean annual productivity and includes western North American desert shrublands and grasslands, savannahs, woodlands, and forests with continuous records of 4 to 12 years. Our analysis reveals site-specific patterns not identifiable in prior syntheses that pooled sites. We interpret temporal variability as an indicator of ecosystem response to annual water availability due to fast-changing factors such as leaf stomatal response and microbial activity, while cross-site spatial patterns are used to infer ecosystem adjustment to climatic water availability through slow-changing factors such as plant community and organic carbon pools. Using variance decomposition, we directly quantify how terrestrial carbon balance depends on slow- and fast-changing components of gross ecosystem production (GEP) and total ecosystem respiration (TER). Slow factors explain the majority of variance in annual net ecosystem production (NEP) across the dataset, and their relative importance is greater at wetter, forest sites than desert ecosystems. Site-specific offsets from spatial patterns of GEP and TER explain one third of NEP variance, likely due to slow-changing factors not directly linked to water, such as disturbance. TER and GEP are correlated across sites as previously shown, but our site-level analysis reveals surprisingly consistent linear relationships between these fluxes in deserts and savannahs, indicating fast coupling of TER and GEP in more arid ecosystems. Based on the uncertainty associated with slow and fast factors, we suggest a framework for improved prediction of terrestrial carbon balance. We will also present results of ongoing work to quantify fast and slow contributions to the relationship between evapotranspiration and precipitation across a precipitation gradient.",

            "abstract": "Previous work on dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) has focused on high temperature, low pH environments where soluble Fe(III) is utilized as an electron acceptor for respiration. Much less attention has been paid to DIR in lower temperature, circumneutral pH environments, where solid phase Fe(III) oxides are the dominant forms of Fe(III). This study explored the potential for DIR in the warm (ca. 40-50°C), circumneutral pH Chocolate Pots hot springs (CP) in YNP. Most probable number (MPN) enumerations and enrichment culture studies confirmed the presence of endogenous microbial communities that reduced native CP Fe(III) oxides. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR coupled to acetate and lactate oxidation through repeated transfers over ca. 450 days. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes indicated that the dominant organisms in the enrichments were closely affiliated with the well known Fe(III) reducer Geobacter metallireducens. Additional taxa included relatives of sulfate reducing bacterial genera Desulfohalobium and Thermodesulfovibrio; however, amendment of enrichments with molybdate, an inhibitor of sulfate reduction, suggested that sulfate reduction was not a primary metabolic pathway involved in DIR in the cultures. A metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures is underway in anticipation of identifying genes involved in DIR in the less well-characterized dominant organisms. Current studies are aimed at interrogating the in situ microbial community at CP. Core samples were collected along the flow path (Fig. 1) and subdivided into 1 cm depth intervals for geochemical and microbiological analysis. The presence of significant quantities of Fe(II) in the solids indicated that DIR is active in situ. A parallel study investigated in vitro microbial DIR in sediments collected from three of the coring sites. DNA was extracted from samples from both studies for 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing in order to obtain a detailed understanding of the vertical and longitudinal distribution of microbial taxa throughout CP. These studies will provide insight into the operation of the microbial Fe redox cycle, demonstrating how genomic properties relate to and control geochemical conditions with depth and distance in a Fe-rich, neutral pH geothermal environment.",

This region is also rich in iron ore deposits and correspondingly has an extensive history of mining activities. Wild rice no longer grows in some areas where it was previously abundant. Sandy Lake, located in St. Louis County on federally protected lands that are ceded territory of the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa in Minnesota and downstream of the nearby U.S. Steel Minntac mine, was selected as a test site. This lake has a history of ricing activities by the Ojibwe (Chippewa) People, for whom manoomin has cultural importance. Lake cores were taken on June 17, 2014 by LacCore and FDLRM staff and samples were obtained. This project used phytolith analysis to answer the question of past wild rice presence and abundance in Sandy Lake. Phytoliths are microscopic opal silica deposits produced in some plants. Zizania palustris produces phytolith morphotypes that are unequivocally diagnostic of this species in this region. Microscopic slides were prepared and analyzed for wild rice phytoliths. Concentration values ranged from 25 to 4379 phytoliths per cm3/year, and wild rice accumulation figures ranged from 7 to 789 phytoliths/cm2/year, the maximum values of which occurred in the 1920s and generally declined to the current lowest levels observed. Mining has likely impacted wild rice populations by causing increased sulfate levels and possibly contributing to higher lake levels.",

            "abstract": "This study aims to reconstruct a high resolution, late Holocene record of precipitation variability for the coastal southwestern United States region using sediment cores from Crystal Lake, CA. This region is especially susceptible to droughts and episodic floods, making it of particular importance to understand past hydrologic variability. Crystal Lake is a small, alpine landslide dammed lake in the Angeles National Forest of the San Gabriel Mountains. The lake is the only permanent, freshwater lake located in the range. It is hydrologically closed, meaning all lake level changes are controlled by changes in precipitation: evaporation. To reconstruct past hydrologic variability, two Livingston piston cores were taken 15 m apart in the depocenter of the lake in May 2014. A multi-proxy methodology was utilized including: magnetic susceptibility, total organic matter and total carbonate content, grain size, and bulk d13Corg of sediments. All analyses were conducted at 1 cm contiguous intervals except bulk d13Corg (at 2 cm). Seismic reflection profiles were also generated to examine the basin’s stratigraphic features in the context of the individual sediment cores.

            "abstract": "Microbially mediated sulfate reduction is the major metabolic process that leads to the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in oil reservoirs. Biogenesis of H2S (souring) has detrimental impacts on oil production operations and can cause significant environmental and health problems. Understanding the processes that control the rates and patterns of sulfate reduction is a crucial step in developing a predictive understanding of reservoir souring and associated mitigation processes. In this study, we describe the development of a microbial trait-based model that is coupled to a reactive transport model. The model represents several anaerobic microbial functional guilds with different resource acquisition (e.g., electron donor, sulfate) traits. The integrated model was used to simulate the temporal and spatial evolution of the primary chemical species (e.g. sulfate, sulfide, nitrate, chlorate and perchlorate) and the microbial community dynamics involved in the souring and desouring processes as revealed in a recent laboratory column experiment comparing the effectiveness of nitrate, chlorate and perchlorate treatments as souring control strategies. Simulation of the laboratory experimental results shows that the model captured the spatio-temporal trend of the chemical species and microbial guilds during both souring and desouring. Model parameters derived through modeling of the column data are utilized in subsequent field-scale model simulations across a set of reservoir relevant environmental conditions. This integrated model demonstrates that interactions between SRBs and other heterotrophs can significantly impact the occurrence and extent of H2S production.",

            "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges for global measurement of snow mass is quantification of the snow microstructure. Radiative transfer models are more sensitive to the snow structure metrics used than to snow depth, so microstructure must be well quantified in order to retrieve snow mass from satellite observations. Principles of physics have been used to simulate microstructure in many years of avalanche and climate research, although these have different accuracy requirements to remote sensing applications.\nGrowth of snow crystals is dependent primarily on the snow temperature gradient, but also the temperature and density of the snow. Forced with the same meteorological data, different models simulate different snow temperatures. Even with the same grain growth assumptions, this leads to different rates of microstructure evolution. This must be taken into consideration if snow models are to be used to give the necessary parameters for retrieval of snow water equivalent.\nThe JULES Investigation Model snow model (JIM) has a highly configurable structure that allows different layering assumptions to be used. It incorporates all major components from existing snow models, which enables the simulation of an ensemble of 1701 members. JIM was used to quantify the impact of different model parameterizations such as snow compaction and thermal conductivity on simulated microstructure (previously referred to as ‘grain size’) for each of four different grain size parameterizations from the Crocus, MOSES, SNICAR and SNTHERM models. The Helsinki University of Technology snow microwave emission model was then used to demonstrate the impact of different snow model assumptions on the simulation of microwave brightness temperature. This paper discusses potential snow mass retrieval errors due to uncertainties in snow parameters from snow evolution models, and how these may be mitigated through techniques such as data assimilation.",

            "abstract": "Marine sea spray aerosols (SSA) make up an important portion of natural aerosols (prior to anthropogenic influence) and are therefore important in establishing the baseline for anthropogenic aerosol climate impacts. One way aerosols impact climate is by scattering solar radiation, and how much light is scattered depends upon the size of aerosols. Aerosols grow larger via water uptake and thus scatter more light at elevated relative humidities. This growth depends on composition. SSA can become enriched in organics during phytoplankton blooms, becoming less salty and therefore less hygroscopic. Aerosol hygroscopicity of SSA sampled during an in-lab phytoplankton bloom were measured during the CAICE-IMPACTS 2014 study. SSA were generated via breaking waves in an enclosed 33 m wave channel filled with natural seawater. Aerosol hygroscopicity was characterized by measuring light extinction at 532 nm of dry aerosols and of aerosols humidified to 85% relative humidity using a Cavity Ringdown Spectrometer. These optical growth factors (humidified extinction/dry extinction) were converted to physical growth factors using Mie Theory calculations and aerosol size distributions measured with a scanning electrical mobility spectrometer (SEMS) and an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS). Growth factors for super- and sub-micron SSA were quantified separately through the use of a PM2.5 cyclone or PM1 impactor. The observed SSA growth factors will be linked to SSA and source water chemical composition determined by both offline and online analysis of samples. The SSA bulk growth factors will also be compared with concurrent measurements of the efficiency with which SSA act as cloud condensation nuclei. Observed SSA growth factors will also be compared to offline hygroscopic growth measurements.",

            "abstract": "The frequency and intensity of cyanobacterial blooms (cyanoblooms) is increasing globally. While cyanoblooms in eutrophic (nutrient-rich) freshwater lakes are expected to persist and worsen with climate change projections, many of the “new” cyanobloom reports pertain to oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) freshwater lakes with no prior history of cyanobloom occurrence. Under the pressures of a changing climate, there exists a critical research need to revisit existing conceptual models and identify cyanobloom regulating factors currently unaccounted for. Iron (Fe) is required in nearly all pathways of cyanobacterial macronutrient use, though its precise role in regulating cyanobacterial biomass across the lake trophic gradient is not fully understood. The hypotheses tested were: (1) cyanobacteria will predominate in lakes when bioavailable Fe concentration is low, and (2) cyanobacteria overcome this Fe limitation in all lakes using the siderophore-based Fe acquisition strategy to scavenge Fe providing a competitive advantage over other phytoplankton. These hypotheses were tested using natural lakes across an oligo-meso-eutrophic gradient across Canada. In all lakes sampled, the relative cyanobacterial biomass was highest at low predicted Fe bioavailability (< 1.0 × 10-19 mol L-1). Within this range of low bioavailable Fe, iron-binding organic ligands were measured. Concentrations of ligands with reactive hydroxamate moieties were positively correlated to cyanobacterial biomass in both the oligotrophic (r2 = 0.77, p < 0.001) and eutrophic (r2 = 0.81, p < 0.001) lakes suggesting a possible low-Fe mediated cellular origin, siderophores. Fe-binding ligands with catecholate-type binding sites were detected in all lakes, although lack of a relationship with cyanobacterial biomass and a significant relationship with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in oligotrophic (r2 = 0.65, p < 0.001) and eutrophic (r2 = 0.65, p < 0.001) lakes may indicate an allochthonous source that is not used by cyanobacteria. These findings suggest that Fe serves as a possible cofactor that maintains cyanobacterial levels across a lake trophic gradient and that cyanobacteria invoke a similar Fe-scavenging system to overcome Fe limitation in lakes of all trophic status.",

Cores were analyzed for assemblage composition of benthic foraminifera and isotopes. 55 samples were analyzed and 227 benthic foraminifera were identified, but only 18 of them showed relative frequencies that contributed to the understanding of both oceanographic dynamics and productivity conditions of the area. There was dominance of Globocassidulina subglobosa, which is considered an indicator of areas with pulses of phytodetritus. Statistical analysis separated samples into different groups according to their location, indicating environmental factors on the continental shelf. Innershore core showed the highest flux of benthic foraminifera and the offshore one showed the major diversity and variation of foraminifera assemblages over time. Mid shelf cores showed little variation of the assemblages and indicate a stable environment. The δ13C values of Uvigerina peregrina indicated more degraded organic matter in the center of the shelf. The mean composition of Cibicides spp. δ13C is, on average, 0.25 ‰ depleted related to the values of δ13CDIC. Such values associated with high frequency of phytodetritus species indicated the formation of a phytodetritus layer at the bottom of the continental shelf of Cabo Frio. The paleotemperature calculated from oxygen isotopes pointed the permanence of SACW at the shelf bottom over the last few centuries.",

This study looks at the cloud fraction output from 6 different CMIP5 global climate models to understand how low-level clouds may respond to increasing CO2 on different time scales. We examine simulations of 1% CO2 increase per year, simulations of 4xCO2 equilibrium change, and simulations employing historical radiative forcing during 1980-2005. In particular, we are interested to determine whether the century-scale transient cloud response is similar to the equilibrium cloud response, and whether simulated cloud changes occurring since 1980 are similar to the century-scale transient cloud response. Although different models produce different cloud responses to increasing CO2, the transient cloud change for a particular model resembles the equilibrium cloud change for that model, indicating internal consistency. Furthermore, if the simulated cloud change since 1980 resembles the century-scale transient cloud change, this would suggest that observed low-level cloud changes over the subtropical ocean since 1980 may be a response to climate change rather than natural variability.",

The technique is useful for producing a scale-explicit overview of the structures beneath a gravity or magnetic survey, including establishing the location and estimating the attitude of surface features, as well as incorporating information about the geometric class (point, line, surface, volume, fractal) of the underlying sources — in a fashion much like traditional structural indices from Euler solutions albeit with better areal coverage. Hornby et al. (2002) show that worms form the locally highest concentration of horizontal edges of a given strike — which in conjunction with the results from Mallat and Zhong (1992) induces a (non-unique!) inversion where the worms are physically interpretable as lateral boundaries in a source distribution that produces a close approximation of the observed potential field. The technique has enjoyed widespread adoption and success in the Australian mineral exploration community — including “ground truth” via successfully drilling structures indicated by the worms.\nUnfortunately, to our knowledge, all implementations of the code to calculate the worms/multiscale edges (including Horowitz’ original research code) are either part of commercial software packages, or have copyright restrictions that impede the use of the technique by the wider community.\nThe technique is completely described mathematically in Hornby et al. (1999) along with some later publications. This enables us to re-implement from scratch the code required to calculate and visualize the worms. We are freely releasing the results under an (open source) BSD two-clause software license. A git repository is available at <https://bitbucket.org/fghorow/BSDWormer.git>.\nWe will give an overview of the technique, show code snippets using the codebase, and present visualization results for example datasets (including the Surat basin of Australia, and the Lake Ontario region of North America).\nWe invite you to join us in creating and using the best worming software for potential fields in existence — as both gratis and libre software!",

We address this challenge using a Berkeley Ice Sheet Initiative for Climate at Extreme Scales (BISICLES) ice sheet model with a new 250 m resolution conditional simulation of the bed beneath Thwaites Glacier and its catchment area. The new bed topography was created by interpolating aerogeophysical observations to a fine grid using inhomogeneous statistics with channelized morphology and a realistic small-scale roughness. The primary interest here is understanding how (and why) the more realistic bed geometry affects model behavior and projections of future change, relative to projections made using simpler bed geometries. We use the same forcing as prior work on the Thwaites and Pine Island Glacier systems--parameterized warm water incursion beneath the floating glacier terminus--and compare the resulting grounding line retreat to retreat simulated using the same model with a standard 1 km resolution basal elevation data set.",

The goals of this study were to compare Thermoproteales sequences from different geothermal environments across YNP, and determine the variation in metabolic potential associated with their distribution. Thermoproteales sequence assemblies (> 0.5 Mbases) were curated from 10 habitats ranging in pH from 3 - 9 (with or without dissolved sulfide). The distribution of specific Thermoproteales is constrained by pH: Vulcanisaeta-like sequences are the most abundant Thermoproteales at pH < 6, Caldivirga-like sequences more important from pH 4 - 6, and Thermoproteus-like sequences abundant from ~ pH 5 - 7, and at pH > 7, Pyrobaculum­-like sequences are nearly the only Thermoproteales present. Thermoproteales populations are generally found in hypoxic systems where reduced forms of S and As often limit concentrations of dissolved oxygen. These environmental conditions are correlated with the presence or absence of system-defined respiratory complexes including different terminal oxidases (e.g., aa3 or bd), numerous DMSO-molybdopterins, and dissimilatory sulfate reductases. Metabolic reconstruction of different genera revealed similar pathways for the degradation of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids across sites. Only the Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum populations contained the three marker genes for the dicarboxylate/4-hyhdroxybutyrate cycle, which is responsible for the fixation of inorganic carbon. Most Thermoproteales populations have the metabolic capacity to synthesize their requirements for vitamins, cofactors, amino acids, and/or nucleotides. Our results indicate that Thermoproteales populations are important members of high-temperature microbial communities across a wide pH range, are responsible for the degradation of organic carbon, and may also serve as a source of metabolites required by other community members. Thermoproteales genera are abundant thermophiles in many hypoxic (and especially sulfidic) systems; however, the presence of introns in the 16S rRNA gene of many Thermoproteales often precludes accurate abundance estimates using universal primers.",

Large increases in carbon and nutrient fluxes within spatially confined zones (hotspots) are significant as drivers for broader cycling. How these processes relate to the transfers between surface and groundwater systems, as well as the transition from freshwater to marine environments, remains poorly understood. We investigated the flux of carbon and water from a freshwater wetland, to a saltmarsh and then mangroves, both within the main surface channel and within a comprehensive shallow groundwater bore network. We were able to characterise the main spatial trends in water gradients and mixing (using salinity, hydraulic gradients, stable water isotopes, and temperature) over seasonal cycles. In addition, at the same time we investigated the changes in dissolved organic carbon concentration and quality (fluorescence, UV), as well as nutrients (NO3, NH4). This revealed the river and tidal channel to be a significant export pathway for organic carbon, which was generally highly aromatic and recalcitrant. However, we also found that isolated sections of the brackish groundwater mixing zone between freshwater and marine provided a consistently high DOC ‘hotspot’ of very high quality carbon. This hotspot has high lateral groundwater gradients and therefore likely transports this carbon to the rest of the mangrove subsurface, where it is rapidly assimilated. These results imply large spatial heterogeneity in the carbon cycling between freshwater and marine environments, and have significant implications for the processing of the organic matter, and therefore also the respiration of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4.",

            "abstract": "The Hosgri fault is the southern part of the regional Hosgri-San Gregorio dextral strike-slip fault system, which extends primarily in the offshore region for about 400 km in central California. Between Morro Bay and San Simeon, high-resolution multibeam bathymetry reveals that the eastern strand of the Hosgri fault is crossed by a ~265-m-wide slope interpreted as the shoreface of a relict sand spit that formed during a period of relatively slower sea-level rise (Younger Dryas stadial) in the latest Pleistocene. This sand spit crossed an embayment and connected a western fault-bounded bedrock peninsula and an eastern bedrock highland, a paleogeography similar to modern geomorphology along coastal segments of the San Andreas fault. Detailed analysis of the relict shoreface with slope profiles and slope maps indicates a lateral slip rate of 2.6 ± 0.9 mm/yr. Because the Hosgri fault locally includes an active western strand, and regionally converges with several other faults, this slip rate should be considered a minimum for the Hosgri fault in central California and should not be applied for the entire Hosgri-San Gregorio fault system. This slip rate indicates that the Hosgri system takes up the largest share of the strike-slip fault budget and is the most active strike-slip fault west of the San Andreas fault in central California. This result further demonstrates the value and potential of high-resolution bathymetry in earthquake-hazard characterization of active offshore faults.",

            "abstract": "On-line learning is already revolutionizing higher education, and emerging cloud-based Geographic Information System (GIS) capabilities are poised to revolutionize the acquisition and sharing of spatial knowledge in a variety of fields. In this project, we deployed ESRI’s ArcGIS Online in an on-line course environment to provide a place-based quantitative exploration of the impacts of environmental changes specifically related to climate change.\nAs spatial thinking is not necessarily transferrable from one domain to another, we hypothesized that combining spatial literacy and climate change domain knowledge would transform student conceptions and mental models of climate change in measurable ways. To this end, we adapted and employed existing instruments for pre- post testing of general pattern recognition, interpretation, and spatial transformational skills, as well as climate system content knowledge and attitudes.\nA collaborative on-line course platform offered to students from University of Nebraska, Lincoln and from City College of New York (CUNY) colleges, Brooklyn and Lehman, brought to the discussion distinct urban and rural perspectives, which were the basis of place-based climate, water and food explorations in the course. The course has been offered 3 times in a shared LMS over the past 3 years.\nParticipants in the most recent iteration of the course demonstrated statistically significant improvements in spatial skills, but they did not show the expected statistically significant improvement overall in climate knowledge that we see in other online courses where climate change literacy is the sole focus of the course. Ongoing research by our team shows strong correlation between active peer engagement in online discussions and student learning outcomes. Student-initiated discussions in the GIS-based climate change courses revealed a shift away from discussing the climate change science and a focus on technology and analyzing the spatial products created using GIS. As we improve the effectiveness of this course, we will be developing interventions in the discussion board activities that we hypothesize will increase the effectiveness of climate knowledge construction in future iterations.",

            "abstract": "Observations in different subduction zones have suggested that overpressured fluids close to the plate interface may be related to the origin of nonvolcanic tremors (NVT) and low frequency earthquakes (LFE). One condition for a causal relationship to exist between fluids and such seismicity is their spatial collocation. Fluids at nearly lithostatic pressures within the top few kilometers of the oceanic crust have been inferred in several subduction zones, including the province of Guerrero, Mexico. However, NVT hypocentral depths in this region have been poorly resolved so that casualty could not even be tested as a hypothesis. In this work, we report NVT relocations from a 3-year-catalog in Guerrero that includes the period of the Slow Slip Earthquake (SSE) of 2006. We used a new location technique called the “Tremor Energy and Polarization” (TREP) method (Cruz-Atienza et al., JGR, 2014), which jointly determines the source location and focal mechanism of sustained tremor signals by simultaneously inverting (1) the energy spatial distribution, (2) the energy spatial derivatives, and (3) the azimuthal direction of the particle motion polarization ellipsoid. In agreement with previous works, NVT epicentral locations concentrate between 200 and 230 km from the trench and then migrate ~40 km trenchward during the occurrence of the SSE. However, unlike earlier investigations, most NVT hypocenters lie at 43 km depth near the plate interface and have subparallel rake angles to the Cocos plate convergence direction. These results are consistent with independent locations and mechanisms of LFE in the region and allow us to examine the casualty hypothesis mentioned above. Poroelastic modeling of fluid transport during two SSEs in Guerrero (Villafuerte and Cruz-Atienza, AGU, 2014) show that fluids migrate towards the spots where this seismicity occurs with maximum velocities between 10-3 and 10-9 km/day, which are more than 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the LFE migration speeds. We conclude that fluid diffusive transport is not responsible of the NVT and LFE migration during the SSEs but instead that slip transients act as a long-term pumping process decreasing the effective pressure where the seismicity takes place as a consequence of small stress perturbations associated to the propagation of the aseismic slip.",

            "abstract": "Determining the chemical speciation of carbon and nitrogen in environmental samples is important for understanding the role of organic matter in contamination mobility and nutrient cycling. Despite these important applications, bulk soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, particularly at the carbon K-edge has not been extensively applied to environmental samples until recently. The primary reasons for this gap is the lack of beamline endstations that are suitable for ‘dirty’ samples and the technical challenges related to acquiring and normalizing spectra from dilute samples.\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the C K-edge probes the local bonding environment of C and N. Bulk XAS techniques permit for high throughput, the study of whole soils and high sampling density. These analyses are complementary to X-ray transmission microscopy (STXM) techniques which are limited by low throughput, thin particles (<100 nm) and low sampling density. In many projects, these bulk XAS measurements may be essential to understanding large scale processes in soils such as the global C cycle.\nTechnical challenges have been largely overcome through the use of customized energy selective silicon drift detectors which enable the carbon signal to be detected separately from the signals from higher order light such as oxygen (i.e., partial fluorescence yield). Accurate normalization is now possible using the X-ray scattering signal from Au coated Si wafers as the Io. The radiation dose was minimized using a monochromator slew scanning mode in conjunction with the development of software tools to automatically sample of multiple pristine spots on a sample. Technical developments and recent applications will be presented, showing how bulk C and N XAS is now positioned to contribute significantly to advancing the characterization of organic matter in soils and environmental samples.",

            "abstract": "In order to measure sediment flux in Porter Creek, a small tributary to the North Fork of the Siuslaw River near Florence Oregon, we have deployed ~600 pieces of tracer gravel embedded with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, 8 fixed antennas, and 9 logging pressure transducers spaced along 130 m of channel comprising 3 wood jams and substrates of sand, gravel, cobble, and bedrock. Tracer deployment is uniform along the instrumented reach, analogous to constant-source solute or dye injection, so that sediment flux [L3/T] for the ith grain size class is Qi = niVpiFi/fTi, where ni is count rate, [T-1], Vpi is particle volume, and Fi and fTi are fractional coverage of the ith size class of grains and tracers, respectively. Tracer concentrations, fTi, must be large enough for accurate estimation of ni = 1/TAi where TAi is the mean inter-arrival time of tracers at an antenna, during a period of nearly constant discharge. A square wave or constant sediment injection is undertaken by placing a concentration of tracers dispersed upstream of the study reach, such that it will add to the concentration within the study reach as gravels migrate downstream, replacing the gravels within the antenna network. Preliminary results show dispersion values ranging from ~7 m2/month for 8-16mm size fraction, to ~0.2 m2/month for 32-64mm size fraction, with travel distances of 60 meters for the 8-16mm, 16 meters for the 16-32mm, 8 meters for the 32-64mm, and 4 meters for the >64mm for 1 water year. Since there is a high level of variability in dispersion within the antennae array given the heterogeneity of substrates and wood placed within the system, it is likely that some tracers will need to be added within the regions between antennae after high water events. The tracer concentration within the regions occupied between antennae must remain at such a level as to provide viable statistical relationships between tracer and non-tracer gravels, and percent mobile versus percent stationary.",

We have developed a unified air-sea interface module that couples multiple atmosphere, wave, and ocean models using the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF). It is a physically based and computationally efficient coupling system that is flexible to use in a multi-model system and portable for transition to the next generation research and operational coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean-land models. This standardized coupling framework allows researchers to develop and test air-sea coupling parameterizations and coupled data assimilation, and to better facilitate research-to-operation activities. It also allows for ensemble forecasts that can be used for coupled atmosphere-ocean data assimilation and assessment of uncertainties in coupled model predictions. The coupled modeling system has been evaluated using the coupled air-sea observations (e.g., GPS dropsondes and AXBTs, ocean drifters and floats) collected in recent field campaigns in the Gulf of Mexico and TCs in the Atlantic and Pacific basins. This talk will provide 1) an overview of the unified air-sea interface model, 2) fully coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean model predictions of TCs and evaluation with coupled air-sea observations, and 3) results from high-resolution (1.3 km grid resolution) ensemble experiments using a stochastic kinetic energy backscatter (SKEB) perturbation method to assess the predictability and uncertainty in TC predictions.",

We have developed a methodology to transform an existing science application code into a web service using a Python wrapper interface and Python web service frameworks. The web-service system, called Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer (CMDA), currently supports (1) all the observational datasets from Obs4MIPs and a few ocean datasets from NOAA and Argo, which can serve as observation-based reference data for model evaluation, (2) many of CMIP5 model outputs covering a broad range of atmosphere, ocean, and land variables from the CMIP5 specific historical runs and AMIP runs, and (3) ECMWF reanalysis outputs for several environmental variables in order to supplement observational datasets. Analysis capabilities currently supported by CMDA are (1) the calculation of annual and seasonal means of physical variables, (2) the calculation of time evolution of the means in any specified geographical region, (3) the calculation of correlation between two variables, (4) the calculation of difference between two variables, and (5) the conditional sampling of one physical variable with respect to another variable. A web user interface is chosen for CMDA because it not only lowers the learning curve and removes the adoption barrier of the tool but also enables instantaneous use, avoiding the hassle of local software installation and environment incompatibility. CMDA will be used as an educational tool for the summer school organized by JPL’s Center for Climate Science in 2014. In order to support 30+ simultaneous users during the school, we have deployed CMDA to the Amazon cloud environment. The cloud-enabled CMDA will provide each student with a virtual machine while the user interaction with the system will remain the same through web-browser interfaces. The summer school will serve as a valuable testbed for the tool development, preparing CMDA to serve its target community: Earth-science modeling and model-analysis community.",

In this study, we investigate poorly understood Sabzpushan Fault Zone (SFZ) within the central part of the Zagros Mountains for spatial variability of neo-tectonic indices. This fault zone is characterized by differential uplift, high neo-tectonic signature and seismic activities in recent past. Field studies have revealed that the SFZ is dividable into three morpho-tectonic segments (northern, middle and southern) with en-echelon array. The neo-tectonic activity of each segment is obtained through DEM analysis using geomorphic indices including the mountain front sinuosity, hypsometric integral, asymmetry factor, stream length–gradient index and valley floor width to valley height ratio. The results illustrate differentiation in the states of activity between those segments at which the middle segment show the highest value. For instance, the mean value of stream-gradient index (SL) of the middle segment is 597.7, whereas this index is 387.5 and 535.4 for the northern and southern segments respectively. This pattern of variation is consistent with recent seismicity, preserved fault scarps, triangular facets and deeply incised valleys along the middle segment of the SFZ.",

A warming climate is reshaping Arctic ecosystems, bringing changes such as the loss of sea ice and glaciers, thawing of permafrost, and changing snow patterns. These shifts challenge Arctic citizens who must adapt to new environmental conditions, and have significant global implications. A 2014 National Research Council report, The Arctic in the Anthropocene: Emerging Research Questions, identifies research questions important for understanding how environmental and societal transitions will affect the Arctic and the rest of the world. It also assesses what is required to address these questions, and points to the need to translate research findings into practical information that can help guide management and policy decisions. Drawing upon the report, this presentation will focus on the scientific research questions identified under five categories: Evolving Arctic, Hidden Arctic, Connected Arctic, Managed Arctic, and Undetermined Arctic. It will also address methods to meet the challenges and assess what is needed to leverage efficiencies in making Arctic research happen, from collaboration and coordination to sustained observations, building human and operational capacity, making information actionable as well as accessible, and possible changes in funding approaches. It will demonstrate that fostering a sense of shared purpose to manage change to the best of our abilities is essential, as is a continued commitment to studying what exists, what is emerging, and what awaits us in the Arctic.",

In this talk, we present a novel trade-off concept comparing diverse groups of pollutants: environmental flows, micropollutants (heavy metals, pesticides, estrogen compounds) and nutrients in a test watershed (Jacksons Creek), in the vicinity of Melbourne. A reservoir in the upper watershed, and a wastewater treatment plant (WTP) are the main sources of flow into Jacksons Creek. The current land use is a mix of agriculture, and rural, though rapid urbanization is anticipated with a 40% increase in the population by 2040. The creek is impacted by: 1) low flow, especially during dry periods (contribution from the reservoir drops dramatically), 2) nutrient enrichment (WTP and agricultural runoff), and 3) micropollutants-heavy metals (urban runoff), estrogenic compounds (WTP), and pesticides (agricultural runoff).\nIn this offset framework, we evaluated current and future scenarios to identify the main stressor in Jacksons Creek. We collected monitoring data at 15 sites for separate 3 events. Then we developed a watershed model to assess sources of pollutant loads to the creek, using two different tools, Model for Urban Stormwater Improvement Conceptualisation (MUSIC) for the preliminary flow and water quality modeling, and eWater Source for integrated water resource management (IWRM), and a decision support system for stakeholders. Scenario analysis includes urbanization and population growth, and anticipated discharges from WTP and the reservoir.\nMeasured nutrient concentrations were high for all sampling events. Micropollutants were detected at a concentration higher than the trigger value at several locations. Preliminary analysis shows that low flow is one of the major stressors in the creek causing elevated micropollutant and nutrient concentrations (non-point), and that discharge from the WTP is essential to maintain the minimum environmental flows, though nutrient enrichment downstream could occur. This study demonstrates an innovative case for evaluating net environmental benefits, and might hold important lessons for the design of offset schemes in comparable environments elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "Observations of polar mesospheric clouds (PMC), temperature, and water vapor from the Solar Occultation For Ice Experiment (SOFIE) on NASA’s Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere satellite are used to quantify the sensitivity of PMCs to their environment. These results are extended to 35 years of PMC observations by the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV), indicating that the bright PMCs detected by SBUV are ~half as sensitive to environmental changes as the entire PMC population detected by SOFIE. A new approach for retrieving PMC vertical column ice mass abundance (or ice water content, IWC) from SBUV measurements was developed. The method employs a rigorous forward model that accounts for both ice particle size and shape in the interpretation of SBUV observations. The SBUV multi-wavelength measurements (252 - 283 nm) are found to contain information sufficient for inferring ice particle size, and this information is included to self-consistently retrieve IWC from the SBUV data. For the subset of bright PMCs observed by SBUV, SBUV PMC radii are within 23% of SOFIE on average and SBUV IWC is within 8% of SOFIE. The analysis is extended to the 35-year SBUV record of IWC by limiting the time series to between 9 and 15 local solar time, to avoid introducing tidally induced variations to the time-series. SBUV results near 70 degrees North latitude indicate a statistically significant increasing IWC trend of ~4% per decade, and no significant trend in particle size. This IWC trend can be explained in part by a decline in solar Lyman-alpha flux since 1979, and in part by stratospheric forcing.",

            "abstract": "The peridotite section of the Samail Ophiolite, Sultanate of Oman is a site of ongoing low temperature serpentinization and carbonation. We present geochemical data for waters collected from boreholes in the peridotite to help describe subsurface water-rock reactions and rates. We constrained groundwater age using 3H-3He dating, He accumulation, dissolved noble gas thermometry, and stable isotopes (δ2H, δ18O). Dissolved gas samples were collected from boreholes and used to estimate ongoing serpentinization rates.\nBoreholes in peridotite contain two water types: Type I Mg2+-HCO3- water and Type II Ca2+-OH- water. All of our groundwater dating techniques suggest boreholes with Type I water contain modern recharge. Type I boreholes have 3H-3He dates of 0-40 years, 3He/4He ratios similar to the atmosphere, and low levels of He accumulation. Noble gas thermometry shows recharge temperatures of 32oC, the modern mean annual ground temperature. Stable isotopes in Type I waters fall between the northern and southern local meteoric water lines, similar to other modern northern Oman groundwaters (Weyhenmeyer et al., Wat. Resour. Res., 2002). In contrast, Type II hyperalkaline groundwaters from boreholes in peridotite appear to be significantly older. Waters have pre-bomb 3H levels, and significant He accumulation from sources such as crustal production from radioactive decay or mantle He. Noble gas temperatures range from 30oC to 25oC, with the cooler samples potentially having recharged during a glacial period. Stable isotopes for Type II waters plot either between the northern and southern meteoric water lines or are enriched in δ18O. The enrichment may be due to evaporation or a change in the source of local water vapor during glacial periods.\nDissolved gases from boreholes with Type I water are primarily N2, while gases from boreholes with Type II water include millimolar concentrations of H2, CH4, or both. These dissolved gases suggest the Type II boreholes are in or near areas of active low temperature serpentinization. Serpentinization rates calculated from dissolved gas concentrations and groundwater flow vary from 4x10-8 to 2x10-6 volume fraction peridotite serpentinized per year.",

The Bolivian high is an upper-level (200 hPa) anticyclone that develops during the summer over the Bolivian Altiplano, a high plateau region of the Central Andes. The position and intensity of this high-pressure cell has been related to the seasonal variation in Amazonian rainfall. This study used the Real-time Multivariate MJO index created by Wheeler and Hendon to examine the impacts and intensification of Bolivian high using daily rainfall data from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and 6-hourly atmospheric fields from the ECMWF Interim reanalysis (ERA Interim). Enhance of precipitation filtered for 20-100-day during 3 to 6 MJO phase is accompanied by a significant suppression of high level zonal winds near northern South Atlantic coast and vice versa, i.e., suppressed precipitation for the same filtered data is associated with an enhancement of the wind near South Atlantic coast, for 8 to 1 phase. Intensification and positioning slightly more southwest of the Bolivian high was observed when there was an increase in convection associated with MJO. This convection enhancement increases the magnitude of the divergence at high levels that consequently favored convection.",

Carefully choosing this set of defining stations allows their geophysical motion to be accurately modeled by a superposition of just linear displacements, harmonic seasonal modes, and when needed, a few discontinuities.

            "abstract": "The coral skeleton barium to calcium ratio (Ba/Cacoral), a proxy for seawater barium concentration (BaSW), has been interpreted as an upwelling tracer based on the “nutrient like” depth profile of BaSW. However, terrestrial runoff and differences between the vertical distribution of BaSW and that of the major nutrients in the upper water column can compromise the reliability of Ba/Cacoral as an upwelled nutrient proxy in some coastal locations. For example, a 6-month time series record of BaSW, SST, SSS, and surface nutrients in the Gulf of Panamá shows that maximum seasonal inputs from terrestrial runoff occur during the upwelling minimum. In contrast to nutrients, BaSW variations resulting from upwelling are overwhelmed by the runoff influence at this location. High resolution Ba/Cacoral records from multiple colonies of Porites lobata, Pavona gigantea, and Pavona clavus corals growing during this period record the nearly two-fold runoff-induced change in BaSW in Gulf of Panamá surface waters as an ~20-70% increase in skeletal Ba/Ca, providing an opportunity to calibrate the Ba proxy with a contemporaneous BaSW record. Compiling the Ba/Cacoral records from three co-located colonies of each species into taxa-specific composite regressions reveal statistically significant correlations with the BaSW time-series (r2=0.7; p <0.001). The application of the Pavona clavus calibration to a previously published Galapágos Ba/Cacoral record and offsets in regression variables between taxa demonstrate the necessity of using taxa-specific calibrations for quantitative BaSW reconstructions. Similar studies using longer high-resolution multi-colony records could further our understanding of intercolony-reproducibility and reduce the uncertainty in the regressions. These results support the application of Ba/Cacoral to reconstruct past changes in BaSW and underscore the value of combining multiple skeletal proxies to provide a complete picture of surface water biogeochemistry.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) derived from isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX), produced from isoprene oxidation under low-NO conditions, can account for a substantial fraction of organic aerosol (OA) in biogenic dominated areas. In this study, IEPOX-SOA was identified from measurements at the forested southeast US supersite (Centreville, AL) during the SOAS campaign using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) of aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurement. By combining SOAS results with other field and lab studies, characteristics of IEPOX-SOA spectra in AMS are systematically evaluated. fC5H6O (The fraction of OA measured at C5H6O+, the major ion at m/z 82) in AMS spectra is shown to be a good tracer for IEPOX-SOA. We observed statistically higher fC5H6O in OA from regions with strong isoprene emissions (3×10-3 - 25×10-3) vs. that from urban and biomass-burning plumes (0 - 3.5×10-3, an avg. of 1.75 ×10-3). In isoprene-influenced areas, fC5H6O in ambient OA decreases with OA aging. The decay of fC5H6O in fCO2 vs fC5H6O scatter plot suggests that physical mixing of air masses might play a more important role in ambient atmosphere. Analyzing the decay of IEPOX-SOA in an oxidation flow reactor results in an empirical kOH for IEPOX-SOA chemical aging of 5.310-13 cm3 molec.−1 s−1, equivalent to an OH lifetime of 2 weeks (OH avg. of 1.5×106 molec. cm-3). The thermograms of IEPOX-SOA suggest similar or lower volatility than for the bulk OA, indicating that most of the IEPOX-SOA will not evaporate under any atmospheric conditions. This contrasts with the small semivolatile molecules that have been identified so far as IEPOX-SOA components. Finally, we develop a simplified method to estimate ambient IEPOX-SOA mass concentrations as a function of C5H6O+, which is shown to perform well compared to the full PMF method. When only unit mass resolution data is available the method performs less well due to increased interferences from other ions at m/z 82. Estimated IEPOX-SOA concentrations in the southeast US from an aircraft campaign correlate well with IEPOX-related species detected by other techniques, which confirms the validity of this method applied here. IEPOX-SOA accounts for 14-17% of the OA in the SE US. We explore the dependence of IEPOX-SOA on key parameters such as acidity, sulfate, and gas-phase IEPOX concentrations.",

Building upon Basins at Risk (BAR) research, our team used updated Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database georeferenced social and environmental data, quantitative data from global indices, and qualitative data from news media sources. Our assessment considered a combination of analyzing 15 global indices related to water or human security to identify which countries scored as highest risk in each index. From this information, we were able to assess the highest risk countries’ human security risk by using a new human security measurement tool, as well as comparing this analysis to the World Bank’s Fragile States Index and the experimental Human Security Index. In addition, we identified which countries have the highest number of shared basins, the highest percentage of territory covered by a transboundary basin, and the highest dependency of withdrawal from transboundary waters from outside their country boundaries.\nBy synthesizing these social and environmental data assessments, we identified five countries to analyze as case studies. These five countries are Afghanistan, China, Iraq, Moldova, and Sudan. We created a series of 30 maps to spatial analyze the relationship between the transboundary basins and social and environmental parameters to include population, institutional capacity, and physical geography by country. Finally, we synthesized our spatial analysis, Human Security Key scores, and current events scored by using the BAR scale to determine what aspects and which basins are most at risk with each country in our case studies and how this concerns future global water resources.",

            "abstract": "We have assembled a new dataset to refine the 3D seismic velocity model in the Parkfield region. The S arrivals from 184 earthquakes recorded by the Parkfield Experiment to Record MIcroseismicity and Tremor array (PERMIT) during 2010-2011 were picked by a new S wave picker, which is based on machine learning. 74 blasts have been assigned to four quarries, whose locations were identified with Google Earth. About 1000 P and S wave arrivals from these blasts at permanent seismic network were also incorporated. Low frequency earthquakes (LFEs) occurring within non-volcanic tremor (NVT) are valuable for improving the precision of NVT location and the seismic velocity model at greater depths. Based on previous work (Shelley and Hardebeck, 2010), waveforms of hundreds of LFEs in same family were stacked to improve signal qualify. In a previous study (McClement et al., 2013), stacked traces of more than 30 LFE families at the Parkfileld Array Seismic Observatory (PASO) have been picked. We expanded our work to include LFEs recorded by the PERMIT array. The time-frequency Phase Weight Stacking (tf-PWS) method was introduced to improve the stack quality, as direct stacking does not produce clear S-wave arrivals on the PERMIT stations. This technique uses the coherence of the instantaneous phase among the stacked signals to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the stack. We found that it is extremely effective for picking LFE arrivals (Thurber et al., 2014). More than 500 P and about 1000 S arrivals from 58 LFE families were picked at the PERMIT and PASO arrays. Since the depths of LFEs are much deeper than earthquakes, we are able to extend model resolution to lower crustal depths. Both P and S wave velocity structure have been obtained with the tomoDD method. The result suggests that there is a low velocity zone (LVZ) in the lower crust and the location of the LVZ is consistent with the high conductivity zone beneath the southern segment of the Rinconada fault that was revealed in the 3D magnetotelluric inversion of Tietze and Ritter(2013).",

            "abstract": "Due to recent changes in the Arctic environment, it is important to monitor the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) properties over the Arctic Ocean, especially to explore the variability in ABL clouds (such as sensitivity and feedback to sea ice loss). For example, radiosonde and satellite observations of the Arctic ABL height (and low-cloud cover) have recently suggested a positive response to sea ice loss during October that may not occur during the melt season (June-September). Owing to its high vertical and spatiotemporal resolution, an independent ABL height detection algorithm using GPS Radio Occultation (GPS-RO) refractivity in the Arctic is explored. Similar GPS-RO algorithms developed previously typically define the level of the most negative moisture gradient as the ABL height. This definition is favorable for subtropical oceans where a stratocumulus-topped ABL is often capped by a layer of sharp moisture lapse rate (coincident with the temperature inversion). The Arctic Ocean is also characterized by stratocumulus cloud cover, however, the specific humidity does not frequently decrease in the ABL capping inversion. The use of GPS-RO refractivity for ABL height retrieval therefore becomes more complex. During winter months (December-February), when the total precipitable water in the troposphere is a minimum, a fairly straightforward algorithm for ABL height retrieval is developed. The applicability and limitations of this method for other seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall) is determined. The seasonal, interannual and spatial variability in the GPS-derived ABL height over the Arctic Ocean, as well as its relation to the underlying surface (ice vs. water), is investigated. The GPS-RO profiles are also explored for the evidence of low-level moisture transport in the cold Arctic environment.",

            "abstract": "Areal expansion of trees on gravel beds and sand bars has been a serious problem for river management in Japan. From the viewpoints of ecological restoration and flood control, it would be necessary to accurately predict the vegetation dynamics for a long period of time. This presentation tries to evaluate both vegetation overgrowth tendency and flood protection safety in an integrated manner for several vegetated channels in Kako River, Japan. The predominant tree species in Kako River are willows and bamboos. The evaluation employs a stochastic process model, which has been developed for statistically evaluating flow and vegetation status in a river course through the Monte Carlo simulation. The model for vegetation dynamics includes the effects of tree growth, mortality by flood impacts, and infant tree invasion. Through the Monte Carlo simulation for several cross sections in Kako River, responses of the vegetated channels are stochastically evaluated in terms of the changes of discharge magnitude and channel geomorphology. The result shows that the river channels with high flood protection priority are extracted from the several channel sections with the corresponding vegetation status. The present investigation suggests that the stochastic analysis could be one of the powerful diagnostic methods for river management.",

            "abstract": "According to previous researches, the influence of the some earthquakes can be detected by groundwater monitoring. Even in some countries groundwater monitoring is being used as an important tool to identify earthquake precursors and prediction measures. Thus, in this study we attempt to catch the anomalous changes in groundwater produced by earthquakes occurred in Korea through the National Groundwater Monitoring Network (NGMN).\nFor observing the earthquake impacts on groundwater more effectively, from the National Groundwater Monitoring Network we selected 28 stations located in the five earthquake-prone zones in South Korea. And we searched the responses to eight earthquakes with M ≥2.5 which occurred in the vicinity of five earthquake-prone zones in 2012. So far, we tested the groundwater monitoring data (water-level, temperature and electrical conductivity). Those data have only been treated to remove barometric pressure changes. Then we found 29 anomalous changes, confirming that groundwater monitoring data can provide valuable information on earthquake effects.\nTo identify the effect of the earthquake from mixture signals of water-level, other signals must be separated from the original data. Periodic signals will be separated from the original data using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). After that we will attempt to separate precipitation effect, and determine if the anomalies were generated by earthquake or not.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) is a system that can provide a few to tens of seconds warning prior to ground shaking at a user’s location. The goal and purpose of such a system is to reduce, or minimize, the damage, costs, and casualties resulting from an earthquake. A demonstration earthquake early warning system (ShakeAlert) is undergoing testing in the United States by the UC Berkeley Seismological Laboratory, Caltech, ETH Zurich, University of Washington, the USGS, and beta users in California and the Pacific Northwest. The beta users receive earthquake information very rapidly in real-time and are providing feedback on their experiences of performance and potential uses within their organization.\nBeta user interactions allow the ShakeAlert team to discern: which alert delivery options are most effective, what changes would make the UserDisplay more useful in a pre-disaster situation, and most importantly, what actions users plan to take for various scenarios. Actions could include: personal safety approaches, such as drop cover, and hold on; automated processes and procedures, such as opening elevator or fire stations doors; or situational awareness. Users are beginning to determine which policy and technological changes may need to be enacted, and funding requirements to implement their automated controls.\nThe use of models and mobile apps are beginning to augment the basic Java desktop applet. Modeling allows beta users to test their early warning responses against various scenarios without having to wait for a real event. Mobile apps are also changing the possible response landscape, providing other avenues for people to receive information. All of these combine to improve business continuity and resiliency.",

            "abstract": "Psychological thought suggests that social engagement with an environmental problem requires 1) cognitive understanding of the problem, 2) emotional engagement with the problem, and 3) perceived efficacy that there is something we can do to solve the problem. Within the water sciences, we form problem-focused, cross-disciplinary teams to help address complex water resource problems, but often we only seek teammates from other disciplines within the realms of engineering and the natural/social sciences. Here I argue that this science-centric focus fails to fully solve these water resource problems, and often the science goes unheard because it is heavily cognitive and lacks the ability to effectively engage the audience through crucial social-psychological aspects of emotion and efficacy. To solve this, future cross-disciplinary collaborations that seek to include creative actors from the worlds of art, humanities, and design can begin to provide a much stronger overlap of the cognition, emotion, and efficacy needed to communicate the science, engage the audience, and create the solutions needed to solve or world’s most complex water resource problems. Disciplines across the arts, sciences, and engineering all bring unique strengths that, through collaboration, allow for uniquely creative modes of art-science overlap that can engage people through additions of emotion and efficacy that compliment the science and go beyond the traditional cognitive approach. I highlight examples of this art-science overlap in action and argue that water resource collaborations like these will be more likely to have their hydrologic science accepted and applied by those who decide on water resource solutions. For this Pop-up Talk session, I aim to share the details of this proposed framework in the context of my own research and the work of others. I hope to incite discussion regarding the utility and relevance of this framework as a future option for other water resource collaboratives working to solve hydrologic issues across the globe.",

            "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic environmental pollutants originating from the incomplete combustion of organic material, both from natural or anthropogenic sources. Once emitted, they can be transported across thousands of kilometers impacting remote environments. Here, we characterize the distribution of 23 PAHs and 9 oxygenated PAHs (Σ32PAH) in litter and soils in four remote forests in the United States. Concentrations of Σ32PAH in fresh surface litter (Oi layers) showed very low levels in three of the four forests (mixed coniferous forest in Maine, deciduous blue oak forest in California, and a coniferous forest in Washington State), with PAHs levels much lower than those reported in previous studies from Europe. The analysis showed that PAHs represented a mix of regional background sources. Highest PAH levels were observed in a coniferous forest floor in Florida, attributable to frequent prescribed burning of understory vegetation at this site, and supported by high contributions of retene (>7%; compared to <1% at other sites). Σ32PAH increased in deeper, more decomposed organic litter layers, increasing from 57±19 ng g-1 (in Oi layer) to 511± 285 ng g-1 in decomposed, humidified litter layers (Oe and Oa horizons). In mineral soils, Σ32PAH were over an order of magnitude lower (average 37±8 ng g-1), which was attributed to higher bulk densities of mineral soils. However, standardized per unit of organic carbon (OC), Σ32PAH:OC ratios in mineral soils also were below levels observed in overlying litter, indicating a strong sorption capacity of organic horizons for atmospheric deposition. Within mineral soils, Σ32PAH:OC ratios increased with depth (Ah horizons: 750±198 ng g-1; B horizons: 1,202±97 ng g-1), indicating that vertical transfer in mineral soils leads to significant accumulation of PAH in subsoils. ΣPAH:OC increases observed in deeper soil layers may be attributed to slower mineralization rates of PAHs compared to OC, plus vertical transport as indicated by preferential enrichment of PAHs with low Kow (i.e., more water-soluble PAHs). Finally, percentage of potentially biologically produced PAH (Σ Naph+Phen+Pery) were low and consistent across the litter/soil horizons, suggesting that biological production is minor or absent at our sites.",

            "abstract": "The >1000 km by >100 km Franciscan complex of California records >100 Ma of subduction history that terminated with conversion to a transform margin. It affords an ideal natural laboratory to study the rock record of subduction-interface and related processes exhumed from 10-70 km. The Franciscan comprises coherent and block-in-matrix (mélange) units forming a nappe stack that youngs structurally downward in accretion age, indicating progressive subduction accretion. Gaps in accretion ages indicate periods of non-accretion or subduction erosion. The Franciscan comprises siliciclastic trench fill rocks, with lesser volcanic and pelagic rocks and serpentinite derived from the downgoing plate, as well as serpentinite and felsic-intermediate igneous blocks derived as detritus from the upper plate. The Franciscan records subduction, accretion, and metamorphism (including HP), spanning an extended period of subduction, rather than a single event superimposed on pre-formed stratigraphy. Melanges (serpentinite and siliciclastic matrix) with exotic blocks, that include high-grade metamorphic blocks, and felsic-intermediate igneous blocks from the upper plate, are mostly/entirely of sedimentary origin, whereas block-in-matrix rocks formed by tectonism lack exotic blocks and comprise disrupted ocean plate stratigraphy. Mélanges with exotic blocks are interbedded with coherent sandstones. Many blocks-in-melange record two HP burial events followed by surface exposure, and some record three. Paleomegathrust horizons, separating nappes accreted at different times, appear restricted to narrow fault zones of <100’s of m thickness, and <50 m in best constrained cases; these zones lack exotic blocks. Large-scale displacements, whether paleomegathrust horizons, shortening within accreted nappes, or exhumation structures, are accommodated by discrete faults or narrow shear zones, rather than by significant penetrative strain. Exhumation of Franciscan HP units, both coherent and mélange, was accommodated by significant extension of the overlying plate, and possibly extension within the subduction complex, with cross-sectional extrusion, and like subduction burial, took place at different times.",

Under future climate scenarios, megafires may increase in some regions. The danger of smoke exposure from megafires in the future depends on several spatial factors, including the likelihood of megafire occurrence, emission rates, air transport patterns, and population density. We combined climatological transport modeling, smoke emission rates, and population density to determine the areas within the U.S. where a megafire would result in the greatest human exposure to smoke.

Surface boundary conditions are from the 0.14-degree European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric operational model analysis, starting in 2011, including atmospheric pressure forcing. The simulation also includes tidal forcing. A unique feature of this simulation is that we save hourly output of full 3-dimensional model prognostic variables, making it a remarkable tool for the study of ocean processes and for the simulation of satellite observations. Although this initial simulation was run without ocean data constraints, it already presents very interesting features and interactions between an exceptionally wide range of scales. The simulation resolves geostrophic eddies and internal tides and admits submesoscale variability and unbalanced dynamics such as internal waves at non-tidal frequencies.\nWe will present some evaluation of these different components based on altimetry observations and moorings. As a first result, the internal tides for the major tidal components have overall realistic amplitudes and spatial patterns compared to independent analyses from altimetry, although some discrepancies arise in equatorial regions. Despite discrepancies with observations, this simulation already constitutes an extremely useful tool for ocean process studies and for satellite observation system experiments, for example, in preparation for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission. As a preliminary exercise, the simulation has been tested in the SWOT simulator developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Fu et al., in this session). Some illustrations of the challenges will be presented.",

            "abstract": "National needs in the area of space weather informational and predictive tools are growing rapidly. Adverse conditions in the space environment can cause disruption of satellite operations, communications, navigation, and electric power distribution grids, leading to a variety of socio-economic losses and impacts on our security. Future space exploration and most modern human endeavors will require major advances in physical understanding and improved transition of space research to operations. At present, only a small fraction of the latest research and development results from NASA, NOAA, NSF and DoD investments are being used to improve space weather forecasting and to develop operational tools. The power of modern research and space weather model development needs to be better utilized to enable comprehensive, timely, and accurate operational space weather tools. The mere production of space weather information is not sufficient to address the needs of those who are affected by space weather. A coordinated effort is required to support research-to-applications transition efforts and to develop the tools required those who rely on this information. In this presentation we will review datasets, tools and models that have resulted from research by scientists at JHU/APL, and examine how they could be applied to support space weather applications in coordination with other community assets and capabilities.",

            "abstract": "Microbial iron cycling can be found in hot springs throughout Yellowstone National Park, where the process is often visibly apparent as red iron oxyhydroxide staining. We measured rates of microbial and abiotic iron oxidation and reduction in systems ranging from pH 2 to 6 and 40° to 90°C. Measurements of numerous solutes, including oxygen, sulfide, and iron, were also made on outflow channels of springs containing apparent iron metabolism. In all cases, > 16 µM dissolved oxygen was required for visible iron oxidation products to occur. Oxygen concentrations below this level do not necessarily preclude microbial iron oxidation coupled to oxygen, only the accumulation of oxidation products. Kinetics experiments conducted at these iron mats suggest that the rate of microbial iron oxidation falls below the rate of microbial reduction when dissolved oxygen falls below this concentration. In outflow channels, this is often visibly apparent as a sharp boundary between the presence and lack of red iron oxidation products. Locations with changing temperature, pH, flow rate and other factors experience changing oxygen concentrations, which causes the boundary to shift from year to year. The boundaries of iron mats are also influenced in several locations by the concentration of total dissolved sulfide. Experiments with enrichment cultures and field observations show that sulfide is not toxic to iron oxidizers, but rather inhibits the accumulation of dissolved oxygen. Microbial and abiotic sulfide oxidation, leading to visible sulfur precipitation, together with degassing of hydrogen sulfide, contribute to keeping oxygen levels low. Typically, only where sulfide concentrations fall below 20 µM are iron mats able to form. Enrichment cultures of iron oxidizers, however, grow easily at levels exceeding 100 µM sulfide. Only a handful of field locations appear to have simultaneous sulfur and iron precipitation zones. Formation of iron oxidation mats occurs at highly consistent concentrations of dissolved oxygen and sulfide in Yellowstone hot springs, and can even serve as visible indicators of the abundance of these geochemical constituents.",

            "abstract": "The Himalayan collision zone between India and Asia hosts an active geothermal province that spans the border from India into Tibet. Despite significant exploration, commercial development thus far in India is limited to modest use of hot water for heating greenhouses. We sampled nine hot springs in Northwest India, from the Karakoram Fault, across the Indus-Yarlung Suture Zone, to the Main Central Thrust. We analyzed major cation and anion chemistry using ICP-OES. Calcium ranges from 1-220 ppm, potassium from 4-110 ppm, magnesium from 0-60 ppm and sodium from 70-440 ppm. These values are similar to samples analyzed by the Geological Survey of India in previous decades. Preliminary reservoir temperatures calculated using the Fournier & Potter Na-K-Ca-Mg geothermometer range from 100–260°C. No correlations with geologic structure or location across the Himalayan orogen are apparent, and springs located within a few tens of km of each other have apparent temperatures differing by a factor of two. However, these classical geothermometers are subject to large uncertainty in cases where gas has been lost or where there has been dilution of the waters from depth with surface waters. We will use Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s multicomponent geothermometry code, GeoT, to improve the temperature estimation for each geothermal site. Even if reservoir temperatures are not high enough for electricity generation, these springs have the potential to provide cheap heating and cooling for the local communities. We plan to collect additional water samples in neighboring Tibet in the future.",

We first present a theoretical approach to quantify the \"interaction energy\" between new and pre-existing regions by identifying the part of the magnetic potential field energy that couples the new and old flux systems. We then examine this energy in two well-studied cases of flux emergence, but find that the predicted energetic perturbation is very small compared to energies released in large solar flares. Next, we present an observational study of the influence of the emergence new active regions on flare statistics in pre-existing active regions. As part of an effort to precisely determine the emergence time of active regions in a large sample, we find that emergence in about half of these regions exhibits a two-stage behavior, with an initial gradual phase followed by a more rapid phase. Preliminary results regarding flaring suggest that newly emerging regions trigger a marginally significant increase in the occurrence rate of X- and M-class flares in pre-existing regions.",

            "abstract": "Activity at Augustine Volcano, Alaska, has been marked by intermediate composition domes, flows, and tephras during the Holocene. Erosive lahars associated with the 2006 eruption exposed voluminous rhyolite pumice fall beneath glacial tills. The rhyolite is both petrologically and mineralogically different from more recent eruptions, with abundant amphibole (both calcium-amphiboles and cummingtonite) and quartz, both rare in more recent products. Three distinct lithologies are present, with textural and chemical variations between the three. Fe-Ti oxide equilibria indicate temperatures of ~765°C and oxygen fugacities of NNO +1.5. Melt inclusions indicate that the stratigraphically lowest lithology began crystallizing isobarically at ~260 MPa with the contemporary mixed H2O-CO2 fluid phase becoming progressively H2O-rich. The other lithologies were likely crystallized under more H2O-dominated conditions, as indicated by the presence of cummingtonite. Apatites and melt inclusions have generally lower chlorine contents than more recently erupted material, which is typically high in chlorine. Xenocrysts of olivine and clinopyroxene in two of the three lithologies contain mafic (basalt to basaltic andesite) melt inclusions that indicate the likelihood of mixing and/or mingling of magmas as an eruption trigger. We interpret the three lithologies as representative of a smaller pumiceous rhyolite eruption, with subsequent extrusion of a rhyodacite banded lava dome or flow. This was followed by a large-scale rhyolitic pumice eruption that entrained portions of the banded flow as lithic inclusions. The unique qualities of this pre-glacial rhyolite and the potential hazards of a similarly large eruption in modern times indicate that further study is warranted.",

            "abstract": "Calypso is a geodynamo code designed to model magnetohydrodynamics of a Boussinesq fluid in a rotating spherical shell, such as the outer core of Earth. The code has been shown to scale well on computer clusters capable of computing at the order of millions of core hours. Depending on the resolution and time requirements, simulations may require weeks to years of clock time for specific target problems. A significant portion of the code execution time is spent transforming computed quantities between physical values and spherical harmonic coefficients, equivalent to a series of linear algebra operations. Intermixing C and Fortran code has opened the door to the parallel computing platform, Cuda and its associated libraries. We successfully implemented the parallelization of the scaling of the Legendre polynomials by both Schmidt Normalization coefficients, and a set of weighting coefficients; however, the expected speedup was not realized. Specifically, the original version of Calypso 1.1 computes the Legendre transform approximately four seconds faster than the Cuda-enabled modified version. By profiling the code, we determined that the time taken to transfer the data from host memory to GPU memory does not compare to the number of computations happening within the GPU. Nevertheless, by utilizing techniques such as memory coalescing, cached memory, pinned memory, dynamic parallelism, asynchronous calls, and overlapped memory transfers with computations, the likelihood of a speedup increases. Moreover, ideally the generation of the Legendre polynomial coefficients, Schmidt Normalization Coefficients, and the set of weights should not only be parallelized but be computed on-the-fly within the GPU. The end result is that we reduce the number of memory transfers from host to GPU, increase the number of parallelized computations on the GPU, and decrease the number of serial computations on the CPU. Also, the time taken to transform physical values to spherical coefficients, (the Legendre transform), depends on the number of shells of a planetary body, and the truncation level (modes). We investigate the effectiveness of an optimized Cuda-enabled Legendre transformation, by varying state variables, in an effort to improve the performance of these types of codes for models of core dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in deep subsurface reservoirs is an attractive strategy for the mitigation and reduction of global CO2 emissions. Previous studies have identified potential geochemical effects of CO2 gas leaks on overlying groundwater aquifers. However, in addition to CO2, other gasses may also be present. For example, methane (CH4) can be present as an impurity in the CO2 gas stream, a native gas, or can be produced within the reservoir or aquifer after the introduction of CO2.\nContinuous and stop-flow column experiments and batch studies were conducted to determine changes in pH and aqueous elemental concentrations and the fate of contaminants (As and Cd) when CH4 is present in addition to CO2 gas. Two sediment samples were obtained from an aquifer overlying potential CO2 storage reservoirs (High Plains Aquifer, KS). Column experiments were conducted with synthetic groundwater (SGW) or As/Cd spiked SGW saturated with a mixture of 99% CO2and 1% CH4 gases. The spiked SGW contained 114 ppb As and 28 ppb Cd to represent maximum contaminant levels present in CO2 reservoir brines as shown in previous modeling studies. Batch experiments were also conducted with spiked SGW, with CO2 or the CO2/CH4 mixture.\nColumn study results showed most elements followed similar concentration trends after injection of CO2/CH4 saturated SGW or spiked SGW. Cd concentrations remained below detection limits for both sediments, with or without the spike. As concentrations were similar between SGW and spiked SGW columns until after the 3rd stop flow. As levels in the spiked SGW column then increased while levels in the SGW column decreased, suggesting the sediments are the source of effluent As until this point. Similar pH values were also observed until the 3rd stop flow event, where the pH of both SGW columns decreased significantly compared to spiked SGW columns. Batch studies showed As concentrations did not decrease as quickly when CH4 was present with the CO2. The concentrations of other elements, including Cd, followed trends similar to the experiments without CH4. Possible effects of redox changes and differences in mineralogy of the two sediments are under investigation. Results of this study, along with those of our previous efforts, are significant for risk evaluation and site selection for CO2 sequestration.",

Although climate change has been suggested as one of the key factors, very few interdecadal studies comparing HABs to low frequency physical forcing have been performed.\nInterannual to interdecadal variability in sea level and sea surface temperature along the Southern California Coast have been shown to have high correlation with the El Nino-La Nina signal. This is important in the study of phytoplankton, because abnormally low sea level corresponds to increased sea surface nutrient concentrations in this region. The California current is stronger during these times, and the higher nutrient water found to the north is advected southward.\nWe have determined that primary productivity is most highly correlated with interdecadal sea level variability derived from tide gage data at a lag of approximately 2 months. This is consistent with previous zooplankton studies. In preparation for a potential El Nino event, we have expanded our analysis to include parameters such as sea surface temperature, salinity and nutrient concentrations from spaceborne and in situ instruments. We have also expanded our research to allow for analysis of several of the most prevalent HAB species. This work is the first step in our effort to create a model to predict and locate Southern California HAB events in the future.",

            "abstract": "We have performed 3D high resolution simulations of underground explosions conducted recently in jointed rock outcrop as part of the Source Physics Experiment (SPE). The main goal is to understand the nature of the shear motions recorded in the near field at depth. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the genesis of shear motions: 1) sliding on the joints, 2) wave conversion at the material boundaries and 3) non sphericity of the source. We suggest yet another mechanism to be responsible for some shear wave generation when the cracks or joints are present in the rock mass containing the source and the explosive products find their way into the cracks. In order to investigate this mechanism, we have conducted several high resolution simulations of the source region using an Eulerian hydrodynamic code GEODYN. We explored the effect of joint orientations, number of family of fracture, energy deposition, joint aperture size, and joint spacing on the overall development of the source itself, sustained damage around the source and shear wave polarization and motions in the vicinity of the source. We have observed that waves interact with the joints and refraction and diffraction of the wave intensify the complexity of the wave field. It is worth noting that the fracture network topology has also dramatically been affected. It is expected that after the pressure has been released and the energy has been dissipated that source cavity may shrink to a different size but will sustain considerable irreversible damage which affect subsequent shots if they were to be conducted in the vicinity or at the same depth. Fracture network connectivity has drastically changed which will affect wave motions and flow of gases. To explore those effects, we have coupled STOTRAN code, which handles flow, mass and heat transport of fluids and gases in fractures and fractured porous media with the GEODYN code. We will present recent 2D and 3D simulations of typical settings for SPE experiments and discuss the most likely physical phenomena that took place during the SPE campaign.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

The WISPR instrument will implement a high-cadence mode (up to 1 second) in which it will obtain images of the corona and inner heliosphere with high spatial resolution over a restricted field of view around specified regions of interest. Two-dimensional power spectra of the density fluctuations can then be constructed with variable cadences for direct comparison to similar spectra obtained by in-situ instruments on SPP and Solar Orbiter (SO). WISPR will provide density power spectra at or below the spectral break between inertial and injection scales, even at the closest perihelion approach, for different coronal structures. When combined with tomographic information from synoptic images, the WISPR turbulence program will be a major enhancement to the turbulence measurements from the SPP and SO in-situ instruments resulting in a much more robust understanding of the near-Sun turbulence. We will present details of the planned observations and will discuss the coordinated science objectives that can be addressed using these observations.",

            "abstract": "The current Exceptional Drought (US Drought Monitor) over the Western Continental United States (CONUS) warrants an in-depth investigation of possible causes of decreased precipitation. Soot, a mixture of black carbon and organic carbon, can increase in its hygroscopicity by two-fold (at relative humidity of 80%) when coated with sulfuric acid, rendering smaller, although quantitatively more, cloud particles. This has the potential to exacerbate the aridity in the western states. In this study, we examined the role of soot and its possible effect on reducing precipitation west of and over the Rocky Mountains from an online and coupled meteorological and chemical perspective. In particular, we utilized the Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model at the horizontal resolution of 30 km, employing the Fu-Liou-Gu plane-parallel radiation scheme and a three dimensional parametrization over mountainous areas to account for direct and indirect feedback of soot and cloud particles, including ice crystals, to understand precipitation patterns based on simulation results. Identifying factors that can mediate drought severity will improve hydrological prediction, and subsequent resource usage and allocation.",

            "abstract": "Violent conflict and issues surrounding available water resources are both global problems and are connected. Violent conflict is increasingly intrastate in nature and coupled with increased hydrological variability as a function of climate change, there will be increased pressures on water resource use. The majority of mechanisms designed to secure water resources are often based on the presence of a governance framework or another type of institutional capacity, such as offered through a supra- or sub-national organization like the United Nations or a river basin organization. However, institutional frameworks are not present or loose functionality during violent conflict. Therefore, it will likely be extremely difficult to secure water resources for a significant proportion of populations in Fragile and Conflict Affected States. However, the capacity in Organisation for Economic Co‑operation and Development nations for the appropriate interventions to address this problem is reduced by an increasing reluctance to participate in interventionist operations following a decade of expeditionary warfighting mainly in Iraq and Afghanistan, and related defence cuts. Therefore, future interventions in violent conflict and securing water resources may be more indirect in nature.\nThis paper assesses the state of understanding key areas in the present literature and highlights the gap of securing water resources during violent conflict in the absence of institutional capacity. There is a need to close this gap as a matter of urgency by formulating frameworks to assess the lack of institutional oversight / framework for water resources in areas where violent conflict is prevalent; developing inclusive resource management platforms through transparency and reconciliation mechanisms; and developing endogenous confidence-building measures and evaluate how these may be encouraged by exogenous initiatives including those facilitated by the international community.\nThis effort will require the development of collaborations between academic, NGO sectors, and national aid agencies in order to allow the development of the appropriate tools, understanding in a broad range of contexts, and the mechanisms that can be brought to bear to address this increasingly important area.",

The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Earth and Environmental Sciences (SURFEES) program at Chapman University, a primarily undergraduate institution in Southern California, is the site of the first NSF-REU program in the NSF’s Division of Earth Sciences that selects participants exclusively from local partnering community colleges. Building on and now running parallel with a successful internally-funded summer research program already in place and available only to Chapman undergraduates, the SURFEES program incorporates specific mentor and participant pre-experience training, pre-, mid-, and post-assessment instruments, and programming targeted to the earth and environmental sciences as well as to community college students. Perhaps most importantly, the application, selection and pairing of student participants with faculty mentors was conducted with specific goals of identifying those applicants with the greatest potential for a transformative experience while also meeting self-defined targets of under-represented minority, female, and low-income participants. Initial assessment results of the first participant cohort from summer 2014 and lessons learned for creating/adapting an NSF-REU site to involve community college students will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Reanalysis datasets are widely used to understand atmospheric processes and past variability, and are often used as “observations” for comparison with climate model output. Because of the central role of water vapour (WV) and ozone (O3) in climate change, it is important to understand how accurately these species are represented in reanalyses, and whether or not significant differences exist among the eight existing global reanalyses.\nThe SPARC (Stratosphere-troposphere Processes and their Role in Climate) Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (S-RIP) is aimed at improving understanding of reanalysis products and ultimately contributing to future reanalysis developments. In this presentation, we present initial results from the WV and O3component of S-RIP. Comparisons are made over a range of timescales between the different reanalyses, and between reanalyses and independent observational data from sondes, aircraft, and satellites.\nBecause stratospheric O3 is assimilated in the newer reanalyses, the reanalysis O3 fields are evaluated using common error statistics (e.g., observation-background departures) and comparison with independent non-assimilated data. On the other hand, since stratospheric WV data are not currently assimilated, the fidelity of reanalysis WV is sensitive to how accurately the fundamental drivers of stratospheric WV are represented in the reanalyses. We therefore attempt to relate differences in reanalysis WV to processes known to affect WV such as tropical tropopause layer temperatures, tape recorder speed of propagation, amplitude of the QBO response, and extent of polar dehydration. Ensemble trajectory runs coupled with a dehydration model are used to analyse WV variability related to these processes, and to assess the self-consistency of the reanalysis WV fields in the stratosphere.",

            "abstract": "Fine-grained rocks, such as shales, contain a significant amount of nanopores that can significantly contribute to their storage capacity through the mechanism of adsorption. The current ability to extract natural gas that is adsorbed in the rock’s matrix is limited and current technology focuses primarily on the free gas in the fractures, thus leading to very low recovery efficiencies. Shales constitute also a great portion of so-called caprocks above potential CO2 sequestration sites; hereby, the adsorption process may limit the CO2 mobility within the cap-rock, thus minimizing leakage phenomena. Whether it is a reservoir or a caprock, understanding and quantifying the mechanisms of adsorption in these natural materials is key to improve the engineering design of subsurface operations. Results will be presented from a laboratory study that combines conventional techniques for the measurement of adsorption isotherms with novel methods that allows for the imaging of adsorption using x-rays. Various nanoporous materials are considered, thus including rocks, such as shales and coals, pure clay minerals and engineered adsorbents with well-defined nanopore structures, such as zeolites. Supercritical CO2 adsorption isotherms have been measured with a Rubotherm Magnetic Suspension balance by covering the pressure range 0.1-20~MPa. A medical x-ray CT scanner has been used to identify three-dimensional patterns of the adsorption properties of a packed-bed of adsorbent, thus enabling to assess the spatial variability of the adsorption isotherm. The data are analyzed by using thermodynamically rigorous measures of adsorption and a graphical method is applied for their interpretation. The density of the adsorbed phase is estimated and compared to data reported in the literature; the latter is key to disclose gas-reserves and/or potential storage capacity estimates. When evaluated against classic adsorbent materials, the adsorption mechanism in shales is further complicated by the presence of resident fluids (such as oil) that can additionally contribute to their total uptake capacity. This further highlights the need of improving our current understanding of the fundamental mechanisms controlling the uptake and release of fluids in natural nanoporous materials.",

            "abstract": "Seagoing science expeditions offer an ideal opportunity for storytelling. While many disciplines involve fieldwork, few offer the adventure of spending two months at sea on a vessel hundreds of miles from shore with several dozen strangers from all over the world. As a medium, video is nearly ideal for telling these stories; it can capture the thrill of discovery, the agony of disappointment, the everyday details of life at sea, and everything in between.\nAt the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP, formerly the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program), we have used video as a storytelling medium for several years with great success. Over this timeframe, camera equipment and editing software have become cheaper and easier to use, while web sites such as YouTube and Vimeo have enabled sharing with just a few mouse clicks. When it comes to telling science stories with video, the barriers to entry have never been lower.\nAs such, we have experimented with many different approaches and a wide range of styles. On one end of the spectrum, live “ship-to-shore” broadcasts with school groups – conducted with an iPad and free videoconferencing software such as Skype and Zoom – enable curious minds to engage directly with scientists in real-time. We have also contracted with professional videographers and animators who offer the experience, skill, and equipment needed to produce polished clips of the highest caliber. Amateur videographers (including some scientists looking to make use of their free time on board) have shot and produced impressive shorts using little more than a phone camera.\nIn this talk, I will provide a brief overview of our efforts to connect with the public using video, including a look at how effective certain tactics are for connecting to specific audiences.",

Several modifications were implemented in its most recent release (CLM4.5), including a revised photosynthesis scheme and improved hydrology, among an extensive list of updates. Since version 4.0, CLM also includes parameterizations related to photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination. In this study we evaluate the performance of CLM4.5 at the Wind River Field Station AmeriFlux site (US-Wrc), with particular attention to its parameterization of ecosystem drought response. US-Wrc is located near the WA/OR border in a coniferous forest (Douglas-fir/western hemlock), in a region characterized by strongly seasonal climate and summer drought. Long-term meteorological/biological data are available through the AmeriFlux repository (almost a decade of L4 (gap-filled) data available, starting in 1998). Another factor that makes the site so unique is the availability of a decade-long record of carbon isotope ratios (δ13C). Here we run CLM in offline mode, forced by the observed meteorological data, and then compare modeled surface fluxes (CO2, sensible heat, and latent heat) against observed eddy-covariance fluxes. We also use the observed δ13C values to assess the parameterizations of carbon isotope discrimination in the model. We will present the result of the analysis and discuss possible improvements in the model.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is both a powerful greenhouse gas and a key participant in ozone destruction. Microbial activity accounts for over 70% of the N2O produced annually, and the atmospheric concentration of N2O continues to rise. Because the fungal and bacterial denitrification pathways are major contributors to microbial N2O production, understanding the mechanism by which NO is reduced to N2O will contribute to both N2O source tracing and quantification. Our strategy utilizes stable isotopes to probe the enzymatic mechanism of microbial N2O production. Although the use of stable isotopes to study enzyme mechanisms is not new, our approach is distinct in that we employ both measurements of isotopic preferences of purified enzyme and DFT calculations, thereby providing a synergistic combination of experimental and computational approaches.\nWe analyzed δ18O, δ15Nα (central N atom in N2O), and δ15Nβ (terminal N atom) of N2O produced by purified fungal cytochrome P450 nitric oxide reductase (P450nor) from Histoplasma capsulatum as well as bacterial cytochrome c dependent nitric oxide reductase (cNOR) from Paracoccus denitrificans. P450nor exhibits an inverse kinetic isotope effect for Nβ (KIE = 0.9651) but a normal isotope effect for both Nα (KIE = 1.0127) and the oxygen atom (KIE = 1.0264). These results suggest a mechanism where NO binds to the ferric heme in the P450nor active site and becomes Nβ. Analysis of the NO-binding step indicated a greater difference in zero point energy in the transition state than the ground state, resulting in the inverse KIE observed for Nβ. Following protonation and rearrangement, it is speculated that this complex forms a FeIV-NHOH- species as a key intermediate. Our data are consistent with the second NO (which becomes Nα and O in the N2O product) attacking the FeIV-NHOH- species to generate a FeIII-N2O2H2 complex that enzymatically (as opposed to abiotically) breaks down to release N2O. Conversely, our preliminary data indicate that cNOR exhibits an inverse isotope effect for both Nα and Nβ, but a normal isotope effect for the oxygen. These results are consistent with a very different mechanism for the bimetallic active site in bacterial cNOR in which one NO binds to a non-heme FeB site while the other NO binds to the heme b3 site.",

We present a spectral analysis of water level time series for 185 globally distributed lakes that suggests a previously unidentified source of internal variability within coupled lake-aquifer systems. Water level fluctuations universally follow a power law scaling of the power spectrum over the range of 30 days to 10 years indicating that lake levels are a 1/f type noise. The slope of the log transformed power spectrum is shown to be a linear function of the logarithm (base 10) of lake surface area. To understand the processes underlying these spectral characteristics, we develop a simple numerical model for lake fluctuations based on the governing equations for groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer with stochastic forcing. The model robustly produces 1/f type power spectra across all lake sizes and predicts surface area dependence of the power spectrum. The close agreement between simulation and natural data suggests that spatial and temporal stochasticity of mass inputs and diffusion of the groundwater table are key processes for understanding lake level variability.",

            "abstract": "Icy plumes emitted into space from Enceladus and other planetary bodies offer the intriguing possibility of sampling the composition of subsurface liquid reservoirs that may comprise habitable zones of particular astrobiological significance in our solar system. Mass spectrometric sampling of plume materials enables the detection of molecules that facilitate an assessment of the extent of chemical and biological evolution that may have occurred in a subsurface sea. In laboratory experiments we have investigated the physical and chemical processes that occur in the complex plume environment that lead to ionization of trace organic constituents, both as a result of the freezing of liquid droplets and the thawing of icy particles. We also demonstrate that collisions between icy particles lead to triboelectric charging. Subsequent discharges between oppositely charged particles result not only in the ionization of trace organics but to chemical reactions between molecular components present in the particles. For example, nitriles react with water to form amides and acids. In particular, icy particles doped with small amounts of aminoacetonitrile and water lead to the formation of the simplest amino acid glycine. The implications which these observations may have for sampling plume composition from orbit in a future mission to Enceladus will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The δD-H2O correlation is important for volcanic degassing and secondary hydration trends. We utilize the caibration of the TC/EA – MAT 253 continuous flow system, which permits us to analyze wt.% H2O and its δD extracted from 1–8 mg of glass with as little as 0.1 wt% H2O. Tephra that has been secondarily hydrated with meteoric water is widely used as a paleoenvironmental tool, but the rate of secondary hydration, the relative amounts of primary magmatic (degassed) and secondary meteoric water, and the retention of primary and secondary δD values are not well understood. To quantify these processes, we use a natural experiment involving dated Holocene tepha in Kamchatka and Oregon. Our research illustrates the drastic difference in hydration rates between silicic (hydrated after ~1.5 ka) and mafic tephra, which is not hydrated in the Holocene (similar to results for submarine volcanic glasses), and andesitic tephra with intermediate degrees of hydration. The 0.05-7.3 ka basaltic scoria from Klyuchevskoy volcano retains ≤0.45 wt.% primary magmatic H2O, with δD values from -99 to -121 ‰. Four other 0.05–7.6 ka basaltic tephra units from Kamchatka with <57 wt.% SiO2 all have wt.% H2O 0.21–0.84 and δD values ranging from -90 – -145 ‰. The 1.0–7.6 ka andesitic tephra have slightly higher water contents (0.9–3.0 %) and slightly lower δD values (-113 – -146 ‰). Seven 0.3–7.9 ka silicic samples with SiO2 >65 wt.% have higher (1.5 -3.4) wt.% H2O and δD values between -115 – -160 ‰. We interpret the lower δD values and higher water contents (opposite of the magmatic degassing trend) to be a characteristic of secondary hydration in regions of higher latitude such as Kamchatka and Oregon. We are also investigating 7.7 ka Mt. Mazama tephra in Oregon that are known to be fully hydrated and cover nearly 5000 km2 northeast of Crater Lake and range in elevation from ~1.3–1.9 km to understand the δD and δ18O details of the hydrated water’s correspondence with local Holocene meteoric waters. In the future, we plan to use a combination of δD in mid-high latitude precipitation to delineate δD-H2O hydration trends to better understand the distinction between primary magmatic and secondary meteoric water in volcanic glass, and the exchange of hydrogen isotopes between OH- and H2Omol sites in volcanic glass.",

            "abstract": "Aerosols are indicators of air quality as they reduce visibility and adversely affect public health. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a measure of the radiation extinction due to interaction of radiation with aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Using this optical measure of atmospheric aerosols we explore the seasonal and annual patterns of aerosols from both anthropogenic and biogenic sources over Egypt. Here, we use an integrated environment-climate-aerosol model in conjunction with inversion technique to identify the aerosol particle size distribution over different locations in Egypt.\nThe online-integrated Environment-Climate-Aerosol model (EnvClimA), which is based on the International Center for Theoretical Physics Regional Climate Model (ICTP-RegCM), is used to study the emission of different aerosols and their impact on climate parameters for a long-term base line simulation run over Egypt and North Africa. The global emission inventory is downscaled and remapping them over Egypt using local factors such as population, traffic and industrial activities to identify the sources of anthropogenic and biogenic emission from local emission over Egypt. The results indicated that the dominant natural aerosols over Egypt are dust emissions that frequently occur during the transitional seasons (Spring and Autumn). From the local observation we identify the number of dust and sand storm occurrences over Egypt.\nThe Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) is used to identify the optical characterizations of different types of aerosols over Egypt. Modeled aerosol optical depth and MISR observed (at 555 nm) are compared from March 2000 through November 2013. The results identify that the MISR AOD captures the maximum peaks of AOD in March/April that coincide with the Khamasin dust storms. However, peaks in May are either due to photochemical reactions or anthropogenic activities.\nNote: This presentation is for a Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER) project sponsored by USAID/NSF/NAS.\nProject Link (at National Academies website):\nhttp://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/dsc/peerscience/PGA_084046.htm\nwebsite: http://CleanAirEgypt.org",

Given that most synchrotron facilities have user programs which grant academic researchers access to facilities and x-ray imaging equipment free of charge, a key limitation or hindrance for small research groups interested in conducting x-ray imaging experiments is the financial cost associated with post-experiment data analysis. While the cost of high performance computing hardware continues to decrease, expenses associated with licensing commercial software packages for quantitative image analysis continue to increase, with current prices being as high as $24,000 USD, for a single user license.\nAs construction of the Nation's newest synchrotron accelerator nears completion, a significant effort is being made here at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), to provide an open-source, experiment-to-publication toolbox that reduces the financial and technical ‘activation energy’ required for performing sophisticated quantitative analysis of multidimensional porous media data sets, collected using cutting-edge x-ray imaging techniques. Implementation focuses on leveraging existing open-source projects and developing additional tools for quantitative analysis. We will present an overview of the software suite that is in development here at BNL including major design decisions, a demonstration of several test cases illustrating currently available quantitative tools for analysis and characterization of multidimensional porous media image data sets and plans for their future development.",

            "abstract": "Flows of partially ionized plasma are frequently characterized by the presence of both thermal and nonthermal populations of ions. This occurs, e.g., in the outer heliosphere – the part of interstellar space beyond the solar system whose properties are determined by the solar wind (SW) interaction with the local interstellar medium (LISM). Understanding the behavior of such flows requires us to investigate a variety of physical phenomena occurring throughout the solar system. These include charge exchange processes between neutral and charged particles, the birth of pick-up ions (PUIs), the origin of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs), SW turbulence, etc. Collisions between atoms and ions in the heliospheric plasma are so rare that they should be modeled kinetically. PUIs, born when LISM neutral atoms experience charge exchange with SW ions represent a hot, non-equilibrium component and also require a kinetic treatment. The behavior of PUIs at the SW termination shock (TS) is of major importance for the interpretation of the puzzling data from the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, which are now the only in situ space mission intended to investigate the boundary of the solar system. We have recently proposed an explanation of the sky-spanning \"ribbon\" of unexpectedly intense emissions of ENAs detected by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission and \"early\" penetration of Voyager 1 into the LISM. Numerical solution of these problems with the realistic boundary conditions provided by remote and in situ observations of the SW properties requires the application of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technologies and petascale supercomputers. Supported by the NSF ITR program and various NASA projects, we have implemented these in our Multi-Scale FLUid-Kinetic Simulation Suite, which is a collection of problem-oriented routines incorporated into the Chombo AMR framework. This paper explains the structure of MS-FLUKSS and provides examples of its application to modeling the SW-LISM interaction.",

Neighborhoods surrounding the oil field are concerned with the potential emissions of air toxics from oil field operations. The Baldwin Hills Air Quality Study focused on (1) quantifying air toxics concentrations originating from the Inglewood Oil Field operations, including drilling and well workovers, and (2) assessing the health risk of both acute and chronic exposure to air toxics emitted from oil field operations. Key pollutants identified for characterization included diesel particulate matter (DPM), cadmium, benzene, nickel, formaldehyde, mercury, manganese, acrolein, arsenic, and lead. The field study began in November 2012 and ended in November 2013. Four types of instruments were used to characterize oil field operations: (1) Aethalometers to measure black carbon (BC; as a proxy for DPM); (2) X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) for metals; (3) Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-of‑Flight Mass Spectrometry (PTR-TOFMS) for volatile organic compounds; and (4) meteorological sensors to help assess the wind patterns, temperature, and humidity that influence pollutant concentrations. Overall concentrations of most of the species measured in the study were quite low for an urban area. We determined that there were statistically significant increases in concentrations of DPM associated with oil field operations when winds were from the west-southwest. BC concentrations increased by 0.036 to 0.056 μg/m3, on average, when winds originated from the west-southwest, compared to annual mean BC concentrations of approximately 0.67 μg/m3. West-southwest winds occurred 53% of the time during the study. No other pollutants showed strong statistical evidence of chronic or acute risk from oil field operations.",

            "abstract": "Glaciers of Alaska and Northwestern Canada are losing mass at one of the highest rates of any mountain glacier system globally. High-precision measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission have revealed changes in the local gravitational field along the Gulf of Alaska due to changes in these ice masses since 2003. Previous efforts have spatially resolved these mass changes to 100 x 100 km grid cells or mass concentrations (mascons) as part of a global GRACE solution. While mass change estimates at the scale of entire mountain ranges (i.e. several geographically-grouped mascons) show strong temporal correlation to surface mass balance and air temperature, and while ice loss magnitudes for all Gulf of Alaska glaciers agree closely with geodetic estimates from ICESat, most GRACE-derived glacier mass loss magnitudes do not match ground observations at the level of individual mascons. In this study, we examine several approaches for partitioning the most recent GRACE mascon solution for glacier mass change along the Gulf of Alaska to individual mascons. We derive sets of scaling coefficients for every mascon, representing the local averages of different topographic or climatological characteristics, which essentially serve as different measures of continentality. These characteristics include mean ice elevation and distance from the coast, derived from the Randolph Glacier Inventory, and mean monthly temperature and precipitation, derived from the gridded climate product PRISM. Each set of scaling coefficients (representing each continentality index) is evaluated by comparing our derived timeseries’ of mass change to independent estimates from available ground and remote sensing datasets. We focus our preliminary validation on mascons within the Juneau Icefield area in Southeast Alaska, for which we have independent constraints on mass change from hydrological models and laser altimetry, and which acts as a test case for future work extending to the Gulf of Alaska. Ultimately, this study investigates our ability to extract mass balance estimates from GRACE at the level of individual mascons, in order to better understand the timing and magnitude of subannual and long-term changes of remote Gulf of Alaska glaciers.",

            "abstract": "The Central Andean Plateau (CAP) has elevations in excess of 3 km, and is part of the Andean Cordillera that resulted in part from shortening along the western edge of South America as it was compressed between the subducting Nazca plate and underthrusting Brazilian cratonic lithosphere. We calculated P- and S-wave receiver functions for the Central Andean Uplift and Geodynamics of High Topography (CAUGHT) temporary deployment of broadband seismometers in the Bolivian orocline (12°-20°S) region to investigate crustal thickness and lithospheric structure. Migration of the receiver functions is done using common conversion point (CCP) stacks through a 3D shear velocity model from ambient noise tomography (Ward et al., 2013). The P- and S-wave receiver functions provide similar estimates of the depth to Moho under the CAP. Crustal thicknesses include 60-65 km thick crust underneath the Bolivian Altiplano, crust that varies from ~70 km to ~50 km underneath the Eastern Cordillera and Interandean zone, and thins to 50 to 40 km crust in the Subandes and the edge of the foreland. The variable crustal thickness of the Eastern Cordillera and Interandean zone ranges from >70 km associated with the Los Frailes volcanic field at 19°-20°S to ~55 km beneath the 6 km peaks of the Cordillera Real at ~16°S.\nFrom our S-wave receiver functions, that have no multiples that can interfere with deeper structure, we also identify structures below the Moho. Along a SW-NE line that runs near La Paz where we have our highest station density, the S-wave CCP receiver-function stacks show a strong negative polarity arrival at a depth of ~120 km from the eastern edge of the Altiplano to the Subandean zone. We suggest this may be a good candidate for the base of the CAP lithosphere. In addition, above this depth the mantle is strongly layered, suggesting that there is not a simple high velocity mantle lithosphere associated with the continental lithosphere underthrusting the Andean orogen from the east.",

            "abstract": "Formation and properties of multiple secondary organic aerosol (SOA) systems were studied in the UC Riverside / CE-CERT dual 90m3 environmental chambers at temperatures ranging from 278K to 313K, controlled to a set point within ±0.5K. Three SOA systems were studied: a simple cyclohexene ozonolysis system, a biogenic α-pinene ozonolysis system, and an anthropogenic gasoline vehicle exhaust. Aerosol number, volume, and mass concentrations were monitored throughout experiments along with particle density, volatility, and hygroscopicity. Both gas and aerosol phase mass spectra were observed in real time via a SYFT selected ion flow tube mass spectrometer (SIFT-MS) and an Aerodyne high resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS), respectively. It was found that the temperature of the system drastically affected aerosol yields in all three systems studied with 278K yields being drastically higher than yields at 313K. Particle density was found to be much higher at 278K for the cyclohexene-O3 and vehicle exhaust systems (at 1.6g/cm3 and 2 g/cm3, respectively), compared to average SOA density of 1.4g/cm3, while the particle density of the biogenic system remained unaffected by temperature. Aerosol phase mass spectra showed significant oxidation at 313K compared to 278K. This work aims to help elucidate temperature’s effect on gas-particle partitioning and hysteresis effects seen in SOA formation that can be used in emerging atmospheric SOA models.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fractures (HFs) of oil and gas shales occur miles underground, below complex, layered heterogeneous rocks making any measurements of their dynamics, extent, or structure difficult to impossible. As such, model lab systems such as blocks of PMMA or rocks fractured with air or fluid (Bunger et al [2013], Alpern et al [2012]) are studied in order to understand the intricacies of HFs. However, due to the extreme energies necessary to fracture these materials the experiments are difficult, have little flexibility in the materials, and offer little no measure of the dynamics of the fracture. Heavily cross-linked hydrogels have been shown to be a good model to study brittle fracture (Livne et al [2004]). I will discuss a new system, which we have developed to study HFs within tough hydrogels which have the benefits of having highly tunable rheology, being optically clear, and having slower fracture speeds and breakdown pressures. By embedding fluorescent tracer particles within the gel together with laser sheet microscopy, we obtain the three dimensional stress and strain maps of the zone surrounding a hydraulic fracture tip.",

            "abstract": "CCN data sets from ambient and chamber studies, which consist of complex heterogeneous mixtures of organic and inorganic aerosol mixtures, may not show a single activation curve but instead can exhibit multiple activations not associated with doubly charged particles. It has been suggested that these activation curves may be representative of multiple externally mixed compounds, whereas single activation curves are representative of single component or multicomponent internally mixed aerosols.\nTo characterize and modify mixing states, a new laminar flow tube apparatus was developed to control the extent of mixing of organic and inorganic fractions under different environmental conditions such as relative humidity. Data sets yielding multiple activation curves have been recreated by mixing multiple inorganic and organic compounds. Preliminary results suggest that aerosol water is a significant factor; under dry conditions, the aerosols remained externally mixed while humid conditions facilitated internal mixing. For example, ammonium sulfate (inorganic) and succinic acid (organic) when dry, maintained an external mixture and multiple activation curves were observed to be constant. Under humid conditions, external mixing was initially observed; however, the aerosol water promoted internal mixing and the activation curves were observed to converge into a single curve. The data agrees well with Köhler Theory and single parameter (kappa) theory thermodynamic predictions of droplet activation. Data sets are also compared with a diffusion based coagulation particle model to predict mixing behavior. The method of analysis and the effect of mixing states of multiple components on the supersaturated hygroscopic properties of aerosols are presented.",

            "abstract": "A nonlinear relation between the salinity field and the subtidal exchange circulation in the Tampa Bay estuary is demonstrated using 1999-2011 measurements of river discharge, salinity and velocity. These data are binned and averaged to form mean monthly values of freshwater input Q, axial (vertical) salinity gradient ΔS (ΔzS), and subtidal vertical shear σ, respectively. These interrelated quantities are found to cycle through three dynamical regimes. The first regime (January to May/June) is a vertically well-mixed state (ΔzS≈0) when Q is low and a complex relation between ΔS and σ occurs. This time period has high ΔzS with an estimated gradient Richardson number Ri ~0.25. A value of Ri > 0.25 is usually stably stratified. Regimes II and III are both partially mixed states and both show a near-linear relation σ=cΔS+c0. Regime II (July-Sept) is characterized by rapidly increasing Q, high ΔS, c=-0.053 km psu-1s-1 and Ri~0.6. The third regime (Oct-Dec) has low Q, and includes high to minimal ΔS, relatively high ΔS, c=-0.011 km psu-1s-1 and Ri ~0.4. This asymmetric annual cycle generates hysteresis in the exchange circulation relative to the axial salinity gradient where σ is multi-valued with regard to ΔS, forming a loop in state space. The loop forms because the σ developed during II persists through III even when the original source of its formation (ΔS) has declined to minimal levels. We hypothesize this large Richardson number during III suppresses vertical mixing of momentum and allows the exchange circulation to maintain higher values.",

            "abstract": "Even though much progress has been achieved through dedicated approaches to improving air quality in many European cities, there are various threats which still remain unchanged. According to the World Health Organization, outdoor air pollution was linked to 3.7 million deaths in year 2012. As climate changes, the frequency of days with harmful levels of air pollutants may significantly increase causing exacerbation of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The aim of this study is to conduct health impact assessment by utilizing regionally and spatially specific data in order to assess the influence of alternative emission strategies on human health. In the first stage of this investigation, a modeling study was carried out using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem; Grell et al., 2005) to estimate ambient concentrations of air pollutants. The model set-up included a nesting approach, where three domains with horizontal resolution of 18 km, 6 km and 2 km were defined. The investigation area included the city of Munich (1.5 million inhabitants). The model performance has been evaluated against available air quality observations from the monitoring database “AirBase”. The chemical species including O3, NO, NO2 and PM10 simulated by WRF/Chem compare favorably with the observations. The model performs especially well in resolving the observed O3 concentrations. In the ongoing study, different emission reduction scenarios are compared to a baseline 2009 scenario based on Germany's National Emissions Inventory. To investigate health effects associated with air pollution concentrations a local-scale health impact assessment (HIA) will be conducted. Concentration-response functions (CRFs) link the change in mortality rates to the change in concentrations of air pollutants. CRFs are applied to population-weighted mean concentrations to estimate relative risks and hence estimate numbers of attributable deaths and associated life-years lost. The health benefits that we assume with introducing alternative air quality strategies can be used to provide options for future policy decisions to achieve the reduction of emissions and thereby premature deaths.",

            "abstract": "Paleo-geomagnetic observations provide fundamental models of the core and the geodynamo that cannot other- wise be obtained. Data and modeling studies are beginning to show that regions of concentrated magnetic flux (flux lobes) on the Core-Mantle boundary, those observed historically and others only hinted at from the short historical record, impose a structure on the geomagnetic field that may govern at least some components of geo- magnetic change. Accumulating evidence suggests that this structure reflects the influence of the lower mantle, yet this structure and the evolution of the geomagnetic field within it, even for the Holocene, are only beginning to be- come apparent. Comparison of specific, well-dated Holocene timeseries of PSV (sedimentary and archeomagnetic) inclination, declination, and paleointensity at key locations can provide intriguing insight when viewed through the lens of the known historical and assumed millennial flux lobes. A limiting factor for these studies is the uneven distribution of high quality data with independent chronologies, with Europe and the North Atlantic having better constrained data sets than North America. To begin to fill this data gap, we present initial results from an ongoing study of the paleomagnetic record from Fish Lake, Oregon. Initial evaluation of directions and intensity along with the construction of an independent chronology allow us to assess and build upon prior results to constrain the evolution of the North American flux lobe and refine our understanding of paleo-geomagnetic change during the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that 1963 catastrophic Vajont landslide (NE Italy) was preceded by a creeping phase monitored over three years before the collapse and that water played a significant role in the instability of the rock sequence. However, the transition from the creeping phase to instability still remains elusive. Here we report experiments carried out in a rotary‐shear friction apparatus (SHIVA at INGV, Rome, Italy) on smectite-rich gouges collected from the landslide surface (60-70% smectite, 20-30% calcite and minor quartz). Experiments were performed under shear stress controlled conditions at normal stress σnof 3-5 MPa in the presence of water (20% weight), and at room humidity.\nDuring the experiments, the shear stress τ was increased by a constant value Δτ and maintained for a fixed time Δt before applying the following shear stress step. When frictional instability was achieved, the machine started to rotate at an imposed velocity.\nIn the first set of experiments, the initial τ (0.05 MPa) was increased by steps of Δτ = 0.25 MPa with Δt of 150 seconds. In the room humidity material, a series of spontaneous slip bursts occurred at τ = 2.5 MPa (at σn = 5MPa) until the shear stress reached 3.0 MPa. At this point, a large stress drop occurred with concomitant dilation. In the wet material, instability took place at τ= 0.3 MPa (at σn= 3 MPa). After forcing τ down, the material re-strengthened. A second main instability occurred when τ was restored to 0.3 MPa, with expulsion of water drops accompanied by an episode of dilation. At this point, the material spontaneously re-strengthened with a stick-slip behavior similar to that observed at room humidity conditions.\nIn the second set of experiments, Δτ was reduced to 0.05 MPa and Δt increased up to 360 seconds producing a general enhancement of the shear stress required to generate unstable sliding. Instability took place at very high τ (3.12 MPa at σn= 3 MPa) at room-humidity conditions, and at τ = 0.8-0.9 MPa at wet conditions.\nThe experiments evidence that the frictional instability of the Vajont clays is strongly dependent on the presence of water and on the shear stress enhancement Δτ. The results are important to model the frictional variation on the sliding surface concomitant with the fluctuations of the dam reservoir level.",

            "abstract": "The global modeling technique provides a way to obtain ordinary differential equations from single time series1. This technique, initiated in the 1990s, could be applied successfully to numerous theoretic and experimental systems. More recently it could be applied to environmental systems2,3.\nHere this technique is applied to seasonal snow cover area in the Pyrenees mountain (Europe) and Mont Lebanon (Mediterranean region). The snowpack evolution is complex because it results from combination of processes driven by physiography (elevation, slope, land cover...) and meteorological variables (precipitation, temperature, wind speed...), which are highly heterogeneous in such regions. Satellite observations in visible bands offer a powerful tool to monitor snow cover areas at global scale, with large resolutions range. Although this observable does not directly inform about snow water equivalent, its dynamical behavior strongly relies on it. Therefore, snow cover area is likely to be a good proxy of the global dynamics and global modeling technique a well adapted approach.\nThe MOD10A2 product (500m) generated from MODIS by the NASA is used after a pretreatment is applied to minimize clouds effect. The global modeling technique is then applied using two packages4,5. The analysis is performed with two time series for the whole period (2000-2012) and year by year. Low-dimensional chaotic models are obtained in many cases. Such models provide a strong argument for chaos since involving the two necessary conditions in a synthetic way: determinism and strong sensitivity to initial conditions. The models comparison suggests important non-stationnarities at interannual scale which prevent from detecting long term changes.\n1: Letellier et al 2009.

Information on rice cropping practices and changes in cropping systems is critical for policymakers to devise successful strategies to ensure food security and rice grain exports for the country. The primary objective of this research is to map rice cropping systems and predict future dynamics of rice cropping systems using the MODIS time-series data of 2002, 2006, and 2010. First, a phenology-based classification approach was applied for the classification and assessment of rice cropping systems in study region. Second, the Cellular Automata-Markov (CA-Markov) models was used to simulate the rice-cropping system map of VMD for 2010. The comparisons between the classification maps and the ground reference data indicated satisfactory results with overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients, respectively, of 81.4% and 0.75 for 2002, 80.6% and 0.74 for 2006 and 85.5% and 0.81 for 2010. The simulated map of rice cropping system for 2010 was extrapolated by CA-Markov model based on the trend of rice cropping systems during 2002~2006. The comparison between predicted scenario and classification map for 2010 presents a reasonably closer agreement. In conclusion, the CA-Markov model performs a powerful tool for the dynamic modeling of changes in rice cropping systems, and the results obtained demonstrate that the approach produces satisfactory results in terms of accuracy, quantitative forecast and spatial pattern changes. Meanwhile, the projections of the future changes would provide useful inputs to the agricultural policy for effective management of the rice cropping practices in VMD.",

Of the two peatland types, natural fens are known to be a larger contributor of methane emissions to the atmosphere than natural bogs. This study uses geophysical methods integrated with in-situ direct measurements and chamber fluxes to improve understanding of temporal and spatial variation in methane production, accumulation and emissions from natural montane fen in Alberta Canada. Meteorological data and peat cores (~150 cm) were collected to study factors affecting methane production, accumulation and emissions from the Sibbald Research Wetland, a montane fen in the Rocky Mountains in southern Alberta.\nOur results show a direct correlation between methane accumulation and degree of peat humification, substrate quality and porosity. Changes in temperature, pressure and water table position were shown to relate to ebullition events, with the highest number of ebullition events occurring from late August to early November. The geophysical results indicate a small spatial variation in free phase biogenic gas accumulation within the studied area. Diffusive methane fluxes were correlated to plant productivity on both daily and seasonal time scales with patterns varying between plots dominated by Juncus sp. and Carex spp. These results highlight the interacting ecological and physical controls on peatland methane dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The Kalman Filter has been widely used for dynamic monitoring in reservoir engineering, and has recently gained popularity in hydrogeologic applications. A common characteristic of such applications is that the physical processes of interest are greatly affected by preferential flow (e.g., contaminant spreading, CO2 leakage), which can only be delineated if the problem is finely discretized into a large number of unknowns. However, for problems with large numbers of unknowns (e.g., larger than 10,000), the Kalman Filter has prohibitively expensive computation and storage costs. The EnKF, which is typically used to reduce the cost of computing the covariance in such cases converges slowly to the best estimate, and for a reasonable number of realizations, the estimate may not be accurate, especially for strongly heterogeneous systems. We present the Spectral Kalman Filter, a new Kalman Filter implementation that has a dramatically reduced computational cost compared to the full Kalman Filter, with comparable or higher accuracy than the EnKF for the same computational cost. Our algorithm’s computational efficiency is achieved by a recurrence that updates small cross-covariance matrices instead of large covariance matrices, in combination with a low-rank approximation of the noise covariance matrix. In addition, instead of computing the expensive Jacobian matrix, a matrix-free method is used to obtain sensitivities. Finally, the error of our method can be explicitly controlled by reducing the time between matrix updates. The frequency of these updates is controlled independently from the data assimilation steps. We demonstrate the performance of the Spectral Kalman Filter for the joint estimation of domain properties and state evolution by assimilation of quasi-continuous data during a hypothetical CO2 injection in a heterogeneous domain.",

            "abstract": "The increased vulnerability of deltaic communities to coastal flooding as a result of upstream engineering has been acknowledged for decades. What has received less attention is the sensitivity of deltas to the interactions of river basin modifications and cultivation and irrigation in their coastal regions, particularly in tropical deltas. Embanking, tilling, and crop or stock choice all affect the movement of sediment and water on deltas. Combined with reduced river and sediment discharge, soil and water management practices in coastal areas may in fact exacerbate the risk of tidal flooding, erosion of arable land, and salinization of soils and groundwater associated with sea level rise. Thus exists a cruel irony to smallholder subsistence farmers whose priorities are food, water and economic security, rather than sustainability of the regional environment. Such issues challenge disciplinary approaches and require integrated social-biophysical models able to understand and diagnose these complex relationships. The complementary Institutional Analysis and Development and SocioEcological Systems frameworks are applied to the southwestern Bengal Delta (Bangladesh). The method helps to define the relevant social and physical units operating on the common pool of environmental resources, those of climate, water and sediment. The conceptual frameworks are designed to inform development of a nested geospatial analysis and a dynamic coupled model to identify the social-biophysical feedbacks associated with smallholder soil and water management practices, coastal dynamics, and climate vulnerability in rural Bangladesh. Our presentation will discuss components of the conceptual frameworks and will introduce a bi-directional pilot study designed for obtaining and disseminating information about environmental change to farmers in southwest Bangladesh with potential application to rural farming communities in other tropical deltas.",

Unconfined channels have high or low quantities of wood, but confined channels store little wood biomass. Within this geomorphic context, forest stand age is also critical; streams draining old growth forests (>350 y) have much higher wood loads and log jam densities than either younger, unmanaged forests (>120 y) or intensively managed forests. Reaches with extensive log jams have anastomosing channels, large pool volumes, and high amounts of organic carbon (OC) storage both as wood and as sediment. We hypothesized that these reaches would be much more biogeochemically active with higher rates of primary production, ecosystem respiration, and nitrate removal. Nitrate removal was undetectable in most single-thread channels, and was much higher in reaches with extensive log jams. Ecosystem respiration was also much higher in reaches with log jams. The mechanism for greater nitrate removal and higher ecosystem respiration is increased organic matter storage. Jams stored 10 times more sediment OC than unjammed reaches. Bioassays showed that this OC had high rates of denitrification which may have stimulated NO3 uptake in these reaches. Forest control of channel morphology dramatically altered biogeochemical cycling with higher rates of OC retention cycling and increased net N removal.",

These basin-wide surveys, together with available earlier data, show linkages between the physical, geo-chemical and ecosystem components during a period of rapid change, largely forced by increased multi-year ice melt and a prolonged anticyclonic phase of the Arctic Ocean circulation. The resulting Ekman convergence has led to a progressive accumulation of river and ice-melt-derived freshwater within the gyre, an increase in surface stratification and depression of the halocline. These changes in physical state have led to a decrease in aragonite saturation state, a deepening of the top of the nutricline and subsurface chlorophyll maximum and a shift in phytoplankton size spectra. Recent years have shown a slight relaxation of the Beaufort Gyre, in addition to large variation in ice cover, leading to informed speculation that the gyre may now be poised to release some of its accumulated freshwater as a salinity anomaly into the global system.",

            "abstract": "Fluid–rock interactions in geothermal reservoirs are driven by the state of disequilibrium that persists among solid and solutes due to changing temperature and pressure. During operation of enhanced geothermal systems, injection of cooled water back into the reservoir disturbs the initial thermodynamic equilibrium between the reservoir and its geothermal fluid, which may induce modifications in permeability through changes in porosity and pore space geometry, consequently bringing about several impairments to the overall system.\nModeling of fluid-rock interactions induced by injection of cold brine into Groß Schönebeck geothermal reservoir system situated in the Rotliegend sandstone at 4200m depth have been done by coupling geochemical modeling Code Phreeqc with OpenGeoSys. Through batch modeling the re-evaluation of the measured hydrochemical composition of the brine has been done using Quintessa databases, the results from the calculation indicate that a mineral phases comprising of K-feldspar, hematite, Barite, Calcite and Dolomite was found to match the hypothesis of equilibrium with the formation fluid, Reducing conditions are presumed in the model (pe = -3.5) in order to match the amount of observed dissolved Fe and thus considered as initial state for the reactive transport modeling. based on a measured composition of formation fluids and the predominant mineralogical assemblage of the host rock, a preliminary 1D Reactive transport modeling (RTM) was run with total time set to 30 years; results obtained for the initial simulation revealed that during this period, no significant change is evident for K-feldspar. Furthermore, the precipitation of calcite along the flow path in the brine results in a drop of pH from 6.2 to a value of 5.2 noticed over the simulated period. The circulation of cooled fluid in the reservoir is predicted to affect the temperature of the reservoir within the first 100 -150m from the injection well. Examination of porosity change in this simulation reveals that, porosity and permeability near the wellbore are enhanced after injection. This is chiefly due to the dissolution of calcite near the injection well and less extent by dolomite The porosity is improved by more than 14% at the injection well, but then decreases away from the well.",

This dedication is substantiated in part through the National Science Foundation (NSF) providing funding for student attendance to the workshop, which enables student participation. Another example of SHINE's commitment to its student members is the incorporation of a Student Day prior to the workshop since 2003, entirely organized and run by two student representatives. While there are variations in format from year to year, Student Day consists of tutorials and research talks exclusively by student volunteers to an audience of only students. The day is intended to provide a low-stress environment for students to learn about the various topics addressed during the workshop, to ask questions freely, and to engage in scientific discussion with other students which hopefully is a catalyst for collaboration. As a result of positive experiences, over the past decade student attendance and participation in the workshop have increased. At the SHINE 2014 workshop, nearly a third of attendees were students. SHINE student visibility has increased over the years, with student posters being advertised at breakfast, inclusion of a student day summary by the student representatives during a plenary session, and continued support from the steering committee. Students are also promoting a broader impact of SHINE sciences via increased social media presence. From a student representative's perspective, SHINE has built and fostered a healthy student community and encourages students to engage in shaping the future of the field.",

            "abstract": "The west coast of Mexico presents a complex pattern of deformation related to the convergence and subduction of the Rivera plate beneath the Jalisco Block/North American plate. Previous single beam bathymetric data have evidenced a large bathymetric high at 104.6218oW, 18.7123oN, in the continental slope region off Manzanillo, Mexico. One school of thought held that this high was the offshore extension of the onshore Manzanillo horst, although the two features are offset in a right-lateral sense. Alternatively, given the presence of a large positive magnetic anomaly near the bathymetric high, the high could also be caused by the collision and subsequent subduction of a large seamount. Given that the offset between the two structures was the main evidence for proposing the existence of a forearc sliver in the offshore area of the Jalisco margin, resolving the nature of this bathymetric high is quite important in our attempts to understand the plate kinematics and tectonics of this region.\nThus, to better define the deformation pattern associated with the bathymetric high, multibeam bathymetric data (obtained using the Kongsberg EM300 multibeam system), subbottom profiles (obtained using the Kongsberg TOPAS18 system), and total field magnetic data (obtained using the Geometrics G877 marine proton precession magnetometer) were collected in the continental slope region between Manzanillo, Colima, and Chamela, Jalisco, during several cruises of UNAM´s research vessel the B.O. EL PUMA. The morphology and structural deformation patterns obtained in this study indicate very clearly that a large seamount is in the process of subducting beneath the continental slope off Manzanillo. The results also indicate that not only has the seamount uplifted the slope but has resulted in slumping of the area of the slope landward of the seamount. Given these results the proposal of the existence of an independent forearc sliver in the offshore area of the southern Jalisco block needs to be reevaluated.(Funding provided by DGAPA grants IN115513, IN108110 and IN104707 and CONACyT grant 50235)",

However the rise of the sea-level is not uniform around the world. The local or relative sea-level rise will be of great concern to the coastal regions. The combination of the land subsidence and global sea-level rise causes the relative sea-level to rise. Relative sea-level rise increases the risk of flooding and wetland loss problems in near coastal areas, which in turn have important economic, environmental, and human health consequences for the heavily populated and ecologically important coastal region. However the role played by the coastal land subsidence is commonly absent during the discussion of sea-level rise problems. The sea-level can be measured in two ways: satellite altimetry and tide gauges. The sea-level measured by satellite is called the geocentric sea-level that is relative to earth center and the one measured by tide gauges is called local sea-level that is relative to the land. The tide gauge measurements of the local sea-level do not distinguish between whether the water is rising or the land is subsiding. In some coastal areas, land subsidence is occurring at a higher rate than the geocentric sea-level is rising. This can have a great local effect. GPS technology has proven to be efficient and accurate for measuring and tracking absolute land elevation change. There are about 300 publically available Continuously Operating ",

The latest forecasts even estimate an enhancement of 56% in total natural gas production due to increased development of shale gas, tight gas and offshore natural gas resources from 2012 to 2040 with the largest contribution from shale formations [US EIA: Annual Energy Outlook 2014].\nDuring the field intensive ‘Energy and Environment – Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Study (UBWOS)’, measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were made using proton-transfer-reactions mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) at the ground site Horse Pool and using a mobile laboratory in the Uintah Basin, Utah, which is a region well known for intense fossil fuel production. A reworked gas well in the Red Wash fields was sampled regularly within two weeks performing mobile laboratory measurements downwind of the well site. The well had been recently hydraulically refractured at that time and waste water was collected into an open flow-back pond. Very high mixing ratios of aromatic hydrocarbons (C6-C13) up to the ppm range were observed coming from condensate and flow-back reservoirs.\nThe measurements are used to determine sources of specific VOC emissions originating from the different parts of the well site and mass spectra are used to classify the air composition in contrast to samples taken at the Horse Pool field site and crude oil samples from South Louisiana. Enhancement ratios and time series of measured peak values for aromatics showed no clear trend, which indicates changes in emissions with operations at the site.",

Previous studies have shown that SSA is a complex mixture of inorganic salts and an array of dissolved and particulate organic components. Enrichment of SSA organic content is often correlated to seawater chlorophyll concentrations, a measure of oceanic biological activity. As the physical and chemical properties of aerosols control their radiative effects, recent studies conducted by the Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment have endeavored to further elucidate the ties between marine biological activity and primary SSA chemical composition using highly time resolved single particle analyses.

            "abstract": "Within the past five years, the production of oil and natural gas in the United States from tight formations has increased rapidly due to advances in technology, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. With the expansion of oil and natural gas extraction operations comes the need to better quantify their emissions and potential impacts on climate forcing and air quality. The Bakken formation within the Williston Basin in North Dakota has emerged as a large contributor to the recent growth in oil production and accounts for over 10% of domestic production. Close to 30% of associated gas co-produced with the oil is flared. Very little independent information is currently available to assess the oil and gas industry emissions and their impacts on regional air quality. In May 2014, an airborne field campaign was conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Earth System Research Laboratory and the University of Michigan to investigate hydrocarbon emissions from operations in the oil field. Here, we present results from the analysis for methane, several non-methane hydrocarbons and combustion tracers in 72 discrete air samples collected by the aircraft on nine different flights. Samples were obtained in the boundary layer upwind and downwind of the operations and in the free troposphere. We will show results of a multiple species analysis and compare them with field campaign data from other U.S. oil and gas fields, measurements from NOAA’s Global Monitoring Division long-term observing network, and available bottom-up information on emissions from oil and gas operations.",

            "abstract": "Around the margins of the Pacific Ocean, denser oceanic plates slipping under continental plates cause subduction earthquakes generating large tsunami waves. The subducting Pacific and Philippine Sea plates create damaging interplate earthquakes followed by huge tsunami waves. It was a rupture of the Japan Trench subduction zone (JTSZ) and the resultant M9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake that caused the unprecedented tsunami along the Pacific coast of Japan on March 11, 2011.\nEQECAT’s Japan Earthquake model is a fully probabilistic model which includes a seismo-tectonic model describing the geometries, magnitudes, and frequencies of all potential earthquake events; a ground motion model; and a tsunami model. Within the much larger set of all modeled earthquake events, fault rupture parameters for about 24000 stochastic and 25 historical tsunamigenic earthquake events are defined to simulate tsunami footprints using the numerical tsunami model COMCOT. A hybrid approach using COMCOT simulated tsunami waves is used to generate inundation footprints, including the impact of tides and flood defenses. Modeled tsunami waves of major historical events are validated against observed data. Modeled tsunami flood depths on 30 m grids together with tsunami vulnerability and financial models are then used to estimate insured loss in Japan from the 2011 tsunami. The primary direct report of damage from the 2011 tsunami is in terms of the number of buildings damaged by municipality in the tsunami affected area. Modeled loss in Japan from the 2011 tsunami is proportional to the number of buildings damaged. A 1000-year return period map of tsunami waves shows high hazard along the west coast of southern Honshu, on the Pacific coast of Shikoku, and on the east coast of Kyushu, primarily associated with major earthquake events on the Nankai Trough subduction zone (NTSZ). The highest tsunami hazard of more than 20m is seen on the Sanriku coast in northern Honshu, associated with the JTSZ.",

            "abstract": "Dust from high latitudes is underappreciated and little studied. We recently identified new sites of dust formation, and a new dust generation mechanism, from the southern AK coastline, in Crusius et al, 2011. Dust is generated each autumn from glacierized river valleys as river levels and discharge decrease following summer peak glacier melt. The most prominent such river is the Copper River, the single largest freshwater source to the Gulf of Alaska. Each autumn the exposed river floodplains contain abundant, fine glacial flour and represent a large dust source region, prior to significant snowfall. Strong katabatic winds channeled down mountain river valleys generate dust from the fine glacial flour, which is transported as much as several hundred kilometers into the ocean. This dust is an important source of Fe to the Gulf of Alaska, where phytoplankton growth is limited by available Fe (a micronutrient). Glaciers are rapidly losing mass in this region, so there is an increasing supply of fine glacial flour during the summer melt season, and possibly increased deposition of fine glacial flour in the dust source regions. We initiated continuous, year-round time-series measurements of dust concentration, and its geochemical composition, in August of 2011 on Middleton Island, AK, which lies in the path of the dust plume extending from the Copper River valley. Dust is clearly generated from other glacierized river valleys along the southern coast of AK, as well. We will discuss results from our continuous record spanning three dust seasons, which prominently shows these events each autumn, and displays substantial interannual variability. Dust appears to remain in the boundary layer, but is transported hundreds of kilometers into the ocean, into Fe-limited waters. It is also possible that some of this dust is redeposited on snow or glacier surfaces, enhancing melting. This dust source is not accounted for in typical global dust models.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Science Mission Directive Science Plan stresses that the primary goals of Heliophysics research focus on the understanding of the Sun’s influence on the Earth and other bodies in the solar system. The NASA Heliophysics Division has adopted the Virtual Observatory, or VxO, concept in order to enable scientists to easily discover and access all data products relevant to these goals via web portals that act as clearinghouses. Furthermore, Heliophysics discipline scientists have defined the Space Physics Archive Search and Extract (SPASE) metadata schema in order to describe the contents of such applicable data products with detail extending all the way down to the parameter level. One SPASE metadata description file must be written to describe each data product at the global level. And the collection of such data product metadata description files, stored in repositories, provides the searchable content that the VxO web sites require in order to match the list of products to the unique needs of each researcher. The VxO metadata repository content also allows one to provide links to each unique data file contained in the full complement of files on a per data product basis. These links are contained within SPASE “Granule” description files and permit uniform access, worldwide, regardless of data server location thus permitting the VxO clearinghouse capability. The VxO concept is sound in theory but difficult in practice given that the Heliophysics data environment is diverse, ever expanding, and volatile. Thus, it is imperative to update the VxO metadata repositories in order to provide a complete, accurate, and current portrayal of the data environment. Such attention to detail is not a VxO desire but a necessity in order to support Heliophysics researchers and foster VxO user loyalty. An application of these basic tenets to the construction of a VxO repository dedicated to providing access to the CDF-formatted data collection hosted on the NASA Goddard CDAWeb data server. Note that the CDF format is self-describing and thus it provides a source of information for initiating SPASE metadata description at the data product level. Also, the CDAWeb data server provides high-quality data product tracking down to the individual data file level permitting easy updating of SPASE Granule metadata.",

            "abstract": "The Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) onboard the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft has been acquiring infrared observations of the Martian surface for nearly thirteen years. Daytime infrared images from the first twelve years of the mission have previously been used to generate a complete global mosaic, while nighttime infrared images have been used to generate a near-global mosaic between 60°N-60°S. A combined product has been generated by overlaying the daytime global mosaic with a colorized version of the nighttime global mosaic, resulting in a near-global map that can be used to more easily identify surface features with unique thermal characteristics.\nWell-preserved ejecta deposits associated with fresh impact craters are readily identifiable in the combined map by their characteristic nighttime temperature pattern, which is controlled by variations in the thermal inertia of the ejecta material. The pattern consists of relatively high thermal inertia material in and around the crater, an inner ejecta ring composed of intermediate thermal inertia material and an outer ejecta ring composed of low thermal inertia material.\nA near-global survey (60°N-60°S) of these well-preserved ejecta deposits has shown that the vast majority occur in a small region covering northern Terra Sirenum and eastern Daedalia Planum, with a smaller concentration present in Syria Planum. A comparison of THEMIS and Viking images has verified that the larger craters and ejecta deposits were present at the time of the Viking mission and are not the result of more recent impacts. The survey also identified similarly fresh impact craters across the planet that are lacking an outer ring of low thermal inertia ejecta material, possibly due to erosion of the original ejecta deposits. This suggests that local conditions in Terra Sirenum, Daedalia Planum and Syria Planum are favorable for the long-term preservation of the fine-grained component of fresh impact ejecta deposits.",

            "abstract": "More numerous observations within and beneath ice sheets are needed to address a broad variety of important questions concerning ice sheets and climate. However, emplacement of instruments continues to be constrained by logistical burdens, especially in cold ice a kilometer or more thick. Electrically powered thermal melt probes are inherently logistically light and efficient, especially for reaching greater depths in colder ice. They therefore offer a means of addressing current measurement problems, but have been limited historically by a lack of technology for reliable operation at the necessary voltages and powers. Here we report field tests in Greenland of two new melt probes. We operated one probe at 2.2 kilowatts (kW) and 1050 volts (V), achieving a depth of 400 m in the ice in ~ 120 hours, without electrical failure. That depth is the second greatest achieved thus far with a thermal melt probe, exceeded only by one deployment to 1005 m in Greenland in 1968, which ended in an electrical failure. Our test run took place in two intervals separated by a year, with the probe frozen at 65 m depth during the interim, after which we re-established communication, unfroze the probe, and proceeded to the greater depth. During the second field test we operated a higher-power probe, initially at 2.5 kW and 1500 V and progressing to 4.5 kW and 2000 V. Initial data indicate that this probe achieved a descent rate of 8 m/hr, which if correct would be the fastest rate yet achieved for such probes. Moreover, we observed maintenance of vertical probe travel using pendulum steering throughout both tests, as well as autonomous descent without operator-intervention after launch. The latter suggests potential for crews of 1-2 to operate several melt probes concurrently. However, the higher power probe did suffer electrical failure of a heating element after 7 hours of operation at 2000 V (24 hours after the start of the test), contrary to expectations based on laboratory component and system testing. We are therefore revising the probe heaters using a newer but more development-intensive technology. With probe systems now validated in our tests, this will result in a reliable means to emplace instruments for studies of subglacial hydrology, ice dynamics, and possible subglacial ecologies.",

All scenarios showed an increase in temperature throughout the U.S., with higher increase occurring in the northern half of the U.S. More severe droughts in the 21st century than in the 20th century are projected for parts of the Midwest, the South and the western U.S. Although water supply is not projected to change much in the northern half of the U.S., because of the much warmer temperature and temporal shift in the peak snow accumulation, this region is projected to experience a shift in the seasonality of streamflow/water yield causing the winter flow to increase and the summer flow to decrease.",

            "abstract": "Glaciers are a reservoir of mercury and other trace elements that have accumulated in the ice from atmospheric deposition during the industrial era. As glaciers continue to melt at an alarming rate, potentially toxic metals are released from the ice to the environment. In order to evaluate the impact of glacier melt on water quality in high elevation catchments in Grand Teton National Park, we sampled transects along the Teton and Middle Teton glaciers and proglacial streams during early-July and mid-August 2013. The glaciers were snow-covered during July, and thus water samples were primarily melt of snowpack from the previous winter. During August, the glacier ice was exposed across the ablation zone. The contrasting sample sets from July and August allowed for a comparison of water chemistry of snowmelt and glacier melt, respectively. The Teton Glacier transect included ten sample sites: four samples of surface drainage on the glacier, three near the terminal moraine, and three in Glacier Gulch stream. The Middle Teton transect included thirteen sample sites: one above the glacier, four of surface drainage on the glacier, two near the terminal moraine, two at the moraine of adjacent Teepe Glacier, and four in Garnet Canyon stream. All water samples were analyzed for total and methyl mercury, a suite of trace elements (including U, Sr, and Mn), solutes, and stable water isotopes (δ2H and δ18O). A subset of samples were analyzed for tritium to differentiate recent snowmelt from older ice melt. Preliminary results indicate that snowmelt and glacier melt were a significant source of total mercury, with little additional inputs downstream of the glaciers. Methyl mercury concentrations increased downstream of the glaciers, possibly indicating that mercury from the glaciers undergoes methylation in the proglacial streams. Other trace elements were found in low concentrations in melt water, but increased substantially downstream of the glaciers likely due to water-rock interactions. This study has implications for evaluating the relative impacts of atmospheric deposition, weathering, and other trace element sources to high alpine lakes and streams.",

            "abstract": "A high resolution C-band Doppler radar previously used to detect debris shed during space shuttle missions is shown to have the capability to determine the properties of individual raindrops in the free atmosphere. This is accomplished through a combination of the radar’s narrow (0.22 degree) beamwidth, a range resolution as fine as 0.5m, and extremely high 3MW power. These attributes lead to exceptionally small radar pulse volumes (as low as 14m3 at the radar’s minimum 2km range) and allow the radar to detect individual drops that exceed 0.5mm in diameter. As the radar transmits both a higher (0.5m) and lower (37m) range resolution waveform every other pulse, a unique opportunity arise to examine both the bulk radar reflectivity and individual particle properties at the same time. The larger individual drops detected by the radar appear in the radar data as bright, nearly linear, reflectivity “streaks” against the more uniform background reflectivity field generated by the population of smaller drops. These streaks can then be examined to infer the properties of the particles directly such as their size, fall velocity, concentration, and potentially other properties such as naturally occurring drop oscillations. Examples of the bulk and individual particle properties for several “streaks” associated with a deep convective system are examined. Additional high-resolution studies of the circulation fields associated with a shallow altocumulus layer and a long-lived radar reflectivity bright band associated with the melting layer within a meso-convective cloud system reveal new details of the internal circulation features associated with these phenomena.",

Aerosols are both a source and sink of gas phase constituents, as well as a transport mechanism for oceanic chemical species into the continental interior. The interaction between aerosols, the gas phase, sea ice and the snow pack is complex and not well understood. Recent observations of ozone depletion events coupled with submicron aerosol mass increase highlight the interaction between the gas and particle phases. These interactions can lead to aerosol formation as well as the deposition of trace elements to the snow pack. To determine the composition and source regions of aerosols in the coastal Antarctic atmosphere, a suite of instruments was deployed in the 2014 Antarctic measurement season including a High Resolution Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-AMS), Ultra High Sensitivity Aerosol Spectrometer (UHSAS), Ozone analyzer, Scanning Electrical Mobility Sizer (SEMS), and Particle-into-Liquid Sampler (PILS). Measurements of gas phase constituents and aerosol composition were interpreted in the context of back trajectories and local meteorological conditions to link the measured air masses to their source regions.",

Our results suggest these ponds also remove heavy metals from solution through adsorption and mineral precipitation. Analyses of the precipitates and water in the settling ponds showed relatively higher metal concentration on the precipitates than in the corresponding aqueous solutions. Speciation modeling showed that the precipitates were mainly travertine, ferrihydrite, fe-oxyhdroxide and gypsum and these are expected to provide surfaces for metal adsorption. Overall, the average concentrations of trace metals were such that, Al concentration was 0.0 mg/L for the aqueous sample and 9.4 mg/L for the precipitate; Fe concentration was 0.04 mg/L for the aqueous sample and 20.1 mg/L for the precipitate; Mn concentration was 0.2 mg/L for the aqueous sample and 10.2 mg/L for the precipitate; Sr concentration was 3 mg/L for the aqueous sample and 8 mg/L for the precipitate; Zn concentration was 0.1 mg/L for the aqueous sample and 1.4 mg/L for the precipitate. Sulfate concentrations in solutions (1346 mg/L) were about seventeen times higher than on the precipitate (80 mg/L). As the water exits the tunnel, its carbon is expected to consistently decrease over space as it moves along the settling ponds while precipitating carbonates. The dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations showed consistent drop from 109 mg/L at the tunnel exit to 96 mg/L at middle pond and 92 mg/L at the exit pond, which corresponds to decreasing pCO2 and removal of carbon from solution through travertine precipitation and CO2 outgassing. This data indicate a strong influence of mineral precipitate as an effective component in the attenuation of metals in mine",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal venting influences ocean chemistry, the thermal and chemical structure of the oceanic crust, the style of accretion at mid-ocean ridges, and the evolution of unique and diverse chemosynthetic ecosystems. Surprisingly, only a few studies have attempted to constrain the volume and heat flux of entire hydrothermal vent fields given that axially-hosted hydrothermal systems are estimated to be responsible for ~20-25% of the total heat flux out of the Earth’s interior, as well as potentially playing a large role in global and local biogeochemical cycles. However, same-site estimates can vary greatly, such as at the Lucky Strike Field where estimates range from 100 MW to 3800 MW. We report a July 2014 field program with the Sentry AUV that obtains the water velocity and heat measurements necessary to estimate the total heat and mass flux emanating from the ASHES hydrothermal vent field. We equipped Sentry with a Nortek acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) with an inertial measurement unit attached, two acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), and two SBE3 temperature probes, to measure the temperature and water velocity. This sensing suite provided more accurate measurements than previous AUV based studies. A control volume approach was employed in which Sentry was pre-programmed to survey a 150m by 150m box centered over the vent field flying a “mowing the lawn” pattern at 5m trackline spacing followed by a survey of the perimeter. During a 40 hour survey, the pattern was repeated 9 times allowing us to obtain observations over multiple tidal cycles. Concurrent lowered ADCP (LADCP) measurements were also obtained. Water velocity data obtained with Sentry was corrected for platform motion and then combined with the temperature measurements to estimate heat flux. Analysis of this data is on-going, however these experiments permit us to quantify the heat and mass exiting the control volume, and potentially provide the most accurate and highest resolution heat and mass flux estimates at a hydrothermal field to date.",

            "abstract": "Three kinds of dynamos are activated in the magnetosphere during geomagnetic storms, which supply the electric field and currents to the mid-equatorial ionosphere. At the onset of the storm, the solar wind shock activates the dynamo of the dawn-to-dusk electric field and Region-1 field-aligned currents for several to ten min, which transmit to the equatorial ionosphere and intensify the equatorial electrojet (EEJ). During the storm main phase, the southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) activates the dynamo of the dawn-to-dusk electric field and the R1 FACs for several hours, which develop the ring current and intensify the EEJ. During the storm recovery phase, on the other hand, the electric field and currents reverse their direction, prohibit the ring current from developing and cause the counterelectrojet in the equatorial ionosphere (CEJ). The CEJs are often observed even during the storm main phase under the relatively constant southward IMF. The long-lasting CEJs are superimposed by large amplitude impulsive/irregular CEJs. We have detected the stormtime electric fields in midlatitude with the SuperDARN radar and HF Doppler sounder in Japan during the stormtime CEJs. The long-lasting CEJs should be caused by the thermospheric wind dynamo (disturbance dynamo), but the impulsive/irregular CEJs are found to be caused by substorms as well as by convection reductions. The transmission of the electric field and currents from the magnetospheric dynamos to the mid-equatorial latitude ionosphere is explained by means of the magnetosphere-ionosphere-ground (MIG) transmission line developed by Kikuchi [JGR 2014]. The Poynting flux is transmitted to the polar ionosphere by the Alfven waves in the magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) transmission line and by the TM0 (TEM) mode waves to the mid-equatorial ionosphere in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide (ionosphere-ground (IG) transmission line). A fraction of the Poynting flux in the IG transmission line leaks into the ionosphere, driving the ionospheric currents in the E-region and motion of plasma in the F-region. Thus, the midlatitude electric field and equatorial currents are well correlated.",

            "abstract": "The giant planet magnetodiscs are shaped by the radial transport of plasma originating in the inner magnetosphere. Along with plasma transport, magnetic flux transport is a key aspect of the stretched magnetic field configuration of the magnetodisc. While net mass transport is outward (ultimately lost to the solar wind), magnetic flux conservation requires a balanced two-way transport process involving magnetic reconnection. A key property of flux transport is the azimuthal bend forward or bend back of the magnetic field. The bend back configuration is an expected property of the magnetodisc with net mass outflow, but the bend forward configuration can be achieved with the rapid inward motion of mostly empty flux tubes following thin current sheet reconnection. We present a comprehensive analysis of current sheet crossings in Saturn's magnetosphere using Cassini MAG data from 2004 to 2012 in an attempt to quantify the circulation of magnetic flux, emphasizing local time dependence. We find that the bend forward cases are limited mostly to the post-noon sector, indicating that much of the reconnection returning flux to the inner magnetosphere occurs in the subsolar and dusk sector. We also find a complex and patchy network of reconnection sites, supporting the idea that plasma can be lost on small-scales through a ``drizzle''-like process rather than a single extended X-line as originally envisioned for the Vasyliunas cycle. Auroral implications for the observed flux circulation and comparisons with Jupiter will also be presented.",

In previous work, synthetic data was produced which had spectral properties derived from the observations of the Hinode/EIS spectrometer. We assumed observations in multiple spectral orders, then used an inverse problem method to infer the spectral properties of the solar source. Physical constraints and regularization derived from prior knowledge were incorporated as part of the solution process.\nHowever in previous work a single emission line without overlapping from neighboring lines was assumed.

Studies suggest that bacteria have a profound effect on Pseudo-nitzschia physiology and toxin production, which influences its dominance in coastal environment. Here, we investigate the microbial assemblages before, during and after toxic and nontoxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms to determine the patterns of bacterial succession in these events. Bacterial community profiles were determined weekly at the Santa Cruz Wharf using next generation sequencing and analyzed together with domoic acid levels, nutrients, temperature and phytoplankton structure.

It marks the transition between ice that can contribute to sea level and that which already has. Ice shelf basal melt rates are a maximum close the GZ and can have an important influence on inland flow. Changes in the position of the GZ for an ice stream resting on a bed with a retrograde slope (deepening inland) can provide an early warning of an instability in flow or state transition. Several methods exists to monitor the GZ, however, to date, there has been no method for routinely and regularly monitoring the GZ, nor any method that can be applied unambiguously across its entirety around Antarctica.\nThe CryoSat-2 mission provides year-round coverage of the ice sheets, at a high spatial resolution. On the Antarctic ice shelves, the 369 day repeat period of the observations leads to aliasing of tidal motion induced by ocean tides, resulting in distinct patterns in the CryoSat-2 elevation measurements. Here, we focus on the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf to demonstrate the potential of the Cryosat-2 observations to map the GZ, and compare our results with existing GZ estimates.",

            "abstract": "This presentation provides an overview of a field project in the rainforest of the Brazilian Amazon region conducted during April to July 2014. Objectives were to investigate turbulent transport and chemical processing of vegetation emitted gases to assess the role of the forest in aerosol production. Turbulence within and above the 35-m forest was investigated with 10 sonic anemometers deployed on a 50-m tower. Temporal and spatial distribution of plant-emitted hydrocarbons, and reactive chemical species such as ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides were determined using gas analyzers and mass spectrometers to estimate aerosol yields from hydrocarbon photo-oxidation. Particle sizes and concentrations were investigated with aerosol spectrometers. The upper canopy experienced strong turbulence, with standard deviation of vertical velocity normalized by the friction velocity similar to values above the forest. The lower canopy maintained a quiescent state with turbulence being four times weaker than near the canopy top. Such weak turbulent state is conducive to the development of strong and pronounced hydrocarbon mixing ratio mean gradients within the canopy, with highest gas levels within the forest crown responding to strong emissions. The forest emitted monoterpenes, resulting in a total sum exceeding one parts per billion (ppb). Ozone levels ranged from 5 to 10 ppb. Such low ozone mixing ratios can be attributed to the frequent presence of clouds and precipitation. However, following the passage of mesoscale convective storms, ozone levels abruptly increased in response to downward transport from aloft and reached maximum levels of 30 ppb. Photochemical process remained suppressed and resulted in low particle concentrations (<104 particles cm-3), dominated by small diameter (< 400 nanometers) particles. Oxidants remained at sufficient levels to allow reactions of the locally produced hydrocarbons to generate particles. One conclusion is that the rainforest produces necessary and sufficient precursors to form particles.",

            "abstract": "Ethics education is an increasingly important component of the pre-professional training of geoscientists. Funding agencies (NSF) require training of graduate students in the responsible conduct of research, employers are increasingly expecting their workers to have basic training in ethics, and the public demands that scientists abide by the highest standards of ethical conduct. Yet, few faculty have the requisite training to effectively teach about ethics in their classes, or even informally in mentoring their research students.\nTo address this need, an NSF-funded workshop was convened to explore how ethics education can be incorporated into the geoscience curriculum. Workshop goals included: examining where and how geoethics topics can be taught from introductory courses for non-majors to modules embedded in \"core\" geoscience majors courses or dedicated courses in geoethics; sharing best pedagogic practices for “what works” in ethics education; developing a geoethics curriculum framework; creating a collection of online instructional resources, case studies, and related materials; applying lessons learned about ethics education from sister disciplines (biology, engineering, philosophy); and considering ways that geoethics instruction can contribute to public scientific literacy.\nFour major themes were explored in detail: (1) GeoEthics and self: examining the internal attributes of a geoscientist that establish the ethical values required to successfully prepare for and contribute to a career in the geosciences; (2) GeoEthics and the geoscience profession: identifying ethical standards expected of geoscientists if they are to contribute responsibly to the community of practice; (3) GeoEthics and society: exploring geoscientists’ responsibilities to effectively and responsibly communicate the results of geoscience research to inform society about issues ranging from geohazards to natural resource utilization in order to protect public health, safety, and economic security; (4) GeoEthics and Earth: explicating geoscientists’ responsibilities to provide stewardship towards of the Earth based on their knowledge of Earth’s composition, architecture, history, dynamic processes, and complex systems.

            "abstract": "Six transoceanic historical tsunami events including Japan Tohoku tsunami (2011), Chile Maule tsunami (2010), Indian Ocean tsunami (2004), Japan Nankai tsunami (1946), Chile Valdivia tsunami (1960), and Alaska tsunami (1964) have been modeled using a 2D well-balanced shallow water numerical model. The model solves the nonlinear 2D shallow water equations using an upwind finite volume method and is shown in this study to be capable of modeling the tsunami waves and resulting inundations over complex topography and bathymetry. The finite volume method is capable of modeling the wetting and drying of the bed surface at the coastline with no numerical instabilities and the inundation is modeled by allowing the computational cells to dynamically change from dry to wet. The numerical model implements parallel computations on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which enables the model to implement detailed modeling of inundation of small-scale coastal regions in a short simulation time. The slip distribution and seismic moment of the six earthquake driven tsunami events are introduced to the model as the initial condition including coastal uplift and subsidence. Both local regions and far-field regions affected by these tsunami waves are numerically studied and the resulting run-up and tsunami inundations are compared with the recorded observation data provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) including coastal tide gauges and eyewitness observation data. The GPU-based finite volume model indicates accuracy and robustness as well as short simulation time that can be used for transoceanic tsunami waves modeling including real-time numerical modeling of tsunami events and their inland inundations.",

            "abstract": "A lot of attention has been focused on the inter-model spread in climate sensitivity, and the radiative feedbacks that contribute to it, as a measure of our uncertainty in the climate system's response to external forcing. Several of the studies investigating inter-model spread in climate feedbacks use transient climate simulations. The spread in feedback estimates obtained in this way, however, is due not only to structural differences among models, but also to internal climate variability. Here we explicitly assess the impact of internal variability on radiative feedback estimates in 40 transient SRES A1B scenario simulations with NCAR's Community Climate System Model Version 3 (CCSM3). We find that the spread in globally averaged feedbacks among members of this Large Ensemble corresponds to an average of 25% of the spread in feedbacks derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Version 3 (CMIP3) multi-model ensemble. The internal variability in the CCSM3 Large Ensemble is characterized using Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) and compared to the variability in feedback estimates from CMIP3. We identify EOFs that appear to represent similar processes in both ensembles using pattern correlation. Assuming that the multi-model ensemble includes variability due to both internal processes and model differences, we attempt to remove the impact of internal variability from CMIP3 feedback estimates by reconstructing feedbacks from their EOFs excluding those that exhibit a strong similarity to the leading EOFs in the Large Ensemble.",

            "abstract": "Recently there has been increasing interest and awareness in the coupling between the neutral atmosphere and the ionosphere and specifically in processes that cause wave-like non-stationary perturbations in the bottom-side of the F-region. A class of these perturbations having periods greater than about five minutes and wavelengths greater than a kilometer or so are believed to occur routinely and propagate throughout the ionosphere; they are known as traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs). In this study we investigate ground-based techniques for detecting and characterizing TIDs with periods ranging from 30-90 minutes and wavelengths of 10s of km or more. These waves are believed to affect the Doppler and propagation angles of high frequency (HF) radio waves refracting through the affected regions. Wave-like perturbations are also commonly observed in GPS total electron content (TEC) data. In the current study we monitor a number of different commercial HF broadcast transmitters from a station in Wallops Island, VA and collect GPS TEC data from numerous stations along the path between the HF receiver at Wallops and specific HF transmitters. The objective is to understand the relationship between TID signatures on HF and GPS sensors and to possibly characterize TIDs using such observations, including propagation velocity, amplitude, wavelength and potentially source. Given that GPS TEC data are now relatively abundant around the globe, establishing a reliable technique for quantifying TIDs with these measurements would yield an important new technique towards developing a global TID monitoring capability that could support ionosphere-thermosphere coupling science as well as potential monitoring capabilities for natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions) with significant TID signatures.",

            "abstract": "The great majority of paleoclimate records from the eastern Pacific suggest a drastic reduction in ENSO variability during the mid-Holocene (around 6 ka BP). However, new coral records from the central Pacific challenge this notion; they show that changes in mid-Holocene ENSO variability lie within the range of variability seen in the Late Holocene. Using a combination of proxy records, modern observations, and climate model simulations we show that conflicting evidence from the east and the central Pacific could be explained by a differential response of the so-called ENSO flavors (Central and Eastern Pacific ENSO) to orbital forcing. We first re-interpret the proxy records based on their location: we argue that eastern Pacific proxies record solely the impact of EP ENSO events on sea surface temperature and precipitation, while western Pacific coral records most likely capture their influence on sea surface salinity. The central Pacific is more complex since CP and EP events have an impact there via temperature and salinity respectively. Aided by a quantitative method that combines observed patterns of variance we show that the proxies are consistent with a large reduction in ENSO’s EP flavor and a not so dramatic increase in the CP flavor. These results are in agreement with climate model simulations of the mid-Holocene, which indeed show a large reduction in the frequency of EP events, and a small increase in the frequency of CP events in response to orbital forcing.",

            "abstract": "The Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP; Swada, et al., 2002) has been used by a trained team of On the Cutting Edge (CE) observers to characterize the degree of student-centered teaching in US college and university geoscience classrooms. Total RTOP scores are derived from scores on 25 rubric items used to characterize teaching practices in categories of lesson design, content delivery, student-instructor and student-student interactions. More than 200 classroom observations have been completed by the RTOP team in undergraduate courses at a variety of US institution types (e.g., community colleges, research universities). A balanced mix of early career, mid-career, and veteran faculty are included, and the study examines class sizes ranging from small (<30) to large (>80 students). Observations are limited to one class session and do not include laboratories or field activities. Data include RTOP scores determined by a trained observer during the classroom observation and an online survey in which the observed instructors report on their teaching practices. RTOP scores indicate that the observed geoscience classes feature varying degrees of student-centered teaching, with 30% of observed classes categorized as teacher-centered (RTOP scores ≤30), 45% of observed classes categorized as transitional classrooms (RTOP scores 31-49) and 25% are student-centered (RTOP scores ≥ 50). Instructor self-report survey data and RTOP scores indicate that geoscience faculty who have participated in one or more CE professional development event and use the CE website have an average RTOP score of 49, which is significantly higher (> 15 points) than the average score of faculty who have not participated in CE events and have not used the website. Approximately 60% of student-centered classes (those with high RTOP scores) use some traditional lecture nearly every day, but are also are likely to include an in-class activity or group discussion (e.g. Think-Pair-Share). More than 50% of instructors in student-centered classes report spending 30% or less of their class time on such activities (e.g. ≤ 15 minutes of a 50 minute class period), indicating that a relatively small investment can yield important impacts in engaging undergraduate geoscience students.",

            "abstract": "Microbially mediated sulfate reduction is a ubiquitous process in many subsurface systems. Isotopic fractionation is characteristic of this anaerobic process, since sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) favor the reduction of the lighter sulfate isotopologue (S32O42-) over the heavier isotopologue (S34O42-). Detection of isotopic shifts have been utilized as a proxy for the onset of sulfate reduction in subsurface systems such as oil reservoirs and aquifers undergoing uranium bioremediation. Reactive transport modeling (RTM) of kinetic sulfur isotope fractionation has been applied to field and laboratory studies. These RTM approaches employ different mathematical formulations in the representation of kinetic sulfur isotope fractionation. In order to test the various formulations, we propose a benchmark problem set for the simulation of kinetic sulfur isotope fractionation during microbially mediated sulfate reduction. The benchmark problem set is comprised of four problem levels and is based on a recent laboratory column experimental study of sulfur isotope fractionation. Pertinent processes impacting sulfur isotopic composition such as microbial sulfate reduction and dispersion are included in the problem set. To date, participating RTM codes are: CRUNCHTOPE, TOUGHREACT, MIN3P and THE GEOCHEMIST’S WORKBENCH. Preliminary results from various codes show reasonable agreement for the problem levels simulating sulfur isotope fractionation in 1D.",

            "abstract": "Porewater methane and sulfate concentrations from cored sediments have been measured in two coastal mangrove ecosystems (Celestún and Chelem Lagoons) on the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. Methane exists in shallow sediments while sulfate is not depleted and stable carbon isotopes of methane (-87.27‰ ~ -62.08‰) imply high methane fluxes/production rates below and within the cored sediment depths. The preliminary results from a transport-reaction model show that methane emitted to the water column from these sediments could be 17.8 mg m-2 d-1 in Celestún Lagoon and much higher (565 mg m-2 d-1) in Chelem Lagoon. Since the water depths are shallow (mostly less than 100 cm), the high fluxes of methane could contribute to the atmosphere. The objectives of this study will aim to understand the biogeochemical cycles for methane and sulfate in sediments. A numerical transport-reaction model will be applied to the sedimentary geochemical data (methane, sulfate, chloride, particulate organic carbon (POC) and stable carbon isotopes of headspace methane) from the two lagoons to estimate sulfate reduction, methane oxidation and production rates and advective methane fluxes. The modeled results will be used to discuss the role of methane from mangrove areas and their potential contribution to the global methane cycle.",

The convection in the Kelvin waves appears to be strongly phase locked in the area of the Maritime continent with the pronounced afternoon maximum. The diurnal phase locking is also evident as Kelvin waves propagate trough the Indian Ocean basin, suggesting that at least some Kelvin waves in this area are forced by the diurnally varying heat source related either to the convection over the land such as Eastern Africa or Madagascar, or over ocean areas with the high SST variability. We examine the hypothesis that the “matching” of the convective phase of the waves with the afternoon maximum of convection over Sumatra influences the wave strength after it crosses the Maritime Continent and can contribute to MJO propagation. The observational results based on observed Kelvin waves are supported by the results of the shallow water model of the interaction of the dry Kelvin wave with the diurnally oscillating heat source.",

            "abstract": "The idea of using a high intensity electron beam to actively probe magnetic field line connectivity in space has been discussed since the 1970’s. However, its experimental realization onboard a magnetospheric spacecraft has never been accomplished because of serious spacecraft charging concerns. Unlike the case of beam experiments in the ionosphere, the tenuous magnetospheric plasma cannot provide the return current necessary to keep the spacecraft charging under control and alternative pathways must therefore be sought. One such pathway is the concept in which a high density contactor plasma emitted prior to the electron beam is used to aid beam emission.\nIn this work, we perform Particle-In-Cell simulations to investigate the conditions under which a high intensity electron beam can be emitted from a magnetospheric spacecraft. First, we show that the electron beam cannot simply be compensated for by an ion beam of equal current, because the Child-Langmuir law is easily violated under conditions of interest. Second, we study the release of a contactor neutral plasma before beam emission and show that the presence of the contactor plasma allows beam emission for longer times. This is consistent with a simple picture where the capacitance of the system consisting of the spacecraft and the ion contactor cloud is increased, as is the time necessary for the spacecraft to charge to the beam kinetic energy and call the beam back. Last, we perform simulations where both the electron beam and the contactor plasma are emitted simultaneously. We show that, after an initial transient controlled by the size of the initial contactor cloud, where the spacecraft potential rises, the spacecraft potential can settle into conditions that allow for electron beam emission. A physical explanation of this result is presented and its implications for beam experiments in space are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Seismic anisotropy is used to constrain stresses or geologic structures. In volcanic areas, distinguishing characteristics of the stress is important for understanding geologic processes at depths. We measure shear wave splitting of Mt. Fuji. In this area, the geophysical environment includes regional stress fields, the gravitational effect of the volcanic edifice, and stress perturbations caused by the 2011 Tohoku-Oki Earthquake and a Mw 5.9 event on 15 March 2011. Measurement of splitting can be a good indicator of the interaction of these factors. We used data from 2009 to 2012 at 24 seismic stations around the volcanic edifice.\nThe distribution of fast directions shows a radial pattern in the vicinity of the volcanic edifice while a pattern of stations far from the summit is parallel to the regional compression. We conducted forward modeling of stress fields around Mt. Fuji to test whether the contrast of patterns can be explained by stress. We estimated regional stresses from focal mechanisms by the methodology of Hardebeck and Michael (2006). And then, we calculated stress fields by gravitational effect as a consequence of the deformation of mass of volcanic edifice by solving a Boussinesq problem. We obtained horizontal directions of principal stresses as eigenvectors of stress tensors that sum both regional stress and gravitational effects. The estimation reproduced the radial pattern of seismic anisotropy near the volcano. It may be possible to constrain the absolute range of stresses if we estimate the influence of gravitational effect of topography and area of seismic anisotropy similtaneously.\nMeasurement results of splitting indicate temporal consistency of anisotropy around the volcanic edifice. Delay times did not show significant change of seismic anisotropy less than 0.025s. By contrast, calculated vp/vs ratios in the measured area suggest that some small change may exist. In previous geophysical observations of Mt. Fuji, possible perturbation of stresses or seismic velocities by the 2011 Tohoku-Oki Earthquake did exist (e.g., Fujita et al., 2013, Brenguier et al., 2014). These changes, however, are small and our lack of significant change of splitting is consistent with these former studies. Subtle change of splitting may be detected if events are restricted spatially enough.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, the system of fluid equations governing core flow dynamics are solved in a numerically uncoupled manner. In practice, this forces fully spectral simulations based on Chebyshev series, Fourier series and spherical harmonics to treat all terms explicitly, with the exception of diffusion. The Coriolis force, for instance, is often treated explicitly and leads to severe time-stepping restrictions. For stability, accuracy and performance reasons, it is preferable to treat all linear terms in the system implicitly; however, this leads to a numerically coupled system of equations that needs to be solved at each timestep. A naive implementation would lead to a discretized system of the form A x = b that is too dense to be solved in an efficient manner (Fig. 1a). We present an alternative approach rendering all A matrices sparse, thus allowing the coupled system to be solved efficiently (Fig. 1b). Our approch has been successfully employed on a range of linear and non-linear problems in Cartesian, spherical and cylindrical geometries (Fig. 2,3).",

            "abstract": "CF3CClH2 (HCFC-133a) was recently detected in the atmosphere and its atmospheric mixing ratio has quadrupled over the last 10 years. As expected for this class of compound, HCFC-133a is both an ozone-depleting substance and a greenhouse gas. Precise knowledge of its atmospheric degradation and radiative efficiency is critical to understanding its effect upon the atmosphere. The predominant atmospheric loss process for HCFC-133a is via reaction with the OH radical, where the rate coefficient for this reaction is poorly constrained, especially below room temperature. UV photolysis is a minor loss process, although large discrepancies exist among the reported spectrum measurements. The infrared spectrum of HCFC-133a is presently not available in the literature. The primary focus of this work was to reduce the uncertainties in the atmospheric loss processes of HCFC-133a and its radiative efficiency. Rate coefficient measurements for the OH + HCFC-133a reaction over the temperature range 233–397 K will be reported. In addition, UV absorption spectrum measurements over the wavelength (184.95–240 nm) and temperature (213–323 K) ranges and infrared absorption measurements from 500–4000 cm-1 will be reported. These results are used in 2-D atmospheric model calculations to quantify the atmospheric loss processes, atmospheric lifetime, ozone depletion potential, radiative efficiency, and global warming potential of HCFC-133a. These important metrics will enable informed policy decisions regarding HCFC-133a.",

            "abstract": "The NOAA Center for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) sponsors a network of high school and middle school summer camps entitled “Channeling Atmospheric Research into Educational Experiences Reaching Students program, CAREERS”. These camps are conducted nationwide at NCAS academic partners; the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), Howard University (HU), University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM), and Jackson State University (JSU). The goals of these camps are to increase the interest of secondary school (HS) students in atmospheric and weather related sciences, target under-represented students, and to ultimately boost their college enrollment in STEM related fields. For 2014 at UTEP, the annual student-outreach weather camp program underwent a thematic overhaul that sought to incorporate more of the geological and environmental context of the region. Doctoral students were allowed to assume greater responsibility for the design, development and implementation of the camp activities. The prevailing assumption was that these Ph.D. students were better suited for peer mentoring, bridging the age and interest gap, and delivering the material through the modern technologies and modes of communication. The redesigned approach focused on the identification of climate drivers within the region and this concept formed a thread throughout the planning and design of the camp modules. The outcome resulted in the incorporation of project based learning (PBL) activities, field excursions, and deployment of weather instrumentation, for explaining regional climate processes and events. Standardized surveys were administered to camp participants to evaluate the efficacy, as well as student perceptions of the camp and its activities. Results will be presented that are based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of student responses.",

            "abstract": "We examine the implicit dynamics in models of the fluid-rock interaction that may be occurring in magmatic conduits (e.g. Julian, 1994; Balmforth et al., 2005; Corona-Romero et al., 2012). We analyze and discuss major differences in their governing equations and geometry, and in their properties and parametric dependences. The models consider the fluid-rock dynamic interaction in a fluid driven conduit embedded in a solid elastic space. The formulations vary from 1D to 3D although the later is axisymmetric. The fluid and solid are dynamically coupled fulfilling continuity of normal velocities and stresses at the conduit's wall. A pressure transient at a point of the conduit, that perturbs a steady flow of incompressible viscous fluid, produces the interaction between the fluid and motion at the conduit's walls. The fluid motion induces the elastic response of the conduit wall forcing it to oscillate. This fluid-rock interaction may generate long lasting response. As a source, we used different pressure excitations functions (e.g. Dirac’s Delta, Gaussian function) including those measuring during simulations gas burst and fragmentation of volcanic rocks under controlled laboratory conditions. Changes in the source magnitude confirm the non-linear behavior of the fluid-rock interaction and the effects of the fluid properties as its viscosity. In our investigation the most robust approach (Corona-Romero et al., 2012) includes the analytical solution and allows changes in the properties of the fluid and the surrounding rock, and in the geometry, by coupling two or more conduits. Besides, the governing equations include the calculation of the pressure and the fluid history along the conduit as well as the velocity of the walls. Furthermore, the synthetics are comparable with those obtained experimentally. Our analyses explore the capabilities, advantages and limitations of the models to simulate volcanic seismic signals.",

            "abstract": "Between 30 June and 1 July 2011, a heavy-rain-producing mesoscale convective system (MCS) occurred over Lake Michigan. A second MCS subsequently occurred over Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin on 1 July 2011 resulting in more than 200 severe weather reports. The antecedent large-scale flow evolution was strongly influenced by early-season tropical cyclones (TCs) Haima and Meari in the western North Pacific. The recurvature and subsequent interaction of these TCs with the extratropical large-scale flow was associated with Rossby wave train (RWT) amplification on 22–26 June 2011 over the western North Pacific and dispersion across North America on 28–30 June 2011. The RWT dispersion was associated with trough (ridge) development over western (central) North America at the time of MCS development over the Midwestern United States. This evolution of the large-scale flow and attendant meso-synoptic scale forcing for ascent were particularly conducive to heavy rainfall and severe weather as a surface-based mixed layer over the Intermountain Western United States was advected eastward, transitioning to an elevated mixed layer (EML) over the Midwestern United States.\nThese two MCSs serve as motivation for a climatology of EML days and their relationship to severe weather over the Midwestern United States. The climatology illustrates that severe weather reports near Minneapolis, MN during the summer are twice as numerous on EML days as compared to normal. The increase in severe weather reports are primarily driven by more large hail and severe wind, which account for 95% of all severe weather reports on EML days. A time-lagged composite analysis indicates that RWT amplification over the central North Pacific and RWT dispersion across the eastern North Pacific and North American, as occurred prior to the 30 June–1 July period, is a common upstream precursor to EML days over the Midwestern United States. These results suggest that investigations of far upstream precursors to RWT amplification and dispersion over the North Pacific may be particularly useful in better understanding warm-season severe weather outbreaks over North America.",

            "abstract": "Urban impervious surfaces lead to increases in stormwater runoff. Green infrastructure, like bioretention cells, is being used to mitigate negative impacts of runoff by disconnecting impervious surfaces from storm water systems and redirecting flow to decentralized treatment areas. While bioretention soil characteristics are carefully designed, little research is available on soil moisture dynamics within the cells and how these might relate to inter-storm variability in performance. Bioretentions have been installed along a residential street in Parma, Ohio to determine the impact of green infrastructure on the West Creek watershed, a 36 km2 subwatershed of the Cuyahoga River. Bioretentions were installed in two phases (Phase I in 2013 and Phase II in 2014); design and vegetation density vary slightly between the two phases. Our research focuses on characterizing soil moisture dynamics of multiple bioretentions and assessing their impact on stormwater runoff at the street scale. Soil moisture measurements were collected in transects for eight bioretentions over the course of one summer. Vegetation indices of canopy height, percent vegetative cover, species richness and NDVI were also measured. A flow meter in the storm drain at the end of the street measured storm sewer discharge. Precipitation was recorded from a meteorological station 2 km from the research site. Soil moisture increased in response to precipitation and decreased to relatively stable conditions within 3 days following a rain event. Phase II bioretentions exhibited greater soil moisture and less vegetation than Phase I bioretentions, though the relationship between soil moisture and vegetative cover is inconclusive for bioretentions constructed in the same phase. Data from five storms suggest that pre-event soil moisture does not control the runoff-to-rainfall ratio, which we use as a measure of bioretention performance. However, discharge data indicate that hydrograph characteristics, such as lag time and peak flow, are altered relative to a control street. This analysis suggests that street-scale implementation of bioretention can reduce the impact of impervious surface on stormflows, but more information is needed to fully understand how soil moisture of the bioretentions affects inter-storm variability in performance.",

            "abstract": "In the past decade, great strides have been made in the development of models capable of projecting the future evolution of glaciers and the polar ice sheets in a changing climate. These models are now capable of replicating some of the trends apparent in satellite observations. However, because this field is just now maturing, very few efforts have been dedicated to adapting these capabilities to education. Technologies that have been used in outreach efforts in Atmospheric and Oceanic sciences still have not been extended to Cryospheric Science. We present a cutting-edge, technologically driven virtual laboratory, geared towards outreach and k-12 education, dedicated to the polar ice sheets on Antarctica and Greenland, and their role as major contributors to sea level rise in coming decades. VISL (Virtual Ice Sheet Laboratory) relies on state-of-the art Web GL rendering of polar ice sheets, Android/iPhone and web portability using Javascript, as well as C++ simulations (back-end) based on the Ice Sheet System Model, the NASA model for simulating the evolution of polar ice sheets. Using VISL, educators and students can have an immersive experience into the world of polar ice sheets, while at the same exercising the capabilities of a state-of-the-art climate model, all of it embedded into an education experience that follows the new STEM standards for education.\nThis work was performed at the California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Cryosphere Science Program.",

            "abstract": "To represent the radiative impact of cloud fields in large scale models, an adequate parameterization of the cloud overlap is necessary. With the ever increasing resolution of weather and climate models, it becomes important to treat the cloud overlap parameterization seperately for different cloud regimes, and in the near future even consider the cloud overlap on a cloud-by-cloud basis. This study continues the work of Neggers et al (JGR, 2011) who used large-eddy simulations to find that the cloud overlap in warm cumulus cloud fields is much more inefficient than previously results for more generic cloud fields found. In this study, we attempt to create some physical understanding of the cloud overlap by looking at the cloud overlap of individual clouds, and comparing that to the entire cloud field. While the overlap ratio goes to zero for the cloud field, an asymptotic limit can be found when looking at individual clouds. More over, preliminary results suggest that a data collapse can be observed in the cloud overlap of individual clouds, while the overlap of the entire field changes significantly between different scenes in a field of slowly organizing cumulus clouds. The individual overlap can then be split out between contributions of the large-scale shear and of the fractal shape of the cloud. This work suggests that with a good knowledge of the turbulent state, the mean wind shear, and the cloud size distribution, a physical understanding of the cloud overlap can be found, leading to an improved basis for parameterizations.",

            "abstract": "Simple formulae are developed to calculate equatorial Pacific WWV from wind stress. The WWV formulae are in agreement with WWV observations. They show that it is zonal equatorial convergence, rather than meridional convergence, that is mainly responsible for the WWV. Also, the theory shows that the WWV is closely related to the non-equilibrium variability that leads El Nino and can be used to predict it. In accordance with Bunge and Clarke (May 2014, J. Phys. Oceanogr.), vital to this predictability is that at interannual and lower frequencies equatorial Kelvin and Rossby wave modes combine to form long Rossby waves which propagate westward more slowly with increased latitude. Consequently, the signal delay at the western boundary increases with meridional distance from the equator and also with increasing zonal distance of the major equatorial wind forcing from the western boundary. Thus the further the equatorial wind forcing is from the western boundary, the bigger the signal delays at the western boundary and the more we can see into the future when the non-equilibrium variability reflects at the western boundary and contributes to the equatorial WWV. Since zonal ENSO wind-forcing has been, on average, closer to the western boundary since 1998, the size of the WWV and its lead over ENSO has on average decreased.",

            "abstract": "The Quesungual agroforestry system from western Honduras has been increasingly promoted as a promising alternative to traditional slash-and-burn agriculture in tropical dry forest regions of the Americas. Improved residue management and the lack of burning in this system can greatly impact soil biological functioning and a number of key soil-based ecosystem services, yet our understanding of these processes has not been thoroughly integrated to understand system functionality as a whole that can guide improved management. To address this gap, we present a synthesis of various field studies conducted in Central America aimed at: 1) quantifying the influence of the Quesungual agroforestry practices on soil macrofauna abundance and diversity, and 2) understanding how these organisms influence key soil-based ecosystem services that ultimately drive the success of this system. A first set of studies examined the impact of agroecosystem management on soil macrofauna populations, soil fertility and key soil processes. Results suggest that residue inputs (derived from tree biomass pruning), a lack of burning, and high tree densities, lead to conditions that support abundant, diverse soil macrofauna communities under agroforestry, with soil organic carbon content comparable to adjacent forest. Additionally, there is great potential in working with farmers to develop refined soil quality indicators for improved land management. A second line of research explored interactions between residue management and earthworms in the regulation of soil-based ecosystem services. Earthworms are the most prominent ecosystem engineers in these soils. We found that earthworms are key drivers of soil structure maintenance and the stabilization of soil organic matter within soil aggregates, and also had notable impacts on soil nutrient dynamics. However, the impact of earthworms appears to depend on residue management practices, thus indicating the need for an integrated approach for management of soil biological function and ecosystem services in the Quesungual agroforestry system.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimates of hydrocarbon source zone natural attenuation (SZNA) rates are important for managing contaminated sites but are difficult to measure. Moreover, SZNA rates may vary seasonally in response to climatic conditions. Previous research at a crude oil spill site near Bemidji, Minnesota, USA showed that SZNA rates in the summer can be estimated by subtracting background soil CO2 efflux from the total soil CO2 efflux above the contaminated source. In this study, seasonal variations in surficial CO2 efflux were evaluated with measurements of gas concentrations (including 14CO2), temperature, and volumetric water content in the vadose zone at the site during a 2-year period. Soil CO2 effluxes in the source zone were consistently greater than background CO2 effluxes, and the magnitude and areal extent of the increased efflux varied seasonally. In the source zone, the 14CO2 and the CO2 efflux data showed a larger proportion of soil CO2 was derived from SZNA in fall and winter (October – February) compared to the summer (June – August). Surficial CO2 effluxes and vadose zone CO2 and CH4 concentrations in the source (2 – 7 meters below land surface) were positively correlated with soil temperature, indicating seasonal variability in SZNA rates. However, peak surficial CO2 effluxes did not correspond with periods of highest CO2 or CH4 concentrations at the 2 – 7 meter depth, demonstrating the effects of physical attributes (such as soil depth, frost, and volumetric water content) on gas transport. Overall, results showed that SZNA rates, background soil respiration rates, and gas transport varied seasonally, and that biological and physical factors are important to consider for accurately estimating SZNA rates.",

            "abstract": "Extreme weather phenomena remain a significant challenge for climate models due in part to the relatively small space and time scales at which such events occur. Accordingly, robust simulation of extreme events requires models with high fidelity at these relatively small scales. However, numerous recent studies have shown evidence that current climate models exhibit non-convergent changes in extreme weather statistics as spatial and temporal resolution increase. These studies also provide evidence that such non-convergence originates in the subgrid parameterization suites (e.g., micro/macrophysics and convection).\nIn order to provide a framework for identifying parameterization characteristics that cause non-convergent behavior and for testing parameterization improvements, we have developed a hindcast-based system characterizing the fidelity of extremes as a function of spatial and temporal resolution. The use of hindcasts as a model evaluation tool allows us to identify modes of failure (e.g., false-hits and misses) that systematically vary as a function of resolution. We have implemented this framework for the Community Earth System Model, and we have created a dataset of hindcast ensembles at multiple horizontal resolutions. Preliminary analysis of this multi-resolution set of hindcasts shows that in some regions, (1) the tail of the precipitation probability density (PDF) function grows as resolution increases (in accord with recent studies), and that (2) a large portion of this increase in the PDF tail comes from increases in Type I model errors—simulated extreme events that do not occur in observations. We explore possible causes of this inconsistent model behavior.",

Several paleoshorelines of Lake Otero have been identified throughout the basin by field surveys and remote sensing using digital elevation models. Up to four shorelines may be buried beneath White Sands Dune Field and it has been posited that the current upwind margin of White Sands coincides with a one of these shorelines. Here we employ a novel geophysical instrument and method to image the subsurface: the seismic land streamer. The land streamer utilizes weighted base plates and one-component vertical geophones in a towed array. With a seisgun acoustic source, we imaged in the Alkali Flats area near the upwind margin, one potential location of paleoshorelines, as well as the Film Lot closer to the center of the dune field. Surfaces in both locations are indurated gypsum playa, which made seismic imaging possible and successful. We collected one SW-NE trending seismic line at each location, which matches the dominant wind and dune migration directions. Based on initial data analysis we find some subsurface structure that may coincide with the paleo lake bed of Lake Otero. The successful demonstration of this new method provides the foundation for an expanded regional subsurface study to image the strata and structure of the Tularosa Basin.",

The former is dynamically forced by the atmosphere, and the latter reflects other thermodynamic and ocean processes. We then applied the self-organizing map (SOM) method to these two components separately and arrived at finite number of SH SIC variability patterns. The opposing SIC trends in the west Antarctic Seas, with an increase in the Ross Sea region and decrease over the Bellingshausin Sea and near the Antarctica Peninsula, are captured by both the SOM patterns based on the SLP component and those based on the residual component. Figure 1 shows that the SIC trend captured by the residual component (right panel) compares better than that captured by the SLP component (left panel), suggestive of dominance of ocean processes.\nWhen applying the PLS on sea ice extent (SIE), with seasonal SIE being predictand and predictor fields including SLP and GPCP precipitation, we find that the fall season (MAM) precipitation has some skill (r=0.4) for wintertime (JJA) SIE. The preliminary results of the lag composites based on the residual SOM patterns show that MAM precipitation leads JJA SIC, with mixed layer depth (MLD) adjustment in response to MAM precipitation. A preliminary analysis of the vertical temperature and salinity in the Ross Gyre from an OGCM will also be presented to provide plausible mechanisms for the increased SIC trend in the Ross Sea in recent decades.",

            "abstract": "Calibration of soil drainage parameters in hydrologic models is typically achieved using statistics based on streamflow. Models that couple hydrology with ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling also calculate estimates of carbon and nutrient stores and fluxes. Particularly in water-limited environments, these estimates will be sensitive to soil drainage parameters. We investigate the use of estimates of annual net primary productivity (annNPP) as an additional data source for soil parameter calibration. We combine literature-based estimates of annNPP with streamflow statistics to calibrate for soil parameters in three Western U.S. watersheds using a coupled eco-hydrology model. We show that for all sites, estimates of annNPP vary significantly across soil parameters selected solely using streamflow calibration. In all watersheds streamflow metrics select soil parameters that yield a range of annNPP estimates that can exceed literature-derived bounds for annNPP by 58-77%. Only 1-10% of the original soil parameter sets met both annNPP and streamflow criteria – a substantial reduction when compared to the percentage of acceptable parameter sets selected using annNPP or streamflow separately. Similarly, streamflow performance varies substantially across soil parameters selected based solely on annNPP criteria. Results show that annNPP in combination with streamflow-based metrics can better constrain soil parameters, although the usefulness varies across watersheds.",

            "abstract": "The H/V ratio is the square root of the ratio of horizontal to vertical energies of ground motion. It has been observed that the frequency of the main peak is well suited for the characterization of site effects and had been widely used for micro-zonation and seismic structural design. Historically that ratio was made from the average of individual H/V ratios obtained from noise autocorrelations. Nevertheless, it has been recently pointed out that the H/V ratio should be calculated differently as the ratio of the average of H over the average of V. This calculation is based on the relation between the directional energies (the imaginary part of Green’s function) and the noise autocorrelations. In general, the average of ratios is different from the ratio of averages.\nAlthough the frequency of the main response was correctly obtained, the associated amplification factor has generally been badly predicted, having little matching with the amplification observed during strong earthquakes. The unexpected decay behavior of such ratios at high frequency and the lack of stability and reproducibility of the H/V ratios are other problems that face the method.\nThese problems are addressed here from the point of view of normalization of noise correlations. In fact, several normalization techniques have already been proposed in order to correctly retrieve the Green’s function. Some of them are well suited for the retrieval of the surface wave contribution, while others are more appropriate for bulk wave incidence. Since the H/V ratio may be used for various purposes like surface wave tomography, micro-zonation or seismic design, different normalizations are discussed in functions of the objectives. The H/V obtained from local historical earthquakes on top or far away from the subduction zone are also discussed.\n ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research has been partially supported by DGAPA-UNAM under Project IN104712 and the AXA Research Fund.",

            "abstract": "Inputs of labile organic substrates to soils are commonly associated with elevated soil organic carbon mineralization rates; this process is known as the priming effect. Plant presence and soil conditions (i.e. water regime, nutrient status) are known to be interacting factors governing priming. In this study, we examine the role of differing species, loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and nuttall oak (Quercus texana B.), and moisture regimes (low and high) upon the soil priming effect in a fine textured soil. We explore whether there is depletion of original soil carbon and concurrent replacement through addition of fresh organic matter from the planted tree species. By employing a series of planted and plant-free pots in a greenhouse mesocosm study, we were able to characterize the composition of soil organic matter and its carbon with the use of CuO oxidation products (e.g. lignin, cutin/suberin biomarkers). Carbon was elevated on the low moisture samples relative to all other treatments, and the C:N ratio suggests that newly produced plant carbon replaced original soil carbon. The soil lignin content of the planted treatments was lower than the plant-free treatments suggesting that lignin present in the original soil may have been preferentially degraded by priming and not replaced. We will discuss the utility of CuO oxidation products to explore soil organic carbon dynamics and the implications of understanding the role of species and soil moisture in predicting the response of soil carbon to land use and climate change.",

            "abstract": "Oman has gone through three decades of efforts aimed at addressing groundwater over-pumping and the consequent seawater intrusion. Example of measures adopted by the government since the 1990’s include a vast subsidy program of irrigation modernization, a freeze on drilling new wells, delimitation of several no-drill zones, a crop substitution program, re-use of treated wastewater and construction of recharge dams. With no major success through these measures, the government laid the ground for water quotas by creating a new regulation in 1995. Nevertheless, groundwater quotas have not been enforced to date due to the high implementation and monitoring costs of traditional flow meters. This presentation discusses how sustainable groundwater management can be secured in Oman using a suit of policy and technologic reforms at a reasonable economic, political and practical cost. Data collected from farms with smart meters and low-cost wireless smart irrigation systems have been used to propose sustainable groundwater withdrawal strategies for Oman using a detailed hydro-economic model that couples a MODFLOW-SEAWAT model of the coastal aquifers with a dynamic profit maximization model. The hydro-economic optimization model was flexible to be run both as a social planner model to maximize the social welfare in the region, and as an agent-based model to capture the behavior of farmers interested in maximizing their profits independently. This flexibility helped capturing the trade-off between the optimality of the social planner solution developed at the system’s level and its practicality (stability) with respect to the concerns and behaviors of the profit-maximizing farmers. The idetified promising policy and technolgical reforms for Oman include strict enforcement of groundwater quotas, smart metering, changing crop mixes, improving irrigation technologies, and revising geographical distribution of the farming activities. The presentation will discuss how different combinations of these reforms would affect groundwater and energy use, groundwater level and salinity, crop yield, and agricultural revenues in the future.",

            "abstract": "The fit of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) model predictions to 24 relative sea-level histories and an additional 18 present-day GPS-measured vertical land motion rates constrains the thickness and volume history of the central and northern Laurentide Ice Sheet. The predictions of the best-fit GIA model indicate respective peak ice thicknesses west and east of Hudson Bay of 3.4-3.6 km and approximately 4 km. These values represent, respectively, a large decrease, and a moderate increase, to the load thickness compared to ICE-5G. This result is generally consistent with other GIA studies focussing on space-geodetic constraints. The large reduction to the ice load west of Hudson Bay also reduces the vertical mantle response along the margins of the load centre, which improves the fit to relative sea-level data from the southern Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The fit of GIA model predictions to relative sea-level data from the Baffin Sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet indicate peak ice thicknesses there of 1.2-1.3 km, a modest reduction compared to ICE-5G. On Baffin Island, the modelled elastic crustal response of the Earth to present-day ice mass changes is large. Accounting for this effect improves the agreement between GPS measurements of vertical crustal motion and the GIA model predictions. However, work is needed to incorporate more detailed observations and modelling of present-day changes to glaciers and ice caps. Overall, the fit to the data is most strongly improved in the region west of Hudson Bay (the χ2 RSL misfit is reduced by a factor of ~4) although the entire revised reconstruction for the central and northern Laurentide Ice Sheet provides an improved fit to both the regional RSL data (the cumulative χ2 misfit is reduced by a factor of >2) and the GPS data (the RMS misfit is reduced by a factor of 9).",

            "abstract": "This study investigated the recent subsidence observed at different depths in the Houston-Galveston area. The subsidence was recorded by using 13 borehole extensometers and 76 GPS antennas. Four of the GPS antennas are mounted on the deep-anchored (549, 591, 661 and 936 m below the land surface) inner pipes of borehole extensometers. They are located at approximately the same depth as the bottom of Evangeline aquifer. There are two pairs of closely-spaced ( about 100 m) extensometers. They were completed at different depths and show the variation of compaction rate in depth. We conclude that recent subsidence (1993-2012) in the Houston-Galveston area was dominated by the compaction of sediments within 600 m below the land surface. Deep-anchored GPS data shows stable vertical movement indicating no measurable compaction at the depth of the Jasper aquifer or within deeper strata. Depending on the location of specific sites, the compaction could occur from a depth as shallow as that within the Chicot aquifer to the maximum depth at the middle of the Evangeline aquifer. ",

Here we present our progress to date, including lake sediment records covering the entire Holocene, archaeomagnetic data from Maori cooking (“hangi”) stones dating back to the earliest occupation of New Zealand, archaeointensities from Lapita pottery from the Pacific Islands (Fiji, Tonga and Papua New Guinea) dating back to ca 3000 BP, and palaeomagnetic directions and intensities from volcanic rocks and lava flows of the North Island of New Zealand. Central to the project is a composite lake sediment record, constrained by a high-resolution radiocarbon-based chronology, which provides a complete record of declination, inclination and relative palaeointensity for New Zealand through the Holocene. This is complemented by directions and absolute intensities from archaeological materials, most of which have associated radiocarbon age control, and lavas with 40Ar-39Ar age constraints, the rock magnetism and analytical details of which are discussed in accompanying posters. The overall picture reveals several large amplitude directional swings in the early Holocene magnetic field, followed by relatively low amplitude secular variation for several thousand years leading to the present trend to increasingly easterly declination and steep inclination as the south magnetic pole moves further off the Antarctic continent towards New Zealand.",

            "abstract": "The effects of agricultural production on nitrate contamination of groundwater is a pressing global concern and agricultural best management practices (BMPs) are often implemented as a means to help alleviate this problem. In Western North America, the Abbotsford-Sumas Aquifer spans the US-Canada border and provides drinking water for over 100,000 people. Intensive agriculture combined with high precipitation and well-drained soils make this aquifer susceptible to nitrate contamination. Long-term studies indicate elevated nitrate concentrations may be influenced by overlying land use; thus, in recent decades, various agricultural BMPs and stewardship programs have been implemented in the region to help reduce potential nitrate sources to the aquifer. Despite these improved nutrient management practices, nitrate concentrations have remained relatively high.\nTo explore how time lags associated with surface inputs might explain this pattern, we ask two questions: (1) How have agricultural landscape patterns changed historically? (2) Do historical agricultural patterns explain continued elevated nitrate concentrations? Responses of nitrate concentrations in deep wells (with screens > 15 m below the water table) were contrasted with shallow wells (screens < 15 m) in the US and Canada. A seamless cross-border mosaic of land cover was created by harmonizing a variety of US and Canadian land use and land cover data. Surrounding each well, terrestrial zones of influence (aligned with the directional flow of groundwater) were delineated then historical and contemporary landscape patterns were characterized within these zones. To link landscape patterns with nitrate, multiple regression was used to compare the strength of relationships between historical land uses and mean nitrate concentrations from both deep and shallow wells. Because previous research showed that contemporary land cover was significantly correlated with shallow well nitrate concentrations, we hypothesize that historical land use may show a stronger correlation due to time-lags associated with historical surface inputs.",

Understanding how these impurities may affect the rheology, intrinsic thermodynamic properties, and ultimate fate of these ice sheets, however, is much less understood. One such soluble impurity thought to be of critical importance and already shown to be catalytic in the flow of single crystal ice, is sulfuric acid. In order to further investigate the potential effects that sulfuric acid may also have on the flow and ductility of polycrystalline ice, we have established a procedure for preparing polycrystalline ice specimens that have been doped with known amounts of sulfuric acid which can then be used for conducting creep tests in uniaxial tension while subjected to a low (less than 1 MPa) but constant applied stress. These creep tests are conducted at -10 and -20 degrees C and each specimen is taken to 10% strain. The influence of a variable temperature is thought to be of particular significance as other previous works have already shown that the effects of soluble impurities can be directly observed in the deformation of the ice crystal lattice and grain boundaries. Following the completion of each creep test, post-creep microstructural analysis is conducted via polarized light microscopy, optical environmental SEM imaging, and Raman spectroscopy.",

However, the strength of the interplay between bioenergy crop production and water resource availability is highly uncertain at the spatial scale and determined by (1) the spatial distribution of land cover types; (2) availability of soil water resources; (3) climate conditions and (4) biophysical characteristics of different bioenergy crops, such as water use efficiency (WUE), tolerances to extreme water and thermal conditions (dry, high temperature, low temperature etc.) and photoperiod adaptability, etc.  \nTo address potential water availability concerns the spatial distribution of bioenergy crops needs to be optimized by considering the maximum WUE and the minimum dependence and impact on water resource availability. To address this objective, we apply a coupled biophysical and biogeochemical model (ISAM), to investigate spatial variability in the interplay between water resources and bioenergy crop production in the US. The bioenergy crops considered in this study include Miscanthus, Cave-in-Rock and Alamo switchgrasses, and corn (grain and stover). The interplay between bioenergy crop and corn production with water resources is quantitatively evaluated by calculating WUE and average water stress for different bioenergy crops and change in plant available soil water between bioenergy crops and natural vegetation.\nOur results indicate that low soil water availability limits production of bioenergy grasses in central and eastern Great Plains. Growing energy grasses here strengthens water depletion and limits its potential production. Miscanthus has the highest WUE in the central Midwest, followed by corn stover and Cave-in-Rock. However, growing Miscanthus and Cave-in-Rock here strengthens soil water depletion and induces water stress on their production. Though production of Miscanthus and Alamo in the upper Midwest and Cave-in-Rock and Miscanthus in the southern US do not depend on and impact water resource availability, their WUE is low here. Corn and Cave-in-Rock has higher WUE than other grasses in the upper Midwest, whereas Alamo has the highest WUE of all bioenergy grasses in the southern US.",

            "abstract": "Toluene, ethylbenze, and xylene (TEX) are common contaminants in the subsurface. Activated persulfate has shown promise for degrading a wide variety of organic compounds. However, studies of persulfate application for in situ degradation of TEX and effects on the subsequent bioremediation are limited. In this work, degradation studies of TEX in aqueous media and soil are being conducted using heat activated and chelated-ferrous iron activated persulfate oxidation in batch and flow-through column experiments. In the batch experiments, sodium persulfate is being used at different concentrations to provide an initial persulfate to TEX molar ratios between 10:1 and 100:1. Sodium persulfate solutions are being activated at 20, 37, 60, and 80 oC temperatures for the heat activated oxidation. For the chelated-ferrous iron activated oxidation, ferrous iron and citric acid, both are being used at concentration of 5 mM. In the experiments with soil slurry, a soil to water ratio of 1 to 5 is being used.\nFlow through water saturated column experiments are being conducted with glass columns (45 cm in length and 4 cm in diameter) uniformly packed with soils, and equilibrated with water containing TEX at the target concentrations. Both the heat activation and chelated-ferrous iron activation of persulfate are being employed in the column experiments. Future experiments are planned to determine the suitability of persulfate oxidation of TEX on the subsequent biodegradation using batch microcosms containing TEX degrading microbial cultures. In these experiments, the microbial biomass will be monitored using total phospholipids, and the microbial community will be determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on the extracted DNA. This study is expected to provide suitable operating conditions for in situ chemical oxidation of TEX with activated persulfate followed by bioremediation.",

            "abstract": "AmeriFlux is a network of sites managed by independent investigators measuring carbon, water and heat fluxes. Individual investigators perform many data validity checks. Network-level data validity checks are also being applied to increase network-wide data consistency. A number of different types or errors occur in flux data, and while corrections have been developed to address some types of errors, other error types can be difficult to detect. To identify errors rapidly and consistently, we have developed automated data validity checks that rely on theoretical limits or relationships for specific measured variables. We present an example of a data validity check that is being developed for the friction velocity u*. The friction velocity is a crucial variable used to identify when low turbulent mixing in the atmospheric boundary layer invalidates eddy covariance measurements of fluxes. It is measured via sonic anemometer and is related to the wind speed WS, the measurement height relative to the canopy height, and the surface roughness, through the log law. Comparing independent measurements of WS and u* can help identify issues related to the sensor but doesn’t take into consideration changes in the canopy (e.g. due to leaf emergence). The u* data check proposed relies on recent work comparing multiple methods for determining the aerodynamic roughness length z0 and zero plane displacement d (Graf, A., A. van de Boer, A. Moene & H. Vereecken, 2014, Boundary-Layer Meteorol., 151, 373-387). These methods, each of which is most robust across a different atmospheric stability range, yield multiple estimates for z0 and d at daily resolution. We use these multiple estimates for z0 and d, as well as half-hourly wind speeds and Obukhov length scales and their uncertainties to generate a predicted u* and a tolerance around this predicted value. In testing, this check correctly identified as invalid u* data known to be erroneous but did not flag data that could look anomalous but instead reflect real changes in the vegetation canopy. This and other validity checks both manual and automated are serving to increase accuracy and inter-comparability of all data within the AmeriFlux and FLUXNET networks preceding the upcoming release of a new global data set of fluxes.",

            "abstract": "A recent field expedition in Central Java targeted the mapping and sampling of several piercements structures in central Java (Indonesia), most of which have never been documented before. Here, at least seven structures erupting mud water and gas are distributed along a NE-SW alignment that extends for about 10 kilometers. Some of the mapped structures (Bledug Kuwu, Bledug Cangkring Krabagan, Mendikil, Banjarsari, Krewek) have been named after the neighboring local village. None of these have obvious elevation despite the vigorous emission of gas and mud, suggesting that significant caldera collapse is ongoing. Among the most relevant:\nBledug Kuwu is certainly the most impressive structure with three main eruption sites in the crater area bursting more than 5 m large hot mud bubbles. Similar characteristics are present at the smaller (200 m in diameter) Bledug Cangkring Krabagan, that is also surrounded by numerous pools and gryphons seeping around the main crater. The smaller sized Mendikil is the only visited structure that, at the moment of the sampling, did not show seepage of hot fluids. Banjarsari and Krewek (up to 200 m wide) are characterized by scattered hot water-dominated pools where gas is vented vigorously. In particular the hot pools are systematically covered by travertine concretions.\nWater and gas geochemisty confirms the seepage of CO2 dominated gas and water with hydrothermal signature.\nThe investigated structures appear to follow an obvious NE-SW oriented lineament that most likely coincides with a tectonic structure (fault?) that controls their location. Indeed the field observations and the analyses suggest that likely scenario is that this fault (?) acts as a preferential pathway for the expulsion of hydrothermal fluids to the surface. Very little is known about this region, neither is known why several of these structures erupt hot mud despite their significant distance from the two closest volcanic structures (i.e. Mt. Muria 60 km to the NW and Mt. Lawu 50 km to the SE).\nThis system of piercement structures represents an ideal analogue for Lusi and other mud volcanoes hosted by the Watukosek fault in North-east Java.",

            "abstract": "Approximately 150 billion cubic meters (BCM) of associated natural gas is flared and vented in the world, annually, emitting greenhouse gases and other pollutants with no energy benefit. Based on estimates from satellite observations, the United States flares about 7 BCM of gas, annually (the 5th highest flaring volume worldwide). The volume of gas flared in the US is growing, largely due to flaring in the Bakken formation in North Dakota.\nBlack carbon (BC), a combustion by-product from gas flaring, is a short-term climate pollutant that absorbs shortwave radiation both in the atmosphere and on snow and ice surfaces. Flaring may be a significant source of global BC climate effects. For example, modeling estimates suggest that associated gas flares are the source of a significant percentage of BC surface concentrations in the Arctic, where BC-induced ice melting occurs. However, there are no direct field measurements of BC emission factors from associated gas flares. Emission measurements of BC that include a range of flaring conditions are needed to ascertain the magnitude of BC emissions from this source.\nOver one hundred flare plumes were sampled in the Bakken formation using a small aircraft. Methane, carbon dioxide, and BC were measured simultaneously, allowing the calculation of BC mass emission factors using the carbon balance method. BC was measured using two methods; optical absorption was measured using a Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP) and BC particle number and mass concentrations were measured with a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2). Simultaneous sampling of BC absorption and mass allows for the calculation of the BC mass absorption cross-section.\nResults indicate that emission factor variability between flares in the region is significant; there are two orders of magnitude variation in the BC emission factors.",

            "abstract": "Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a good indicator of the surface energy balance because it is determined by interactions and energy fluxes between the atmosphere and the ground. The variability of land surface properties and vegetation densities across the Earth’s surface changes these interactions and gives LST a unique biogeographic influence. Natural and human-induced disturbances modify the surface characteristics and alter the expression of LST. This results in a heterogeneous and dynamic thermal environment. Measurements that merge these factors into a single global metric, while maintaining the important biophysical and biogeographical factors of the land surface’s thermal environment are needed to better understand integrated temperature changes in the Earth system.\nUsing satellite-based LST we have developed a new global metric that focuses on one critical component of LST that occurs when the relationship between vegetation density and surface temperature is strongly coupled: annual maximum LST (LSTmax). A 10 year evaluation of LSTmax histograms that include every 1-km pixel across the Earth’s surface reveals that this integrative measurement is strongly influenced by the biogeographic patterns of the Earth’s ecosystems, providing a unique comparative view of the planet every year that can be likened to the Earth’s thermal maximum fingerprint. The biogeographical component is controlled by the frequency and distribution of vegetation types across the Earth’s land surface and displays a trimodal distribution. The three modes are driven by ice covered polar regions, forests, and hot desert/shrubland environments. In ice covered areas the histograms show that the heat of fusion results in a convergence of surface temperatures around the melting point. The histograms also show low interannual variability reflecting two important global land surface dynamics; 1) only a small fraction of the Earth’s surface is disturbed in any given year, and 2) when considered at the global scale, the positive and negative climate forcings resulting from the aggregate effects of the loss of vegetation to disturbances and the regrowth from natural succession are roughly in balance. Changes in any component of the histogram can be tracked and would indicate a major change in the Earth system.",

We have developed a new high-resolution chronostratigaphic framework for correlating and dating these sites over the last 400,000 years using a combination of absolute oxygen isotope, relative paleointensity, and directional paleomagnetic secular variation age dating. We can define synchronous environmental variability across these four sites with a resolution of ~±200 years over the entire 400,000 year time span. We see 3-5,000 year cycles of high/low terrigenous flux, derived from the continental margin and shelf, during all the interglacials, which are synchronous among the sites. Each interglacial has 9-12 of these cycles. We think these are caused by millennial-scale oscillations in Alaskan continental climate during interglacials. We also note evidence for millennial-scale relatively-warm/seasonally-ice-free conditions within selected intervals of all glacials and millennial-scale intervals of apparently cold/permanent ice conditions during all the interglacials. Although glacials are dominated by cold/permanent ice conditions and interglacials by warm/seasonally ice free conditions, it seems that almost as much time is spent in the opposite pattern as in the normal pattern.",

            "abstract": "Rural lands increasingly are receiving attention for the ecosystem services they provide to growing populations. Among the most important of these is water yield and storage in rangelands. Yet rangelands are dynamic, with large land use/land cover changes over time. Uncertainty remains about the effects of these changes on rangeland function and how they affect potential benefits to populations that depend on them. We investigated rangelands in central Texas, USA to quantify changes in land cover and land use and resulting trends in sediment yield over time. Examining eight watersheds totaling 230 km2, we classified land cover using aerial photos from the late 1930s to 2012, focusing on woody plant cover. In addition, we digitized cultivated areas over time. Finally, we collected sediment cores from reservoirs at the base of each watershed and created a chronosequence of sedimentation trends using cesium-137 and lead-210 tracers. Cropland exhibited major reductions nearing 80% in all areas. Woody plant cover trends varied geographically, from steady decreases to decline followed by rebound to consistent increases in shrub extent. Cesium-137 profiles indicated sedimentation rates generally have decreased by more than 50% since 1963. Since then, rates in all areas have been quite stable. Cesium-137 and lead-210 rate estimates were similar (p = 0.69). At its peak, sedimentation in the smaller, semi-urban watershed occurred 1400% faster per unit area than in rural watersheds. Results indicate changing shrub cover is not a primary driver of sediment dynamics in these watersheds. Rather, it is likely that a combination of severe drought and land use history is responsible for periods of high sediment yield and reservoir storage loss",

A comparison between A(686mm rainfall during 22days) and B(661mm/4days) knew that soil infiltration of A is 17.08% and B is 5.48% of the rainfall. Reduction of runoff after introduction of the GI of A is 24.76% and B is 6.56%. These results mean that GI is effective to small rainfall intensity, and artificial rainwater retarding reservoir is needed at extreme rainfall.\nSecond, set of target year is conducted for the recovery of hydrological cycle at the predevelopment. And an amount of infiltration, evaporation, surface runoff of the target year and now is analysed on the basis of land coverage, and an arrangement of LID facilities.\nThird, rainwater management scenarios are established and simulated by the SWMM-LID. Rainwater management facilities include GI(green roof, porous pavement, vegetative swale, ecological pond, and raingarden), and artificial rainwater. Design scenarios are categorized five type: 1)no GI, 2)conventional GI design(current design), 3)intensive GI design, 4)GI design+rainwater retarding reservoir 5)maximized rainwater retarding reservoir. Intensive GI design is to have attribute value to obtain the maximum efficiency for each GI facility with in-depth experts interviews. Climate change scenario is also used to set the capacity of the rainwater management facilities considering the extreme precipitation. These all scenarios are not only simulated for calculating the hydrological balance but analysed the cost for each scenarios effect.",

            "abstract": "Global and regional changes in climate have important implications for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Recent studies, for example, have revealed significant warming of inland water bodies throughout the world. To better understand the global patterns, physical mechanisms, and ecological implications of lake warming, an initiative known as the \"Global Lake Temperature Collaboration\" (GLTC) was started in 2010, with the objective of compiling and analyzing lake temperature data from numerous satellite and in situ records dating back at least 20-30 years. The GLTC project has now assembled data from over 300 lakes, with some in situ records extending back more than 100 years. Here, we present an analysis of the long-term warming trends, interdecadal variability, and a direct comparison between in situ and remotely sensed lake surface temperature for the 3-month summer period July-September (January-March for some lakes). The overall results show consistent, long-term trends of increasing summer-mean lake surface temperature across most but not all sites. Lakes with especially long records show accelerated warming in the most recent two to three decades, with almost half of the lakes warming at rates in excess of 0.5 °C per decade during the period 1985-2009, and a few even exceeding 1.0 °C per decade. Both satellite and in situ data show a similar distribution of warming trends, and a direct comparison at lake sites that have both types of data reveals a close correspondence in mean summer water temperature, interannual variability, and long-term trends. Finally, we examine standardized lake surface temperature anomalies across the full 100-year period (1910-2009), and in conjunction with similar timeseries of air temperature. The results reveal a close correspondence between summer air temperature and lake surface temperature on interannual and interdecadal timescales, but with many lakes warming more rapidly than the ambient air temperature over 25- to 100-year periods.",

            "abstract": "With the recent addition of realistic fault topography in 3D simulations of earthquake source models, ground motion can be deterministically generated more accurately up to higher frequencies. However, the earthquake source is not the only source of complexity in the high-frequency ground motion; there are also scattering effects caused by small-scale velocity and density heterogeneities in the medium that can affect the ground motion intensity. Here, we model dynamic rupture propagation for the 1994 Mw 6.7 Northridge earthquake up to 8 Hz using a support operator method (SORD). We extend the ground motion to further distances by converting the output to a kinematic source for the finite difference anelastic wave propagation code AWP-ODC, which incorporates frequency-dependent attenuation via a power law above a reference frequency in the form Q0fn.\nWe model the region surrounding the fault with and without small-scale medium complexity, with varying statistical parameters. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of varying both the power-law exponent of the attenuation relation (n) and the reference Q (Q0) (assumed to be proportional to the S-wave velocity), and compare our synthetic ground motions with several Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs) as well as observed accelerograms. We find that the spectral acceleration at various periods from our models are within 1 interevent standard deviation from the median GMPEs and compare well with that of recordings from strong ground motion stations at both short and long periods. At periods below 1 second, Q(f) is needed to match the decay of spectral acceleration seen in the GMPEs as a function of distance from the fault (n~0.6-0.8).We find when binning stations with a common distance metric (such as Joyner-Boore or rrup) that the effect of media heterogeneity is canceled out, however, the similarity between the intra-event variability of our simulations and observations increases when small-scale heterogeneity is included.",

            "abstract": "Summertime low cloud intrusion into the terrestrial west coast of North America impacts human, ecological, and logistical systems. Over a broad region of the West Coast, summer (May – September) coastal low cloudiness (CLC) varies coherently on interannual to interdecadal timescales and has been found to be organized by North Pacific sea surface temperature. Broad-scale studies of low stratiform cloudiness over ocean basins also find that the season of maximum low stratus corresponds to the season of maximum lower tropospheric stability (LTS) or estimated inversion strength. We utilize a 18-summer record of CLC derived from NASA/NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) at 4km resolution over California (CA) to make a more nuanced spatial and temporal examination of intra-summer variability in CLC and its drivers. We find that uniform spatial coherency over CA is not apparent for intra-summer variability in CLC. On monthly to daily timescales, at least two distinct subregions of coastal California (CA) can be identified, where relationships between meteorology and stratus variability appear to change throughout summer in each subregion. While north of Point Conception and offshore the timing of maximum CLC is closely coincident with maximum LTS, in the Southern CA Bight and northern Baja region, maximum CLC occurs up to about a month before maximum LTS. It appears that summertime CLC in this southern region is not as strongly related as in the northern region to LTS. In particular, although the relationship is strong in May and June, starting in July the daily relationship between LTS and CLC in the south begins to deteriorate. Preliminary results indicate a moderate association between decreased CLC in the south and increased precipitable water content above 850 hPa on daily time scales beginning in July. Relationships between daily CLC variability and meteorological variables including winds, inland temperatures, relative humidity, and geopotential heights within and above the marine boundary layer are investigated and dissected by month, CA subregion, and cloud height. The rich spatial detail of the satellite derived CLC record is utilized to examine the propagation in time and space of CLC on synoptic scales within and among subregions.",

            "abstract": "Since 1998, the rate of global warming has slowed but the degree to which this slowdown has affected alpine glaciers in North America remains uncertain. Here we describe glacier fluctuations in the continental mountain ranges of British Columbia, Alberta, Yukon and the Northwest Territories for the period 1985-2013. Our manual digitization of over 3,000 glaciers mapped from 12 Landsat scenes builds upon a glacier inventory for the period 1985-2005 that utilized aerial photography and satellite imagery (Landsat) for the mountain ranges of British Columbia and Alberta. Landsat imagery allowed us to extend the spatial distribution of this inventory to include most alpine glaciers that straddle the Yukon and Northwest Territory border (Nahanni region) for the years 1985 and 2004. We also digitized glaciers from pan-sharpened Landsat 8 imagery for the year 2013. Glacier recession rates differ among regions between the early [1985-2005] and recent [2005-2013] periods. Recession rates during the recent period, for example, slowed by 43% and 15% for the Nahanni and Columbia Basin regions respectively. When compared to the early period, recent recession rates accelerated by 17% and 121% for glaciers in the Southern and Northern Rocky Mountains. Some of this regional variability is attributed to climate anomalies in the study area based on our analysis of instrumental (CRU 3.21) and reanalysis (ERA Interim) data, but the doubling of the recessional rate for the Northern Rocky Mountains is anomalous. Non-climatic factors that could explain this anomalous rapid retreat of Northern Rocky Mountain glaciers includes low minimum elevation of these glaciers, debris cover and shadowed terrain in the Landsat imagery.",

            "abstract": "Sinabung is a 2460 m high andesitic volcano located in northern Sumatra, Indonesia. Sinabung had no confirmed historical activity until a small (VEI 2) explosive eruption in August-September 2010. In September 2013, explosions began again and were accompanied by lava dome growth and subsequent dome-collapse generated pyroclastic flows (Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network 35:07; 39:01). The Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (Indonesia) estimated dome growth at 3.5 m3/s in late December 2013. From January to March 2014 lava extrusion continued and formed a lobe down Sinabung’s south flank. As of this writing, effusion and growth of the lava lobe continues, but at a much slower rate. Pyroclastic flows generated by collapse of the steep sides of the lobe remain a hazard. We use thermal infrared (TIR) images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiomter (MODIS) to observe volcanic activity at Sinabung during the 2013-2014 eruption and estimate effusion rates following the methods of Harris & Ripepe (2007, Geophys. Res. Let. 34). We also use new analysis of those thermal images to characterize style of activity, distinguishing pyroclastic flow activity from pure lava lobe growth. Preliminary results from satellite images show an average effusion rate of 1.1 m3/s during January-March 2014, with peak effusion rates from individual TIR images of 4-7 m3/s in mid-January. These numbers are in good agreement with the ground-based estimates, and they provide improved temporal resolution of the activity as it evolved. Since March, effusion rates have decreased to below 0.01 m3/s on average. Using the MODIS images, we estimate the maximum possible total erupted volume to be 7 million m3, and have constrained the accuracy of this estimate using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry from ground-based visual images of the lava lobe. Following explosions in 2010 and 2013 and high effusion rates from January to March 2014, the ongoing slow effusion suggests a steady-state, open vent system has been established.",

            "abstract": "Marine isotope stage (MIS) 5e of the last interglacial (LIG) is of great interest because it serves as an analog for the Holocene. Changes in sea-level are, in part, indicative of the global-scale changes in climate. Unlike the stable Holocene, significant drops and/or rises, up to nine meters, have been reported during MIS-5e, suggesting that MIS-5e climate may not have been as stable as the Holocene. Phreatic overgrowths on speleothems (POS) from coastal caves of Mallorca Island (Spain) are deposited less than 40 cm below the brackish water/air interface (water table) at elevations equivalent to sea-level. Thus, stable sea-level stands result in POS that have grown large enough to be used as accurate sea-level markers. Like reefs, the POS are also discontinuous in their coverage of sea-level through time, but the method potentially locates both the position and the age of a particular past sea-level stand with very high accuracy and precision. Uranium-series dating of 18 POS samples from ten Mallorcan caves indicates that for 11,000 years (between 127.4 +/- 0.5 and 116.3 +/- 1.3 ka) the sea-level was remarkably stable at 2.25 +/- 0.75 m above the present sea-level. Given there were any deviations from this Mallorcan MIS-5e sea-level, they were likely too rapid to form POS. Also indicated by our record is a fast 5 mm/year decline in sea-level from MIS-5e to -5d, and from MIS-5b to -5a sea-level rose at 18 mm/year, peaked for 1000 years, then fell rapidly at 5-10 mm/year at the onset of MIS 4. In all, these changes roughly follow Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Further uranium-series dating of highstands preceding MIS-5 are ongoing to document the tectonic stability of the Mallorcan sea-level site.",

            "abstract": "Carbon is subducted into the mantle primarily in the form of metasomatically calcium-enriched basaltic rock, calcified serpentinites and carbonaceous ooze. The fate of these carbonates in subduction zones is not well understood. End-member CaMg(CO3)2 dolomite typically breaks down into two carbonates at 2-7 GPa, which may further decompose to oxides and CO2-bearing fluid. However, high-pressure X-ray diffraction experiments have recently shown that the presence of iron may be sufficient to stabilize dolomite I to high pressures, allowing the transformation to dolomite II at 17 GPa and subsequently to dolomite III at 35 GPa [1][2]. Such phases may be a principal host for deeply subducted carbon. The structure and equation of state of these high-pressure phases is debated and the effect of varying concentrations of iron is unknown, creating a need for theoretical calculations. Here we compare calculated dolomite structures to experimentally observed phases. Using the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) interfaced with a genetic algorithm that predicts crystal structures (USPEX), a monoclinic phase with space group 5 (\"dolomite sg5\") was found for pure end-member dolomite. Dolomite sg5 has a lower energy than reported dolomite structures and an equation of state that resembles that of dolomite III. It is possible that dolomite sg5 is not achieved experimentally due to a large energy barrier and a correspondingly large required volume drop, resulting in the transformation to metastable dolomite II. Due to the complex energy landscape for candidate high-pressure dolomite structures, it is likely that several competing polymorphs exist. Determining the behavior of high-pressure Ca-Mg-Fe(-Mn) dolomite phases in subduction environments is critical for our understanding of the Earth’s deep carbon cycle and supercell calculations with Fe substitution are in progress.

            "abstract": "Forest restoration projects are being planned for large areas of overgrown semi-arid ponderosa pine forests of the Southwestern US. Restoration involves the thinning of smaller trees and prescribed or managed fire to reduce tree density, restore a more natural fire regime, and decrease the risk of catastrophic wildfire. The stated goals of these projects generally reduced plant water stress and improvements in hydrologic function. However, little is known about how to design restoration treatments to best meet these goals. As part of a larger project on snow cover, soil moisture, and groundwater recharge, we measured soil moisture, an indicator of plant water status, in four pairs of control and restored sites near Flagstaff, Arizona. The restoration strategies used at the sites range in both amount of open space created and degree of clustering of the remaining trees. We measured soil moisture using 30 cm vertical time domain reflectometry probes installed on 100 m transects at 5 m intervals so it would be possible to analyze the spatial pattern of soil moisture. Soil moisture was higher and more spatially variable in the restored sites than the control sites with differences in spatial pattern among the restoration types. Soil moisture monitoring will continue until the first snow fall, at which point measurements of snow depth and snow water equivalent will be made at the same locations.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge and understanding of precursory events and thermal signatures are vital for monitoring volcanogenic processes, as activity can often range from low level lava effusion to large explosive eruptions, easily capable of ejecting ash up to aircraft cruise altitudes. Using ground based remote sensing techniques to monitor and detect this activity is essential, but often the required equipment and maintenance is expensive. Our investigation explores the use of low-light cameras to image volcanic activity in the visible to near infrared (NIR) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. These cameras are ideal for monitoring as they are cheap, consume little power, are easily replaced and can provide near real-time data. We focus here on the early detection of volcanic activity, using automated scripts, that capture streaming online webcam imagery and evaluate image pixel brightness values to determine relative changes and flag increases in activity. The script is written in Python, an open source programming language, to reduce the overall cost to potential consumers and increase the application of these tools across the volcanological community. In addition, by performing laboratory tests to determine the spectral response of these cameras, a direct comparison of collocated low-light and thermal infrared cameras has allowed approximate eruption temperatures and effusion rates to be determined from pixel brightness. The results of a field campaign in June, 2013 to Stromboli volcano, Italy, are also presented here. Future field campaigns to Latin America will include collaborations with INSIVUMEH in Guatemala, to apply our techniques to Fuego and Santiaguito volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "During and following eruption, mafic magmas can readily drain downward in conduits, dykes and lakes producing complex and coincident up-flow and down-flow textures. This process can occur at the top of the plumbing system if the magma outgases as slugs or through porous foam, causing the uppermost magma surface to descend and the magma to densify. In this scenario the draining volume is limited by the gas volume outgassed. Additionally, magma can undergo wholesale backflow when the pressure at the base of the conduit or feeder dyke exceeds the driving pressure in the chamber beneath. This second scenario will continue until pressure equilibrium is established. These two scenarios may occur coincidently as local draining of uppermost conduit magma by outgassing can lead to wholesale backflow because the densification of magma is an effective way to modify the vertical pressure profile in a conduit. In the rare case where conduits are preserved in cross section, the textural record of draining is often complex and great care should be taken in interpreting bimodal kinematic trends in detail. Lateral cooling into country rock leads to lateral profiles of physical and flow properties and, ultimately, outgassing potential, and exploration of such profiles elucidates the complexity involved. We present evidence from Red Crater volcano, New Zealand, and La Palma, Canary Islands, where we show that at least one draining phase followed initial ascent and eruption. We provide a rheological model approach to understand gravitational draining velocities and therefore, the timescales of up- and down-flow cycles predicted. These timescales can be compared with observed geophysical signals at monitored mafic volcanoes worldwide. Finally, we discuss the implications of shallow magma draining for edifice stability, eruption longevity and magma-groundwater interaction.",

            "abstract": "Geochemical fingerprinting of glass shards and minerals have clearly demonstrated that ash from the 74 ka Toba eruption was distributed over a vast area including parts of the Indian Ocean, South China Sea, Indian sub-continent, and eastern Africa. The great dispersal has been attributed to eruption column height, co-ignimbrite ash, shard morphology, and volume of the Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT) eruption. New evidence suggests that another contributing factor may have been a phreatomagmatic component of the eruption whereby portions of the YTT interacted with a paleolake Toba during the eruption. This evidence consists of an accretionary lapilli ash fall bed at the base of the YTT, friable lake sediment lithic fragments found within the proximal YTT ignimbrite, and organic remains in distal ash exposures. Notably, diatom frustules and sponge spicules similar to those that occur in post-YTT lacustrine sediments at Toba have now been identified in the proximal YTT ash fall bed and ignimbrite, as well as distal ash exposures in Malaysia and India. Our findings support the observations of J.B.Scrivenor (1930, 1943) who first described such microfossil occurrences in the Toba ash from sites in Malaysia, and speculated that they may have originated from Toba. Species characterization is currently underway to determine if the microflora/faunal assemblages of the Malaysian and Indian ashes are consistent with a Toba source. The preliminary results of our study lends further credence to Van Eaton et al.’s (2013) suggestion that microbiological cargo carried by phreatomagmatic tephra can provide a new tool in deciphering volcanological, paleoenvironmental, and biologic dispersal models.",

Isochemical phase diagrams (pseudosections), assuming H2O saturation, predict that more hydrous mineral assemblages change to less hydrous mineral assemblages with increasing P and T along the prograde path, as well as during decompression along the retrograde path. Pseudosections were calculated for two samples from the Dulan area, D5A and D126A. Sample D5A (garnet + omphacite, with minor amphibole + epidote) contains 1.3-2.5 mm garnet porphyroblasts. D5A garnets display strong compositional zoning with increasing Ca from core (Alm49 Prp23 Grs28) to rim (Alm43 Prp24 Grs33). D5A garnet porphyroblasts contain rectangular polycrystalline epidote inclusions, interpreted as lawsonite pseudomorphs that provide evidence for fluid release. Sample D126A (garnet + omphacite + zoisite, with minor quartz + phengite) contains 500-600 µm garnet porphyroblasts, and 2-4 mm zoisite crystals. D126A garnets display strong compositional zoning with decreasing Ca from core (Alm43 Prp25 Grs32) to rim (Alm45 Prp28 Grs27). D126A garnet porphyroblasts contain potential coesite pseudomorphs, seen as a euhedral, tabular quartz inclusion between the core and rim zone.\nThermodynamic models of sample D126A calculate a stable garnet core compositional isopleth intersection in the coesite field at ~660 °C and ~28 kbar. The stable mineral assemblage predicted for these conditions is omphacite + amphibole + phengite + garnet + lawsonite + coesite. The stable rim compositional isopleth is also in the coesite field at ~660 °C and ~31 kbar, within the same mineral assemblage as the core. The predicted peak whole rock H2O wt.% of 0.9-1.3 wt.% is higher than the 0.4 wt.% H2O calculated from sample D126A’s present mineral assemblage, stable at >630 °C and <26 kbar. The difference in H2O wt.% indicates that between 0.5 and 0.9 wt.% H2O would be released during decompression from peak conditions. Lawsonite breakdown produced the coarse grained zoisite, seen in sample D126A, and polycrystalline epidote, seen in sample D5A.",

            "abstract": "Arctic peatlands and thermokarst lakes (TK) are thought to play a significant role in changing atmospheric methane concentration (AMC) during the last deglacial. However, there is debate concerning timing of their initiation and extent they drove variations in AMC. Models show sea ice cover (SIC) and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) can also play a significant role. Yet, changes in peatland/TK lake areal extent in response to those dynamics as continental shelves were submerged are often not considered. To examine such connections, we report on molecular proxies in marine records that reveal change in terrestrial organic matter (TOM) export, SIC, and SSTs as sea levels rose during the last 18 ka in the Pacific-Arctic Gateway. Here, TOM input to the ocean was tracked by measuring the flux of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers, n-alkyl lipids, and pentacyclic triterpenoids. SIC and SSTs were reconstructed using modern calibrations of highly branched isoprenoid alkene abundances in surface sediments from the Bering and Chukchi Seas. SSTs were also reconstructed based on the relative abundance of isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers. Our sediment records reveal increased flux of TOM coincides with peatland/TK lake initiation, reduced SIC (~20%), and warmer SSTs (~4°C) as AMC increased during the Bølling-Allerød (BA). Terrestrial flux dramatically reduced as SIC increased (~50%) and SSTs cooled as AMC fell during the Younger Dryas. Most notably, TOM export rapidly rebounds as AMC abruptly rose throughout the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM), when SSTs warmed by ~3°C and SIC diminished and peatland areal extent increased. Using multi-proxy evidence in combination with a simple model that accounts for submergence of peatland/TK lake area, we estimate that the exposed Beringian shelf emitted an amount of CH4 comparable to previously reported peatland emissions in Alaska during the BA and HTM. The GDGT-based methane index (MI) was <0.3 throughout our sediment records, suggesting destabilized marine gas hydrates were not the principal source of methane. Results of our study provide novel marine-based evidence for the timing of peatland and TK lake initiation and the role sea ice played in contributing to variations in AMC during deglacial sea level rise in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models parameterize boundary layer turbulence with planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes, which assume a coarse [O(10 km)] grid resolution. Newer NWP models also have the ability to be large-eddy simulation (LES) models, which use a grid resolution that is sufficiently fine to resolve energy-containing eddies. The range in resolution-space between the maximum appropriate resolution for an LES closure and the minimum appropriate resolution for a PBL scheme is the turbulent gray zone, or the terra incognita. PBL schemes are designed for grid spacings that are much larger than the energy-containing eddies, typically considered to be of the same scale as the PBL depth [O(1 km)], to be contained in the sub-grid scale (SGS). LES closures are designed for a resolution that explicitly resolves the most energetic eddies, leaving the SGS turbulence approximately isotropic. The resolution limit for LES remains largely unexamined for atmospheric flows despite its dynamical significance and the increasing use of atmospheric LES models.\nHere we examine the grid-dependence of the Weather Research and Forecasting model in LES mode (WRF-LES). We attempt to identify the symptoms of approaching the turbulent gray zone with WRF-LES under primarily convective conditions using the Wangara Day 33 case. Grid-dependence is evaluated by considering the development of the stability profile, the onset of resolved convection, higher-order statistical profiles, and turbulence spectra. Also considered are the effects of isotropic mixing length-scales, domain extent and spatially heterogeneous surface fluxes. We find that resolved convection is often too coarse to be physically realistic when the resolution falls within the gray zone.",

            "abstract": "An application of the 3D elastic full-waveform inversion (FWI) to wide-aperture seismic data obtained for a complex geological setting is presented. Imaging is implemented in the Fourier domain, exploiting damped wave fields. The modeling part is solved with a finite-difference method. The non-linear conjugate gradient method is used for the inverse problem solution. The nonlinearity of FWI leads to the presence of local and multiple minima in the least-squares error functional especially for large offset problems. That leads to the shutdown of the inverse problem convergence and uncertainty in the solution. An accurate starting velocity model can avoid this problem, but in many cases may not be available. Hence other strategies are necessary to address the problem.\nWe propose a robust inversion process for an arbitrary starting velocity model, which allows avoiding local minima and obtaining acceptable images of the deep seated structures defined by large offset data. We proceed from the assumption that decreasing data offset reduces local minima problems but decreases the depth of the recovered image. So, the inversion process is realized sequentially from small to large offsets, allowing recovery of geological structures over the entire depth range of interest from the near surface to deeper depths sensed only by large aperture offsets. Increasing of data offset is first performed at the lowest frequency and then proceeding with treatment of all data offsets from low to high frequencies. A reverse loop is also implemented in the laddering of frequencies, where after the inversion at high frequencies and all offsets we return to the lower frequencies data to continue the IP. Returning to lower frequency data provides helping to ameliorate multiple minima encountered in the inversion. The inversion then concludes by sweeping over higher frequency data, at all offsets.\nWe demonstrate our strategies for treating wide aperture offset data on the Marmousi model, using a linearly increasing starting velocity model with depth. Our results suggest that FWI exploiting variable data offsets, up to 10 km, can be applied successfully to frequencies up to 6 Hz, and it is possible to develop accurate 3D velocity images down to depths of 3.5 km at the resolution that approaches half the smallest wavelength utilized in FWI.",

We find that while HYCOM assimilates Argo data, the model still suffers from significant temperature and salinity biases in this region. These biases are most severe in the northern Bay of Bengal, where the model tends to be too saline near the surface and too fresh at depth. The maximum magnitude of these biases is approximately 0.6 PSS. We also find that the model's salinity biases have a distinct seasonal cycle. The most problematic periods are the months following the summer monsoon (Oct-Jan). HYCOM's near surface temperature estimates compare more favorably with Argo, but significant errors exist at deeper levels. We argue that optimal interpolation will tend to induce positive salinity biases in the northern regions of the Bay. Further, we speculate that these biases are introduced when the model relaxes to climatology and assimilates real-time data.",

            "abstract": "Although it is well known that the Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio of seawater has varied throughout the Phanerozoic, there is little information on whether the concentration of Ca2+ has changed in conjunction with Mg2+ or whether these two elements have changed independently. In addition while it has been documented that the Mg/Ca has varied within scleractinian corals during certain time periods, there have been no studies which have verified that changing Mg/Ca ratio in corals corresponds with a similar variation in seawater. Here we report studies using Modern corals which have been grown for an extended period of time (10 weeks) in elevated Ca2+and Mg2+ concentrations. While these studies show that the Mg2+/Ca2+ of the seawater is related to the same ratio in the coral skeleton, the slope of the relationship is dependent upon which of the two cations is altered. When the Ca2+ is increased, thereby decreasing the Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio in seawater, then the ratio within the skeleton decreases by ~0.7 mM/M for every 1 M/M decrease in the Mg2+ / Ca2+ ratio in the external seawater. However, when the Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio is altered by adding Mg2+, then there is an increase is ~2 mM/M for every 1 M/M increase in Mg2+/Ca2+. Assuming that such changes can be replicated by the reverse experiment, i.e. reducing the concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+, then such a finding offers a solution to resolving whether the Mg/Ca ratio in ancient unaltered corals is responding to a change in Mg2+ or a change in Ca2+ in seawater. For example, the Mg/Ca ratios of unaltered corals from a defined time period might only be possible if the Ca2+ of seawater was altered rather than Mg2+. The reverse might be case for other time periods. Further supporting evidence for this hypothesis will be presented by other elements which exhibited unexpected behavior in response to changing Ca2+ and Mg2+.",

            "abstract": "The Berkeley Instrumental Neutron Generator (BINGE) facility is the product of a consortium involving the Berkeley Geochronology Center (BGC), the U.C. Berkeley Nuclear Engineering Dept. (UCB/NE), and Lawrence Berkeley (LBNL) and Lawrence Livermore (LLNL) National Labs. BINGE was initially designed (and funded by NSF) for 40Ar/39Ar geochronology. BINGE uses a plasma-based deuteron ion source and a self-loading Ti-surfaced target to induce deuteron-deuterium (DD) fusion via the reaction 2H(d,n)3He, producing 2.45 MeV neutrons. The limited neutron energy spectrum is aimed at reducing recoil effects, interfering nuclear reactions, and unwanted radioactive byproducts, all of which are undesirable consequences of conventional irradiation with 235U fission spectrum neutrons. Minimization of interfering reactions such as 40Ca(n,na)36Ar greatly reduces penalties for over-irradiation, enabling improved signal/background measurement of e.g. 39Ar. BINGE will also be used for a variety of nuclear physics and engineering experiments that require a high flux of monoenergetic neutrons. Neutron energies lower than 2.45 MeV can be obtained via irradiation ports within and external to polyethylene shielding. Initial commissioning produced a neutron flux of 108 n/sec/cm2 at 1 mA source current and 100 kV anode voltage, as expected. When scaled up to the 1 A source current as planned, this indicates that BINGE will achieve the design objective neutron flux of 1011 n/sec/cm2. Further progress towards this goal will be reported.

            "abstract": "Groundwater in irrigated regions is impacted by timing and rates of deep drainage. Because field monitoring of deep drainage is often cost prohibitive, numerical soil water models are frequently the main method of estimation. Unfortunately, few studies have quantified the relative importance of likely error sources. In this study, three potential error sources are considered within a Monte Carlo framework: water retention parameters, rooting depth, and irrigation practice. Error distributions for water retention parameters were determined by 1) laboratory hydraulic measurements and 2) pedotransfer functions. Error distributions for rooting depth were developed from literature values. Three irrigation scheduling regimes were considered: one representing pre-scheduled irrigation ignoring preceding rainfall, one representing pre-scheduled irrigation that was altered based on preceding rainfall, and one representing algorithmic irrigation scheduling informed by profile matric potential sensors. This approach was applied to an experimental site in Nebraska with silt loam soils and irrigated corn for 2002-2012. Results are based on Six Monte-Carlo simulations, each consisting of 1000 Hydrus 1D simulations at daily timesteps, facilitated by parallelization on a 12-node computing cluster.\nResults indicate greater sensitivity to irrigation regime than to hydraulic or vegetation parameters (median values for prescheduled irrigation, prescheduled irrigation altered by rainfall, and algorithmic irrigation were 310 ,100, and 110 mm/yr, respectively). Error ranges were up to 700% higher for pedotransfer functions than for laboratory-measured hydraulic functions. Deep drainage was negatively correlated with alpha and maximum root zone depth and, for some scenarios, positively correlated with n. The relative importance of error sources differed amongst the irrigation scenarios because of nonlinearities amongst parameter values, profile wetness, and deep drainage. Compared to pre-scheduled irrigation, the algorithmic irrigation resulted in a drier profile, higher sensitivity to rooting depth, and lower sensitivity to hydraulic parameters. Results highlight that knowledge of irrigation rates and timing are at least as important as biophysical measurements for constraining recharge.",

            "abstract": "Lake Tahoe, located at 6,225 ft. (1,897 m) in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, is the largest alpine lake in North America. Known for the clarity of its water and the panorama of surrounding mountains on all sides, Lake Tahoe is a prime tourist attraction in the California – Nevada area. However, the Lake Tahoe Basin is facing significant environmental pollution problems, including declining water clarity and air quality issues. During the period of July 21 - 26, 2012, we conducted a field study in the Basin designed to characterize the precursors and pathways of secondary pollutant formation, including ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Four sites were selected; two were located at high elevations (one each on the western and eastern sides of the Basin) and two were positioned near the Lake level. Ozone and NO/NO2 concentrations were continuously measured. With a resolution of several hours over a 6-day sampling period canister samples were collected for detailed speciation of volatile organic compounds (VOC), 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) impregnated Sep-Pak cartridges for analysis of carbonyl compounds, PM2.5 Teflon and quartz filter samples for determination of mass, organic and elemental carbon (OC/EC) concentrations and speciation of organic compounds. Whereas the concentrations of lower molecular weight (mw) C2 – C3 hydrocarbons were generally the highest at all sampling sites, ranging from 25 to 76% of the total measured VOC (over 70 species from C2 to C10), the concentrations of biogenic hydrocarbons, isoprene and α-pinene were significant, ranging from 1.4 to 26% and 1.5 to 30%, respectively, of the total VOC. For comparison, the sum of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) constituted from 2.5 to 37% of the total VOC. All four sites showed maximum ozone concentrations in the range of 60 ppb. However, the lower sites show a pronounced diurnal pattern (i.e. maximum concentrations during the daytime hours, 0900 to 1700, with minimum values at night and in the early morning hours), whereas the upper sites shows much less variability over the 24-hour diurnal period. NO/NO2 concentrations were generally low, in the range of a few ppb. This presentation will discuss VOC and NOx patterns at these four sites in terms of their relevance to local ozone formation and/or regional transport.",

            "abstract": "Environmental changes after the terminal Cryogenian snowball Earth event have been debated extensively in the literature. But there have been relatively few studies on the biotic response in the aftermath of this snowball Earth event. In fact, a variety of potential microbial facies are preserved in basal Ediacaran cap dolostones as peloids, clotted fabrics, and morphologically diverse microbialites (e. g., tube-like stromatolites and stratiform biolaminites). In South China, centimeter-sized domal and conical stromatolites consisting of wavy or wrinkled microbial mats occur at the top of the Doushantuo cap dolostone. Sedimentological investigation of these stromatolites on outcrop and in core samples from the Yangtze Gorges area suggests that they are likely biological in origin. These stromatolites are characterized by vertical accumulation of dark and light laminae. The dark laminae are sub-millimetric in thickness and are composed of probably biogenic kerogen as determined by Raman spectroscopy. The dark laminae is also rich in pyrite, likely derived from organic degradation by sulfate reduction bacteria. Microsparry calcite occur as cements between the dark laminae. Within the Doushantuo stromatolites, there are patches of randomly oriented calcite needles. The precipitation of these calcite needles may have also been facilitated by microbial processes such bacterial sulfate reduction.\nOur study shows that shallow marine environment became habitable soon after the snowball Earth glaciation ended and benthic microbes were among some of the first organisms to colonize these environments.",

            "abstract": "Preisach theory is a phenomenological model of hysteresis that is the basis for FORC analysis in rock magnetism. In FORC analysis, a system is characterized using first-order reversal curves (FORCs), each of which is a magnetization curve after a reversal in the direction of change of the magnetic field. Preisach theory uses the same curves to predict the magnetic response to changes in the magnetic field. In rock magnetism, the Preisach model has been adapted to predict general properties of thermoremanent magnetization (TRM), and even to inferpaleointensity from room-temperature FORCs.\nPreisach theory represents hysteresis by a collection of hysteresis units called hysterons; the distribution of hysterons is inferred from FORC measurements. Each hysteron represents a two-state system. This is similar to a single-domain (SD) magnet, but the first-order theory cannot represent the magnetism of a simple system of randomly oriented SD magnets. Such a system can be represented by a second-order Preisach theory, which requires the measurement of magnetization curves after two reversals of the direction of change. One can generalize this process to higher order reversal curves, although each increase in the number of reversals greatly increases the number of measurements that are needed.\nThe magnetic hysteresis of systems of interacting SD magnets is calculated using numerical homotopy, a method that can find all the solutions of the equilibrium equations for such a system. The hysteresis frequently has features that cannot be represented by any order of Preisach theory. Furthermore, there are stable magnetic states that are not reachable during isothermal hysteresis unless thermal fluctuations are large enough. Such states would not be visible at room temperature but would contribute to TRM.",

These very short duration parallel electric field spikes contribute to accelerate electrons along magnetic field lines, which raises the question of their roles regarding electron precipitation into the atmosphere. Currently, the interaction with lower-band chorus waves at the magnetic equator is the most favored candidate for explaining energetic electron precipitation and the resulting auroral emissions. In an attempt to discern the requirements for electron precipitation, we use conjugate, high-time resolution, time domain recordings from Van Allen Probes and the Canadian array of all-sky imagers. We report on the correlation of auroral light emissions and time-domain structures alone, whistlers alone, and time-domain structures and whistlers together.",

Such worst case scenarios warrant special scrutiny, and there has been much discussion of the methods, and even the feasibility, of reducing our uncertainty of their likelihood. We present a brief review of high sensitivity outcomes and what gives them such high values, highlighting which mechanisms suggest reasonable future pathways for the Earth. In particular, we highlight the role of low cloud feedbacks. We illustrate that the assumption of linearity often used in analysis of climate feedbacks becomes increasingly likely to break down for high sensitivity Earths, and show in a simple thought experiment how the true climate sensitivity can become decorrelated from the one predicted by linear feedbacks as these feedbacks become strongly positive, a condition necessary for high sensitivity. Knowledge of the nonlinearity of these feedbacks is essential to reducing uncertainty of the highest warming scenarios, with implications for the design of the methodologies used to study them.",

            "abstract": "Impacts on the lunar surface from meteoroid streams encountered by the Earth-Moon system can result in measurable enhancements in both the lunar atmosphere and dust environment. Here we describe the annual meteoroid streams incident at the Moon during the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission, and discuss their effects on the lunar environment. The LADEE science payload consisted of three instruments: the Ultraviolet/Visible Spectrometer (UVS); the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX); and the Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS). All three instruments detected the effects of encounters with meteoroid streams. During its time in lunar orbit, the LADEE mission coincided with 18 out of 35 IAU established annual streams. As stream meteoroids move on near-parallel trajectories we expect to observe asymmetries in their effects on the lunar environment. Based on predicted incident meteoroid mass fluxes at the Moon, one might expect the Geminids and Quadrantids to have had the most significant effect on the lunar environment during the mission. While a substantial exospheric response was clearly observed by the LADEE instruments during the Geminids, the apparent response during the Quadrantids was more subdued. One contribution to this difference was likely due to the location of the stream radiant on the lunar surface relative to LADEE’s orbit. The Geminids radiant was predicted to be very close to LADEE’s equatorial orbit, whereas the Quadrantids radiant was much farther poleward. This could explain the diminished exospheric activity and suggests that the response of the lunar environment to meteoroid streams could be relatively localized in some instances. Both short-term and long-term variations observed in the lunar sodium exosphere could be attributed to the instantaneous and cumulative effects of meteoroid stream bombardment. These and other effects will be discussed.",

The catchment is a matrix of savanna and agricultural land maintained under various regimes, providing a comparison of multiple land use types of Sudanian Wooded Savanna including a canyon gallery forest, agroforestry parklands, occasionally grazed semi-open savanna, a semi-closed wooded slope, fallow fields, rice paddies, and ephemeral wetlands. By filtering out times when dry air was entrained, we demonstrate the small control of soil moisture and vegetation on the evaporative fraction, which was not initially visible. Additionally we document the high contribution of the gallery forest to the the catchment evaporation, despite its small size. These small meteorological stations could be paired with currently available satellite data to calculate evaporation over a much larger area, even when eddy-covariance equipment is not available. These findings reinforce local cultural beliefs of the importance of gallery forests for climate regulation and may provide tools to key local decision makers, rural farmers.",

It lies at the southern edge of the Northern Chile seismic gap, where the last large event Mw~8.8 occurred on 1877. The peninsula has been regarded like a tectonic boundary for large earthquakes, where strong interaction between surface, crustal and interplate deformation associated to the subduction of the Nazca beneath the South American plates occur.\nGeochronological and geomorphologic results including the analysis of Digital Elevation Model, differential GPS data and submarine subbottom seismic profiles (3.5 kHz), evidence an acceleration of the coastal uplift (from ca. 0.2 m/ka up to ca. 1 m/ka) and crustal normal faulting (slip rate in the order of 0.6 m/ka) processes in the last ~40 ka, with respect to the Middle and Late Pleistocene, according previous results. Onshore and offshore observations revealed a scissor-shape deformation along the Mejillones Fault, with increasing slip rate offshore. Accelerated coastal uplift phenomenon in the last ~40 ka should evidence increased earthquake production along the subduction contact, implying also an acceleration of the seismogenic activity along crustal normal faults, and should result in the current coastal cliff formation.",

The diffuse-flow images display the level of decorrelation between sonar echos with transmissions separated by 0.2 s. The present work aims to provide further information on the strength of diffuse flows. Two approaches are used: Measurement of the dependence of decorrelation on lag and measurement of phase shift of sonar echos, with lags in 3-hour increments up to several days. The phase shifts and decorrelation are linked to variations of temperature above the seabed, which allows quantification of those variations, their magnitudes, spatial and temporal scales, and energy spectra.

Multiple surveys were conducted along 200-meter lines using a capacitively coupled resistivity array, a thermal sensor array, and an ice drill.\nA custom thermal sensor array based on the Arduino platform was constructed for this work. This array included an infrared sensor with a 35° field of view. This gave an average surface temperature reading over a spot of ≈25cm diameter with an accuracy of ±0.1°C . An ambient temperature sensor with an accuracy of ±1°C was positioned 25cm above the ice. Both of these were mounted on a repurposed GPR cart with a custom-built odometer wheel. Sets of 30 data points were collected every 17cm along the survey lines. Most data were collected during daylight hours. Some thermal data were collected in the morning twilight to study the effects of shadows cast by snow mounds.\nResistivity data were obtained at 8 to 10 vertical depths as determined by the length of the array using 2.5m dipoles. This depended on the ice thickness along a survey line as well as the equipment’s susceptibility to ambient temperature variations. The data points were obtained approximately 35cm apart horizontally. The resistivity data were inverted using software with a number of parameters to be set by the user. Adjusting these parameters caused the modeled depth to the ice/water boundary to vary significantly. The parameters have been refined through ice drill data obtained at 10-meter intervals. The ice drill was deployed only after resistivity and thermal data were obtained for each survey line. The resistivity and ice drill data showed an average ice depth of 1.2-1.7 meters, significantly thinner than in previous years’ surveys.\nThe modeled locations of the ice/water boundaries from the resistivity and ice drill data were compared to the surface temperatures along the survey lines. An analysis of the correlation of the temperature and ice thickness will be presented. Possible extensions of this method to further ice thickness studies will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Antarctica has experienced a series of dramatic climate changes on regional scales in recent decades. Surface air temperature observations of the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica reveal rapid warming trends. In contrast to the sea ice decline over the Arctic, Antarctic sea ice has not declined, but rather exhibiting a perplexing redistribution, with increases in the Ross Sea and decreases in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea. While changes in radiative forcing from greenhouse gases and ozone have played important roles in Antarctic surface temperature change, these regional scale changes are strongly influenced by changes in the atmospheric circulation, and is linked to the tropical Ocean through tropical – polar teleconnections. In this study, we used different observational and reanalysis datasets, as well as a hierarchy of atmospheric models with different complexity, to establish a teleconnection between the Atlantic Ocean and Antarctic climate. We show that the Sea surface temperature warming related to Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation generates Rossby wave trains propagating to the polar region, induces a positive phase response in the Southern Annular Mode, strengthens the Amundsen Sea Low, projects onto the observed dipole-like sea-ice redistribution between the Ross and Amundsen Seas, and contributes to Peninsula warming. This teleconnection depends critically on the Rossby wave dynamics and is pronounced in all seasons except austral summer.",

The inversion procedure properly accounts for the finite-volume sensitivities of measured travel time residuals, and the resulting model shows a greater resolution of upper mantle velocity heterogeneity beneath the study area than earlier approaches based on the classical ray-theoretical approach. Our model reveals a lateral change of P velocities from -0.5% to 0.5% down to ~200-km depth in a 50-km wide zone between the Alberta Basin and the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, which suggests a sharp structural gradient along the Cordillera deformation front. The stable cratonic lithosphere, delineated by positive P-velocity perturbations of 0.5% and greater, extends down to a maximum depth of ~180 km beneath the Archean Loverna Block (LB). In comparison, the mantle beneath the controversial Medicine Hat Block (MHB) exhibits significantly higher velocities in the uppermost mantle and a shallower (130-150 km depth) root, generally consistent with the average depth of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary beneath Southwest Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). The complex shape of the lithospheric velocities under the MHB may be evidence of extensive erosion or a partial detachment of the Precambrian lithospheric root. Furthermore, distinct high velocity anomalies in LB and MHB, which are separated by ‘normal’ mantle block beneath the Vulcan structure (VS), suggest different Archean assembly and collision histories between these two tectonic blocks.",

            "abstract": "Modern data from the China Bulletin and temporary network deployments has been used to update amplitude tomography using ML and MS seismic amplitudes. This work builds on the results of Hearn et al., 2008. ML attenuation estimates are much better resolved due to the inclusion of subnet data. We find that the trade-off between geometrical spreading and attenuation estimates are well constrained; however, both of these parameters have significant trade-off with the frequency dependence of attenuation. Maps of attenuation using the ML amplitudes are similar to those of Lg attenuation found by other authors suggesting that ML attenuation estimates form a suitable proxy for Lg attenuation estimates. We are now able to associate high attenuation directly with the Longmen Shan and the Qilian Shan mountains and also, where resolved, with the Kunlun Shan, Altyn Tag, and Tian Shan mountains. Grabens around the Ordos Platform also show high attenuation. Basins, however, do not in general show high attenuation. The main exception to this is the Bohai Basin. We conclude that the ML waveforms, like the Lg waveforms, interrogate the entire crustal column and are most sensitive to tectonically active structures and rapid changes in crustal structure. Data from MS data do not include subnet readings and do not have the resolution that was obtained with the ML data. Nonetheless, features are similar with the exception that basins appear more highly attenuative.",

Particle properties, chemical speciation, and smoke radiative properties are related and mutually informative, as pictures below suggest (slopes of lines of same color are similar).\n(a) Mixed-effects (random-effects) statistical modeling provides estimates of both emission factors and a reasonable description of carbon-burned simultaneously. Different fire plumes will have very different contributions to volatile organic carbon reactivity; this may help explain differences of free NOx(both gas- and particle-phase), and also of ozone production, that have been noted for forest-fire plumes in California. Our evalualations check or correct emission factors based on sequential measurements (e.g., the Normalized Ratio Enhancement and similar methods). We stress the dangers of methods relying on emission-ratios to CO.\n(b) This work confirms and extends many reports of great situational variability in emissions factors. VOCs vary in OH reactivity and NOx-binding. Reasons for variability are not only fuel composition, fuel condition, etc, but are confused somewhat by rapid transformation and mixing of emissions. We use “unmixing” (distinct from mixed-effects) statistics and compare briefly to approaches like neural nets. We focus on one particularly intense fire the notorious Yosemite Rim Fire of 2013. In some samples, NOx activity was not so surpressed by binding into nitrates as in other fires. While our fire-typing is evolving and subject to debate, the carbon-burned Δ(CO2+CO) estimates that arise from mixed effects models, free of confusion by background-CO2 variation, should provide a solid base for discussion.\n(c) We report progress using promising links we find between emissions-related \"fire types\" and promising features deducible from remote observations of plumes, e.g., single scatter albedo, Ångström exponent of scattering, Ångström exponent of absorption, (CO column density)/(aerosol optical depth).",

            "abstract": "Understanding the flow of fines, particulate sorting in porous media and fractured media during sediment transport is significant for industrial, environmental, geotechnical and petroleum technologies to name a few. For example, the safety of dam structures requires the characterization of the granular filter ability to capture fine-soil particles and prevent erosion failure in the event of an interfacial dislocation. Granular filters are one of the most important protective design elements of large embankment dams. In case of cracking and erosion, if the filter is capable of retaining the eroded fine particles, then the crack will seal and the dam safety will be ensured. Here we develop and apply a numerical tool to thoroughly investigate the migration of fines in granular filters at the grain scale. The numerical code solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and uses a Lagrange multiplier technique. The numerical code is validated to experiments conducted at the USACE and ERDC. These laboratory experiments on soil transport and trapping in granular media are performed in constant-head flow chamber filled with the filter media. Numerical solutions are compared to experimentally measured flow rates, pressure changes and base particle distributions in the filter layer and show good qualitative and quantitative agreement. To further the understanding of the soil transport in granular filters, we investigated the sensitivity of the particle clogging mechanism to various parameters such as particle size ratio, the magnitude of hydraulic gradient, particle concentration, and grain-to-grain contact properties. We found that for intermediate particle size ratios, the high flow rates and low friction lead to deeper intrusion (or erosion) depths. We also found that the damage tends to be shallower and less severe with decreasing flow rate, increasing friction and concentration of suspended particles. We have extended these results to more realistic heterogeneous population particulates for sediment transport.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the US DOE by LLNL under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344 and was sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate, Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency.",

The objective of the study is to investigate basin-scale hydrogeology in WCSB and to establish boundary conditions for future local-scale groundwater management models. Earlier work in the Alberta basin has acknowledged the fact that in addition to topography controlled conditions, a substantial part of the basin exhibits sub-hydrostatic regimes. The basin-scale model (approx. 420,000 km2) includes Upper Cretaceous aquifers to Recent age sediments which collectively attain maximum thicknesses of >2600 m. Regional aquifer units considered for the numerical model are Quaternary sediments, and the sedimentary rocks of the Paskapoo, Scollard, Horseshoe Canyon formations and the Belly River Group. Regional aquitards delineated include the Battle and Bear Paw formations. The study area is bound to the west by the Brazeau-Waptiti thrust belt and to the south by the Canada-USA international border. The boundary to the north and east is delineated by the maximum extent of the Wapiti and Belly River groups and Judith River Formation. USGS MODFLOW was implemented for numerical simulation.\nThe steady state numerical model was calibrated using a Response Surface based (Radial Basis Functions) optimization method. The calibration targets (~2000) were comprised of drill stem tests for deeper units and static water levels for shallower units. Petrophysical analyses of cores averaged K values from analyses of aquifer test results,and literature values were used to provide initial values and calibration ranges for hydraulic properties. Results indicate predominance of topography driven, local- to intermediate-scale flow systems in all hydrostratigraphic units with recharge of these units occurring in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The Battle aquitard, where present, acts to retard regional flow. Sensitivity analysis of the steady-state model calibration was evaluated for hydraulic conductivities and recharge rates.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic Ocean, on a volume basis, receives the largest input of terrestrial organic matter of all ocean basins. These inputs come from the most important stock of soil organic carbon (OC) on Earth, estimated around 1700 Pg OC, which is well preserved in permafrost (from patchy to continuous). Arctic watersheds are experiencing unprecedented climate warming, and future warming is projected to be stronger at high latitudes. As a result, we can expect an increase in active layer depth and a decrease of permafrost extent in the near future. These shifts will affect the riverine contributions of terrestrial organic matter to the coastal and oceanic carbon pools. Until recently, few data existed about dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes in Siberian rivers, particularly during the spring freshet. Further, there is still a dearth of information about the source and degradation state of this DOC in Arctic rivers through their hydrographs. To address this issue, we intensively sampled two spring flood periods in a small Canadian river (Great Whale river) and the largest Arctic river (Yenisei) at their outlet in order to get information on the source and state (“freshness”) of mobilized DOC during these active flood periods. Combining geographical information data (GIS) and biogeochemical analysis (elemental, isotopic and molecular) we were able to discern dynamic ecosystem linkages. DOC concentration increased 4-9 fold in each river from low flow to peak flow. Molecular characteristics of this DOC are extremely variable during the flood event, ranging from old, altered DOC to fresh, labile DOC. We observed a partition of this quality between DOC and POC, with fresher DOC coming mostly from the leaching of softwoods during peak flow. Snow cover is variable along the period with snow-free area of the watershed imparting the greatest influence on DOC composition within the river. These results confirm that DOC dynamics during the spring flood are complex and much different than during low flow conditions. As export of DOC in this period can reach up to 80% of annual DOC export, measurements acquired during this study will bring crucial information on not only watershed-aquatic system linkages, but also on global carbon cycling.",

            "abstract": "Prior studies have provided observational evidence that cloud feedback over the subtropical stratocumulus regions is positive because cloud cover is anti-correlated with local Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies. Moreover, regressions of observed atmospheric fields on equatorial SST anomalies indicate that cloud feedbacks over the southern hemisphere stratocumulus regions (i.e., Peruvian and Namibian) co-vary with the respective equatorial modes of variability: El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Atlantic Niño. However, from observations alone it is not possible to quantify the influence of regional cloud feedbacks on large-scale climate variability. To address this question, a set of sensitivity experiments are conducted using an atmospheric general circulation model (ECHAM6) coupled to a slab-ocean in which the strength of positive cloud feedback is enhanced over the Peruvian and Namibian regions. Enhanced positive cloud feedback increases the variance and the persistence of local as well as equatorial SST anomalies, enhancing ENSO and Atlantic Niño variability. We explore the role of cloud feedbacks over other regions in the South Atlantic and find that they increases local SST variability, but exhibit negligible responses at the equator. Our results indicate that the subtropical stratocumulus regions play a central role in enhancing equatorial SST variability because they are located where the SST anomalies have the largest growth rates, that is, where the variance of SST is largest and the damping rate of SST is weakest. These results highlight the important role of the regional coupling of cloud cover over the subtropical stratocumulus regions with local SSTs, and have implications for the response of equatorial climate variability to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Very low frequency earthquakes (VLFEs) are discrete seismic events rich in low frequencies (20 – 50 sec) and depleted in high frequencies compared to similar size local events. They are associated with slow earthquakes and so far found in only a handful of subduction zones worldwide. I systematically search and find VLFEs in the Cascadia subduction zone. I use a grid-search moment tensor inversion method to scan for VLFEs in 3-D space and time, locate them and determine their source parameters. They are located downdip of the locked zone, where non-volcanic tremor occurs (Fig. 1). The best estimates of VLFE depths put them near the plate interface. Their focal mechanisms indicate double couple sources and are consistent with shallow dipping thrust movement. Their moment magnitude ranges between 3.3 and 3.5 suggesting that a significant part of seismic moment may be released by such VLFEs during slow earthquakes. Interestingly, most of the VLFEs are located where the slip is the largest in an ETS event. Generally, VLFEs correlates with tremor quite well in space and time. They slowly migrate alongstrike form south to north with tremor. In detail, VLFEs appear to be tracking tremor even during tremor migration of shorter time scales. I am currently expanding the VLFE catalog in space and time to better characterize their spatiotemporal distribution, moment release, and their role in slow earthquakes. VLFEs and their interaction with tremor is providing new insights to the physics of slow earthquakes, underlying processes governing them and fault properties in Cascadia.",

            "abstract": "During one 17 month period ending October 2013, three major reports on sea level rise from three highly respected science providers produced three differing, in some cases wildly divergent, estimates of sea level rise through the year 2100. These reports, by the National Research Council, the IPCC, and the National Climate Assessment, collectively flummoxed the lay reader seeking direction on sea level rise projections to incorporate into adaptation planning. Guidance documents soon emerged from state entities, including regulatory agencies, which caused further confusion.\nThe City and County of San Francisco, surrounded by water on three sides, began developing City-wide sea level rise guidance in 2013. A Sea Level Rise Committee featuring representatives of key infrastructure managers met over a nine month period, and their work included an in-depth review of the science of sea level rise. To convert divergent scientific reports into “actionable science” required not only a close reading of each but extensive expert elicitation to tease out the meaning behind each of the numbers and the associated uncertainties. In the end, sufficient consistency between the differing projections, fortified by political exigencies, allowed a “scientific consensus” with actionable science value for the City to surface. The resulting document, “Guidance for Incorporating Sea Level Rise into Capital Planning in San Francisco,” begins by providing a scientific underpinning for planning, guidelines for incorporating uncertainty – particularly for accommodating multiple projections for any particular time slice – and outlines a four step process for assessment and adaptation. It also relies on new state-of-the-art inundation maps produced as part of the SFPUC’s capital improvement program. Together, the Guidance and associated tools provide a road map for successful assessment and adaptation to sea level rise. We will also draw lessons from the experience that may be of value to science leaders seeking to make contributions in the decision making domain.",

The main objective of this initiative is to have a complete cover of the seafloor morphology of the Guerrero slope as the background data for comparative studies of the seafloor deformation in case of future offshore earthquake ruptures in this region. At he first stage of this initiative, we have mapped the continental slope in front the Petacalco Bay, west of the Guerrero Seismic Gap, where three important large earthquakes occurred and caused great damages in Mexico City: Petatlán earthquake (Mw=7.6) at 1979, Michoacán earthquake (Mw=8.1) and its aftershock (Mw=7.9) at 1985. Geophysical results of two campaigns carry in 2012 (MAMRIV12) and 2013 (BABPET13) on board the BO EL PUMA are presented which include multibeam data and subbottom profiles. These data sets cover an area between 101°W and 103°W, and from the shelf-slope break to the trench. The multibeam chart shows details of the hydrological erosion induced by many submarine cannons at the upper slope, whereas the seafloor relief in the lower slope is dominated by tectonic structures. The subbottom profiles and the seafloor morphology evidence zones of big slumps and faults. For first time the Rio Balsas submarine cannon is completed chart, reaching the trench basin. The river course is deflected, possibly by shear faulting. There are slump sites near the trench that probably one is associated to the 1925 tsunami at Zihuatanejo, Guerrero. The 1985 Michoacán aftershock was accompany by a small Tsunami. At that time, the lack of morphology data in this slope inhibited further studies of seafloor-deformation and its tsunamigenic relationship.\nFunding providing by UNAM-DGAPA-PAPIIT grants: IN115613 and IN115513",

            "abstract": "Lipid biomarkers are key tools for the interpretation of past and present environments, and specifically, intact polar lipids (IPLs) reflect contributions from the living biosphere. While several studies have documented intact polar lipid (IPL) distributions in the marine subsurface, the organic geochemistry of terrestrial subsurface communities remains poorly characterized. Here we present IPL distributions from a portal into deep terrestrial biosphere, the former Homestake Mine, SD USA. Interpretation of IPL distributions can be hampered by a lack of comparative pure culture information or comparative molecular and geochemical data, thus we performed IPL analysis in conjunction with detailed geochemistry and DNA sequencing. A large diversity of lipid structures is observed including phospholipids, aminolipids, glycolipids, GDGTs, and a number of unidentified compounds. Variability in lipid distributions is not random with individual samples clustering based on physical and geochemical parameters. For instance, biofilm samples contain abundant aminolipids relative to filtered subsurface fluid samples. Does this difference reflect phosphorus scarcity in the biofilms, or production of aminolipids by specific microbial phyla? Using comparative analysis between the IPL, molecular, and geochemical datasets we address this, and similar questions, as well as identify potential microbial sources of unknown biomarkers. In the case of the aminolipids, we observe strong covariation between the lipid distribution and that of the bacteroidetes, epsilonproteobacteria, and spirochaetes, but no correlation with P concentration. We can also extend this comparison globally; asking how similar IPL distributions of the deep terrestrial subsurface are previously studied sites. A surprising finding from this work is the total lack of similarity between deep marine and terrestrial subsurface sites. This contribution will help to define the phylogenetic and geochemical mechanisms driving the lipid biomarker signature of the deep terrestrial subsurface biosphere.",

Measurements came from ten California sites and spanned a mean annual temperature range of 5 to 23°C and mean annual precipitation range of 100 to 1400 mm, from Mojave Desert scrub to subalpine lodgepole forest. All ten ecosystems exhibited similar patterns in water use efficiency: ecosystem WUE declined sharply as annual precipitation dropped below 500 mm, and WUE plateaued with annual precipitation greater than 500 mm. Surface evaporation and flexible plant physiology contributed to sensitive WUE with low annual precipitation, while limited surface evaporation and \"ecosystem inertia\" diminished sensitivity of WUE with high annual precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Prior to perihelion passage on 28 November 2013, the observed right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec) coordinates of comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) significantly lagged the predicted JPL (# 53) ephemeris. We show that this “braking effect” is due to a dynamic pressure exerted by sublimating gases on the sunward side of the nucleus [1]. Comet ISON was observed November 23 through November 28 using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). Imaging is achieved simultaneously at wavelengths of 850 μm and 450 μm, with RA and Dec determined from the central peak in the coma brightness [2]. When comet ISON was first detected at 850 μm, the 1-mm-sized dust particles were tightly bound to the comet nucleus until at least November 23. Three days later, the dust was less tightly bound, elongated and diffuse, spread out over as much as 120 arc seconds (80,000 km) in the anti-solar direction, suggesting a fragmentation event.\nWe compute the average braking velocity of the nucleus of comet ISON by first measuring the distance between the central RA position and the predicted JPL ephemeris. We then calculate the change in this distance between subsequent observations, and divide this value by the elapsed time between the two observations to yield an average drift velocity of the nucleus over this time interval. We assume that comet ISON, like a number of Jupiter Family Comets visited by spacecraft [3], has low thermal inertia. Thus, the sublimating gases are emitted predominantly on the sunward side of the nucleus. Additionally, we assume that water ice dominates the sublimating gases [4]. We then calculate the pressure on the surface of the nucleus due to the emitted gases using the procedure described in [1]. We match the average drift velocity of the nucleus due to this sublimation pressure with the observed average drift velocity from the JCMT observations, which is sensitive to the size of the body, allowing us to estimate the size of the nucleus (or its fragments) shortly before perihelion.

            "abstract": "Precipitation in California is naturally more variable than elsewhere in the United States, and climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of precipitation and streamflow anomalies. As part of a larger effort to assess flow conditions under historical, current, and future climates, we characterized the change in the Russian River’s mainstem flows between two 30-year periods that represent historical (1951 to 1980) and current (1981 to 2010) climate conditions. Analyses included measured data from one mainstem gage (Ukiah) that represents natural flow conditions, and three mainstem gages (Hopland, Healdsburg, and Guerneville) regulated by diversion into the Russian River from the adjacent Eel River and by reservoir storage. Analysis of natural flows at the Ukiah gage under the current climate indicates statistically significant increases in low flow metrics that include: median monthly flows from July to October; number of zero flow days; and 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, 30- and 90-day minimum flows. In contrast to the Ukiah gage, decreases in low flows under the current climate at the three regulated-streamflow gages varied with distance downstream. Statistically significant declines in median monthly flows occurred during the second period (1981-2010) from August to November at Hopland, September to November at Healdsburg and in October at Guerneville. Although mean annual flow declined at all four gages during the second period and median monthly low flows declined at the downstream gages, median monthly low flows and minimum flows at the Ukiah gage which represents natural flows increased during the driest months (July to October). Results from this study will be used to support ecological studies and water resource planning within the Russian River watershed. The relative importance of climate and watershed response on the quality and quantity of streamflow under historical and current climates will be assessed and results compared to analyses of unimpaired flows estimated using a basin-scale water balance model calibrated to low flow conditions.

            "abstract": "From the point of infiltration to the point of discharge, the chemical signature imparted to fluid flowing through catchments represents the weathering flux from the landscape. The magnitude of this flux is linked to both the time water spends in the system and the time required for reactions to influence fluid chemistry. The ratio of these characteristic times is often represented as a Damköhler number (Da), which links the parameters governing reactivity and flow. Stable isotope ratios are now commonly applied to identify and even quantify the processes and rates of primary mineral weathering, secondary mineral formation and biogeochemical cycling within catchments. Here, we derive a series of fractionation-discharge relationships for a variety of governing chemical rate laws utilizing Da coefficients. These equations can be used to isolate and quantify the effects of (1) fluid travel time distributions and (2) chemical weathering efficiency on observed stable isotope ratios. The analytical solutions are verified against multi-component reactive transport simulations of stable isotope fractionation in homogeneous and spatially correlated heterogeneous flow fields using the CrunchTope code and evaluated against field observations.\nWe demonstrate that for an irreversible reaction, the relationship between stable isotope enrichment and reactant concentration obeys a Rayleigh-type model across a wide range of reaction rates. However, this relationship is violated when a heterogeneous travel time distribution is considered. This observation highlights an important discrepancy in the commonly assumed relationship between fractionation and concentration for irreversible reactions. We further extend our derivation to consider isotope fractionation associated with a reversible reaction (i.e. a kinetically controlled approach to equilibrium) in a steady-state flow field. Due to the dependence of the observed isotope ratio on the flow rate, kinetic enrichment and equilibrium fractionation, our results suggest that a simple concentration – fractionation relationship does not exist for this type of reaction.",

            "abstract": "Waste-fluid injection into sedimentary rock is believed to have induced strike-slip earthquakes on historically inactive near-vertical faults in underlying crystalline basement beneath Youngstown, Ohio in 2011 (Kim, 2013). Two other examples of vertical strike-slip basement seismicity - the 1986 M4.8 earthquake near Painesville, Ohio (Nicholson et al., 1988) and sequences near Ashtabula, Ohio between 1986 and 2003 (Seeber et al., 2004) - were likely induced, although the Painesville event occurred 12 km from the nearest active injection well, and the Ashtabula activity persisted for years after injection ceased. In each case, hypocenters were about 1 km deeper than injection zones, prompting the hypothesis that fluid flow along faults triggered earthquakes by raising hypocentral fluid pressure. While a M4-5 earthquake likely requires a pre-existing fault 0.5-1 km in extent, favorably oriented in the pre-existing stress field, high fault-zone hydraulic conductivity has not been demonstrated. Assuming faults affect neither fluid flow nor the stress field, a layered axisymmetric finite element model (implemented in COMSOL) can simulate coupled poroelastic stress and pore-pressure distributions in isotropic, homogeneous basement with higher stiffness and lower permeability than target injection zones. Simulated radial and tangential poroelastic stresses resolved onto vertical planes lead to Coulomb stress changes favoring strike slip on portions of such planes beneath the injection zone. More specifically, the maximum horizontal shear stress increment on a vertical fault occurs where a line to the well is at 45° to the fault. The maximum shear strain is of opposite sense in adjacent quadrants, possibly explaining activation of en echelon faults in Youngstown, Ohio. Similar configurations of the wells, faults, and earthquakes in these case histories suggests that poroelastic stresses can govern the locations of strike-slip earthquakes on basement faults.",

            "abstract": "This work presents an analysis of North Atlantic ocean-atmosphere interaction in a warming climate, based on a long-term earth system model experiment forced by the RCP 8.5 scenario, the strongest greenhouse gas forcing used in the climate projections for the 5th Assessement report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). In addition to a global increase in SSTs as a direct response to the radiative forcing, the model shows a distinct change of the local sea surface temperature (SST hereafter) patterns in the Gulf Stream region: The SST front moves northward by several hundred kilometers, likely as a response of the wind-driven part of the oceanic surface circulation, and becomes more zonal. As a consequence of a massive slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, the northeast North Atlantic only shows a moderate warming compared to the rest of the ocean. The feedback of these changes on the atmosphere was studied in a set of sensitivity experiments based on the SST climatology of the coupled runs. The set consists of a control run based on the historical run, a run using the full SST from the coupled RCP 8.5 run and two runs, where the SST signal was deconstructed into a homogenous mean warming part and a local pattern change. In the region of the precipitation maximum in the historical run the future scenario shows an increase of absolute SSTs, but a significant decrease in local precipitation, low-level convergence and upward motion. Since warmer SSTs usually cause the opposite, this indicates that the local response in that region is connected to the (with respect to the historical run) weakened SST gradients rather than to the absolute SST. Consistently, the model shows enhanced precipitation north of this region, where the SST gradients are enhanced. However, the signal restricts to the low and mid-troposphere and does not reach the higher model levels. There is little evidence for a large-scale response to the changes in the Gulf Stream region; instead, the large scale signal is mainly controlled by the warmer background state and the AMOC slowdown and influenced by tropical SSTs. In a warmer climate the same change in SST gradient has a stronger effect on precipitation and the model produces a slightly enhanced North Atlantic storm track.",

            "abstract": "Changes in sea-ice cover, coastal erosion, and freshwater run-off have the potential to greatly influence carbon assimilation pathways and affect trophic structure in benthic communities across the western Arctic. In the Chukchi Sea, variations in the duration and timing of ice cover affect the delivery of ice algae to a relatively shallow (40-50 m) shelf benthos. Although ice algae are known as an important spring carbon subsidy for marine benthic fauna, ice algal contributions may also help initiate productivity of an active microphytobenthos. Recent studies provide clear evidence that the microphytobenthos are photosynthetically active, and have sufficient light and nutrients for in situ growth. The assimilation of benthic diatoms from both sources may explain the 13C enrichment observed in benthic primary consumers throughout the northern Chukchi. On the eastern Beaufort Sea coast, shallow (2-4 m) estuarine lagoon systems receive massive subsidies of terrestrial carbon that is assimilated by a benthic fauna of significant importance to upper trophic level species, but again, distinct 13C enrichment in benthic primary consumers suggests the existence of an uncharacterized food source. Since ice algae are absent, we believe the 13C enrichment in benthic fauna is caused by the assimilation of benthic microalgae, as reflected in seasonally high benthic chlorophyll in spring under replete light and nutrient conditions. Our observations suggest that changes in ice cover, on both temporal and spatial scales, are likely to have significant effects on the magnitude and timing of organic matter delivery to both shelf and nearshore systems, and that locally produced organic matter may become an increasingly important carbon subsidy that affects trophic assimilation and secondary ecosystem productivity.",

            "abstract": "Lunar mare “pits” are key science and exploration targets. The first three pits were discovered within Selene observations [1,2] and were proposed to represent collapses into lava tubes. Subsequent LROC images revealed 5 new mare pits and showed that the Mare Tranquillitatis pit (MTP; 8.335°N, 33.222°E) opens into a sublunarean void at least 20-meters in extent [3,4]. A key remaining task is determining pit subsurface extents, and thus fully understanding their exploration and scientific value. We propose a simple and cost effective reconnaissance of the MTP using a small lander (<130 kg) named Arne, that carries three flying microbots (or pit-bots) [5,6,7]. Key measurement objectives include decimeter scale characterization of the pit walls, 5-cm scale imaging of the eastern floor, determination of the extent of sublunarean void(s), and measurement of the magnetic and thermal environment.\nAfter landing and initial surface systems check Arne will transmit full resolution descent and surface images. Within two hours the first pit-bot will launch and fly into the eastern void. Depending on results from the first pit-bot the second and third will launch and perform follow-up observations. The primary mission is expected to last 48-hours; before the Sun sets on the lander there should be enough time to execute ten flights with each pit-bot.\nThe pit-bots are 30-cm diameter spherical flying robots [5,6,7] equipped with stereo cameras, temperature sensors, sensors for obstacle avoidance and a laser rangefinder. Lithium hydride [5,6] and water/hydrogen peroxide power three micro-thrusters and achieve a specific impulse of 350-400 s. Each pit-bot can fly for 2 min at 2 m/s for more than 100 cycles; recharge time is 20 min. Arne will carry a magnetometer, thermometer, 2 high resolution cameras, and 6 wide angle cameras and obstacle avoidance infrared sensors enabling detailed characterization of extant sublunarean voids.\n[1] Haruyama et al.

            "abstract": "The purpose of our study was to determine the interaction between in-stream large wood (LW), bank erosion, and sports fisheries in the 210 river kilometer (km) Coastal Plain segment of the dam-regulated Roanoke River, North Carolina. Methods included collecting background geomorphic data including a 200 km channel geometry survey and measurements from 701 bank erosion pins at 36 cross-sections over 132 km. LW concentrations were evaluated over a 177 km reach using georeferenced aerial video taken during regulated low flow (56 m3/s). LW transport was measured using 290 radio tagged LW pieces (mean diameter = 35.0 cm, length = 9.3 m) installed between 2008 and 2010. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were surveyed in 2010 at 29 sites using a boat mounted electroshock unit. The abundance of LW in logjams was 59 pieces/km and these were concentrated (21.5 logjams/km) in an actively eroding reach with relatively high sinuosity, high local LW production rates, and narrow channel widths. Most jams (70%) are available nearly year round as aquatic habitat, positioned either on the lower bank or submerged at low-water flows. The actively eroding reach is adjusting to upstream dam regulation by channel widening. The channel upstream of this reach has widened and stabilized while the channel downstream of the eroding reach is still relatively narrow but with lower bank erosion rates. Repeat surveys of radio tagged LW determined that transport was common throughout the study area despite dam regulation and a low channel gradient (0.0016). The mean distance travelled by a radio tagged piece of LW was 11.9 km with a maximum of 101 km (84 tags moved, 96 stationary, 110 not found). Radio tagged LW that moved during the study was found at low flow either in logjams (44%), as individual LW (43%), or submerged mid-channel (14%). Largemouth bass biomass density (g/hr effort) was highest in the actively eroding reach where logjams were most common. Our results support the hypothesis that channel evolution processes control bank stability and complexity that in turn control logjam frequency. Areas with higher concentrations of logjams have larger and more largemouth bass, a valued sports fish.",

The mission employs L-band radar and radiometer measurements to estimate soil moisture with 4% volumetric accuracy at a resolution of 10 km, and freeze-thaw state at a resolution of 1-3 km. Immediately following launch, there will be a 3 month instrument checkout period, followed by 6 months of level 1 (L1) calibration and validation. In this presentation, we will discuss the plans and preparations for the calibration and validation of L1 radar data from SMAP.\nAt the start of the L1 cal/val period, we will validate the operation of the instrument and of the ground processing using tools that look at readily identifiable surface features such as coast lines and corner reflectors. Geometric biases will be fit and removed. Radiometric cross-calibration with PALSAR and Aquarius will also be performed using target regions in the Amazon rain forest selected for their stability and uniformity. As the L1 cal/val period progresses, the performance of the automated short and long term calibration modules in ground processing will be tracked and verified using data from stable reference targets such as the wind corrected ocean and selected areas of rain forest that have shown good temporal stability.\nThe performance of the radio frequency interference (RFI) removal algorithm will be validated by processing data with the algorithm turned on and off, and using different parameter settings. Additional information on the extent of RFI will be obtained from a special RFI survey conducted early in the L1 cal/val period. Radar transmissions are turned off during the RFI survey, and receive only data are collected over a variety of operating frequencies. The model based Faraday rotation corrections will also be checked during the L1 cal/val by comparing the model Faraday rotation with the measured Faraday rotation obtained by the SMAP Radiometer.\nThis work is supported by the SMAP project at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.",

How this response affects fluvial sediment transport is poorly understood and is scope of our study.\nWe set up a numerical model to investigate how different magnitudes, frequencies and grain size distributions (GSD) of sediment supply events influence the sediment dynamics in the fluvial system. We used a randomized time series of disturbances and simulated subsequent fluvial reworking using a bed load transport model. Besides tracking the volume of stored sediment, we investigate changes in the GSD of the channel.\nIn our model, the GSD of the fluvial channel approaches the GSD of the sediment input under high supply conditions, in which large quantities of material are supplied by a high frequency of events. This results in an exceedance of the ability of the fluvial system to significantly evacuate the supply. On the other hand, if the fluvial system is given enough time to rework the input material, the GSD of the channel gets coarser with time, as the smaller grain sizes are transported away. We further analyze the conditions under which the system is stable or more sensitive to changes in the magnitude or frequency of sediment supply.\nOur model shows how the combination of episodic time scales of disturbances and constant time scales of fluvial reworking results in temporal patterns of fluvial sediment transport.",

However, our understanding of atmospheric nucleation and its influence on climate is limited as few ambient measurements have been made of either the nucleation rate (at 1 nm) or the initial growth rate of newly formed clusters (from 1 to 3 nm), both of which are necessary to constrain and investigate the nucleation mechanism and to develop process-level models. Aerosol nucleation and initial growth were investigated during the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon) campaign spanning the wet and dry seasons of 2014 downwind of the city of Manaus, Brazil. Aerosol measurement was accomplished through the deployment of a condensation particle counter-based electrical mobility spectrometer, optimized for the detection of aerosol down to 1 nm in diameter. An electrometer-based neutral air ion spectrometer was also deployed at the same location to measure the neutral and charged fraction of aerosol down to 1.5 nm in diameter. From these size distribution measurements, periods of nucleation will be identified, and the resulting nucleation rates and initial growth rates will be presented. Concurrent and co-located measurements of gas-phase sulfuric acid will provide the opportunity to investigate the functional contribution of sulfuric acid to the observed nucleation rate and initial growth rate.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical NMR measurements allow direct quantification of fluid content and estimation of critical flow and storage parameters, including bound/mobile porosity, pore size, and permeability. Following widespread adoption of NMR logging in the oilfield, novel low-field NMR technologies have been developed for measuring groundwater and hydrogeologic properties in the near-surface. Adaptation and optimization of these technologies has been required to meet the unique objectives of near-surface investigations. Here we present recent technical enhancements to low-field NMR instrumentation and methodologies along with field results from hydrogeologic characterization and monitoring applications. Improvements to circuit design have led to a significant reduction of the NMR echo-time, yielding more accurate detection and quantification of signals with short T2 (i.e. associated with water bound in clays and silts); the shorter echo-time also suppresses artifacts associated with magnetic mineralogy. Dynamic acquisition schemes including multi-frequency and multi-wait-time scanning have further increased the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), particularly for short T2 signals. Taken collectively, these improvements yield a factor of 4 increase in SNR, allowing faster measurement times and significant reduction of the variance and uncertainty in estimated hydrogeologic parameters. These specific advancements have been implemented both in downhole NMR logging tools as well as non-invasive soil moisture sensors, and are presented here with field applications including (1) quantification of porosity and hydraulic conductivity (K) in unconsolidated aquifers, (2) monitoring of changes in subsurface biogeochemistry, and (3) quantification and monitoring of changes in shallow soil moisture.",

The work is carried out using 2 different sets of statistically downscaled Global Climate Model (GCMs) projection datasets i.e. Bias correction and statistical downscaling (BCSD) generated at Portland State University and The Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) generated at University of Idaho. The analysis is done for with 10 GCM downscaled products each from CMIP5 daily dataset totaling to 40 different downscaled products for robust analysis. Summer, winter and yearly trend analysis is performed for all the 10 sub-basins using linear regression (significance tested by student t test) and Mann Kendall test (0.05 percent significance level), for precipitation (P), temperature maximum (Tmax) and temperature minimum (Tmin). Thereafter, all the parameters are modelled for uncertainty, across all models, in all the 10 sub-basins and across the CRB for future scenario periods. Results have indicated in varied degree of trends for all the sub-basins, mostly pointing towards a significant increase in all three climatic parameters, for all the seasons and yearly considerations. Uncertainty analysis have reveled very high change in all the parameters across models and sub-basins under consideration. Basin wide uncertainty analysis is performed to corroborate results from smaller, sub-basin scale. Similar trends and uncertainties are reported on the larger scale as well. Interestingly, both trends and uncertainties are higher during winter period than during summer, contributing to large part of the yearly change.",

            "abstract": "A recent study by the USGS National Assessment of Shoreline Change project revealed an increase in erosion hazards along the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast since the 1960s and a pattern of counter-clockwise shoreline rotation within headland-bounded littoral cells (Ruggiero et al., 2013). Shoreline rotation at seasonal to annual scale has been hypothesized to be produced by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) due to the generation of larger than average waves approaching the coast from more oblique angles during major El Niños. This change to the wave height and direction results in a greater alongshore component of wave energy flux and therefore a greater potential for strong gradients in longshore sediment transport in headland bounded littoral cells. Despite this relationship, the impact of an ENSO-driven increase in longshore sediment transport gradients on long-term shoreline change patterns has not been quantitatively explored. In this study, we first establish a relationship between ENSO and north eastern Pacific wave energy flux variability, and then use a one-line shoreline model to assess the effect of ENSO variability on seasonal to decadal coastal evolution.\nAnalyses of long-term wave hindcasts reveal a wave climatology with southerly alongshore energy flux during summer months, and northerly flux during winter months. During major El Niño winters, the northerly flux is an order of magnitude greater than the climatological average. Additionally, decadal trends reveal net cumulative wave energy flux to the north, with values at 1 to 2 orders of magnitude greater than the annual variability. These conditions are used as inputs to a single-line contour model which computes gradients in longshore sediment flux, and the associated shoreline changes. Using this simplified approach we assess if gradients in longshore sediment transport is the most relevant process affecting morphological change on sandy beaches bounded by rocky headlands. We then vary the wave climatology to develop a probabilistic understanding of how these coastal systems may respond to future changes. Our approach allows us to investigate the relationship between offshore wave climate variability and littoral cell scale shoreline rotation to yield new insights into the dominant processes forcing shoreline evolution.",

Joint Probability distribution functions (PDFs), of both the climatic variables, might help better understand the interdependence of the two, and thus in-turn help in accessing the future with confidence. Using the joint distribution of temperature and precipitation is also of significant importance in hydrological applications and climate change studies. In the present study, we have used multi-modelled statistically downscaled-scenario ensemble of precipitation and temperature variables using 2 different statistically downscaled climate dataset. The datasets used are, 10 Global Climate Models (GCMs) downscaled products from CMIP5 daily dataset, namely, those from the Bias Correction and Spatial Downscaling (BCSD) technique generated at Portland State University and from the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) technique, generated at University of Idaho, leading to 2 ensemble time series from 20 GCM products. Thereafter the ensemble PDFs of both precipitation and temperature is evaluated for summer, winter, and yearly periods for all the 10 sub-basins across Columbia River Basin (CRB). Eventually, Copula is applied to establish the joint distribution of two variables enabling users to model the joint behavior of the variables with any level of correlation and dependency. Moreover, the probabilistic distribution helps remove the limitations on marginal distributions of variables in question. The joint distribution is then used to estimate the change trends of the joint precipitation and temperature in the current and future, along with estimation of the probabilities of the given change. Results have indicated towards varied change trends of the joint distribution of, summer, winter, and yearly time scale, respectively in all 10 sub-basins. Probabilities of changes, as estimated by the joint precipitation and temperature, will provide useful information/insights for hydrological and climate change predictions.",

            "abstract": "The river restoration industry spends millions of dollars every year on improving salmon spawning in riverbeds where sediment is too big for fish to move and thus use during redd building. However, few studies have addressed the question of how big is too big in salmon spawning substrates. Hence managers have had little quantitative basis for gauging the amount of spawning habitat in coarse-bedded rivers. Moreover, the scientific framework has remained weak for restoration projects that seek to improve spawning conditions. To overcome these limitations, we developed a physically based, field-calibrated model for the fraction of the bed that is fine-grained enough to support spawning by fish of a given size. Model inputs are fish length and easy-to-measure indices of bed-surface grain size. Model outputs include the number of redds and eggs the substrate can accommodate when flow depth, temperature, and other environmental factors are not limiting. The mechanistic framework of the model captures the biophysical limits on sediment movement and the space limitations on redd building and egg deposition in riverbeds. We explored the parameter space of the model and found a previously unrecognized tradeoff in salmon size: bigger fish can move larger sediment and thus use more riverbed area for spawning; they also tend to have higher fecundity, and so can deposit more eggs per redd; however, because redd area increases with fish length, the number of eggs a substrate can accommodate is highest for moderate-sized fish. One implication of this tradeoff is that differences in grain size may help regulate river-to-river differences in salmon size. Thus, our model suggests that population diversity and, by extension, species resilience are linked to lithologic, geomorphic, and climatic factors that determine grain size in rivers. We cast the model into easy-to-use look-up tables, charts, and computer applications, including a JavaScript app that works on tablets and mobile phones. We explain how these tools can be used in a new, mechanistic approach to assessing spawning substrates and optimizing gravel augmentation projects in coarse-bedded rivers.",

            "abstract": "A precise process and analysis of a dense network of CGPS observations are used to infer the long term and seasonal deformation patterns of ground surface over the state of Texas. The state covers 9 major aquifers which supply more than 50 percent of the water utilized in the state and spread over ~75% of the state area. Pumping of groundwater from many aquifers for irrigation, industrial and human consumption has resulted in a significant water level declines, and in many areas caused long term ground surface subsidence. While more than 70 percent of GPS sites, located on the top of aquifers, experience subsidence, the remained sites located outside the aquifers present significant uplift as a result of elastic response to the changes in loading due to soil moisture and surface water. However, a significant episodic uplift (up 6 mm/yr) from 2010 to 2012 appears in all GPS time series corresponding to 2011 extreme drought in Texas and adjacent states. Such episodic uplift is inferred as an elastic response of ground surface to reduced surface load. While most of drought indicators rely on precipitation index, soil moisture model, satellite vegetation health index and streamflow data, we suggest using regional CGPS vertical displacement as a further proxy for the indication of a drought. Inverting the vertical displacement from GPS it is possible to estimate total water storage including the portion of groundwater storage. In this abstract, the uplifts during drought period are inverted to derive total water storage loss using load Green’s function. The GPS-based estimate of water loss is compared with GRACE-based and Land Surface Models estimates of total water storage (e.g. NLDAS and GLDAS). The limitations and uncertainty associated with each technique are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Stishovite, found in some parts of subducted oceanic slabs and crustal fragments in the Earth's mantle, may contain small amounts of hydroxyl in conjunction with Al incorporation. Spektor et al. (2011, PNAS) showed that much larger amounts of water (1.3 wt%) can be incorporated into pure Al-free stishovite at 10 GPa and 723 K. However, solubility variations with pressure and temperature have not been measured in detail, and the effect of water on the physical properties of stishovite at mantle-related pressures and temperatures is still unknown.\nWe have synthesized different hydrous stishovite samples in the multi anvil press: two hydrous samples at 723 K and 10 GPa for different heating time and another hydrous sample at 723 K and 20 GPa. We also synthesized anhydrous stishovite at 1473 K and 10 GPa. X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows larger unit cell volume for all hydrous phases comparing to the anhydrous stishovite.\nXRD patterns show that the samples synthesized at 10 GPa both have a tetragonal rutile type structure whereas the sample synthesized at 20 GPa shows peak splittings indicating a lower symmetry. It deviates from the rutile structure and it is closer to the CaCl2-type structure but has additional splitting. From the unit cell parameters for those samples combined with the calibration by Specktor et al. the water content is determined: 1.6-4.9 wt% water, which increases with pressure and heating duration. The existence of water in stishovite was also confirmed by Raman, Infrared spectroscopy and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry.\nWe also synthesized hydrous stishovite in the diamond anvil cell at 26-60 GPa and 1300-2000 K. SiO2 glass was loaded in an H2O pressure medium and the sample was laser heated at high pressures and different temperatures. Synchrotron XRD patterns show that those phases are tetragonal stishovite. From unit-cell parameters, at 26-31 GPa, the water content of the samples synthesized at 1300 K is lower than the multi anvil sample. However, the samples synthesized at >50 GPa and 1300-2000 K have larger unit-cell volume suggesting that the pressure plays an important role in stabilizing OH in dense silica. The fact that hydrous stishovite is still stable and contains more water even at mantle geotherm temperatures suggests silica may transport a significant amount of water to the lower mantle.",

The measured nodal pattern validates previous numerical estimates associated with a northern amplitude bias, though variability exists across the modal frequency band, particularly for mode 0 and 1. Low frequency oceanic η white noise within seiche frequency bands (24-69 cpd) provides a continuous forcing of the bay seiche with a η2 (variance) amplification of 16-40 for the different modes. The temporal variation of the oceanic η white noise is significantly correlated (R2=0.86) at the 95% confidence interval with the bay seiche η that varies seasonally.

            "abstract": "Marine sediments often exhibit strong redox gradients, hosting a range of important nitrogen transformation processes. While the interplay among these microbially catalyzed nitrogen transformations has been well studied in the water column, the sharp redox transition in sediments often makes it far more difficult to unravel the complexity underpinning the cycling of nitrogen. Although often low in concentration, nitrite represents an important ‘crossroad’ in the nitrogen cycle as a reactive intermediate of both reductive and oxidative N transformations, including nitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and denitrification. Here we focus on the dual isotopic composition of nitrite (δ15N and δ18O), in concert with nitrate and ammonium data, as a means for constraining the sedimentary N cycling.\nIntact flow-through core incubations were performed on sediments collected from intertidal flats on the island of Sylt, Germany. Three types of substrate (i.e., sand, silt, and clay) were collected and subjected to different oxygen (i.e., ambient vs depleted) and nitrogen (i.e., ambient vs highly loaded) regimes. In addition to the measurement of natural abundance N and O stable isotopes, we also amended cores with nitrate having a positive ∆17O in our high nitrogen treatment, which offers yet an additional tracer to further constrain these transformations.\nWhile the concentration and isotopic composition (δ15N and δ18O) of nitrite act to integrate the influence of major N redox reactions, the N and O isotope systematics are decoupled. Although nitrogen atoms are generally conserved among these transformations, oxygen isotopes of nitrite are subject to a different set of processes. For example, the loss of an oxygen atom during the reductive processes of NO3- and NO2- reduction, the gain of oxygen atoms from O2 and water during nitrification, and oxygen isotopic equilibration between nitrite and water are all reflected in the δ18O of NO2-. Thus, the δ15N, δ18O and Δ17O can be used together to help elucidate the interconnections between the cycling of nitrogen and oxygen. While these sediments were a net source of NO2- to the overlying water, our NO2- isotope data revealed the integrated influence of denitrification, nitrification and oxygen isotope exchange in these dynamic systems.",

            "abstract": "Large scale monitoring of crop growth and yield has relied on empirical correlations between remotely sensed vegetation-indices and yield. However, the determinants of yield are complex with several processes including crop phenology, photosynthesis and respiration contributing to overall crop yield. It has not been possible to delve more deeply into environmental effects on these controls given the limitations of current remote sensing technology. Recent advances in the ability to monitor solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) now provides a direct measurement of photosynthetic activity from space and opens up new approaches for understanding the controls on crop yield. Using county-level crop statistics in the United States, we find that spaceborne SIF measurements for 2007-2012 provided improved measures of crop productivity compared with various traditional crop monitoring approaches, despite the fact that SIF sensors are still not optimized for crop monitoring. We also demonstrate that SIF, when combined with other data, can be used to estimate light-use-efficiency and plant autotrophic respiration. SIF thus opens up an unprecedented opportunity for improved crop monitoring and mechanistic understanding of how crops respond to temperature and other climate drivers.",

            "abstract": "Drought may have severe impacts on many human activities. Understanding its spatio-temporal variations is thus very important in many research fields. On example of the Central Europe dataset we analyzed and compared some products based on drought analyses, which may help to answer important questions for impact studies:\n1) evaluation of the added value coming from inclusion of spatial aspect (not only temporal one) in the drought analysis;\n2) comparison of drought indices calculated from various number of available input meteorological elements (backwards into history less and less meteorological elements are available);\n3) linking together meteorological drought with agriculture one.\nBasis for the study was production of gridded dataset of basic meteorological elements (daily minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, sunshine duration, relative humidity and wind speed). From the station location time series in the period 1961-2013, gridded dataset was created applying geostatistical methods using both spatial and temporal aspects of the data (spacetime package under R). From such gridded dataset, SPEI (standardized precipitation evaporation index) was calculated using various approaches: Thornthwaite (potential evapotranspiration), Hargreaves and Penman-Monteith (reference evapotranspiration). The outputs were gridded datasets of the SPEIs that were then analyzed for the Central Europe both from temporal (based on station data) and spatial aspects. In order to estimate how this meteorological drought analysis may contribute to drought impact analysis (in our case we chose agriculture), we compared the results with the analysis coming from the agrometeorological drought monitoring system (based on SoilClim – dynamical model of soil water content) which is now used for drought monitoring and analysis in the Central Europe. Such comparison is important either for drought analysis in the past (when soil observations are not available) or also for future climate projections (is it sufficient to use only meteorological information if soil information are not available?).",

Global Climate Models (GCMs) are widely used to study the impacts in future, with varied projections/simulations from the entire participating member GCMs. This has urged scientific communities across the world try to improve the understandings of future climate conditions, and reduce the uncertainties associated with them. In the present study, we have used various multi-modelling methods, both deterministic and probabilistic, to reduce the model uncertainties, in historical time period of 1970-2000. The analysis is performed for uncertainty bounds of precipitation and temperature using 10 selected Global Climate Models (GCMs) from Climate Model Inter-comparison project Phase 5 (CMIP5) dataset over 10 sub-basins of Columbia River Basin (CRB). All the multi-modelling methods are applied and evaluated in accordance to their performance indicator using Taylor diagrams on simulating past climate for all 10 sub-basins. The best performing multi-model method, on basis of performance of all the climatic parameters, is chosen for a particular sub-basin and same is used to develop a probable future scenario for the period of 2010-2099. All the analysis and computations are performed on statistically downscaled GCM data to increase the accuracy and better capture the uncertainty bounds on sub-basin scale, as well as enhancing the ability of multi-modeling techniques. All the future time series are used to assess the uncertainties of climatic parameters for climate change analysis. Results have brought insight into each of the multi-modelling techniques i.e. highlighting the pros and cons of all the applied methods. It was also inferred that multi-modelling techniques varied from basin to basin and with different variables, as per their capabilities to capture the observation spread/uncertainty. Eventually, the different ensemble time series for future period provided much better insight of the climate, on sub-basin scale, for Columbia River Basin.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Apollo mission realized the first and only seismic network on the Moon consisting of 4 seismic stations (Apollo 12, 14, 15 and 16). The seismic recording obtained by the network revealed that the most active lunar seismic events occurred in the lunar deep region at about 700 to 1200 km depth, which are called as deep moonquakes (e.g., Nakamura, 2005). The deep moonquakes repeatedly occur at the identical source with lunar tidal period depending on the relative positions of the Moon, the Earth and the Sun (e.g., Lammlein, 1977). On the other hand, the occurrence mechanism of the deep moonquakes is still unclear because we do not yet understand the source parameters such as focal mechanism, seismic moment and source spectrum.\n Yamada et al. (2013) analyzed the seismic data from Apollo 12 station to derive seismic moment distribution for active 15 deep moonquakes and showed that the seismic moments were different source by source. However, we found that the amplitudes of deep moonquakes observed at Apollo 15 and 16 stations cannot be well explained by our seismic moment distribution derived from the Apollo 12 data (Yamada et al., 2014). The higher seismic quality factors of S-wave are required to explain attenuation of amplitude of the deep moonquakes. \n This discrepancy may be also due to assumption of constant radiation pattern (strike dip, slip) in our previous studies. The amplitude of seismic event is determined from seismic moment, radiation pattern and lunar interior structure through which the seismic rays pass. Nakamura (1978) indicated that the radiation pattern varies with time by analyzing of the ratio of amplitudes of the same deep event observed at two stations. In this study, we investigate possible radiation pattern and seismic quality factor and seismic moments so as to explain the amplitude ratios of the same deep event observed at three stations (Apollo12, 15 and 16) and absolute amplitude of the deep events at each station using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo inversion method. We will present these results and discuss the possible source mechanism of the deep moonquakes.",

            "abstract": "Pn is one of the most important seismic phases used for regional-event location, discrimination and yield estimation, yet its amplitude is the most variable among all regional phases. This is due to its acute sensitivity to small-scale uppermost-mantle structure and material-property heterogeneities including the lateral variation of Pn velocity gradient. In order to better model Pn amplitudes to reduce the discrimination uncertainty and yield-estimation error, we are developing region-specific Pn geometric-spreading models for Eurasia based on observed Pn travel times and amplitudes. We first estimate path-specific Pn velocity gradient from Pn travel times and the Regional Seismic Travel Time model (RSTT). We assume that these path-specific gradient values are the average of laterally varying Pn velocity gradient along the paths, and invert the values for a 2D Pn velocity-gradient map through tomography. The gradient map is used to divide Eurasia into sub-regions of different dominant gradients. For each region, we correct observed Pn amplitudes for spreading using a model based on the dominant Pn velocity gradient of that region. The amplitude residuals are then used to estimate an average Pn attenuation for that region. After removing the estimated attenuation effect from the original Pn amplitudes, we fit a region-specific Pn geometric-spreading model to the corrected amplitudes to capture the small-scale Pn velocity-gradient variations. We will use the new region-specific Pn geometric-spreading models for spreading correction in the development of 2D Pn attenuation models, and test the performance of the new models in reducing Pn amplitude variations.",

            "abstract": "A majority of carbon in soil is derived from plant roots, yet roots remain remarkably less explored. Root tissues are abundant in heteropolymers such as suberin, lignin and tannins which are energetically demanding to depolymerize, thus facilitating the accrual of carbon in soil. Most biopolymers are operationally/functionally defined and their function is regulated by the identity of monomers and the linkages connecting these monomers. The structural chemistry of these biopolymers could vary with the environmental conditions experienced during their formative stage thus altering the potential for soil carbon sequestration. We examined the biopolymer composition in the roots of a C3 (Hesperostipa comata) and a C4 (Bouteloua gracilis) grass species exposed to a factorial combination of warming and elevated CO2 at the Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment (PHACE) experiment, Wyoming, USA. The grass roots were subjected to a sequential solvent extraction and base hydrolysis to delineate various operational fractions within the polydisperse matrix. The extracted fractions were analyzed using various chromatography mass spectrometry platforms. Warming and elevated CO2 increased the total suberin content and the amount of ω-hydroxy acids in C4 grass species while in C3 species there was a trend of increasing concentration of α,ω-dioic acids in roots exposed to elevated CO2 compared to ambient CO2 treatment. Our results highlight the effect of warming and elevated CO2 on the chemical composition of heteropolymers in roots that may potentially alter root function and rate of decomposition leading to changes in soil carbon in a future warmer world.",

Long-term streamflow data at 43 USGS sites in the region from Hydro-Climatic Data Network (HCDN) basins that are least distributed by anthropogenic influences are used for evaluation. Parametric and nonparametric hypothesis tests are used to evaluate statistically significant changes in the characteristics of low flows. Individual and combined influences of the oscillations are also evaluated at different sites depending on the availability of lengthy records. Inferences about influences of oscillations on droughts from the results of statistical analysis and possible physical basis explanations are expected outcomes of this study. Evaluation and understanding of changes in frequency and intensity (severity) of droughts and their links to climate variability are critical for basin scale water resources and low flow management in region.",

The odd hydrogen species HOx (primarily OH and HO2), which plays a key role in controlling middle atmospheric ozone, are expected to show distinct variability following the solar cycle. Previous investigations based on total OH abundances from long-term ground-based observation and 5.5 year Aura/Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) OH data and model calculations suggest that the HOx solar cycle variability may dominate the ozone solar cycle variability above 40 km.\nIn the present study, we expand the investigation to both HO2 and OH, as well as the partitioning between them, which is important in the catalytic HOx cycle. With the newly developed MLS offline HO2 product that has significantly improved data quality and better vertical and diurnal coverage, we examine the vertical and latitudinal distribution of the solar cycle signals in HO2 (~10 year data) and compare it with OH. Model simulations using the Caltech/JPL 1-D photochemical model are used to understand the detailed mechanisms controlling the variability in HOx abundances and partitioning. The results of using different solar spectral irradiance (SSI) variabilities in models and the comparison with observations will be discussed.\nIn addition, while the continuous MLS OH data record is only 5.5 year, the MLS THz sub-system was turned back on for a 30-day OH measurement in every August since 2011. Using the most recent version of MLS retrieval software (v4.1x, to be released), some first OH data for selected months will be presented, suggesting reliable quality of the “THz restart” observations and making it promising to combine such OH data with earlier OH data to build a longer-term record.",

            "abstract": "Chlorine concentrations tend to be significantly enriched in surface reservoirs relative to that of the mantle. This large contrast in chlorine contents makes primary asthenospheric melts, highly susceptible to contamination by surficial chlorine in shallow-level crustal environments. Indeed, on the basis of both chlorine abundance systematics [e.g., 1], and chlorine isotopes [2], previous researchers have argued for a surficial chlorine component in controlling the chlorine systematics of MORB. In contrast, other studies suggest recycling of ancient chlorine via a subducted, altered oceanic lithospheric component as a means of controlling the chlorine isotope composition of the mantle [3]. So far, very few high precision chlorine isotope data are available from key oceanic islands, which potentially provide access to deeper parts of the mantle and thus allow for testing of the relative role of these ideas.\nWe report new chlorine isotope (reported as δ37Cl; n=22) and abundance data (SIMS) derived from fresh subglacial glasses from Iceland. The glasses, which cover all the currently active volcanic zones of Iceland, span a wide range in their major element composition with MgO contents between 2.1 and 10.0 wt% and chlorine contents, that vary by almost two orders of magnitude, of 17 to 1270 ppm. Chlorine contents show significant correlations (R2 > 0.9) with incompatible elements such as potassium, consistent with earlier observations from Iceland and the adjacent Reykjanes Ridge [4, 5]. δ37Cl values range from -0.6‰ to +1.4‰. Significantly, δ37Cl values strongly correlate with Cl and MgO contents, with low δ37Cl values in samples with low Cl and high MgO concentrations. The data are consistent with mixing between two different reservoirs: a upper mantle reservoir with low Cl concentration and a slightly negative δ37Cl value and a crustal reservoir with a high Cl concentration and enriched in 37Cl. To further investigate the origin of these chlorine isotope variations, we are currently analyzing a range of other isotopic tracers, including oxygen and radiogenic isotopes.\n[1] Michael & Cornell, JGR, 103, (1998), [2] Bonifacie et al., Science 319, (2008), [3] John et al., EPSL, 298, (2010), [4] Sigvaldason & Óskarsson, GCA, 40, (1976), [5] Unni & Schilling, Nature, 272, (1978).",

            "abstract": "Flooding has the potential to cause significant impacts to economic activities as well as to disrupt or displace populations. Changing climate regimes such as extreme precipitation events increase flood vulnerability and put additional stresses on infrastructure. Potential flooding from just under 100 (2009 NPRI Reviewed Facility Data Release, Environment Canada) toxic tailings ponds located in Canada increase risk to human safety and the environment. One such geotechnical failure spilt billions of litres of toxic tailings into the Fraser River watershed, British Columbia, when a tailings pond dam breach occurred in August 2014. Damaged and washed out roadways cut access to essential services as seen by the extensive floods that occurred in Saskatchewan and Manitoba in July 2014, and in Southern Alberta in 2013. Recovery efforts from events such as these can be lengthy, and have substantial social and economic impacts both in loss of revenue and cost of repair.\nThe objective of this study is to investigate existing conditions in the Elk River watershed and model potential future hydrological changes that can increase flood risk hazards. By analyzing existing hydrology, meteorology, land cover, land use, economic, and settlement patterns a baseline is established for existing conditions in the Elk River watershed. Coupling the Generate Earth Systems Science (GENESYS) high-resolution spatial hydrometeorological model with flood hazard analysis methodology, high-resolution flood vulnerability base line maps are created using historical climate conditions. Further work in 2015 will examine possible impacts for a range of climate change and land use change scenarios to define changes to future flood risk and vulnerability.",

            "abstract": "The hyporheic zone (HZ) is a natural bioreactor within streambed sediments. The dynamic interface of streamwater and groundwater creates a diverse microbial community that has potential to provide substantial contaminant removal. However, insufficient water exchange between the stream and the HZ is often a limiting factor for improved streamwater quality. Modular subsurface hydraulic conductivity (K) modifications with the addition of organic carbon substrates have been proposed as a means to increase hyporheic exchange and enhance natural water treatment via denitrification. Subsurface K modification flow paths are well understood from previous computer modeling and tracer testing studies, but treatment capabilities have yet to be tested in physical systems.\nThis research applied chemical and molecular biological techniques to investigate nitrate removal and microbial community structure in a bench-scale stream simulation with subsurface K and carbon modifications. The system received treated wastewater effluent containing soluble nitrogen primarily in the form of nitrate at concentrations fluctuating from 4-7mg/L. To gain insight into denitrification potential and relative microbial activity along hyporheic flow paths, profiles of nitrate fate, total bacterial presence and the density of the denitrification genes (nirS and nirK) were quantified spatially.\nNitrate tests showed a decrease from ~7mg/L in the influent to less than 1mg/L along hyporheic flowpaths. This was accompanied by an increase in 16S rRNA copies (representative of total bacterial biomass) from approximately 200000 gene copies in the influent zone to 630000 gene copies in the effluent zone. Also, the bacterial communities had a greater presence in the upper 6cm of the sediment layer with nirS amplifying 4-5 cycles earlier than nirK in the PCR analysis. The nirS gene concentration was nearly an order of magnitude greater in the effluent zone than the carbon modified zone, suggesting that leached dissolved organic carbon was fueling the process downstream. Our findings show the value of coupled chemical, hydrological and microbial analyses for the optimization of engineered denitrification zones in HZ systems and could further present monitoring tools for assessing environmental performance in situ.",

            "abstract": "Since the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in 2010, there has been an increased awareness on the need for better collaboration between the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs). Work through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) International Airways Volcano Watch Operations Group (IAVWOPSG) and International Airways Volcano Task Force (IAVTF) brought increased awareness and focus to this challenge. A VAAC Best Practices group was formed out of these larger meetings and focused on VAAC specific issues of importance. Collaboration was one of the topics under consideration.\nSome ideas and procedures for an effective, yet easy, method for the VAACs to collaborate have been discussed. Implementation has been mainly on a VAAC to VAAC basis, however a more consolidated process needs to be developed and agreed upon between all VAACs in order to successfully move toward harmonization.\nCollaboration procedures and tools are being considered. The National Weather Service (NWS) Alaska Region has been looking at collaborative software to help the VAACs identify the presence of ash and forecast the plume both in the horizontal and vertical. Having an interactive graphical interface within the forecast operation may help to ensure consistency across VAAC boundaries. Existing chat software within NWS is being investigated to allow Tokyo and Anchorage VAAC to “chat” about forecast issues in real time. This capability is being tested through scenarios.\nThe Anchorage and Tokyo VAACs participated in a series of meetings in Tokyo in March 2014. Collaboration was a major topic of discussion. This paper will outline some of the efforts being undertaken between the Anchorage and Tokyo VAACs as a result of these meetings and subsequent dialogue.",

However, meteorological data over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are poorly sampled and there are notable disagreements between models in that region. This means that GRACE solutions may be improved with the substitution of atmospheric models over Antarctica and that GRACE data may potentially offer improvements to these models. We use the GRACE K-band range acceleration residuals to explore variations in the gravity field over Antarctica at sub-monthly timescales during 2010, comparing these to surface mass balance and differences in surface pressure between models. We find correlations between pressure differences and accelerations residuals over certain regions in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.",

            "abstract": "In the aftermath of the 2010 Chile and 2011 Japan tsunamis that struck the California coastline, emergency managers requested that the state tsunami program provide more detailed information about the flood potential of distant-source tsunamis well ahead of their arrival time. The main issue is that existing tsunami evacuation plans call for evacuation of the predetermined “worst-case” tsunami evacuation zone (typically at a 30- to 50-foot elevation) during any “Warning” level event; the alternative is to not call an evacuation at all. A solution to provide more detailed information for secondary evacuation zones has been the development of tsunami evacuation “playbooks” to plan for tsunami scenarios of various sizes and source locations. To determine a recommended level of evacuation during a distant-source tsunami, an analytical tool has been developed called the “FASTER” approach, an acronym for factors that influence the tsunami flood hazard for a community: Forecast Amplitude, Storm, Tides, Error in forecast, and the Run-up potential. Within the first couple hours after a tsunami is generated, the National Tsunami Warning Center provides tsunami forecast amplitudes and arrival times for approximately 60 coastal locations in California. At the same time, the regional NOAA Weather Forecast Offices in the state calculate the forecasted coastal storm and tidal conditions that will influence tsunami flooding. Providing added conservatism in calculating tsunami flood potential, we include an error factor of 30% for the forecast amplitude, which is based on observed forecast errors during recent events, and a site specific run-up factor which is calculated from the existing state tsunami modeling database. The factors are added together into a cumulative FASTER flood potential value for the first five hours of tsunami activity and used to select the appropriate tsunami phase evacuation “playbook” which is provided to each coastal community shortly after the forecast is provided.",

Such processes affecting the structural and functional characteristics of ecosystems would harm environmental services that guarantee, for example, the regulation of climate and the provision of fresh water. A survey was organized, through a multidisciplinary perspective, on the main policies and programs that can affect forest cover in the Amazon. These rules and norms seek to regulate societal actions by defining a developmental model for the region. Although deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon have decreased significantly since 2004, some locations maintain high levels of deforestation. In 2013, for example, the municipalities of Monte Alegre, Óbidos, Alenquer, Oriximiná, Curuá and Almeirin, in the northern region of the state of Para, showed the highest rates of deforestation in the Amazon. Managers and stakeholders within these areas are being interviewed to provide insights on how policies are interpreted and applied locally. There is an understanding delay between discourses normalized by federal governmental institutions and claims of local societies. The possible lack of clarity in official discourses added to the absence of a local communicative dynamics cause the phenomenon of incomplete information. Conflicts often occur in local institutional arenas resulting in violence and complex social and historical dissonances, enhanced by other public policies idealized in different temporal and spatial conditions.",

            "abstract": "The observed non-Fickian tailing in solute breakthrough curves is often caused by a multitude of mass transfer\nprocesses taking place over multiple scales. Yet, in some cases it is convenient to fit a transport model with a\nsingle-rate mass transfer coefficient that lumps all the non-Fickian observed behavior. Since mass transfer processes\ntake place at all characteristic times, the single-rate mass transfer coefficient derived from measurements in the\nlaboratory or in the field vary with time, β(t). In this context, we present a mathematical equivalence between the Multi-Rate\nMass Transfer Model (MRMT) and an effective time-dependent single-rate mass transfer model (t-SRMT). In doing this, we provide new\ninsights into the previously observed scale-dependence of mass transfer coefficients. The memory function, g(t),\nwhich is the most salient feature of the MRMT model, determines the influence of the past values of concentrations on\nits present state. We found that the t-SRMT model can also be expressed by means of a memory function\nφ(t,s). In this case though the memory function is non-stationary, meaning that in general it cannot be\nwritten as φ(t-s). Nevertheless, the concentration breakthrough curves obtained using an effective single time-dependent\nrate β(t) is analogous to that of the MRMT model provided that a simple equality holds. This\nrelationship suggests that when the memory function is a power law, g(t)~ t1-m, the equivalent mass transfer\ncoefficient scales as β(t)~ t-1.

Two portable spectrometers, Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Acoustic-Optic Tunable Filter Reflectance Spectroscopy (AOTFRS) were used to differentiate between bacterially influenced and inorganically precipitated calcite specimens from Fort Stanton Cave, NM, USA. LIBS collects light emitted from the decay of excited electrons in a laser ablation plasma; the spectrum is a chemical fingerprint of the analyte. AOTFRS collects light reflected from the surface of a specimen and provides structural information about the material (i.e., the presence of O-H bonds). These orthogonal data sets provide a rigorous method to determine the origin of calcite in cave deposits. This study used a set of 48 calcite samples collected from Fort Stanton cave. Samples were examined in SEM for the presence of biologic markers; these data were used to separate the samples into biologic and non-biologic groups. Spectra were modeled using the multivariate technique Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). Half of the spectra were used to train a PLSR model, in which biologic samples were assigned to the independent variable \"0\" and non-biologic samples were assigned the variable \"1\". Values of the independent variable were calculated for each of the training samples, which were close to 0 for the biologic samples (-0.09 - 0.23) and close to 1 for the non-biologic samples (0.57 - 1.14). A Value of Apparent Distinction (VAD) of 0.55 was used to numerically distinguish between the two groups; any sample with an independent variable value < 0.55 was classified as having a biologic origin; a sample with a value > 0.55 was determined to be non-biologic in origin. After the model was trained, independent variable values for the remaining half of the samples were calculated. Biologic or non-biologic origin was assigned by comparison to the VAD. Using LIBS data alone, the model has a 92% success rate, correctly identifying 23 of 25 samples. Modeling of AOTFRS spectra and the combined LIBS-AOTFRS data set have similar success rates. This study demonstrates that rapid, portable LIBS and AOTFRS instruments can be used to map the spatial distribution of biologic precipitation in caves.",

The 4STAR instrument operated successfully in the SEAC4RS [Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys] experiment in Aug./Sep. 2013 aboard the NASA DC-8 and in the DoE [Department of Energy]-sponsored TCAP [Two Column Aerosol Project, July 2012 & Feb. 2013] experiment aboard the DoE G-1 aircraft. 4STAR provided direct beam measurements of hyperspectral AOD, columnar trace gas retrievals (H2O, O3, NO2), and the first ever airborne hyperspectral sky radiance scans, which can be inverted to yield the same products as AERONET ground-based observations.\nIn this presentation, we provide an overview of the new 4STAR capabilities, with an emphasis on 26 high-quality sky radiance measurements carried out by 4STAR in SEAC4RS. We compare collocated 4STAR and AERONET sky radiances, as well as their retrievals of aerosol microphysical properties for a subset of the available case studies. We summarize the particle property and airmass characterization studies made possible by the combined 4STAR direct beam and sky radiance observations.",

            "abstract": "The Weather Research and Forecasting model and its four-dimensional variational data assimilation system are employed to examine the impact of airborne Doppler radar observations on predicting the genesis of Typhoon Nuri (2008). The ELDORA airborne radar data, collected during the Office of Naval Research–sponsored Tropical Cyclone Structure 2008 field experiment, are used for data assimilation experiments. Two assimilation methods are evaluated and compared, namely, the direct assimilation of radar-measured radial velocity and the assimilation of three-dimensional wind analysis derived from the radar radial velocity. Results show that direct assimilation of radar radial velocity leads to better intensity forecasts, as it enhances the development of convective systems and improves the inner core structure of Nuri, whereas assimilation of the radar-retrieved wind analysis is more beneficial for tracking forecasts, as it results in improved environmental flows. The assimilation of both the radar-retrieved wind and the radial velocity can lead to better forecasts in both intensity and tracking, if the radial velocity observations are assimilated first and the retrieved winds are then assimilated in the same data assimilation window.\nIn addition, experiments with and without radar data assimilation lead to developing and nondeveloping disturbances for Nuri’s genesis in the numerical simulations. The improved initial conditions and forecasts from the data assimilation imply that the enhanced midlevel vortex and moisture conditions are favorable for the development of deep convection in the center of the pouch and eventually contribute to Nuri’s genesis. The improved simulations of the convection and associated environmental conditions produce enhanced upper-level warming in the core region and lead to the drop in sea-level pressure.",

Hydrogeological studies by the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology have assumed that the location at Logan is a pinch-point for the local Gallatin watershed. Shallow groundwater is expected to discharge into the Gallatin river because depth to bedrock near the river is shallow (~5 meters). Groundwater monitoring wells indicate dry Tertiary sediments overlying bedrock, suggesting surface and groundwater systems are disconnected. We deployed shallow seismic refraction, electrical resistivity, spontaneous potential, and electromagnetic surveys to investigate the groundwater system in the study area. Geophysical measurements were preferentially obtained near the Gallatin river and close to shallow monitoring wells. Hand samples of Mississippian aged rocks of the Madison group were collected from local outcrops to help correlate geophysical results with properties of the carbonate rich bedrock. Preliminary interpretations of geophysical data confirm the shallow bedrock and dry sediments encountered in nearby wells. These results suggest that the pinch-point is located upstream or groundwater follows a network of preferential flow paths through limestone bedrock within the study area.",

We present an investigation of the physical differences between oceanic and land lightning. We have deployed a sensitive Low Frequency (1 MHz sampling rate) radio receiver system aboard the NOAA Ronald W. Brown research vessel and have collected thousands of lightning waveforms close to deep oceanic lightning. We analyze the captured waveforms, describe our modeling efforts, and summarize our findings. We model the ground wave (gw) portion of the lightning sferics using a numerical method built on top of the Stanford Full Wave Method (FWM) [Lehtinen and Inan 2008]. The gwFWM technique accounts for propagation over a curved Earth with finite conductivity, and is used to simulate an arbitrary current profile along the lightning channel. We conduct a sensitivity analysis and study the current profiles for land and for oceanic lightning. We find that the effect of ground conductivity is minimal, and that stronger oceanic radio intensity does not result from shorter current rise-time or from faster return stroke propagation speed.",

            "abstract": "The goal of hydraulic fracturing is to increase the permeability of rocks to extract hydrocarbons from “tight” formations. This process stimulates fluid-driven fractures which induce microseismic events. Successfully treating the formations, stimulating large volumes of the reservoir, depends on targeting parts of the formation with more “brittleness”, a property which is frequently characterized from the mechanical properties of the rock. Typically, these properties are constrained using well-logs, vertical seismic profiles and 3-D seismic surveys. Such tools provide a static view of the reservoir on very large or very small scales. While lithology controls the average rock strength within a unit, the content (gas or fluid filled), the shape of the pore space and the concentration of micro-fractures alters the mechanical properties of the reservoir.\n Seismic moment tensor inversion of the events generated during these stimulations reveals that they are significantly non-double-couple, and are described by a tensile angle and a Poisson’s ratio (or, equivalently, ratio of shear to compressional velocities, Vp/Vs) of the rock-fracture system. Following Vavryčuk (2011), the mechanical properties of the reservoir (i.e. Vp/Vs ratio) are estimated as the hydraulic fracture progresses from an extensive catalog of microseismic events spanning magnitudes of -1.5 to 0.8 in the Horn-River Basin, Canada.\n Studying several fracture stages in the reservoir reveals temporal and spatial variations in the rock strength within a unit as hydraulic fracturing proceeds. Initially, the estimated values of Vp/Vs are quite close to those determined from 3-D seismic surveys. As the stage progresses, previously fractured regions have lower Vp/Vs values. At the onset of maximum treating pressure, regions have anomalously high Vp/Vs values, which could reflect short-term local concentrations of high pore pressures or other interactions of the treatment with the formation. The relationship between source parameters and variations in Vp/Vs are also examined. This technique has the potential to provide a unique and dynamic view of variations in the reservoir both spatially and temporally.",

            "abstract": "For the reflection seismic industry on land, source generated seismic surface noise is a main barrier to improving seismic imaging. The industry’s understanding of this noise is poor and its methods for attenuating the surface noise are often ineffective. The approach of collecting massive data redundancy to reduce noise is reaching its limits. This industry needs new approaches to do better.\nTo understand the noise generating processes better, we perform unique 3D acquisition tests that record 2D noise patterns over a wide frequency range. Results show that industry surface noise consists much of forward scattered and back scattered high mode Rayleigh and Love waves and guided waves. Very little energy is low order surface waves direct from the source to the receiver. This implies that 1D models of surface noise are limiting. Moreover, Rayleigh waves and Love waves may be coupled enough that they can’t be treated separately.\nWhile the extensive academic expertise with whole earth surface waves offers significant potential to help industry, the surface noise in industry data appears to be more complex than many whole earth surface wave models. The reason for this difference is that reflection industry frequency ranges are in the 5-60Hz range and that sedimentary areas have strong heterogeneity that affect this frequency range. Review of literature suggests that the upper 100 meters in many areas of industry reflection data is a very strong wave guide that is also laterally heterogeneous. Our 3D acquisition tests support this characterization of the upper 100 meters in sedimentary areas. The model that may best suit industry geology and frequency ranges is that of a “scattering, leaky, near surface wave guide.” These strong velocity variations can provide challenges for 3D wavefield inversion (FWI) methods. We probably need to better understand the model and wave propagation effects of a scattering, leaky, near surface wave guide to significantly improve seismic reflection imaging on land.",

The state of Washington and Oregon contains a tightly coupled forest ecosystem and fire regime. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of future climate changes for large wildfire in the two states. MAXENT algorithm was used to develop a large forest wildfire suitability model using historical fire for the 1971-2000 time period and validated for 1981-2010 time period . Input variables include climate (e.g. July-August temperature) and topographic variables (e.g. elevation). The model test AUC of 0.77±0.1. Using the predicted versus expected curve and methods described by Hirzel and others (Hirzel et al. 2006), we reclassified the model into four classes; low suitability (0-0.36), moderate suitability 0.36-0.5), high suitability (0.5-0.75), and very high suitability (0.75-1.0). To examine the future climate change impact, climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5) from 33 different climate models were used to predict the large wildfire suitability from 1971-2100 using the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) Downscaled Climate Projections (NEX-DCP30) dataset. Results from ensembles of all the climate scenarios showed that the area with high and very high suitability for large wildfire increased under all 4 climate scenarios from 1971 to 2100. However, under RCP 2.6, the area start to decline from 2080 while the other three scenarios keep increasing. On the extreme case of RCP 8.5, very high suitable area increases from less than 1% during 1971-2000 to 14.9% during 2070-2100. Details about temporal patterns for the study area and changes by ecoregions will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic sea ice composition is shifting from predominantly thick perennial ice (multiyear ice –MYI) to thinner, seasonal ice (first year ice –FYI). The effects of the shift on the Arctic ecosystem and macro-organisms of the Arctic Ocean have been the focus of many studies and have also been extensively debated in the public domain. The effect of this shift on the microbial constituents of the Arctic sea ice has been grossly understudied, although it is a vast habitat for a microbial community that plays a key role in the biogeochemical cycles and energy flux of the Arctic Ocean. MYI and FYI differ in many chemical and physical attributes (e.g. bulk salinity, brine volume, thickness and age), therefore comparing and contrasting the structure and composition of microbial communities from both ice types will be crucial to our understanding of the challenges that the Arctic Ocean ecosystem faces as MYI cover continues to decline. Here, we contend that due to the differences in abiotic conditions, differences in bacterial community structure will be greater between samples from different ice types than within samples from the same ice type. We also argue that since FYI is younger, its community structure will be closer to that of the surface sea water (SW). To test this hypotheses, we extracted DNA and used high throughput sequencing to sequence V1-V3 regions of the bacterial 16s rRNA gene from 10 sea ice samples (5 for each ice type) and 4 surface sea water (SW) collected off the shore of Northern Ellesmere Island, NU, CAN, during the month of May from 2010-2012. Our results showed that observed richness was higher in FYI than MYI. FYI and MYI shared 26% and 36% of their observed richness respectively. While FYI shared 23% of its observed richness with SW, MYI only shared 17%. Both ice types showed similar levels of endemism (61% of the observed richness). This high level of endemism results in the grouping of microbial communities from MYI, FYI, and SW to three distinct groups when looking at membership (jclass dissimilarity index, tested by AMOVA). However, when looking at composition (θYC dissimilarity index) while communities from MYI and SW samples still clustered as two distinct groups, communities from FYI samples show no significant clustering (tested by AMOVA).",

This study presents the first detailed data on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations of Black Carbon (BC), ions, and trace metals at Rabigh, Saudi Arabia, and assesses their sources. Results showed several characteristic aspects of air pollution at Rabigh. Daily levels of PM2.5 and BC showed significant temporal variability ranging from 12.2 – 75.9 µg/m3 and 0.39 – 1.31 µg/m3, respectively. More than 90% of the time, the daily PM2.5 exceeded the 24 h WHO guideline of 20 µg/m3. Sulfate, NO3–, and NH4+ dominated the identifiable components. Trace metals with significantly higher concentrations included Si, S, Ca, Al, Fe, Na, Cl, Mg, K, and Ti, with average concentrations of 3.1, 2.2, 1.6, 1.2, 1.1, 0.7, 0.7, 0.5, 0.4 and 0.1 µg/m3, respectively. Based on the Air Quality Index (AQI), there were 44% days of moderate air quality, 33% days of unhealthy air quality for sensitive groups, and 23% days of unhealthy air quality throughout the study period. Two categories of aerosol trace metal sources were defined: anthropogenic (S, V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Cd, Sb, and Pb) and naturally derived elements (Si, Al, and Fe). The extent of anthropogenic contribution was estimated by the degree of enrichment of these elements compared to the crustal composition. Soil resuspension and/or mobilization is an important source of “natural” elements, while “anthropogenic” elements originate primarily from fossil fuel combustion and industries. Ni and V correlated strongly pointing to combustion of heavy fuel oil as the likely source. A positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used to obtain information about possible sources. Our study highlights the need for stringent laws on PM2.5 emission control to protect human health and the environment.",

The first dedicated ground transmission that was detected by RRI was from the Saskatoon Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radar on Nov. 7, 2013 at 14 MHz. Several other passes over the Saskatoon SuperDARN radar have been recorded since then. Ground transmissions have also been observed from other radars, such as the SPEAR, HAARP, and SURA ionospheric heaters. However, the focus of this study will be on the results obtained from the SuperDARN passes. An analysis of the signal recorded by the RRI provides estimates of signal power, Doppler shift, polarization, absolute time delay, differential mode delay, and angle of arrival. By comparing these parameters to similar parameters derived from ray tracing simulations, ionospheric electron density structures may be detected and measured. Further analysis of the results from the other ground transmitters and future SuperDARN passes will be used to refine these results.",

We navigated the tomography through 26 iterations, alternating the inversion sequences between the adjoint-wavefield (AW) method and the more rapidly converging, but more data-intensive, scattering-integral (SI) method. Earthquake source errors were reduced at various stages of the tomographic navigation by inverting the waveform data for the earthquake centroid-moment tensors. All inversions were done on the Mira supercomputer of the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. The resulting model, CVM-S4.26, is consistent with independent observations, such as high-resolution 2D refraction surveys and Bouguer gravity data. Many of the high-contrast features of CVM-S4.26 conform to known fault structures and other geological constraints not applied in the inversions. We have conducted several other validation experiments, including checking the model against a large number (>28,000) of seismograms not used in the inversions. We illustrate this consistency with the excellent fits at low frequencies (≤ 0.2 Hz) to three-component seismograms recorded throughout Southern California from the 17 Mar 2014 Encino (MW4.4) and 29 Mar 2014 La Habra (MW5.1) earthquakes, and we show these fits to be much better than those obtained by two community velocity models in current use, CVM-S4 and CVM-H11.9. We conclude by describing some of the novel features of the CVM-S4.26 model, which include unusual velocity reversals in some regions of the mid-crust.",

The weather conditions are directed related with the crop yield, being a basic parameter for its forecast. The southern region has a subtropical climate and is the major national producer of rice and wheat and also is the second one for soybean, bean and corn. The Eta seasonal forecast model data for southern Brazil was evaluated from 2001 to 2010. Observed data from National and state meteorological agencies were used to evaluate the monthly model performance. The model performance was evaluated by calculating two parameters. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used to evaluate the monthly forecast averages and the observed precipitation standard deviation. The Skill Score Climatology (SSC) was used to compare the accuracy between the forecast and the climatology. The RMSE showed that in some locations the predicted values by the model were closer to the observed. The SSC showed a systematic error for the predicted values by the Eta seasonal model. This behavior indicates that the climatological analysis is more accurate to predict the monthly climate than the ETA model forecast. Also the consecutive negative bias was observed in some locations that can be corrected removing the systematic error.",

            "abstract": "Is the water cycle intensifying in response to global warming due to temperature-driven changes in atmospheric water holding capacity? To address this question, we are developing and testing Water Cycle Intensification Indicator (WCI) to quantify the current and future change in the strength of the water cycle across the conterminous U.S. in support of the National Climate Assessment (NCA). The WCI consists of a suite of primary water cycle trend and extreme composites that are spatially- and temporally-scalable for summarizing how the climate changes results in stronger or more extreme water cycling over the nation. We calculated trend and extreme in water cycle components using NASA-produced data and modeling products. Six water cycle variables are chosen, including precipitation, evaporation, runoff, moisture convergence flux, terrestrial storage and water vapor. Our preliminary results showed that the strength of water cycle depends on specific regions and variables, even different datasets. For instance, precipitation from MERRA-Land offline simulation is consistent with the CPC unified precipitation dataset in showing positive trend over the northeastern, northwestern and west north central, but negative trend over the western and central regions. However, negative trends are observed in MERRA-land over the southern Texas and some parts of the southern coast, contrary to the positive trend revealed by the unified dataset in the same area. Next, we are going to integrate and combine the trends and extremes of these water cycle components to develop a suite of climate indicators to monitor the changes of water cycle as result of climate change. These indicators will be implemented and tested over the nation for further optimization. Moreover, we will also be developing innovative WCI visualization, documentation and distribution methods to disseminate WCI products to the public and stakeholders.",

An L-shaped array consisting of 19-seismometers and having arm lengths of 600m located on Holocene fluvial sediments of the Mississippi River was used to examine wave coherency appropriate for many sites throughout the Mississippi embayment and other sediment sites associate with large rivers. Data from local and regional earthquakes within a distance range of 300km show that coherency within the frequency band of 0.5 to 16 Hz degrades with interstation distance across the array according to an empirical exponential model. Vertical component P-waves are coherent over nearly 2 horizontal wavelengths. However, the coherency for horizontal component S-waves degrades more rapidly than the vertical component P waves. S-waves become significantly incoherent at distances of only 0.2 horizontal wavelength and become completely incoherent after 0.5 wavelength. The results of this study show clear and quick decay of wave coherence likely to occur in strong ground motions from nearby earthquakes. The observed incoherence can be a significant factor for the response of structures having foundation lengths of even 100m for a nearby large magnitude earthquake in New Madrid Seismic Zone.",

            "abstract": "Evaluation of atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land surface models is an important step in identifying deficiencies in Earth system models and developing improved estimates of future change. For the land surface and carbon cycle, the design of an open-source system has been an important objective of the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) project. Here we evaluated CMIP5 and CLM models using a benchmarking system that enables users to specify models, data sets, and scoring systems so that results can be tailored to specific model intercomparison projects. Our scoring system used information from four different aspects of global datasets, including climatological mean spatial patterns, seasonal cycle dynamics, interannual variability, and long-term trends. Variable-to-variable comparisons enable investigation of the mechanistic underpinnings of model behavior, and allow for some control of biases in model drivers. Graphics modules allow users to evaluate model performance at local, regional, and global scales. Use of modular structures makes it relatively easy for users to add new variables, diagnostic metrics, benchmarking datasets, or model simulations. Diagnostic results are automatically organized into HTML files, so users can conveniently share results with colleagues. We used this system to evaluate atmospheric carbon dioxide, burned area, global biomass and soil carbon stocks, net ecosystem exchange, gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, terrestrial water storage, evapotranspiration, and surface radiation from CMIP5 historical and ESM historical simulations. We found that the multi-model mean often performed better than many of the individual models for most variables. We plan to publicly release a stable version of the software during fall of 2014 that has land surface, carbon cycle, hydrology, radiation and energy cycle components.",

We present results using one year of data collected in 2007 and show comparisons of the aerosol radiative property estimates to collocated AERONET retrievals. Use of the recently released MODIS Collection 6 data for aerosol optical depths derived with the dark target and deep blue algorithms has extended the coverage of the multi-sensor estimates towards higher latitudes.\nInitial calculations of seasonal clear-sky aerosol radiative forcing based on our multi-sensor aerosol retrievals compare well with over-ocean and top of the atmosphere IPCC-2007 model-based results, and with more recent assessments in the “Climate Change Science Program Report: Atmospheric Aerosol Properties and Climate Impacts” (2009). For the first time, we present comparisons of our multi-sensor aerosol direct radiative forcing estimates to values derived from a subset of models that participated in the latest AeroCom initiative.\nWe discuss the major challenges that exist in extending our clear-sky results to all-sky conditions. On the basis of comparisons to suborbital measurements, we present some of the limitations of the MODIS and CALIOP retrievals in the presence of adjacent or underlying clouds. Strategies for meeting these challenges are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Biomineral composition reflects a complex interplay between minute-scale biological control, mineral growth processes, and the influence of environmental conditions. For this reason, the mechanisms responsible for the formation of these minerals, as well as the incorporation of trace elements during biomineral growth, are poorly understood. Potential mechanisms governing the production and composition of biominerals can be organized into two distinct groups: a) biological mechanisms controlling the calcifying environment and b) mineral growth processes from this controlled environment. Despite significant advances in both these areas, critical gaps remain in our understanding of biomineral production and geochemical tracer incorporation. We are adapting Atom Probe Tomography (APT), a technique that maps the arrangement and identity of individual atoms within a bulk material, to analyze foraminiferal calcite for the first time. These data-rich atom-scale chemical maps provide a unique opportunity to deconvolve the effects of biological and crystal growth processes in the incorporation of geochemical tracers. \nOur first experiments have examined the influence of the biological-mineral interface on geochemical proxy element incorporation. Preliminary measurements show that (1) we can successfully map impurities in calcite biominerals, while also distinguishing between mineral and organic zones, overcoming a major technical hurdle; and (2) that elements like sodium appear to be recruited to the organic-mineral interface. The high-resolution chemical data from the APT will further allow us to investigate the fundamental basis for geochemical proxy behavior. For example, we can determine for a certain set of conditions whether the substitution of trace elements into the calcite follows ideal solid-solution behavior, as tacitly assumed in many geochemical proxy systems, or is modulated by intra-shell organics, or coupled-substitution interactions. Collectively, the application of APT to biominerals will lead to a mechanistic understanding of the processes controlling proxy behavior, with applications in climate science, geochemistry, and the design of complex biomimetic materials.",

            "abstract": "The equatorial Pacific is the largest open ocean productivity center, responsible for nearly half of global marine new production and about 40% of CaCO3 burial. Understanding how the equatorial Pacific upwelling system has evolved over the Neogene is critical to understand the evolution of the global carbon cycle. We know from reconnaissance studies that productivity in equatorial Pacific surface waters as well as dissolution driven by deep waters have strongly affected the sediment record. We have used calibrated XRF scanning to capture anomalies in equatorial Pacific upwelling and productivity at Milankovitch-resolving resolution since the early Miocene. The 8 elements calibrated in the XRF scans can be used to distinguish intervals of high carbonate dissolution from those of high productivity. Carbonate dissolution intervals are recorded by a drop of CaCO3 relative to Aeolian clays, with little change in the ratio between estimated opal and clay (estimated by TiO2). In contrast, high production intervals have high opal/TiO2 and low CaCO3. Low CaCO3 contents are caused partly by dilution, since high production skews tropical particulate rain to be more opal-rich relative to carbonate, and additional C-org rain can help to increase CaCO3 dissolution within near-surface sediments. We observe long-lived high production anomalies modulated by orbitally-driven climate variability. Prominent intervals are found at the end of the Miocene climate optimum (~ 14 Ma), interspersed with dissolution intervals in the Carbonate Crash interval (~9-11 Ma), and in the Biogenic Bloom interval (8-4.5 Ma). Using relationships among biogenic fluxes in modern equatorial sediment trap studies, especially the positive correlations between biogenic Ba , C-org, and CaCO3 fluxes, we find that the highest production intervals have much higher opal/C-org in the particulate rain, implying an inefficient carbon pump to the deep ocean. If confirmed, productivity was not as strong a feedback to atmospheric CO2 in the Miocene as it is in the Holocene.",

These cycles influence regional ozone and aerosol pollution but remain uncertain. Although nitrogen oxide levels are highest in urban areas, nighttime chemistry is notoriously difficult to study in these regions due to surface level buildup of NO and consequent titration of O3, which suppress nighttime chemical reactions. Tai Mo Shan (TMS) is a high elevation site (950 m) situated between the cities of Hong Kong and Shenzhen, each of which has a population of approximately 7 million. Both lie within the Pearl River Delta, a regional megacity of population 45 million. TMS is ideally suited for the study of nighttime chemistry within a megacity because it is situated within the residual boundary layer at night and is influenced by regional pollution in the absence of strong local effects.\nDuring the fall season, the Pearl River Delta region and Hong Kong experience peak ozone due to meteorological pattern that brings polluted continental outflow over the coastal region of southern China. During November and December 2013, a small-scale field study was conducted at the TMS summit to investigate nighttime chemistry. Chemical instrumentation included cavity ring-down and mass spectrometric instruments for NO3, N2O5 and ClNO2, as well as instrumentation for measurement of NOx, NOy, O3, VOCs, aerosols, other trace gases and meteorological data. Regular late afternoon and evening outflow events from mainland China were observed at this site, including one event with extreme (12 ppbv) levels of N2O5. This presentation will give an overview of the campaign, the atmospheric chemical data and its relationship to meteorological regimes. It will also examine budgets for nighttime production and loss of NO3 and N2O5 and the implications for air quality in this region.",

            "abstract": "The Amundsen Sea, Antarctica, has been known for one of the most susceptible region to the current climate change such as sea ice melting and sea surface temperature change. In the Southern Ocean, a predominant amount of primary production is occurring in the continental shelf region. Phytoplankton blooms take place during the austral summer due to the limited sunlit and sea ice cover. Thus, quantifying the variation of summer season net community production (NCP) in the Amundsen Sea is essential to analyze the influence of climate change to the variation of biogeochemical cycle in the Southern Ocean.\nDuring the past three years of 2011, 2012 and 2014 in austral summer, we have conducted underway observations of ΔO2/Ar and derived NCP of the Amundsen Sea. Despite the importance of NCP for understanding biological carbon cycle of the ocean, the observations are rather limited to see the spatio-temporal variation in the Amundsen Sea. Therefore, we applied self-organizing map (SOM) analysis to expand our observed data sets and estimate the NCP during the summer season.\nSOM analysis, a type of artificial neural network, has been proved to be a useful method for extracting and classifying features in geoscience. In oceanography, SOM has applied for the analysis of various properties of the seawater such as sea surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration, pCO2, and NCP. Especially it is useful to expand a spatial coverage of direct measurements or to estimate properties whose satellite observations are technically or spatially limited.\nIn this study, we estimate summer season NCP and find a variables set which optimally delineates the NCP variation in the Amundsen Sea as well. Moreover, we attempt to analyze the interannual variation of the Amundsen Sea NCP by taking climatological factors into account for the SOM analysis.",

            "abstract": "Despite recent studies demonstrating the importance of rock moisture as a source of water to vegetation, much remains unknown regarding species-specific and seasonal patterns of water uptake in a Mediterranean climate. Here, we use stable isotopes of water (d18O, dD) to define the isotope composition of water throughout the subsurface critical zone of Rivendell, within the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory. We find that a structured heterogeneity of water isotope composition exists in which bulk saprolite is chronically more negative than bulk soil, and tightly held moisture is more negative than the mobile water that recharges the saturated zone and generates runoff. These moisture reservoirs provide a blueprint from which to measure the seasonal uptake patterns of different species collocated on the site. Douglas-firs use unsaturated saprolite and weathered bedrock moisture (i. e. rock moisture) throughout the year. Contrastingly, hardwood species (madrone, live oak, tanoak) modify their source water depending on which moisture is energetically favorable. Hardwoods use freely mobile water in the wet season, and rely on unsaturated zone soil moisture in the dry season. When soil water tension decreases on the drier south-facing slope, hardwood species use saprolite moisture. Although adjacent hardwoods and Douglas-firs partition water based on matric pull on the north side, there is competition for saprolite moisture in late summer on the south side. These results reveal the eco-hydrological importance of moisture derived from weathered bedrock, and show that the hardwoods have a competitive advantage under the drier conditions predicted in many climate models. Finally, the data emphasize that isotope measurements of all subsurface reservoirs and potential water sources are necessary for a complete and accurate characterization of the eco-hydrological processes within the critical zone.",

            "abstract": "In order to better understand the timing of the earliest oxygenation of Earth’s surface environment, we are pursuing a multi-proxy investigation of paleoredox conditions in diamond drill cores through sedimentary rocks of the Archean Fortescue & Hamersley Groups. These cores were recovered in 2012 by the Agouron Institute from the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. The AIDP-2 core samples a stratigraphic succession of carbonate and sulfidic, organic-rich shale in the Carawine Dolomite and Jeerinah Formation representing a shallow near-shore depositional setting. Core AIDP-3 samples a transition from BIF in the Marra Mamba Formation to organic-rich shales in the underlying Jeerinah Formation representing a deeper offshore depositional setting. We have analyzed 322 black shale samples from the Roy Hill Member of the Jeerinah Formation deposited just before the transition from the Fortescue to Hamersley Group. Roy Hill black shale units are mostly pyritic in AIDP-3, but are less so in AIDP-2. The Roy Hill Member of AIDP-3 extends from 2.629 Ga to2.676 Ga and contains the 2.632Ga Jeerinah impact layer, whereas the Roy Hill member of AIDP-2 is slightly older, lying beneath the Jeerinah impact layer, and has been dated to 2.636 Ga to >2.643 Ga [1].\nOur initial findings reveal that Mo concentrations range between 0.7 and 7 ppm in the Roy Hill black shale member of AIDP-2 and AIDP-3. Corresponding Mo/Al ratios range between 1-9×10-5 ppm/ppm, indicating slight Mo enrichment relative to average continental crust. These results are consistent with a previous study by Scott et al. [2], which suggested little or no Mo enrichment. However, the higher resolution sampling in this study allows us to clearly resolve the Mo/Al depth profiles in these late Archean cores. These data suggest that the variations we see are not due to analytical scatter or sample variability, but instead represent real variations in Mo scavenged into these sediments.\nOngoing work is focused on obtaining additional complementary datasets including Fe-speciation, TOC, and traditional and non-traditional isotopes. These data will provide the additional constraints needed to understand the origin and significance of Mo enrichments in these Archean sediments.\n[1] Rasmussen & Fletcher (2010) Geology, 38: 299-302\n[2] Scott et al.

            "abstract": "Carbon cycling among the three major Earth’s pools, i.e., atmosphere, terrestrial systems and oceans, has received increased attention because the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased significantly in recent years reaching concentrations greater than 400 ppm that have never been recorded before, warming the planet and changing the climate. Within the terrestrial system, soil organic matter (SOM) represents an important sub-pool of carbon. The associations of SOM with soil mineral interfaces and particles, creating micro-aggregates, are believed to regulate the bioavailability of the associated organic carbon by protecting it from transformations and mineralization to carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, the molecular scale interactions of different types of SOM with a variety of soil minerals and the controls on the extent and rate of SOM transformation and mineralization are not well documented in the current literature.\nGiven the importance of SOM fate and persistence in soils and the current knowledge gaps, the application of atomistic scale simulations to study SOM/mineral associations in abiotic model systems offers rich territory for original and impactful science. Molecular modeling and simulation of SOM is a burgeoning and challenging avenue for aiding the characterization of these complex compounds and chemical systems and for studying their interactions in self-assembled aggregates composed of different organic matter compounds and with mineral surfaces of different types and common in soils, which are thought to contribute to their reactive properties including recalcitrance potential and resistance to mineralization.\nHere, we will discuss our large-scale molecular dynamics simulation efforts to explore the interaction of proteins  with clay minerals (i.e., phyllosilicates such as kaolinite, smectite and micas), including the potential physical and chemical structural changes of proteins, protein adsorption by polar and permanently charged mineral surfaces and variably charged edges, and the potential role of amphiphilic proteins in providing adsorptive layers for SOM-mineral interfaces.  Our efforts at characterizing these systems through combined modeling and simulation and NMR will also be discussed.",

Two moored buoys in the North Pacific – KEO (32.3°N, 144.6°E) and Papa (50°N, 145°W) - continuously measure solar and longwave radiation and other atmospheric and oceanic variables through two redundant systems. After identifying the primary system and constructing daily clear sky solar and longwave radiation values, the seasonal and regional clouds effects are quantified for the two locations. Situated south of the Kuroshio Extension, significant moisture content variability, associated with the Asian monsoon, affects solar and longwave radiation and cloud effects at KEO. Less seasonal variability is observed at buoy Papa located in the Gulf of Alaska. At KEO, the negative solar radiation cloud forcing outweigh the positive longwave radiation cloud forcing leading to ocean cooling, particularly in the summer. At Papa, the longwave radiation cloud forcing counteracts the solar cloud forcing during the winter, subsequently warming the ocean. The regional and seasonal variability of clouds represents a difficult aspect of climate modeling and an area for further research.",

It is being designed and developed to fly on cubesat platforms. The new instrument will be capable of making measurements of absolute electron density and electron neutral collision frequency at temporal and spatial resolutions not previously attained. A single measurement can be made in a time as short as 50 microseconds, which yields a spatial resolution of 0.35 meters for a satellite orbital velocity of 7 km/s. By averaging over 100 samples we expect an average spatial resolution of 35 meters.\nThe method essentially consists of applying a small amplitude time limited voltage signal into a probe and measuring the resulting current response. The electron resonant frequencies of interest in the ionosphere are between are typically between 100 kHz and 20 MHz, which sets the required bandwidth. The new time domain method will\npresent a significant improvement over the frequency domain method currently in use. The RF impedance probe has a distinct advantage over other methods used to measure plasma properties, in that it's measurements are not strongly affected by spacecraft charging effects that contaminate measurements made in the plasma environment.\nWe will demonstrate the effectiveness of the instrument using data from sounding rocket\nmissions, give details of the new instrument methodology, and suggest some possible areas of application of the method to measuring space plasmas. The difficulties associated with performing the measurements in a cubesat platform, and subsequently interpreting the measurements, will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "Icy and rocky satellites of our solar system display a wide range of structural deformation on their surfaces. Some surfaces are old and heavily cratered showing little evidence for recent tectonism while other surfaces are sparsely cratered and young, with some moons showing geologically very recent or present-day activity. The young deformation can take the form of small cracks in the surface, large double ridges that can extend for thousands of km, and mountain ranges that can reach heights of several kilometers. Many of the potential sources of stress that can deform the surfaces are likely tied to the diurnal tidal deformation of the moons as they orbit their parent planets. Other secular sources of global-scale stress include: volume change induced by the melting or freezing of a subsurface liquid layer, change in the orbital parameters of the moon, or rotation of the outer shell of the satellite relative to the rest of the body (nonsynchronous rotation or true polar wander). We turn to computer modeling to correlate observed structural features to the possible stresses that created them. A variety of modeling programs exist and generally assume a thin ice shell and/or a multi-layered viscoelastic satellite. The program SatStress, which was developed by Zane Crawford and documented by Wahr et al. (2009), computes tidal and nonsynchronous rotation stresses on a satellite. It was later modified into a more user-friendly version with a graphical user interface (SatStress GUI) by Kay and Kattenhorn (2010). This implementation assumes a 4-layer viscoelastic body and is able to calculate stresses resulting from diurnal tides, nonsynchronous rotation, and ice shell thickening. Here we illustrate our recent enhancements to SatStress GUI and compare modeled stresses to example features observed on the surfaces of Ganymede, Europa, and Enceladus.\nKay and Kattenhorn (2010) 41st LPSC, abs # 2046.\nWahr et al.

The current research extends these findings to explore the role of ice-ash hydrometeor aggregation in various plume environments. Laboratory experiments utilizing an ice nucleation chamber allow us to parameterize tephra aggregation rates under the cold (0 to -50 C) conditions prevalent in the upper regions of volcanic plumes. We consider the interaction of ice-coated tephra of variable thickness grown in a controlled environment. The ice-ash hydrometers interact collisionally and the interaction is recorded by a number of instruments, including high speed video to determine if aggregation occurs. The electric charge on individual particles is examined before and after collision to examine the role of electrostatics in the aggregation process and to examine the charge exchange process. We are able to examine how sticking efficiency is related to both the relative abundance of ice on a particle as well as to the magnitude of the charge carried by the hydrometeor. We here present preliminary results of these experiments, the first to constrain aggregation efficiency of ice-ash hydrometeors, a parameter that will allow tephra dispersion models to use near-real-time meteorological data to better forecast particle residence time in the atmosphere.",

We associate area burned from lightning-set wildfires, as registered to the start date of the fires, with the simulated atmospheric circulation and the surface water and energy balances at 50 km over NA and at 15 km for 4 sub-regions of NA. Our 50-km results clearly associate the seasonal cycle and spatial distribution of wildfire in the US and Canada with the seasonal cycle of atmospheric circulation and surface climate, in particular to solar and long-wave radiation and latent and sensible heating. We also use the 50‑km model output to diagnose the within-season temporal and spatial characteristics of wildfire (e.g., the Northern Rockies versus the Boreal forest) and the characteristics of individual fire years. Over the 15-km sub-regions, we use composite anomalies of the surface water and energy balances to differentiate the spatial and temporal controls of high- and low-fire years and to assess the role of interannual variability in the fire record",

            "abstract": "The spatial distribution of naturally occurring, arsenic-bearing minerals in the subsurface is a key factor for determining the fate and transport of arsenic in groundwater systems. However, the direct measurement and estimation of these heterogeneously distributed minerals are often costly and difficult to obtain. While previous studies have shown the utility of using indirect measurements combined with inverse modeling techniques for tomography of physical properties including hydraulic conductivity, these methods have seldom been used to image geochemical properties. In this study, we use synthetic applications to demonstrate the ability of inverse modeling techniques to image reactive mineral lenses in the subsurface and quantify estimation error using indirect, commonly measured groundwater parameters. Specifically, we simulate the mobilization of arsenic via kinetic oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite due to dissolved oxygen in the ambient groundwater. The modeling investigation is carried out at various scales and considers different flow-through domains including (i) a 1D lab-scale column (80 cm), (ii) a 2D lab-scale setup (30 cm x 60 cm) and (iii) a 2D field-scale domain (4 m x 20 m). Next, the simulated dissolved oxygen data and forward reactive transport model are used to image the spatial distribution of arsenopyrite using the Principal Component Geostatistical Approach (PCGA) for inverse modeling. The PCGA is a matrix-free geostatistical inversion approach that uses the leading principal components of the prior information to save computational costs and can be easily linked with any simulation software. Our results show that the PCGA can be used to image randomly distributed arsenopyrite lenses at various scales and has the potential to be employed at the field-scale to map complex distributions of reactive minerals in the subsurface based on the measurement of dissolved constituents in groundwater.",

            "abstract": "The Mexico subduction zone is characterized by both steep and flat subduction, and a volcanic arc that appears to be oblique to the trench. It has excellent seismic data coverage due to the 2005-2007 Middle America Subduction Experiment (MASE) and the permanent Mexican stations. Here, we study the anisotropy of the region using Surface waves, shear-wave splitting measurements, and higher modes. Our goal is to verify and complement the three-dimensional model of shear-wave velocity and anisotropy in the region constructed using Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion measurements (Stubailo et al., JGR, 2012) and constrain the depth of the shear-wave splitting anisotropy with the help of the n1-3 overtones.\nThe 3D model contains lateral variations in shear wave velocity consistent with the presence of flat and steep subduction, as well as variations in azimuthal anisotropy, that suggest a tear between the flat and steep portions of the slab. Shear-wave splitting is effective for studying mantle anisotropy beneath the receivers and has a better lateral resolution than the Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion measurements, although it suffers from a poor depth resolution. To better resolve the anisotropy at depth, we also calculate the anisotropy based on the higher mode surface waves of different overtones for Mexican stations using least-squares fitting of the synthetic higher mode seismograms to the data collected from the deep earthquakes. The three methods allow us to separate the anisotropy and its strength at different depths.\nWe will report on our shear-wave splitting and higher mode results, and their comparison, and present evidence that anisotropy under Mexico is of deep origin.",

            "abstract": "In the recent years, ShakeMap has been extensively used in California for earthquake rapid response. Serving as a backup to the Northern and Southern seismic regions of the California Integrated Seismic Network (CISN), the California Geological Survey (CGS) is running a ShakeMap system configured such that it effectively produces ShakeMaps for earthquakes occurring in both regions. In achieving this goal, CGS has worked to improve the robustness of its ShakeMap system and the quality of its products. Peak ground motion amplitude data are exchanged between the CISN data centers to provide robust generation of ShakeMap. Most exchanged ground motion packets come associated with an earthquake by the authoritative network. However, for ground motion packets that come unassociated, CGS employs an event association scheme to associate them with the corresponding earthquake. The generated ShakeMap products are published to the CGS server which can also be accessed through the CISN website. The backup function is designed to publish ShakeMap products to the USGS NEIC server without collision with the regional networks, only acting in cases where the authoritative region encounters a system failure. Depending on the size, location and significance of the earthquake, review of ShakeMap products by a seismologist may involve changes to ShakeMap parameters from the default. We present an overview of the CGS ShakeMap system and highlight some of the parameters a seismologist may adjust including parameters related to basin effects, directivity effects when finite fault models are available, site corrections, etc. We also analyze the sensitivity and dependence of the ShakeMap intensity and ground motion maps on the number of observed data included in the computation. In light of the available strong motion amplitude data, we attempt to address the question of what constitutes an adequate quality ShakeMap in the tradeoff between rapidity and completeness. We also present a brief comparative study of the available Ground Motion to Intensity Conversion Equations (GMICE) by studying selected earthquakes in California region. Results of these studies can be used as a tool in ShakeMap generation for California earthquakes when the use of non-default parameters is required.",

            "abstract": "The two major challenges for continuum reactive transport models are the treatment of interfaces between different phases (multi-fluids like DNAPL-water, or solid-fluid) and the ability to model transient chemical gradients at the pore-scale. Pore-scale models allow us to deal naturally with chemical gradients at the discrete scale and they generally consider interfaces as boundary conditions that satisfy a local, but modified, mass balance equation. In other word grains do not take part in the mass balance of chemical species besides providing a boundary condition for the fluid. For instance, heterogeneous reactions at solid-fluid boundaries are framed as a balance between incoming chemical flux and reactions. Due to complex topology of interfaces in natural porous media, the treatment of heterogeneous reactions depends on the orientation of the interface and therefore requires a special care. It can become complicated and tedious especially when interfaces are allowed to evolve with time.\nApproaches such as the enthalpy method, which was developed for solving moving interfaces during melting processes, offer the advantage of a treatment that is independent of the shape of the moving interface. Similar methods have been used for modeling multiphase flows with diffuse interface successfully. Here, we expand on these approaches and introduce a phase-field approach to introduce heterogeneous reactions in single and multiphase reactive flows at the pore-scale. Mass conservation is solved in each phase and we introduce interface conditions as a source/sink term in the conservation equation rather than a boundary condition. The advantages are that the method becomes independent of the (time-dependent) topology of the interface and automatically enforces local mass conservation between the different constituents of the domain. We show validations of the model and applications to multispecies reactive transport, isotope fractionation during calcite growth and finally chemical reactions between immiscible fluids.",

The preliminary results of the surface ozone study in urban area of Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil, are presented for the first intensive operating period (IOP1) of the GoAmazon experiment (February/March 2014). Photochemical ozone production was found to be a regular process, with an afternoon maximum of the ozone mixing ratio of lower than 20 ppbv for cloudy days or clear sky weather. Typical ozone concentrations at mid-day were low (about 10 ppb). On the other hand, several high-value ozone episodes with surface ozone mixing ratios up to three times larger were registered during the dry season of 2013 (September/October). At the beginning of the wet season, the ozone concentration in Manaus decreased significantly, but diurnal variations can be found during the days with rainfall and other fast changes of meteorological conditions. Possible explanations of the nature of pulsations are discussed. Photochemical ozone production by local urban plumes of Manaus is named as a first possible source of the ozone concentration and biomass burning or power plant emissions are suggested as an alternative or an additional source.",

Since its launch on October 28, 2011, the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite has been continuously providing data for LST production; intensive validation and calibration of the LST data have been conducted since then. To better monitor the performance of the S-NPP LST product and evaluate different retrieval algorithms for potential improvement, a near-real-time monitoring system has been developed and implemented. The system serves as a tool for both the routine monitoring and the deep-dive researches. It currently consists of two major components: the global cross-satellite LST comparisons between S-NPP/VIIRS and MODIS/AQUA, and the LST validation with respect to in-situ observations from SURFRAD network. Results about cross-satellite comparisons, satellite-in situ LST validation, and evaluation of different retrieval algorithms are routinely generated and published through an FTP server of the system ftp. The results indicate that LST from the S-NPP is comparable to that from MODIS. A few case studies using this tool will be analyzed and presented.",

            "abstract": "North America’s coastal marshes are uniquely vulnerable to sea-level rise (SLR), and coastal subsidence (Torio and Chmura, 2013). While many studies have measured rates of vertical accretion in marshes, none have synthesized accretion rates to report basic summary statistics or make geographical comparisons. In this meta-analysis we synthesized accretion data, and SLR estimates when available, from 75 different sources reporting 704 measures from artificial plots, Cs-137 dates, Pb-210 dates, pollen horizons in sediment cores, and C-14 dates. Accretion generally decreased over longer time spans, likely due to a combination of shallow autocompaction, below ground carbon loss, and the recent acceleration of SLR. Artificial plots had an average time span of ~4 years and had the highest average accretion rate of all methods (7.8±9.9 mm/yr). Cs-137 and Pb-210 dates represented ~30 and ~100 years of accretion respectively, and had relatively moderate rates of accretion, 5.6±3.8 and 4.0±2.5 mm/yr respectively. C-14 dates had the lowest accretion rates (average = 2.5±2.5 mm/yr), and represented the longest records ranging from 206-9000 years. A subset of 15 studies (n=130) reported Cs-137 and tide gauge data in order to calculate accretion relative to eustatic SLR and coastal subsidence/uplift. A cursory analysis of these studies indicates that the subsiding regions of the Gulf Coast are the most vulnerable to SLR, while tectonically uplifting regions of the West Coast are the most resilient. The mapped deficits are overly optimistic as Cs-137 accretion rates do not fully represent net elevation change. Sediment elevation table and modeling data indicate that shallow autocompaction rates range from 1.2-27.8 mm/yr and net elevation gain ranges from -23.4 to 24.9 mm/yr in North America. Despite some methodological inconsistencies, this database indicates that the current relative SLR of ~10 mm/yr is contributing to massive submergence of Gulf Coast marshes. Models predict similar SLR estimates for the rest of the worlds’ coastlines over the next century, indicating the potential for massive coastal marsh loss in North America even where marshes are currently resilient to SLR.\nTorio, D.

For the prediction and mapping of the river flooding, it is necessary to evaluate the spatial distribution of the water (volume) in the river as well as study the interaction between the climatic and hydrological variables. Two study areas have been analyzed; one in Mohawk River, New York and one in Kent, United Kingdom (UK). A high resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the Mohawk River, New York has been used for a GIS flooding simulation to determine the maximum elevation value of the water that cannot continue to be restricted in the trunk stream and as a result flooding in the river may be triggered. The Flooding Trigger Level (FTL) is determined by incremental volumetric and surface calculations from Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) with the use of GIS software and LiDAR data. The prediction of flooding in the river can also be improved by the statistical analysis of the hydrological and climatic variables in Mohawk River and Kent, UK. A methodology of time series analysis has been applied for the decomposition of the hydrological (water flow and ground water data) and climatic data in both locations. The KZ (Kolmogorov-Zurbenko) filter is used for the decomposition of the time series into the long, seasonal, and short term components. The explanation of the long term component of the water flow using the climatic variables has been improved up to 90% for both locations. Similar analysis has been performed for the prediction of the seasonal and short term component. This methodology can be applied for flooding of the rivers in multiple sites.",

            "abstract": "High rates of atmospheric deposition of mercury (Hg) in the northern Appalachian Mountain region of the eastern United States have led to an accumulation of anthropogenic Hg in soils and the aquatic food chain. Much concern is focused on methyl mercury (MeHg) in surface waters as it is the most bioavailable species. The bacterial transformation of organic Hg to MeHg has been suggested to increase when oxidized soils or sediments become reduced, such as during flooding. The refilling of a Northern Appalachian impoundment has been tracked in this study in order to examine a potential increase in methylation rate. The sediments in this 0.29 km2 constructed impoundment lay dry for 6 years before dam reconstruction allowed refilling. Since being drained, redox concentration and depletion colors have appeared in the formerly gley sediments suggesting intense oxidation/reduction events. Dry sediment (soil order Entisols) Hg concentrations were typically highest in the upper horizon of the sediments and coincided with the highest concentrations of organic carbon. The ratio of MeHg to total Hg (THg) in the soils/sediments was used as an indicator of methylation rate. The highest ratio of MeHg/THg before the refilling were found in the deepest part of the former lake, were the sediments still periodically held rainwater. The sediments will be sampled again in late summer 2014 to evaluate the change in methylation rate with lake refilling. A potential change in stream water MeHg concentration in the outflow versus inflow determines if the restored lake may act as a source of MeHg to downstream environments. Results from this sampling of post-refilling water and sediments will be evaluated during the fall.",

            "abstract": "We have developed an improved algorithm for the retrieval of glyoxal (CHOCHO) from OMI. Glyoxal is a short-lived product of volatile organic carbon (VOC) oxidation. Satellite glyoxal observations may provide a powerful addition to existing formaldehyde products for constraining VOC emissions. However, glyoxal-to-formaldehyde ratios of current retrievals disagree with ground-based observations over anthropogenic and biogenic regions, inhibiting their combined use in top-down studies. To address these discrepancies we perform a series of sensitivity studies on real and simulated OMI spectra. We show that the sensitive fit window dependence found in previous studies is consistent with a combination of errors from reference cross section uncertainties and spectral interference due to the Ring effect. This implies an optimal fit window of 435-461 nm, consistent with previous retrievals. Using simulated spectra we confirm a NO2 interference associated with cross section temperature, that can be corrected using multiple cross sections. We show that cross-track biases in the OMI retrieval can be corrected by deriving offsets over the Sahara, and apply the correction to the OMI data. Average background concentrations are lower in the new product since the Sahara reference sector is free of liquid water interference associated with the oceanic regions used in previous studies. Concentrations measured over Asia during the monsoon season and the tropics are also lower, suggesting that the new retrieval is less sensitive to water vapor abundance. Consequently we do not see significant enhancements over tropical oceans. The glyoxal-to-formaldehyde ratios of the new OMI product are consistent with surface observations.",

            "abstract": "A large wetland and floodplain complex adjacent to the Snake River in southeastern Idaho, USA, encompasses numerous spring-fed creeks that originate on the floodplain and discharge at their confluence with the Snake River and American Falls Reservoir. Resource managers are implementing a program to restore these spring creeks for the recovery of Yellowstone cutthroat trout and ecosystem health. Our objectives were to evaluate the physical characteristics of these spring creeks, develop a conceptual model of their geomorphic function, compare the restoration potential of individual reaches, and communicate our findings to a broad audience of resource managers and regional stakeholders in order to foster restoration planning. A geomorphic assessment along 38 km of three spring creeks was completed by collecting data at several transects within distinct geomorphic reaches, and by collecting data continuously throughout all reaches. These data were summarized in a GIS database and used to quantify the overall geomorphic functioning of each reach. The geomorphic functional scores were scaled from 0% (non-functional) to 100% (fully functional). Among all three spring creeks, geomorphic function ranged from 29% to 63%, with bank conditions and riparian vegetation being the primary causes of overall channel degradation. Results from the geomorphic assessment fostered the development of a conceptual model for spring creek function, whereby degraded bank conditions represent the primary controlling factor of decreased geomorphic function and fish habitat quality. The reach-based geomorphic functional scoring provides an indicator of relative restoration potential for each reach, and is one of the factors used in determining site-specific priorities for protecting, enhancing, and restoring spring creeks on the Fort Hall Bottoms. The study results, conceptual model and restoration strategy were communicated to resource managers and regional stakeholders through a graphically-rich, large format atlas document. Presentation of hard copy and electronic versions of maps and infographics fostered a high level of engagement among those interested in restoring these spring creek systems.",

            "abstract": "Through education and leadership development, Alliance for Climate Education (ACE) is building a generation of confident and capable youth driving climate solutions now throughout their lives. In 2011-12, a random sample of 2,800 high school students across the country was surveyed before and after seeing the ACE Assembly on climate science and solutions. The survey showed that the ACE Assembly resulted in a 27% increase in climate science knowledge scores, with 59% of students increasing their intentions to take action on climate and a doubling of the number of students talking to parents and peers about climate change. Students were also compared to the Global Warming’s Six Americas classification of Americans’ views on climate. Following the ACE Assembly, 60% of students were alarmed or concerned about climate change.\nBuilding off these results, in 2014 ACE began to assess the results of its leadership development program that follows the ACE Assembly. The goal of this survey project is to measure ACE’s long-term impact on students’ college and career pathways, civic engagement and climate action. Preliminary results show that a majority of students in ACE’s leadership development program are alarmed about global warming and are having conversations about global warming. A majority of these students also feel confident in their ability to lead a climate-related campaign in their school and community. These students will continue to be surveyed through 2015.",

            "abstract": "The Needles District of Canyonlands, Utah contains a coupled array of extensional faults, salt diapirs and an elongate anticline produced by gravitational stresses associated with erosion and canyon cutting along the Colorado River and its tributaries. Three-dimensional numerical models using high-resolution topography have been produced using FLAC3D to test how plastic flow of evaporites and brittle extension of overburden are coupled during deformation and how they combine to form salt structures in the region. High resolution (50 m DEM) topographic models were built of the Needles District and of the region to the southwest of the Needles containing the Imperial Valley fault. The overburden in these models was described by a strain-softening Mohr-Coulomb rheology and is 400 m thick from the surface to the base of the Colorado River canyon. It overlays a flat, 340 m thick, viscous layer representing the salt, which outcrops in the Colorado river downstream of the grabens. The Needles District is dominated by horst and graben structures which extend updip from the Colorado River to the southeast. In models of the Needles, lateral displacement is dominantly to the northwest, toward the river canyon with the most displacement occurring in regions containing side canyons. In the canyon, salt flows upward to form an anticline that follows the sinuosity of the river, and diapirs appear adjacent to side canyons or where the canyon widens, which is observed in the field and the models. Without a salt layer, models show much smaller displacement rates that vary from northwest to southeast demonstrating the importance of a flat lying salt layer in propagating deformation toward the river. The region to the southwest is an area of broader subsidence bounded by a major fault (Imperial Valley fault) with fewer developed extensional faults near the river canyon. The Imperial Valley fault model shows similar patterns in which deformation is driven perpendicular to the river canyon. However, the sinuosity of the river and side canyons cause displacement direction to shift from north to west. High resolution topographic models demonstrate the sensitivity of salt deformation to topography, influencing both flow direction and displacement rates.",

            "abstract": "In many regulated rivers throughout the western United States, deliberate management of water temperature below reservoirs is crucial to the survival of endangered salmonids. However, management options at reservoirs are often limited to adjusting either the flow volume and/or release temperature to alter the downstream water temperature. Here we investigate the efficacy of this approach in three major regulated rivers in California: the Sacramento River, the Klamath River, and the St. Ynez River. We use a 1-dimensional water temperature model (RAFT) to compute heat fluxes to/from the river based on meteorological conditions, channel bathymetry, and reservoir releases. A sensitivity analysis evaluates the thermal response of the river to reservoir releases during summertime flow conditions. Results indicate that the water temperature dynamics downstream of reservoirs vary between rivers. Although both the Sacramento and Klamath Rivers exhibit cooling in response to increased flows, the Sacramento River is cooled more effectively by decreasing the release temperature. In contrast, increased flow rate in the St. Ynez River does not as strongly influence downstream temperatures due to shallower flows combined with significant thermal buffering already provided by deep alluvial streambed.",

            "abstract": "The topside ionosphere is highly variable and is known to correlate on long time scales with the F10.7 flux, a common proxy for the solar EUV radiation. However, it is not generally known which EUV wavelength bands contribute most to the ionization, and most models use the proxy rather than incorporating real solar EUV data on a wavelength-by-wavelength basis. In addition, the ion density signal is modulated by a seasonal oscillation due to the changing solar zenith angle (SZA) which is more dramatic at high latitudes. We have used empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to explore the variability in the topside ionosphere. We found that the first principal component correlates strongly with solar EUV, and the second principal component correlates with a seasonal oscillation due to the SZA, indicating that these two variables explain most of the variance. We use EOFs to remove the SZA oscillation in order to begin to investigate the response of the topside ionosphere to the solar EUV on a wavelength-by-wavelength basis.",

            "abstract": "Organic wastes, in particular fecal material, are qualified as one of the major causes of water quality deterioration. Their accumulation in water bodies may increase algal proliferation and eutrophication and the number of pathogenic organisms, which are responsible for many intestinal diseases especially when the water is used for recreational activities and/or as a supply for drinking water. In order to estimate the risk level associated with primary body contact in recreational water bodies, enumeration of some specific micro-organisms, such as Enterococci and Escherichia coli, are commonly used. Sterol distributions can provide some relevant information on the origin of fecal material in water system, since they are ubiquitous organic compounds and their distributions in many warm-blooded animal feces can be used as evidence for their source. In this study, we monitored fecal material contamination in three Oklahoma watersheds based on sterol fingerprints over a one-year period (2012 ~ 2013).\nThe sterols from sediments and water samples (sterols associated to suspended particles as well as free sterols in water) were recovered using sonication and solid phase extraction (SPE), respectively, using different organic solvents. They were then identified and quantified by gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using an internal standard. The GC-MS was previously calibrated with a sterol mixture injected at different concentrations.\nOur primary results show that the concentration of total sterols generally increases from the Upper Canadian < Neosho Grand < Cimarron – Upper Arkansas Basins in Oklahoma. The fecal sterols commonly represent a small proportion (<15%) within the total sterols quantified in these three basins. Their distributions show a significant contribution from herbivore feces. By means of this monitoring, we are able to determine the presence of fecal contamination and provide a better understanding on the ability of using sterol fingerprints to determine the origin of the fecal contamination. Additionally, such a sampling strategy, over a one-year period at regular intervals, enable us to track the water contamination by feces according to the seasonal climatic variations such as drought or heavy rainfall events.",

The long axis of the ~4 km by ~1.5 km oval shaped subsiding region coincides with the strike of the predominant normal fault system at Brady. Within this bowl of subsidence, the interference pattern shows several smaller features with length scales of the order of ~1 km. These smaller features are spatially associated with the intersections and overlaps of some of the mapped fault segments. This type of signature occurs consistently in all of the well-correlated interferometric pairs spanning several months. To model the deformation, we explore several different observable quantities, including the spatial derivative of the range change (dimensionless), and the (unwrapped) range change (in mm). The results from inverse modeling suggest that the deformation is a result of compaction associated with a decline in pore-fluid pressure. This phenomenon occurs in shallow lithologic units and/or highly damaged regions where fault segments mechanically interact. Such damaged zones are expected to be vertically extensive along the faults, providing a high permeability conduit to the deep reservoir tapped by production wells. Using time series analysis, we test the hypothesis that changes in the net rate of geothermal production drive the observed deformation.",

            "abstract": "The Valley of Fire State Park, 60 km NE of Las Vegas, is a beacon of knowledge for deformation of Aztec Sandstone, a cross-bedded quartz arenite deposited in the Aztec-Navajo-Nugget erg in early Jurassic. It displays great diversity of physical properties, different localization types and micromechanics. The two deformation episodes, the Sevier folding & thrusting and the Basin & Range extension affected the area. The appearance of compaction bands marks the earliest deformation structure and their distribution, orientation, and dimension are controlled by the depositional architecture and loading. The earliest shear structures in the area are the Muddy Mountain, Summit, and Willow Tank thrusts and numerous small-scale bed-parallel faults. They altogether produced several kilometers of E-SE transport and shortening in the late Cretaceous and display numerous shear bands in its damage zone within the Aztec Sandstone. Shear bands also occur along dune boundaries and cross-bed interfaces. These observations indicate that the early deformation of the sandstone was accommodated by strain localization with various kinematics.\nThe younger generation of faults in the area is of mid-Miocene age, and crops out pervasively. It includes a series of small offset normal faults (less than a few ten meters) which can be identified at steep cliff faces. These faults are highly segmented and are surrounded by a dense population of splay fractures. A large number of these splays were later sheared sequentially resulting in a well-defined network of left- and right-lateral strike-slip faults with slip magnitudes up to a few kilometers in the Park. The formation mechanisms of both the normal and strike-slip faults can be characterized as the sliding along planes of initial weaknesses and the accompanying cataclastic deformation. Some of the initial weak planes are associated with the depositional elements such as interdune boundaries and cross-bed interfaces while others are joint zones apparently not physically connected to any observable normal fault or dune boundary fault, but consistent with the earlier extension direction. The specific kinematics of this latter period of faulting is thought to be dictated by the orientation of the depositional and structural weaknesses and the orientation and rotation of the driving stresses.",

            "abstract": "The idea of considering the “end user perspective” regarding storm activity and objective tracking methods used to compile information on their behaviour is particularly important in the Alaskan region. Annually, coastal regions in the North are exposed to stormy conditions, though most impacts occur during periods where multiple storms track over the same area in a short period of time (serial cyclones) or where strong storms occur without the presence of a protective sea ice buffer. From a fixed perspective (i.e. Eulerian), a storm may be identified more by the impacts that it generates at that location (winds, sea state, erosion). From a Lagrangian (tracking) view, the intensity, duration, and characteristics of the synoptic environment may prove more relevant for understanding. The overall “effectiveness” of an objective tracking method depends on the intended use of the provided information. While pitting different methods against each other is not necessarily a fruitful exercise (Mesquita et al. 2009), the reality is that one method may better reflect the reality of storm activity and impacts to those experiencing the weather first hand.\nOne of the more subtle points in extra-tropical cyclone tracking and comparison work is the method by which a storm is defined. Most cyclones are analyzed on MSLP fields; others define a cyclone by relative vorticity (ζ) maxima at 850 hPa (NH) and minima (SH). Storms can also be defined by wind events, or even impacts, at a location. Using counts of strong wind events at a grid point or location can account for pressure gradients both associated with storms and absent of a synoptic event.\nThree separate tracking algorithms are analyzed to determine the method most likely to produce a long-term homogeneous dataset that can be used to train a statistical seasonal prediction method. These methods include the Serreze algorithm, Hodges TRACK algorithm, and Atkinson algorithm. Both the Serreze and Hodges methods provide a tracking perspective while the Atkinson algorithm provides a Eulerian view using wind speed returns at grid points throughout the study area. Unique to this study is a view of how all three methods perform during strong storms (such as the 2004 Nome, AK storm) and weaker events where wind events are still triggered.",

            "abstract": "Human activities has tranformed the Earth's surface in complex ways. Here we show that not only land cover change, but also the management intensity, namely the intensification of agriculture through the Green Revolution has had a profound impact on the carbon cycle. A long-standing puzzle in the global carbon cycle is the increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2. This increase likely reflects enhanced biological activity in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). It has been hypothesized that vegetation growth may have been stimulated by higher concentrations of CO2 as well as warming in recent decades, but the role of such specific mechanisms has not been quantified and they have been unable to explain the full range and magnitude of observations. Here we suggest another potential driver of the increased seasonal amplitude: the intensification of agriculture from the Green Revolution to feed a rising population, that led to a 3-fold increase in world crop production over the last 5 decades. Our analysis of CO2 data and atmospheric inversions shows a robust 15% long-term increase in CO2 seasonal amplitude from 1961 to 2010 that is punctuated by large decadal and interannual variations. The three pillars of the Green Revolution, consisting of high yield cultivars, fertilizer use, and irrigation, are represented in a terrestrial carbon cycle model. The results reveal that the long-term increase in CO2 seasonal amplitude arises from two major regions in the NH: the mid-latitude cropland between 25N-60N that encompasses the world’s major agriculture zones in Asia, Europe and North America, and the high-latitude natural vegetation between 50N-70N that includes much of the Northern boreal forests, tundra and some deciduous forests. The long-term trend of seasonal amplitude is 0.3% per year, of which sensitivity experiments attribute 43% to land use change, 31% to climate variability and change, and 26% to CO2 fertilization. Our results suggest that human land use and management is a key driver in the changing seasonal ‘breathing’ of the biosphere as well as the long-term carbon sink. Research priorities thus need to balance the studies of both the natural systems and human system, and importantly the interplay between them.",

            "abstract": "While magnetically conjugate observations by ground-based magnetometers are available at both high and low magnetic latitudes, few have been established at auroral latitudes to monitor the hemispheric asymmetry of auroral electric currents and its impact to geospace dynamics. Due to the limitations of global land areas, the only regions where conjugate ground-based magnetic observations can cover the full range of auroral latitudes are between Quebec, Canada and West Antarctica. Funded by the Canadian Space Agency, the AUTUMNX project is currently emplacing 10 ground-based magnetometers in Quebec, Canada, and will provide the magnetic field observations in the Northern Hemisphere. The proposed U.S. Polar Region Interhemispheric Magnetic Observatories (PRIMO) project plans to establish six new ground-based magnetometers in West Antarctica at L-values between 3.9 and 10.1. The instrument is based on the new low-power fluxgate magnetometer system recently developed at UCLA for operation in the polar environments. The PRIMO magnetometers will operate on the power and communications platform well proven by the POLENET project, and the six PRIMO systems will co-locate with existing ANET stations in the region for synergy in logistic support. Focusing on the American longitudinal sector and leveraging infrastructure through international collaborations, PRIMO and AUTUMNX can monitor the intensity and location of auroral electrojets in both hemispheres simultaneously, enabling the first systematic interhemispheric magnetic observations at auroral latitudes.",

            "abstract": "Cosmic dust enters the mesosphere/lower thermosphere and ablates into a hot gas which later condenses into meteoritic smoke, leaving behind some atomic potassium in the gas phase. In this paper we report the observation of day airglow from atomic K from the RAIDS on ISS and OSIRIS on ODIN satellite instruments. This atomic potassium has also been measured extensively with potassium lidars at several sites. The atomic potassium reacts with ozone to form potassium oxide, KO. The KO reacts with atomic oxygen to recycle the atomic K. This balance between production and loss leads to a dominant concentration of K. The resonance scattering of sunlight by K leads to a chemi-luminescent airglow emission which has been previously noted by the authors, Llewellyn and Evans, from their OSIRIS spectrograph on the ODIN satellite. The intensity of this airglow emission from K is proportional to the product of the atomic K concentration and the resonance scattering coefficient (g-factor). Since the rate of reaction for the reaction of KO with atomic oxygen is also in equilibrium with rate of reaction of K with ozone, the day airglow intensity can be used to derive the ground state K density if the atomic oxygen concentrations are available. The atomic oxygen can be derived from other airglow emissions, particularly the A band of O2 which is also observed simultaneously by the OSIRIS instrument. The concentration profile of K is derived from the altitude profile of the dayglow emission of potassium at 766.5 nm. The observed volume emission dayglow altitude profile will be compared with model calculations by the authors. The RAIDS ISS profile is peaked at 100 km level and extends up to 160 km. The profile has been simultaneously observed in the 766.5 and the 769.9 nm lines. Since this is the first measurement of the altitude profile of dayglow K emission, it can be compared with extensive historic ground based measurements of K twilight emission taken at Saskatoon in the 60s by Sullivan and Hunten (CJP; 1964 doi10.1139/p64-087).",

One way this ocean-atmosphere relationship can be tested is by reconstructing upper equatorial Pacific Ocean conditions during the Pliocene—a time period when greenhouse gases were as high as today. To date, most studies use sea surface temperature (SST) proxies in sediments to reconstruct Pliocene ocean conditions, but contradicting results have highlighted the possible short-comings and limitations of this approach. Here, we bypass this controversy by using measurements of the modern and Pliocene equatorial Pacific to link surface nutrient variability to upper ocean variability. This alternate reconstruction suggests there was no change in the mean state of nutrients since the late Pliocene and we explore this surprising result by discussing potential changes in the thermocline / nutricline relationship.",

            "abstract": "Understanding plate boundary behaviour is a major objective in seismotectonics to better understand and mitigate seismic hazards. Field- and light detection and ranging (lidar)-derived topographic mapping, geological characterisation, and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of on-fault sediments were used to better constrain rangefront deformation of the Southern Alps at the Alpine Fault near the Whataroa River. The Alpine Fault, which forms the plate boundary in the South Island of New Zealand, is thought to rupture in large to great earthquakes (most recently in 1717 AD). Here the fault is dextral-reverse, although primarily strike-slip with clear fault traces cutting across older surfaces of varying elevations and ages. Deformational bulges are observed along these traces that are likely thrust-bounded. A terrace of Whataroa River sediments on the hanging wall of the fault approximately ~ 55-75 m (when considering uncertainties) above the floodplain of the Whataroa. OSL ages for hanging wall sediments of ~ 11 ka in this terrace, ~ 2.8 ka for Whataroa River terrace deposits in a deformational bulge, and ~ 11.1 ka for a rangefront-derived fan and aggradation along the rangefront and Holocene hanging wall uplift rates of ~6.0 + or - 1 mm/yr at the fault. These Whataroa River-sourced terrace deposits suggest that the adjacent bounding faults are steeply-dipping, with no geometries in the shallow subsurface that would tend to cause rotation and tilting. Because GPS-derived “interseismic” vertical uplift rates are < 1 mm/yr here, the majority of rock uplift at the rangefront happens during episodic major Alpine Fault earthquakes. Additionally, our recent data on fault behaviour based on mapping and field measurements indicate that the fault may not exhibit characteristic rupture behaviour. We suggest instead ‘bimodal behavior’ where the AF exhibits both ‘partial’ (rupture length <300 km; moment magnitude, Mw, 6.5 to 7.8) and ‘full’ (rupture length ≥300 km; Mw ≥ 7.9) ruptures. This further questions the validity of the characteristic earthquake model for seismic hazard assessments. Finally, we present a appraisal of the active South Westland Fault Zone, including new outcrop mapping that demonstrates other important sources of seismic hazard exist near this plate boundary.",

            "abstract": "Coal mining in Svalbard has been ongoing since the early 1900’s. In this study, spectral reflectance of undisturbed seasonal surface snow near an active coal mine closest to the largest settlement of Longyearbyen (78.2° N) with refractory black carbon (rBC) up to 345 ppb are compared to a non-contaminated pristine site at Woodfjorden (79.5 ° N) near the northern end of Svalbard with rBC ~1 ppb. Dissolved black carbon (DBC) measurements are also assessed as carbon passing through a 0.7 um filter and vary from 1 to 75 ppb. Reflectance spectra decreased dramatically across all wavelengths up to 1400 nm with increasing black carbon and the reflectance spectra did not converge at infrared wavelengths. At the most contaminated site with rBC of 345 ppb and DBC of 75 ppb, absolute reflectance was much lower than previously published results with values between 10 and 20% in blue wavelengths. This indicates the potential impact of BC on natural long-term contaminated snow spectra subject to melt and refreezing and the possibility to serve as a natural end member for global remote sensing studies. These results are also significant because there is increasing pressure being put on Arctic communities to increase mining exploration. Additionally, diminishing sea-ice resulting in increased shipping traffic will also contribute to BC impacts in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "In the US, the forecasting approach used by the NWS River Forecast Centers and other regional organizations such as the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) or Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has traditionally involved manual model input and state modifications made by forecasters in real-time. This process is time consuming and requires expert knowledge and experience. The benefits of automated data assimilation (DA) as a strategy for avoiding manual modification approaches have been demonstrated in research studies (eg. Seo et al., 2009).\nThis study explores the usage of various ensemble DA algorithms within the operational platform used by TVA. The final goal is to identify a DA algorithm that will guide the manual modification process used by TVA forecasters and realize considerable time gains (without loss of quality or even enhance the quality) within the forecast process.\nWe evaluate the usability of various popular algorithms for DA that have been applied on a limited basis for operational hydrology. To this end, Delft-FEWS was wrapped (via piwebservice) in OpenDA to enable execution of FEWS workflows (and the chained models within these workflows, including SACSMA, UNITHG and LAGK) in a DA framework. Within OpenDA, several filter methods are available. We considered 4 algorithms: particle filter (RRF), Ensemble Kalman Filter and Asynchronous Ensemble Kalman and Particle filter. Retrospective simulation results for one location and algorithm (AEnKF) are illustrated in Figure 1. The initial results are promising. We will present verification results for these methods (and possible more) for a variety of sub basins in the Tennessee River basin. Finally, we will offer recommendations for guided DA based on our results.\n",

These systems account for over 90% of the poleward transport of water vapor in mid-latitudes and thus are a key mechanism in help establish the water and energy cycles of the planet. Many of the intense wintertime hydrological (flood and drought-ending precipitation) events in the US western states (as well as in other continents) occur in conjunction with land-falling AR events. Despite the important role of the ARs in our climate and weather systems, there have been few broad characterizations of model performance of ARs for global weather and climate models (GCMs), in terms of their role in global climate or impacts associated with extreme weather. Part of the challenge has been the lack of a comprehensive set of observation-based model simulation diagnostics and performance metrics. Based on the objectives and support from three activities: 1) the CalWater 2 AR project, 2) the Year of Tropical Convection (YOTC) and GEWEX Atmospheric System Study (GASS) multi-model experiment on Vertical Structure and Physical Processes of Weather & Climate, and 3) a new NASA effort examining the value added by dynamic regional climate model (RCM) downscaling, we are working to develop a comprehensive set of AR simulation diagnostics and model performance metrics for RCMs and GCMs. Application of these diagnostics and metrics will afford: 1) a baseline characterization of model representations of synoptic features, impacts, and multi-scale interactions, 2) an ability to guide model development and assess proposed improvements, 3) quantify the evolution in forecast skill, as well as 4) estimate predictability of AR characteristics and impacts. The purpose of this presentation is to initiate a more formal dialogue of this activity with the community, present a preliminary set of diagnostics/metrics and illustrate their utility through application to the 27 GCMs that contributed simulations to the YOTC/GASS multi-model experiment highlighted above.",

            "abstract": "Environmental changes in time and across space are multivariate, thus understanding the drivers of biotic responses to paleoclimate events requires the incorporation of multiple proxies and selection of the variables most associated with the biotic patterns. Here, two case studies, one examining paleoecological change leading into the Early Miocene warming and one examining global diversity patterns in modern bivalves, illustrate the utility of multivariate data sets for understanding biotic patterns.\nWe create a multivariate time series of benthic foraminiferal faunal composition and environmental variables (δ13C, Δδ13C, δ18O, δ15N, sediment grain size) from the Early Miocene Astoria Formation spanning ~18-20 mya. We then use multivariate statistics and maximum likelihood model selection to disentangle the potential drivers of the faunal changes. We find that d15N values and age are the most parsimonious correlates with major changes in foraminiferal composition, suggesting oxygenation is primarily affecting the foraminiferal community. Failure to include δ15N in the analysis still yields significant and supported relationships with Δδ13C, which would lead to the incorrect interpretation that the benthic foraminifera are responding primarily to organic carbon flux rather than oxygenation.\nSimilarly, we examine the environmental factors associated with global diversity patterns. Using occurrence data for modern bivalves and a multivariate oceanographic data set, we identify the modern environmental factors most associated with diversity. However, inclusion of spatial variables in addition to environmental variables in the analysis reveals a well-supported relationship between proximity to diversity hotspots and diversity, suggesting historical processes also play a key role in diversity patterns.\nBecause environmental variables can be coupled in time and in space, it is important to consider multiple environmental, temporal, and spatial variables, and their interactions, to disentangle the drivers of biotic patterns. Studies that incorporate multiple variables can be powerful tools for identifying the drivers of biotic patterns and projecting biotic responses to future climate changes.",

Strain profiles are analyzed in a stretched vertical coordinate system determined from the mean vertical density structure. Wavelet decomposition is used to analyze the power spectra in each basin. In the Indian and Pacific Oceans, we see two distinct peaks in the power spectra around the equator, the first a broader Kelvin Wave-like signal and the second a narrower feature consistent with the characteristics of a first-meridional-mode Rossby Wave. In all three ocean basins we find coherent basin-wide signals consistent with first-meridional-mode Rossby Waves, having periods of 5±1 years in the Indian and the Atlantic, and 12±3 years in the Pacific. The first-meridional-mode Rossby wave dispersion relation suggests basin-scale zonal wavelengths in all three oceans.

            "abstract": "The analysis of terrestrial magnetic anomalies has long proved useful for constraining crustal structure and dynamics. Here, we study Jupiter’s moon, Io, using magnetics. We conduct forward modeling to make predictions of the crustal magnetic anomaly distribution on Io. Io is the most volcanic body in the solar system due to tidal heating from its Laplace resonance with Europa and Ganymede, causing extensive sulfur and silicate volcanism. We assume the magnetic susceptibility, which controls the measured magnetic signal, is controlled by temperature. Continuous overturn of the crust controls the vertical temperature profile, and local volcanic centers give the lateral temperature structure. As non-magnetic sulfur volcanism occurs at cool temperatures beneath the Curie point, it should not greatly affect the planetary magnetism and consequently is ignored in this paper.\nWe assume that the average crustal temperatures are determined by a model of continuous burial by newly erupted material (O’Reilly and Davies 1981, Geophysical Research Letters), which put the Curie isotherm at great depth. We use a cylindrically symmetric model of the thermal evolution of the crust around an isolated volcanic center to obtain the local deviations in the thickness of the magnetizable layer. The crustal rocks are presumed to be mafic or ultramafic in composition, based on their spectral signatures, the temperature of the silicate volcanic eruptions, and their rheology as inferred from flow structures. Analysis of the 1997 Pillan eruption suggests a composition similar to lunar mare basalt or komatiite. The magnetic and thermal properties of lunar mare basalt have been well studied since the Apollo missions. Unaltered terrestrial ultramafics have been studied sufficiently to constrain their properties.\nA common technique of discretizing the magnetized material into prisms and summing the magnetic field of each prism as per Blakely (1995) was used to obtain an estimate of the crustal magnetic anomalies of Io as they would be measured by a satellite. The mapping is displayed as zonal bands so that a Cartesian geometry may be used. Early results indicated an accuracy better than 2 nT is required to detect the magnetic anomalies generated by volcanic activity.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 318 drilled Site U1361 on the continental rise offshore of the Wilkes sub-glacial basin. The goal was to reconstruct the stability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) during Neogene warm periods. Teasing out the paleoenvironmental implications is essential for understanding the evolution of the EAIS. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is sensitive to differential compaction and other rock magnetic parameters like isothermal remanence and anhysteretic remanence are very sensitive to changes in the terrestrial source region. In general, highly anisotropic layers correspond with laminated clay-rich units, while more isotropic layers are bioturbated and have less clay. Layers enriched in diatoms are associated with the latter, which also have higher Ba/Al ratios indicating higher productivity. Higher anisotropy layers have lower porosity and moisture contents and have fine grained magnetic mineralogy dominated by magnetic. Higher anisotropy layers are dominated by maghemite, supporting the suggestion by Cook et al. (2013) of different source regions during low and high productivity times. They tied the two facies to the coastal outcrops of the Lower Paleozoic granitic terranes and the Ferrar Large Igneous Province in the more inland Wilkes Subglacial Basin respectively. Here we present evidence for a third geological unit, one eroded at the boundaries between the high and low clay zones with a “hard” (hematite) dominated magnetic mineralogy. This unit likely outcrops in the Wilkes sub-glacial basin and could be hydrothermally altered Beacon sandstone similar to that detected by Craw and Findlay (1984) in Taylor Valley or the equivalent to the Elatina Formation in the Adelaide Geosyncline in Southern Australia (Schmidt and Williams, 2013).\nCook, C.

            "abstract": "Low water levels in the Great Lakes have recently had significant financial impacts on the region’s commercial shipping, responsible for transporting millions of dollars’ worth of bulk goods each year. Low lake levels can significantly affect shipping firms, as cargo capacity is a function of draft, or the distance between water level and the ship’s bottom. Draft increases with weight, and lower lake levels force ships to reduce cargo to prevent running aground in shallow harbors, directly impacting the finances of shipping companies.\nRisk transfer instruments may provide adaptable, yet unexplored, alternatives for managing these financial risks, at significantly less expense than more traditional solutions (e.g., dredging). Index-based financial instruments can be particularly attractive as contract payouts are directly linked to well-defined transparent metrics (e.g., lake levels), eliminating the need for subjective adjustors, as well as concerns over moral hazard. In developing such instruments, a major challenge is identifying an index that is well correlated with financial losses, and thus a contract that reliably pays out when losses are experienced (low basis risk).\nIn this work, a relationship between lake levels and shipping revenues is developed, and actuarial analyses of the frequency and magnitude of revenue losses is completed using this relationship and synthetic water level data. This analysis is used to develop several types of index-based contracts. A standardized suite of binary contracts is developed, with each indexed to lake levels and priced according to predefined thresholds. These are combined to form portfolios with different objectives (e.g. options, collars), with optimal portfolio structure and length of coverage determined by limiting basis risk and contract cost, using simulations over the historic dataset. Results suggest that portfolios of these binary contracts can substantially reduce the risk of financial losses during periods of low lake level at a cost of only 1-3% of total revenues.",

At present, few North Pacific high-resolution marine records of the last 2000 years of temperature exist. High quality box and kasten cores from Santa Barbara Basin provide an opportunity to link foraminiferal proxy records to the instrumental sea surface temperature record over the past 200 years, to extend these proxy temperature records back over the last 2000 years, and to compare them with marine and continental records of temperature from other regions.\nWe present an approximately annual to decadal record of planktonic foraminiferal proxies of temperature, including Mg/Ca, calcite δ18O and size-normalized shell weight of the near-subsurface dwelling planktonic foraminifera Globigerina bulloides, and Neogloboquadrina pachyderma coiling in Santa Barbara Basin, California (34° 16.847’ N, 120° 02.268’ W), over the past 2000 years. G. bulloides Mg/Ca temperatures exhibit a long-term cooling trend of approximately 2°C that ended in the early 18th century. Similarly, G. bulloides calcite δ18O and shell weight gradually increased from 0 to 1000 AD indicating long-term cooling. However, the cooling trend was followed by a calcite δ18O decrease from 1000 to 1700 AD, indicating either warming or freshening of surface water through the Little Ice Age (ca. 1400 to 1850 AD). After the early nineteenth century, G. bulloides calcite δ18O, Mg/Ca and shell weight trends are again broadly similar and correlate with historical sea surface temperature since 1850, and indicate that near surface temperatures have warmed by approximately 2°C since ~1920.",

The most voluminous volcanic stages of the OJP—the Kroenke and Kwaimbaita stages, which dominate the accessible portions of the plateau—have relatively flat primitive mantle normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns, or spidergrams. With the exception of relatively small volumes of late-stage melts—referred to as the Singgalo stage—that are characterized by slightly enriched REE spidergrams, the volcanic stages that dominated the eruptive history of the OJP exhibit remarkably homogeneous, flat REE patterns. Here we isolate, for the first time, olivine-hosted melt inclusions from OJP. We show that the melt inclusions have two clear populations defined by having distinct trace element characteristics. The first population has relatively flat trace element patterns that are similar to that observed in whole rock lavas from the most voluminous volcanic stages (Kroenke and Kwaimbaita stages) recorded in the OJP. In contrast, a second group of melt inclusions, referred to as UDM (ultra-depleted melt) inclusions, exhibit strikingly depleted REE spidergrams; these trace element patterns are far more depleted than any previously reported lava from OJP. The UDM have unique trace element signatures that preclude an origin by assimilation of hydrothermally-altered oceanic crust or re-melting the depleted mantle source left over after melt extraction during construction of the OJP. We interpret the new UDM compositions to be the result of melting of a previously unrecognized ultra-depleted component hosted in the OJP mantle source.",

However, the extent to which kelp ‘goes with the flow’ as opposed to dissipating wave and current energy is unclear. We present innovative measurements of the wave-forced motion of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera at different heights along the length of the stipe using a series of accelerometers attached at fixed intervals.\nObservations were taken at the Aramoana breakwater (“the Mole”), located at the entrance to Otago Harbor, New Zealand. This field site encompassed a wave-exposed region open to Pacific swells and a sheltered (harbor) region. Analysis of wave gauge measurements revealed that forcing was dominated by the swell frequency (0.11 Hz). However, the spectra also indicated periods of substantial energy at lower, infragravity wave frequencies (0.011 Hz). Preliminary analysis of the accelerometer data shows significant differences in displacement over the stem length, with large motions apparent at both the top and bottom of the kelp (consistent with visual observations from divers). Initial observations also revealed an unexpected result; different sections of the kelp responded most strongly to different forcing frequencies. In particular, the lowest sensor showed peaks in energy close to both swell and infragravity periods, whereas the higher sensor revealed the surprising result of a strong response at the infragravity frequencies but little movement at the swell frequencies.\nWe discuss how these results may allow us to determine the extent to which aquatic plants are adapted to minimize stresses imposed by fluid flow and potential consequences for present and future plant community distributions.",

Our eventual goal is to insure students taking introductory classes at any institution will be exposed to comparable content and be similarly prepared for advanced courses. Our initial results suggest that the modules’ use of case studies and analysis of authentic data sets are very appealing to our student body (over 70% Hispanic). Since many students do not speak English at home, they were challenged by vocabulary presented in some modules. Modules containing glossaries and extensive background material (such as concept maps and annotated figures) proved very helpful to these students. The use of pre-activity quizzes insured that the students had mastered basic concepts needed for in-class activities. Modifications required to teach these modules in larger classes included condensing materials and reducing the amount of color figures to save paper and printer costs, streamlining dissemination/collection of in-class group assignments, and adapting assignments such as jigsaws and gallery walks to the confines of a large lecture hall with fixed seating.

This computational load may be reduced by employing surrogate models - simpler approximations of more complex codes.\nSurrogate performance depends on the nature of the surrogate and which complex model runs are used to calibrate the surrogate. It tends to diminish away from these complex model snapshots.\nIn this paper we investigate how robust a Polynomial Chaos surrogate of a typical groundwater model is under common sources of uncertainty. We aim to provide guidelines as to when to re-calibrate a groundwater model surrogate, and to identify which sources of uncertainty tend to be more significant.",

            "abstract": "Travel-time based models are presented as an alternative to traditional spatially explicit models to solve nonlinear reactive-transport problems. The main advantage of the travel-time approach is that it does not require multi-dimensional characterization of physical and chemical parameters, and transport is one-dimensional. Spatial dimensions are replaced by groundwater travel time, defined as the time required by a water particle to reach an observation point or the outflow boundary, respectively.\nThe fundamental hypothesis is that locations of the same groundwater age exhibit the same reactive-species concentrations. This is true in strictly advective-reactive transport in steady-state flows if the coefficients of reactions are uniform and the concentration is uniform over the inflow boundary. We hypothesize that the assumption still holds when adding some dispersion in coupled flow and transport dynamics. We compare a two-dimensional, spatially explicit, bioreactive, advective-dispersive transport model, considered as “virtual truth”, with three 1-D travel-time based models which differ by the conceptualization of longitudinal dispersion: (i) neglecting dispersive mixing altogether, (ii) introducing a local-scale longitudinal dispersivity constant in time and space, and (iii) using an effective longitudinal dispersivity that increases linearly with distance.\nWe consider biodegradation of organic matter catalyzed by non-competitive inhibitive microbial populations. The simulated inflow contains oxygen, nitrate, and DOC. The domain contains growing aerobic and denitrifying bacteria, the latter being inhibited by oxygen. This system is computed in 1-D, and in 2-D heterogeneous domains.\nWe conclude that the conceptualization of nonlinear bioreactive transport in complex multi-dimensional domains by quasi 1-D travel-time models is valid for steady-state flow if the reactants are introduced over a wide cross-section, flow is at quasi-steady state, and dispersive mixing is adequately parameterization. First results considering diurnal fluctuations of flow rate of the uniform velocity field point out to match of concentrations with respect to average travel-time the estimated “virtual truth”.",

Road transport sources included flex (gasoline and ethanol) cars and motorcycles and diesel trucks and buses. Air pollutant concentrations for the transport sources were measured and related with the fuel sales by the emission factors (EFs) expressed in grams of pollutant per kilometer driven or unit of fuel consumed. Over the 14- year time period, pollutant concentrations of NOX, CO and PM10 decreased by 0.65, 0.37 and 0.71% month-1, respectively. Oppossitely during this time, fuel sales of gasoline, ethanol and diesel increased by 0.26, 1.96 and 0.38% month-1. Flex engines are the prevalent road source of CO, oppositely to diesel ones which appear to be the major source of NOX and PM10. Decrease in air pollutants are partially offset by the increment of fuel sales and related transport activity. For CO, there have been steep decreases in pollutant concentrations (rate of -5 parts per billion, ppb, month-1) for gasoline and ethanol engines between 2000 and 2013. Similarly, diesel related NOX and PM10 concentrations decreased but at slower time rates (-0.25 and -0.09 ppb month-1). Rates uncertainties are larger for diesel pollutants (coefficient of determination R of -0.47 and -0.41) than for gasoline and ethanol related CO (R equal to -0.72). This paper led to the following conclusions: (1) concentrations of gasoline and ethanol related CO, estimated by air quality network measurements, decreased at steeper rate than diesel pollutants NOX and PM10, (2) transport source contributions to the O3 formation differ significantly through the time period focus of this work, with higher contributions coming from gasoline and ethanol engines at the beinning of the reviewed period (2000-2007) and from diesel engines at the end (2008-2013).",

            "abstract": "A variety of regional smoke forecasting applications are currently available to identify air quality, visibility, and societal impacts during large fire events. However, these systems typically assume persistent fire activity, and therefore can have large errors before, during, and after short-term periods of extreme fire behavior. This study employs a wide variety of ground, airborne, and satellite observations, including data collected during a major NASA airborne and field campaign, to examine the conditions required for both extreme spread and pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) development. Results highlight the importance of upper-level and nocturnal meteorology, as well as the limitations of traditional fire weather indices. Increasing values of fire radiative power (FRP) at the pixel and sub-pixel level are shown to systematically correspond to higher altitude smoke plumes, and an increased probability of injection above the boundary layer. Lidar data collected during the 2013 Rim Fire, one of the most severe fire events in California’s history, show that high FRP observed during extreme spread can facilitate long-distance smoke transport, but fails to loft smoke to the altitude of a large pyroCb. The most extreme fire spread was also observed on days without pyroCb activity or significant regional convection. By incorporating additional fire events across North America, conflicting hypotheses surrounding the primary source of moisture during pyroCb development are examined. The majority of large pyroCbs, and therefore the highest direct injection altitude of smoke particles, is shown to occur with conditions very similar to those that produce dry thunderstorms. The current suite of automated forecasting applications predict only general trends in fire behavior, and specifically do not predict (1) extreme fire spread events and (2) injection of smoke to high altitudes. While (1) and (2) are related, results show that they are not predicted by the same set of conditions and variables. The combination of meteorology from numerical forecast models and satellite observations exhibits great potential for improving regional forecasts of fire behavior and smoke production in automated systems, especially in remote areas where detailed observations are unavailable",

            "abstract": "In the Pacific Northwest (PNW), increasing temperatures are expected to alter the hydrologic regimes of streams by shifting precipitation from snow to rain and forcing earlier snowmelt. How are such changes likely to affect peak flows across the region? Shifts in peak flows have obvious implications for changing flood risk, but are also likely to affect channel morphology, sediment transport, aquatic habitat, and water quality, issues with potentially high economic and environmental cost. Our goal, then, is to rigorously evaluate sensitivity to potential peak flow changes across the PNW. We address this by developing a detailed representation of snowpack and streamflow evolution under varying climate scenarios using a cascade-modeling approach. We have identified paired watersheds located on the east (Metolius River) and west (McKenzie River) sides of the Cascades, representing dry and wet climatic regimes, respectively. The tributaries of these two rivers are comprised of contrasting hydrologic regimes: surface-runoff dominated western cascades and deep-groundwater dominated high-cascades systems. We use a detailed hydro-ecological model (RHESSys) in conjunction with a spatially distributed snowpack evolution model (SnowModel) to characterize the peak flow behavior under present and future climate. We first calibrated and validated the SnowModel using observed temperature, precipitation, snow water equivalent, and manual snow survey data sets. We then employed a multi-objective calibration strategy for RHESSys using the simulated snow accumulation and melt from SnowModel and observed streamflow. The Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency between observed and simulated streamflow varies between 0.5 in groundwater and 0.71 in surface-runoff dominated systems. The initial results indicate enhanced peak flow under future climate across all basins, but the magnitude of increase varies by the level of snowpack and deep-groundwater contribution in the watershed. Our continuing effort is to link these hydrologic changes with the channel morphology and fluvial hydraulics of streams in order to evaluate the geomorphic implications of these hydrologic changes.",

            "abstract": "Wintertime storms that produce precipitation events such as snow, freezing rain, and ice pellets cause significant damage to utility services and disrupt travel. These synoptic systems involve deep isothermal regions where warm, moist air over-runs surface sub-freezing air. However, little else is known about the synoptic evolution of the storms. Therefore this study analyzes the dynamic and thermodynamic conditions of ice events along the east coast.\nThe National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) Storm Events Database is used to pull the dates of ice events from the Northeast and Southeast climate regions for 1996-2013. We find that Southeast ice storms often cover a large geographical region, while Northeast ice storms tend to be much smaller but more frequent. We utilize Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to relate the spatial coverage of our ice events to population density in order to compare the impacts of the events in the two regions.\nNext, we analyze the synoptic control of ice storms from both regions in an effort to explain what causes the size differences. For the ice storms gathered from the Storm Events Database, composites are generated for sea level pressure, 2-meter temperatures, 850-hPa temperature and 850-500 hPa thickness, and vorticity parameters, from reanalysis data. A comparison of the composites for the Southeast and Northeast storms suggests that the size differences relate in part to the thermal structure produced by cold air damming. The ice events are also associated with objectively identified cyclone tracks, and we find that cyclone forward speed is inversely proportional to the size of the ice storm produced.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the physical conditions within magma reservoirs, the dynamic processes that occur within them, and how they relate to the scale and timing of volcanic eruptions is of significant importance to volcanology and our ability to quantify volcanic hazard potential. Methods such as U-series geochronology and mineral diffusion allow us to evaluate different aspects and timescales of magmatic processes and to constrain the thermal histories of magma bodies (e.g., [1]). We are using combined U-series ages and diffusion durations to examine the physical conditions of magma storage and subsequent remobilization at Lassen Volcanic Center (LVC), CA. Together these data will provide the percentage of time spent at temperatures where magmas are mobile and eruptible, the duration of magma storage, and lag time between eruption and mixing events. Mineral and outcrop-scale textures indicative of magma mixing processes have been well documented at the LVC. Major oxide mixing trends suggest similar mafic and felsic end-members for the Chaos Crags (1143 ± 23 ybp) and 1915 eruptions; however, the Chaos Crags magmas are far less mixed. Constraining the time lag between the initial establishment of a crystal-rich reservoir and later intrusions of recharge magmas and how that affects magma mixing is necessary to assess the relationship between mixing and eruption. These independent methods enable the characterization of magmatic thermal histories by constraining the total time represented in the crystal record from crystallization ages (238U-230Th and 230Th-226Ra disequilibria) of mineral populations, the durations spent at high temperature from diffusion (internal diffusion), and post-mixing timescales (rim diffusion). We will present preliminary results from the Chaos Crags and 1915 eruptions of the LVC. We will combine plagioclase (± biotite and hornblende) bulk mineral separate 238U-230Th and 230Th-226Ra crystal ages with mineral diffusion profiles to constrain the total time scale of crystal storage, the proportion of time spent above temperatures of rheological lock-up (~40-50% crystalline), and the temporal relationship between magma recharge and eruption.\n[1] K.M.

            "abstract": "Predictions that the frequency and intensity of monsoon extremes will rise in coming decades are being made with increasing confidence. There is concern that these climatic changes may drive tropical monsoon forests across critical thresholds, triggering ecological regime shifts. The global consequences of such shifts, coupled with knowledge gaps around the nature and intensity of drivers needed to instigate ecosystem reorganization, highlights the need for research that analyses the resilience of these seasonal forest to future climatic change. While work has indicated that these forests may be susceptible to reorganization to savanna under changing precipitation regimes, the interactions between climatic drivers and ecosystem response is still poorly understood, particularly in the seasonal forests outside of the neo- and afro-tropics. This study presents results on the threshold dynamics of the extensive south-east Asian seasonally dry tropical forest ecoregion (SASDTF) through analysis of plant microfossils and charcoal archived in sediment cores extracted from two tropical crater lakes in Cambodia. These data are compared with regional paleoclimatic reconstructions to gauge past forest response to monsoon extremes, and provide insight into the magnitude and duration of climatic events most likely to result in the breaching of critical thresholds. Our results suggest that, at a biome level, the SASDTF appears resilient to low-amplitude climatic variations over millennia, despite instrumental observations of strong precipitation-tree cover coupling in global dry forest resilience models.",

            "abstract": "Fe isotope fractionation spans ~0-0.4 permil in igneous systems, which cannot all be attributed to variable source compositions since peridotites barely overlap these compositions. Other processes may fractionate Fe isotopes such as variations in the degree of partial melting, magmatic differentiation, fluid addition related to the final stages of melt evolution, and kinetic fractionation related to diffusion. An important observation in igneous systems is the trend of increasing Fe isotope values against an index of magmatic fractionation (e.g. SiO2; [1]). The data strongly curve from δ56Fe >0.3 permil for SiO2 >70 wt% down to values around 0.09 permil from ~65 wt% down to 40 wt% SiO2 of basalts. However, ocean island basalts (OIBs) have a slightly larger δ56Fe variability than mid ocean ridge basalts (MORBs; [e.g. 2]). We present Fe isotope data on samples from the Samoan Islands (OIB) that have unusually high δ56Fe values for their SiO2 content. We rule out alteration by using fresh samples, and further test for the effects of magmatic processes on the δ56Fe values. In order to model the largest possible fractionation, unusually small degrees of melting with extreme fractionation factors are modeled with fractional crystallization of olivine alone, but such processing fails to fractionate the Fe isotopes to the observed values. Moreover, Samoan lavas likely also fractionated clinopyroxene, and its lower fractionation factor would limit the final δ56Fe value of the melt. We therefore suggest the mantle source of Samoan lavas must have had unusually high δ56Fe. However, there is no clear correlation with the highly radiogenic isotope signatures that reflect the unique source compositions of Samoa. Instead, increasing melt extraction correlates with lower δ56Fe values in peridotites assumed to be driven by the preference for the melt phase by heavy Fe3+, while high values may be related to metasomatism [3]. The latter would be in line with metasomatized xenoliths from Samoa [4].\n[1] Heimann et al., 2008, doi:10.1016/j.gca.2008.06.009\n[2] Teng et al., 2013, doi:10.1016/j.gca.2012.12.027\n[3] Williams et al., 2004, doi: 10.1126/science.1095679\n[4] Hauri et al., 1993, doi: 10.1038/365221a0",

            "abstract": "Flow paths and residence times in the hyporheic zone are known to control biogeochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification. The exchange across the sediment-water interface involves mixing of surface water and groundwater through complex hyporheic flow paths that contribute highly variable biogeochemical active zones. The objectives of this study were to determine the fate of nitrate (NO3) and dissolved oxygen (DO) during temporally varying flow conditions and compare concentrations to residence times simulated along a longitudinal cross-section accounting for mixing behavior of vertical and horizontal flow paths. In this study, the spatial and temporal distribution of nutrients was monitored in the hyporheic zone beneath a riffle-pool sequence on the Truckee River, NV using in-stream piezometers and riparian monitoring wells. Time-varying river discharge, spatially-varying hyporheic flow, and the distribution and mixing of flow paths appear to control the nitrification and denitrification process, and result in biogeochemical hot spots and hot moments. Results indicate that dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations in the hyporheic zone are generally greater than surface water concentrations, especially in down-welling zones. Concentrations of NO3 and DO were greater beneath the riffle areas as compared to pool areas, as a result of mineralization and nitrification of down-welling surface water. Replenishment of DO appears to support nitrification over long flow paths (101 of meters) and residence times (days). Denitrification along longer horizontal flow paths is limited by the influx of DO into the riverbed and the reductions in mean residence times. It is important to consider the occurrence of rapid inflows of surface water into the hyporheic zones resulting from variability in stage and riverbed topography, that replenishes DO and controls reaction rates and solute residence times. Flow-tube conceptual models for simulating residence times and reactions do not appear to be appropriate for systems where mixing among short and long flow paths in the hyporheic zone is prevalent.",

However, some petroliferous areas with proven oil reserves were identified in synclinal structures, e.g. Songliao, Ordos and Bohai Bay Basins, northeast China, Bonaparte Basin, Australia, and Santa Maria Valley field, California. We analyze the fractures in synclines that are expected to carry curvature related fractures similarly to anticlines. The analysis is conducted on a 500m long and ~300 tall exposure of a folded sequence of dolomite and limestone layers at Miaofengshan, Beijing. Two general fracture groups are recognized: (1) layer crossing joints that are sub-parallel to the syncline axial surface; and (2) a distinct system of extension veins, which are joints filled with secondary calcite, that was found only in two layers of 0.8 and 2.2 m thick. These veins are layer-bound, they are up to 5 cm wide, and their width tapers toward the top and bottom of the host layers. Most of them are oriented normal to the bedding surfaces and radially with respect to the syncline shape. We recognized two phases of secondary mineralization that indicate layer-parallel extension of 5% or more. Apparently, these veins developed by bending extension of the most brittle layers whereas the more ductile layers above and below extended quasi-continuously. The analysis suggests that synclinal fracturing should be considered as possible mechanism for exploration of unconventional.",

The bulb from which camas grows was a major subsistence commodity for tribes living in the Pacific Northwest and was once the second most-traded item in the region after salmon. Conservation management practices recommend detailed analysis of the target species’ habitat in order to determine characteristics necessary for reestablishment. It was hypothesized that certain species, specifically exotic or invasive plants, may present deleterious competition for blue camas. Plant community dynamics associated with camas populations were studied using plot and transect sampling to measure camas density and species coverage. Statistical analysis was used to calculate camas density, frequency, site diversity, and correlation of each plant species with camas. One study site at Evaro, MT was found to have the highest level of plant diversity and highest abundance of camas. However, of the 83 species identified, none were found to have significant positive or negative correlation with camas prevalence, and no data supported the hypothesis of exotic or invasive competition.",

            "abstract": "Understanding of the last interglacial (LIG) is critical for the assessment of long-term impact of global warming on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and climate. Relative to the Millennium, air temperature over Greenland and eustatic sea-level during the LIG was higher by 8±4˚C and 4–8 m, with a considerable oscillation in the rate of meltwater input (NEEM Community rembers, Nature, v.493, p.489; Kopp et al., Nature, v. 462, p. 863) . The impact of millennial-scale LIG meltwater input on the AMOC and global climate is, however, less understood. Here we present a highly resolved, benthic foraminiferal multi-proxy record from the eastern equatorial Atlantic. The record shows that the LIG was punctuated by at least two episodes of reduced AMOC whose impact on the global climate varied considerably. While the event between 126,000 and 123,800 years ago lacks imprints on available global climate records, the AMOC perturbation between 129,000 and 128,000 years ago provides a causative link to a rapid increase of atmospheric CO2, peak air warming over Antarctica, and a slow down of the rate of global monsoon intensification. We suggest that the rate of meltwater input into the North Atlantic and the size of remanent Greenland ice sheet was critical in determining the degree of AMOC reduction and its effect on the interhemispheric climate.",

            "abstract": "It has been poorly understood how the regional intraplate seismicity evolve with time after megathrust earthquakes. Also, it is unknown whether the great earthquakes will induce hazardous earthquakes in regional intraplate regions. We investigate the seismicity property changes around the Korean Peninsula before and after the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. The long-term response of media for the great earthquake and potential seismic hazards in intraplate regions are discussed. The megathrust produces large lithospheric displacements up to regional distances, constructing transient tensional stress fields in the backarc lithospheres around the Korean Peninsula. These additional stress fields cause decreases of Coulomb failure stresses and increase the seismicity in optimally-oriented strike-slip or normal faults. The transient stress perturbation diminishes with time by lithostatic loading, making gradual recovery of the ambient stress field. The seismicity evolves with the stress change. The long-term evolution of regional intraplate seismicity in regional intraplate regions with negative Coulomb stress changes is poorly understood. Strong seismic waves from the great earthquake produce dynamic stress changes in local and regional distances, increasing pore fluid pressure in fluid-including medium. The radial tension field and pore pressure increase induces abrupt increase of seismicity with intact-medium faulting. A series of moderate-size earthquakes and earthquake clusters develop as a consequence of medium response to the temporal evolution of stress field. The long-term evolution of seismicity is expected to continue until the preseismic ambient stress field is fully recovered.",

            "abstract": "We explore the ability of a new GPS software receiver, called CASES\n(Connected Autonomous Space Environment Sensor), to measure seismic\ndisplacements in realtime. Improvements in GPS technology over the last 20 years allow for precise\nmeasurement of ground motion during seismic events. For example, GPS data has been used to\ncalculate displacement histories at an earthquake’s epicenter and fault slip estimations with great\naccuracy. This is supported by the ability to measure displacements directly using GPS, bypassing\nthe double integration that accelerometers require, and by higher clipping limits than seismometers.\nThe CASES receiver developed by ASTRA in collaboration with Cornell University and the\nUniversity of Texas, Austin represents a new geodetic-quality software-based GPS\nreceiver that measures ionospheric space weather in addition to the usual navigation\nsolution. To demonstrate, in a controlled environment, the ability of the CASES receiver to measure\nseismic displacements, we simulated ground motions similar to those generated during earthquakes,\nusing a shake box instrumented with an accelerometer and a GPS antenna. The accelerometer\nmeasured the box’s actual displacement. The box moved on a manually controlled axis that\nunderwent varied one-dimensional motions (from mm to cm) at different frequencies and\namplitudes. The CASES receiver was configured to optimize the accuracy of the position solution. We\nquantified the CASES GPS receiver performance by comparing the GPS solutions against the\naccelerometer data using various statistical analysis methods. The results of these tests\nwill be presented.\nThe CASES receiver is designed with multiple methods of accessing the data in realtime,\nranging from internet connection, blue-tooth, cell-phone modem and Iridium modem. Because\nthe CASES receiver measures ionospheric space weather in addition to the usual navigation\nsolution, CASES provides not only the seimic signal, but also the ionospheric space weather\neffects produced by the seismic signal and by tsunamis, including signatures of acoustic waves and\ngravity waves in the ionosphere. Examples of CASES GPS receiver data containing ionospheric\nspace weather signatures generated by Pacific Rim earthquakes and tsunamis will be also presented.",

The study was performed using in situ measurements from the Earth's magnetosheath downstream of the quasi-parallel shock. Intermittent structures were identified using the Partial Variance of Increments method. We studied the distribution of the identified structures as a function of their magnetic shear angle, the PVI index and the electron heating. The properties of the observed current sheets were different for high (>3) and low (<3) values of the PVI index. We observed a distinct population of high PVI (>3) structures that accounted for ~20% of the total. Those current sheets have high magnetic shear (>90 degrees) and were observed mostly in close proximity to the bow shock with their numbers reducing towards the magnetopause. Enhancement of the estimated electron temperature within these current sheets suggest that they are important for local electron heating and energy dissipation.",

            "abstract": "Redox state of magma is important to understand dynamics of volcanic eruptions because magma properties such as composition of degassed volatiles, stability field of minerals, and rheology of magma depend on redox state. To evaluate redox state of magma, Fe3+/ΣFe ratio [= Fe3+/( Fe3++ Fe2+)] of volcanic glass has been measured non-destructively by Fe-K edge μ-XANES (micro X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure) spectroscopy (e.g., Cottrell and Kelly, 2011).\nWe performed textural, compositional, and Fe-K edge μ-XANES analyses on volcanic ash to infer oxidation process of magma at shallow conduit during eruption at Bromo Volcano, Indonesia. The volcanic ash particles were collected in 24th March 2011 by real-time sampling from ongoing activity. The activity was characterized by strombolian eruption showing magma head ascended to near the ground surface. The ash sample contains two type of volcanic glasses named as Brown and Black glasses (BrG and BlG), based on their color. Textual analysis shows microlite crystallinities are same in the two type of glasses, ranging from 0 to 3 vol.%. EPMA analyses show that all of the glasses have almost identical andesitic composition with SiO2 = 60 wt.%. In contrast, Fe-K edge μ-XANES spectra with the analytical method by Ishibashi et al. (in prep) demonstrate that BrG (Fe3+/ΣFe = 0.20-0.26) is more oxidized than BlG (Fe3+/ΣFe = 0.32-0.60). From combination of the glass composition, the measured Fe3+/ΣFe ratio and 1060 degree C of temperature (Kress and Carmichael, 1991), the oxygen fugacities are estimated to be NNO and NNO+4 for BrG and BlG, respectively. The volcanic glasses preserve syn-eruptive physicochemical conditions by rapid quenching due to their small size ranging from 125 to 250 μm. Our results demonstrate that BrG and BlG magmas are textually and chemically identical but their redox conditions are different at the eruption. The oxidation of magma can be caused by following two processes; 1) diffusive transport of oxygen, and 2) dissociation reaction of hydrogen from magma head. The two processes should be easy to occur in shallower region of the conduit. Therefore we suggest BlG magma existed in shallower part of the conduit than BrG magma. The K-edge μ-XANES analysis can be strong tool for understanding on degassing and ascent process of magma at shallow conduit.",

            "abstract": "Radiocarbon dating of carbon (C) encapsulated in phytoliths (phytC) is currently used in many Earth Science disciplines for absolute chronologies and paleoclimatic reconstructions; however, the usefulness of phytC has been hampered by inadequate extraction methods[1] and uncertainties regarding its origin as purely photosynthetic [2,3,4]. An early investigation measuring isotopes from Gramineae spp. grown in free-air C enrichment experiments (FACE), showed that part of of its phytC is from a non-photosynthetic source, thus indicating a dual origin[5]. To demonstrate that non-photosynthetic sources within phytC could be from soil C stocks, we measured 14C-AMS phytC extracted from a set of Sorghum bicolor growing on known 14C and d13C bulk substrates and hydroponic solutions. The phytolith concentrates and a silica blank were extracted at UCI, CEREGE and Wisconsin using an improved protocol [1,2]. We also measured CO2 fluxes and isotopic signatures of microbial respiration, percentage of biomass and phytolith extracts produced, and isotopic signatures of the local air and bulk-plant during the growing season of 2012. This allowed comparison of the belowground substrate and nutrient C contributions to phytC 14C results. Meanwhile, NanoSIMS analyses of phytolith polished sections was used to locate phytC in the phytolith siliceous structure [6]. These results will be shown and discussed.\n[1] Corbineau et al. 2013 R.

This southern boundary of the CCS generally extends further south during spring into early summer and retracts towards the north during fall and winter, and this pattern is further amplified or reduced on different time scales, (e.i. interannual timescales by El Niño and La Niña events, or multidecadal ones by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)). These oceanographic conditions are related with important differences in the base of the food chain; when the boundary migrates to northern latitudes, the presence of relatively warmer tropical and subtropical waters further stratify the water column, a period when coccolithophorids dominate the microplankton web structure. On the other side, diatoms flourish when the wind-driven circulation expand the subarctic water masses of the CCS to the south and upwelling cells are generated.\nWe find in our cores XRF Ca counts (1 mm resolution) highly correlate with CaCO3 measurements (R=0.56), this last one showing a general decreasing trend over the past 2 Kyrs. The Ca spectrum analysis shows significant peaks for periods centered at 28, 40, 60, 120 yr. The centennial mode of variability of the Ca record shows correlations with Drought area Index from North America. When the variance of this mode is considered, similarities arises with intensity and number of ENSO events from Equatorial archives. Decadal variations of the record are highly correlated (R>0.8) with instrumental measurements of Kaplan sea surface temperature, and the PDO. We will discuss the implications of these periods in the carbonate record and the links between them and other paleoceanographic records in the Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Finite-fault source inversions are often performed with an assumed fault geometry. Green’s functions calculated using a fixed strike, dip and rake can introduce hard-to-quantify errors in the inversions if the true fault geometry deviates from the model assumptions. For mega-earthquakes with large rupture areas, it is important to consider fault curvature and other non-planar fault effects. To accommodate uncertainties in the fault geometry, we propose to parameterize the fault as multiple moment-tensor sources within a 3D grid of possible source locations. The grid is defined with respect to an assumed initial fault plane, spanning the likely 2D rupture extent and a small range in the direction to normal to the fault to accommodate errors in assumed fault location or orientation. Instead of determining the slip-rate history, a moment-rate function is solved. There are six unknowns per point at a given frequency and the best-fitting double-couple (i.e., strike and dip) can be extracted from the results. If we assume the earthquake occurs within a few fault planes, the unknowns to be solved should be spatially sparse. Recently emerging tools such as compressive sensing (CS) can be used to deal with the problem. For a case study, we will analyze the 2013 Okhotsk Mw 8.3 earthquake and hope to understand the uncertainty limits caused by fault geometry in the finite fault modeling.",

Particularly exciting is the high-pressure chemistry of Xenon, which is known to react with hydrogen and ice at high pressures, and form stable compounds under pressure. Here we show that Ag16Al16Si24O80·16H2O irreversibly inserts Xe into its micropores at 1.7 GPa and 250 °C while Ag+ reduces to metallic Ag and possibly oxidizes to Ag2+. In contrast to Krypton, Xenon is retained within the pores of this zeolite after pressure release and requires heat to desorb. This irreversible insertion and trapping of Xenon in Ag-natrolite at moderate conditions sheds new light on chemical reactions that could account for a Xenon deficiency relative to Argon observed in terrestrial and Martian atmospheres.",

            "abstract": "Recurrent particle matter episodes greatly influence air quality in Northeast Asia. According to many studies, a major reason is long-range transport of air pollutant. Large amount of emission of chemical compounds aggravate air pollution in the region. Emitted air pollutants mainly come from industrialized regions along the East China coast. It can be transported over downwind region by the prevailing westerlies. The long-rang transported fine particle certainly attributes to air quality in downwind region, but there are many unknowns on the quantity, transport pattern, and secondary aerosol production mechanism despite the fact with many studies have been performed.\nMajor contributors of PM2.5 are inorganic secondary aerosols, sulfate, nitrate and ammonium, in Korea. Especially high relative contributions of inorganic secondary aerosols appear for westerly wind cases. The main pathway of production of inorganic secondary aerosols is produced by converting from SO2 and NOx during the long-range transport but the contribution varies dramatically depending on season and wind pattern. Sulfate is consistently the primary contributor of PM2.5 still now but we should more concern nitrate because that NOx emissions of China is increasing steeply since 2000 by leading powerplant, industry, and transport, despite downward trend of SO2.\nIn order to better understand regional air quality modeling of the long-range transport, international study, MICS-Asia phase III, has been initiated with many researchers. We will present chemical characteristics of PM2.5 long-range transport during westerly wind cases focused on secondary aerosol, tracking their transport pattern, and production pathway. Results using CMAQ with the modeling domain covering Northeast and Southeast China, Korea, and Japan with 15km resolution will be discussed.",

The two releases occurred in twilight at the ground, but with distinctly different solar elevation angles. Resonance-fluorescence spectral lines are identified throughout this wavelength range, and are attributed to Sm, Sm+, SmO and SmO+. Even given the wide spectral range of the instrument, the spectral resolution throughout the range was 1.5 nm or better.

            "abstract": "Volcanic jets can undergo gravitational collapse to produce pyroclastic density currents (PDCs), or loft material several tens of kilometres and spread out as an ash cloud. The key ingredient that determines which of these two phenomena will occur is the turbulent entrainment of atmospheric air, which adds buoyancy to the jet. Classical models of eruption columns assume that the rate of entrainment is fixed and ~10% of the upflow rate of the jet. In particular, the efficiency of entrainment is assumed to be independent of the vent shape as well as the physical properties of the pyroclastic mixture. However, we show that the presence of particles of certain particle-size distributions (PSDs) in the jet can have a significant effect on the entrainment rate owing to their buoyancy and inertia. As a consequence, the conditions for collapse as previously identified must be revisited. In particular, there is a possibility for an eruption to produce both a buoyant column and a collapsing fountain. Using scaled analogue experiments, we test the likelyhood of collapse and the production of pyroclastic flows according to the source geometry and particle-size distributions.",

            "abstract": "Due to their complexity and volume, the satellite data are underutilized in today’s hurricane research and operations. To better utilize these data, we developed the JPL Tropical Cyclone Information System (TCIS) - an Interactive Data Portal providing fusion between Near-Real-Time satellite observations and model forecasts to facilitate model evaluation and improvement. We have collected satellite observations and model forecasts in the Atlantic Basin and the East Pacific for the hurricane seasons since 2010 and supported the NASA Airborne Campaigns for Hurricane Study such as the Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP) in 2010 and the Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) from 2012 to 2014.\nTo enable the direct inter-comparisons of the satellite observations and the model forecasts, the TCIS was integrated with the NASA Earth Observing System Simulator Suite (NEOS3) to produce synthetic observations (e.g. simulated passive microwave brightness temperatures) from a number of operational hurricane forecast models (HWRF and GFS). An automated process was developed to trigger NEOS3 simulations via web services given the location and time of satellite observations, monitor the progress of the NEOS3 simulations, display the synthetic observation and ingest them into the TCIS database when they are done. In addition, three analysis tools, the joint PDF analysis of the brightness temperatures, ARCHER for finding the storm-center and the storm organization and the Wave Number Analysis tool for storm asymmetry and morphology analysis were integrated into TCIS to provide statistical and structural analysis on both observed and synthetic data. Interactive tools were built in the TCIS visualization system to allow the spatial and temporal selections of the datasets, the invocation of the tools with user specified parameters, and the display and the delivery of the results.\nIn this presentation, we will describe the key enabling technologies behind the design of the TCIS interactive data portal and analysis tools, including the spatial database technology for the representation and query of the level 2 satellite data, the automatic process flow using web services, the interactive user interface using the Google Earth API, and a common and expandable Python wrapper to invoke the analysis tools.",

            "abstract": "Theory and numerical simulations are used to study the resonant generation and energetics of inertial oscillations in a unidirectional, laterally-sheared ocean current forced by oscillatory winds. The analysis applies to submesoscale geostrophic flows with Rossby numbers, Rog, that are of order one. In this case, the local resonant forcing frequency for inertial oscillations is modified from the Coriolis frequency $f$ to the effective Coriolis frequency F=f(1+Rog)1/2. In addition, the resonant inertial velocity response is elliptical, not circular, because the oscillation periodically exchanges energy with the geostrophic flow via shear production. With damping, the energy exchange becomes permanent, but its magnitude and sign depend strongly on the angle of the oscillatory wind vector relative to the geostrophic flow. However, for an ocean forced by an isotropic distribution of wind directions, the response averaged over all wind angles results in a net extraction of energy from the geostrophic flow that scales as the wind-work on the inertial motions times Rog2 for Rog <<1. For Rog ~ 1, this sink of kinetic energy for the circulation preferentially damps geostrophic flows with anticyclonic vorticity and thus could contribute towards shaping the positively-skewed vorticity distribution observed in the upper ocean.",

            "abstract": "Past studies have demonstrated there is a relationship between risk perception, risk tolerance and mitigation planning. When people experience high-risk perception, their risk tolerance is typically lowered causing them to become more likely to support the implementation of mitigation policies including those that are either cost intensive or politically controversial. Understanding stakeholder risk perception could therefore provide information about the likelihood of implementation of various mitigation strategies. Varied risk communication methods are needed to accurately represent community risk so as to better inform decision-making.\nIn response to this need, this research examines the effect of risk perception on community resilience through a case study of Fernan Lake, ID. Researchers conducted a survey of Fernan Lake residents to determine their risk perception of the impact of blue-green algae blooms on community resilience. Survey questions were developed based on traditional risk perception factors like vested interest, social trust, knowledge, possible benefits or losses, relevance to individual and potential for control. The results were used to determine residents’ risk perception of the impact of blue green algae blooms on Socio-Ecological System resource availability and future development and growth potential. Focus groups were then conducted to validate the survey results. Research results demonstrate that residents are concerned about the impacts of blue-green algae blooms, but the level of interest in acting on those concerns and their willingness to consider more aggressive mitigation strategies varies across the study area. This research demonstrates the need for varied risk communication approaches, depending upon community mitigation goals.",

However, no study has focused on more than one layer of anisotropy when examining the seismic behavior in these areas. Given that mantle wedge flow may be different from sub-slab flow, it is worth constraining the anisotropy in this region in terms of multiple layers of potentially dipping anisotropy. Moreover, shear wave splitting patterns may give indications of the viscosity of the mantle wedge (Jadamec and Billen, 2012). In this study, the wealth of data collected over the last fifteen years will be used to constrain the orientations of multiple layers of anisostropy using the Cross-convolution method (Menke and Levin, 2003) combined with a new statistical approach that better quantifies confidence bounds in the presence of pre-SKS noise.",

            "abstract": "This study identifies the locations of anomalous heat sources (AHS) that promote low-frequency variations in three components of South America Monsoon System (SAMS) associated with South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) behavior, which are: 1) the Northeastern Brazilian trough in 200hPa (NBT); 2) the Bolivian High in 200hPa (BH); and 3) the trough in 500hPa on the southeastern of South America (TS). The AHS are identified through combined analysis between anomalous outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) observed fields, only for January months from 1982 to 2011, and influence functions (IF) fields produced for January climatology basic state from numerical simulations of a global atmospheric circulation model that include in each solution of temperature tendency equation a thermal forcing in a specific grid point of model domain to mimic a diabatic heating vertical profile observed in deep convective clouds. Statistically significant linear correlations are observed among each of those components from SAMS and OLR. For NBT and BH the largest correlations are concentrated in equatorial regions, SACZ and subtropical oceans. On the other side, TS circulation correlates with convective dipole between eastern of tropical Indian Ocean and western of tropical Pacific Ocean, besides anomalous convection on the Africa, the subtropical South Pacific Ocean and the SACZ. IF for different atmospheric levels show that NBT and BH (TS) variations are related to AHS in tropical Pacific/Atlantic Oceans and SACZ (subtropical South Pacific Ocean), possibly connected with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (Madden-Julian Oscillation - MJO). Generally, an intensification of NBT (BH) could be produced by El Niño, intensified SACZ and/or equatorial Atlantic reduced convection (by La Niña and/or SACZ/equatorial Atlantic intensified convection), whilst an intensified TS could be produced by reduced convection in central-western of subtropical South Pacific Ocean resulting from MJO variability.",

            "abstract": "The air-sea CO2 balance is regulated by both biological and physical mechanisms in the Southern Ocean. Changes in the vertical supply of the major nutrients, nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon, and in the availability of the micronutrient Fe are all thought to play a role in the glacial-interglacial variation in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Here we present the most spatially extensive dataset of silicon and nitrogen isotope measurements from diatom frustules to examine the controls on nutrient drawdown during the last glacial period and across the glacial termination. The data confirm existing views that differing silicon and nitrate consumption patterns are likely the result, at least in part, of iron addition during the last glacial maximum. However, earlier in the glacial, a more coordinated response between the two proxy records, with both reflecting enhanced consumption during episodes of increased iron accumulation and export production, implies a different response to iron than observed for the LGM. Extended spatial coverage in the Subantarctic provides evidence for vertical mixing of nutrients directly in this zone. The collapse of the expected equatorward gradient in silicon isotope values and contraction of the nitrogen isotope gradient during the deglaciation suggests that nutrient supply increased not only in the Antarctic Zone, but also in the Subantarctic, perhaps due to enhanced deep mixing locally. Increased vertical supply in both zones of the Southern Ocean may better explain the enhanced nutrient supply to the low latitude thermocline than Antarctic Zone dynamics alone.",

            "abstract": "Land use changes can greatly increase erosion and sediment loads reaching watersheds and downstream coastal waters. In coastal environments with steep terrain and small drainage basins, sedimentation directly influences water quality in near-shore marine environments. Poor water quality indicators (i.e., dissolved nutrients and high particulates) affect coral calcification, photosynthesis, and coral cover. The abundance, recruitment, and biodiversity of American Samoa’s coral reefs have been heavily affected by population growth, land cover change, pollution, and sediment influx. Monitoring, managing, and protecting these fragile ecosystems remains difficult due to limited resource availability, steep terrain, and local land ownership. Despite extensive field hours, traditional field and lab-based water quality research produces temporally and spatially limited datasets. Using a ‘ridge to reef’ effort, this project built a management tool to assess coral reef vulnerability using land use, hydrology, water quality, and coral reef cover in American Samoa to provide local agencies and partners with spatial representation of water quality parameters and site-specific implications for coral reef vulnerability. This project used land cover classified from Landsat 7 and 8 images, precipitation data from NOAA, and physical ocean factors from Terra MODIS. Changes in land cover from 2000 to 2014 were also estimated using Landsat imagery. Final products were distributed to partners to enhance water quality management, community outreach, and coral reef conservation.",

Models have predicted that the closure of the Bering Strait, during past glacials when relative sea level dropped at least 50 m, may have had a significant impact on NPIW and the climate of the North Pacific. However, until now, proxy records of NPIW were limited to just the last glacial cycle and were insufficient to evaluate the links between NPIW, climate, and sea level. Here, we use new, long cores from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 323 Site U1342 (818 m water depth) from the Bering Sea to reconstruct the first continuous records of NPIW over the past 35 Marine Isotope Stages (1.2 myrs). Records of benthic foraminiferal δ13C and δ18O from U1342 indicate that increased brine formation and NPIW ventilation occurred during extreme glacials when flow through the Bering Strait was cut off. During glacial climates in which the Bering Strait was still open, the region was as weakly ventilated as during interglacials. Additionally, cross-spectral analyses show that variations in NPIW are coherent and in-phase with variations in Upper North Atlantic Deep Water (UNADW), and are unrelated to changes in lower NADW. These results contradict many previous modeling studies that predict weaker NPIW influence with Bering Strait closure and an out-of-phase (see-saw) relationship between NPIW and NADW. We propose that NPIW formation was enhanced when the Bering Strait was closed due to changes in the position of the Aleutian Low that were conducive to increased sea ice formation and brine formation within the Bering Sea. These results offer a new paradigm relating global climate and North Pacific Ocean circulation and provide data to ground-truth model simulations of NPIW.",

            "abstract": "Can a single model adequately represent a catchment’s runoff response? Is it possible to design a modelling framework that can adequately represent catchment processes now and in the future? These are just a few of the questions related to catchment modelling that continue to intrigue hydrologists. An appreciation of catchment non-stationarity is critical to answering these questions. However this has been given little consideration in the past. Typically a single model parameterisation is adopted and assumed to be adequate outside the period of calibration/validation. We present a novel method for dealing with catchment non stationarity that allows model parameterisations to evolve in time through a Data Assimilation framework. Data Assimilation for hydrologic parameter estimation has mainly focused on deriving a stationary parameter distribution. We investigate the potential for Data Assimilation to estimate time varying model parameters, an application which has not been examined before in the hydrologic sciences. This is undertaken using the popular Ensemble Kalman Filter with the Probability Distributed Model (PDM), a lumped conceptual hydrologic model. It is shown that careful consideration of the artificial parameter evolution step is critical in this context. A range of traditional artificial parameter evolution techniques are considered and found to be problematic when parameters exhibit temporal variability. A new hierarchical approach is presented that relies on a more meaningful description of parameter evolution to improve the prior parameter distribution. The hierarchical approach is applied to multiple known case studies and shown to produce superior results when compared to traditional parameter evolution techniques. This method provides a general framework for establishing dynamically evolving models that will be particularly useful for rapidly changing catchments.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations of seismic slip occurring below the seismogenic zone of large fault zones have emphasized the significance of coeval ductile and brittle processes at high temperatures. We present observations of a shear zone contained within the Saddlebag Lake pendant of the eastern Sierra Nevada, CA, where Triassic and Jurassic metavolcanics and metasediments are highly strained in a high-temperature shear zone. Transposed bedding and cleavage that define a flattening fabric, dextrally rotated porphyroclasts, and a steep, pervasive lineation together suggest an overall transpressive kinematic regime for the ductile deformation. The high-strain rocks exhibit multiple episodes of vein formation, indicating a prolonged migration of hydrothermal fluids throughout the system. Crosscutting relationships and mineral assemblages define discrete sets of differently oriented veins. The veins form by fracture, but many veins are folded and boudinaged, showing synkinematic brittle and ductile deformation. We document foliation-parallel quartz veins that show shear displacement from the geometry of pull-apart structures and offsets of earlier veins. Synkinematic equilibrium mineral assemblages within the host rock and dynamic recrystallization of the quartz veins show they formed at temperatures around 400 to 500°C. The shear fractures have horizontal trace lengths of up to a few meters and displacements range from 2-3 mm to ~3 cm, with 1-5 mm of opening. Assuming the observed offset in the fractures occurred in a single event, these measurements are consistent with stress drops of 1 to 10 MPa. We interpret these observations to show that the veins formed as a result of high pore fluid pressure that caused shear failure at low effective stresses. Because foliated rocks are mechanically anisotropic, the foliation provided planes of weakness for failure with a preferred orientation. Evidence for shear failure occurring within crystal-plastic shear zones at high temperatures suggests the veins within this shear zone-fault system may record similar processes to those causing tectonic tremor in other continental transform fault zones.",

            "abstract": "The photochemistry of impurities in ice can impact snow and ice composition as well as meltwater and air quality. For some trapped impurities in/on ice, exposure to sunlight can trigger direct photodegradation to form new stable products (e.g., formaldehyde and NOx) and/or reactive intermediates such as hydroxyl radical. The rates of some direct photoreactions are the subject of debate, due in part to the complex nature of ice. Solutes can be present in at least three distinct locations: (1) in a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) at the air-ice interface, (2) in liquid-like regions (LLR) within the solid ice, and (3) within the bulk ice matrix. While the rate of direct photodegradation of impurities depends on the photon flux, little is known about how the flux varies in different ice reservoirs. This complicates the interpretation of direct photodegradation kinetics. To address this issue, we are quantifying the photon fluxes in the different reservoirs using 2-nitrobenzaldehyde actinometry. We have found that in some cases the photon flux in an ice sample depends upon how the sample was prepared (e.g., quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen versus slowly frozen on a cold plate), likely a result of differences in ice morphology altering the extent of internal reflections of the incident light. Based on our results so far, for ice pellets of similar geometry but different preparation method, differences in photon flux can be up to a factor of 3. Overall, these results highlight the importance of measuring photon fluxes in all sample types in ice photochemical studies.",

We have been funded through NASA’s Planetary Instrument Definition and Development Program (PIDDP) to develop CIRS-lite as a lightweight successor to the Goddard-developed Cassini CIRS FTS currently operating in Saturn orbit. CIRS-lite also has promise for Earth science due to its modest mass, power and volume requirements and novel technical capabilities.\nFor Earth, CIRS-lite supports the characterization of climate radiative forcing, including trace species measurements such as methane. Detection capability beyond the typical limit of HgCdTe focal planes (about 16 microns wavelength) enables a more complete characterization of the greenhouse effect. As for trace-species quantification, a beyond-HgCdTe focal plane permits characterization of water without overlapping lines from other species, enabling better measurements of these other species such as methane at wavelengths reachable by HgCdTe.",

            "abstract": "A perduring challenge in the study of reconnection it has long been the failing attempts to reconcile the large scale MHD view based on the Petschek model with the small scale view based on kinetic theory. The first is based on the existence of standing switch off slow shocks (SSS) that eliminate the horizontal (the x component in the usual GSM coordinates) reconnecting magnetic field component forming vertical magnetic field lines. The second is based on nested diffusion regions where the magnetic field lines become decoupled first from ions and then from electrons. The kinetic picture when observed superficially does seem to have seem resemblance to the Petschek topology, despite the nested boxes being more of a Sweet-Parker concept.\nNevertheless, the question has always been: if expanded to sufficiently large scales, does the kinetic description eventually lead tot the formation os SSS? The question remains answered. \nRecently a first negative answer has been proposed in Ref. [1]. The proposed answer is in essence that SSS are made impossible by the presence of a firehose instability in the reconnection exhaust and by the formation of a plateau in the firehose parameter at a value of 0.25 corresponding to the condition where nonlinear slow and intermediate wave become degenerate. \nWe report a new series of simulations where we demonstrate that this is not the case in general. While for the specific case used in Ref [1], we indeed re-obtain the same conclusions reached by the authors. But our study demonstrates that case to be very peculiar and not representative of the more general kinetic answer. We will report direct evidence of the presence of extended SSS (over regions of hundreds of ion inertial lengths) in fully kinetic simulations for parameters typical of the magntotail and of the solar wind. Our results indicate that SSS are the natural extension of kinetic reconnection to large scales.\nThe simulations required for the study are heroic and were conducted with state of the art massively parallel computers provided by the PRACE system in Europe (specifically the Curie and SuperMUC computers) and by NASA Pleiades.

Extensive studies have examined kinetic properties of Alfvén waves in simple Maxwellian or Bi-Maxwellian plasmas. However, the solar wind electron velocity distribution function is more complex. A study of Alfvén waves in a plasma, whose electrons consist of two drifting populations in the proton bulk frame, is reported here. By numerically solving the linearized Maxwell-Vlasov equations, we find that the damping rate and the proton-electron energy partition for Alfven waves have been significantly modified in such plasmas, comparing to their counterparts without electron drifts. We suggest that electron drift is an important factor to take into account when considering the dissipation of Alfvénic turbulence in the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "We have analyzed explosive shot data from the 2011 Salton Seismic Imaging Project (SSIP) across a 2-D seismic array and 5 profiles in the Coachella Valley to produce a 3-D P-wave velocity model that will be used in calculations of strong ground shaking. Accurate maps of seismicity and active faults rely both on detailed geological field mapping and a suitable velocity model to accurately locate earthquakes. Adjoint tomography of an older version of the SCEC 3-D velocity model shows that crustal heterogeneities strongly influence seismic wave propagation from moderate earthquakes (\nTape et al., 2010\n). These authors improve the crustal model and subsequently simulate the details of ground motion at periods of 2 s and longer for hundreds of ray paths. Even with improvements such as the above, the current SCEC velocity model for the Salton Trough does not provide a match of the timing or waveforms of the horizontal S-wave motions, which\nWei et al. (2013\n) interpret as caused by inaccuracies in the shallow velocity structure. They effectively demonstrate that the inclusion of shallow basin structure improves the fit in both travel times and waveforms.\nOur velocity model benefits from the inclusion of known location and times of a subset of 126 shots detonated over a 3-week period during the SSIP. This results in an improved velocity model particularly in the shallow crust. In addition, one of the main challenges in developing 3-D velocity models is an uneven stations-source distribution. To better overcome this challenge, we also include the first arrival times of the SSIP shots at the more widely spaced Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) in our inversion, since the layout of the SSIP is complementary to the SCSN.\n",

The WC-EEW GNSS WG establishes geodetic standards and coordinates the activities of WC-EEW collaborators that are focused on research and development aspects of real-time GNSS processing and analysis. The long-term objective is to improve accuracy and robustness and to reduce data latency and overall system resource demands. These efforts will ensure the rapid availability of precise input data for the EEW algorithms, the research and development of which is coordinated by WC-EEW Science Coordination Working Group. The WC-EEW GNSS WG activities will carry out comparisons to assess performance of existing and new methods for real-time processing of GNSS data. Subcommittees within the working group are being formed to address requirements of the ShakeAlert production system as follows: 1) define interface specification documents and data format standards, 2) coordinate and specify plans for physical testing of equipment (for example on shake tables), and 3) assess performance of real-time GNSS processing options and define acceptable data specifications.

            "abstract": "We report the findings of the NSF-supported Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) investigation of the Oso Landslide. Our findings are principally based on data collected during a four-day team reconnaissance across the entire landslide area, but also draw upon other data sources including lidar surveys, high-resolution imagery, geologic mapping, precipitation data, and seismic records. The Oso Landslide claimed 43 lives, making it the deadliest landslide disaster in U.S. history. The landslide occurred within a thick sequence of glacial sediments that were deposited into the North Fork Stillaguamish River valley during the last glacial advance. Geomorphic evidence suggests that the valley in the vicinity of Oso Landslide has experienced multiple large landslides over at least the past 6,000 years.\nIntense three-week rainfall that immediately preceded the event very probably played an important role in triggering the landslide; however, many other factors likely contributed to destabilization of the landslide mass. These include: (i) alteration of the local groundwater recharge and hydrogeological regime due to previous landsliding and, possibly, land use practices, (ii) weakening and alteration of the landslide mass due to previous landsliding and other natural geologic processes, and (iii) changes in stress distribution resulting from removal and deposition of material from earlier landsliding. During our field reconnaissance we identified six distinctive landslide zones and several subzones that are characterized by different geomorphic expression resulting from deformation styles, geologic materials, vegetation, and sequence of deposition. Based on the reconnaissance observations and other available data, we hypothesize that the landslide occurred in two major stages. The first stage of movement is interpreted to be a remobilization of the 2006 slide mass and headward extension that included part or all of the forested slope of an ancient landslide. The second stage occurred in response to the unloading and the redirection of stresses within the landslide mass.\nWe additionally approximated the risk for fatalities due to landslides in the region and found that it to be relatively high compared to guidelines for landslides in other developed countries and for large dams in the U.S.",

            "abstract": "Recent works have investigated the impact of heat waves on the surface energy and carbon balance. However, less attention has been given to the impacts on terrestrial hydrology. During the summer of 2010, the occurrence of an exceptional heat wave affected severely the Northern Hemisphere. The extension (more than 2 million km2) and severity of this extreme event caused substantial ecosystem damage (more than 1 million ha of forest fires), economic and human losses (~500 billion USD and more than 17 million of indirect deaths, respectively).\nThis work investigates for the first time the impacts of the 2010 summer heat wave on terrestrial water storage. Our study area comprises three different regions where air temperature records were established or almost established during the summer: Western Russia, the Middle East and Eastern Sahel. Anomalies of terrestrial water storage derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) were used to infer water storage deficits during the 2003-2013 period. Our analysis shows that Russia experienced the most severe water storage decline, followed by the Middle East, whereas Eastern Sahel was not significantly affected. The impact of the heat wave was spatially uniform in Russia but highly variable in the Middle East, with the Northern part substantially more affected than the Southern region. Lag times between maxima air temperatures and lower water storage deficits for Russia and the Middle East were approximately two and seven months, respectively.\nThe results suggest that the response of terrestrial water storage to heat waves is stronger in energy-limited environments than in water-limited regions. Such differences in the magnitude and timing between meteorological and hydrological extremes can be explained by the propagation time between atmospheric water demand and natural or anthropogenic sources of water storage.",

            "abstract": "Agulhas leakage of warm, salty water from the Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic is suggested to have altered Atlantic meridional overturning and climate in the North Atlantic. One way to assess such linkages with North Atlantic climate variability is to examine the past Agulhas hydrography via high-resolution marine records from the Agulhas Bank slope. Here we present one such hydrographic estimate from the Agulhas Bank slope in the Atlantic sector of the Agulhas Corridor using planktic foraminiferal (Globigerinoides ruber) δ18O and Mg/Ca-derived SST to estimate surface salinity.\nBy focusing on the last 80,000 years this is the first quantitative fine-scale Agulhas leakage record that overlaps in time with the Greenland ice core record of abrupt climate changes in the North Atlantic region. Periods of enhanced Agulhas Corridor salinity occur at Northern Hemisphere cool periods (glacial termination and Heinrich meltwater events) and are followed by rapid northern hemisphere warming. We show that the timing of maximal salinity events in relation to periods of North Atlantic freshwater perturbation is consistent with the concept suggested by climate models that Agulhas salinity oscillations could provide buoyancy compensation for the Atlantic and potentially even trigger increased convective activity in the North Atlantic, thereby restoring Atlantic overturning circulation after relatively weak states.",

            "abstract": "The CONTRAST experiment was conducted from Guam (13.5° N, 144.8° E) using the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft during January and February 2014. The main objective of the experiment was to investigate the impact of deep convection on chemical composition and ozone photochemical budget. The experiment was part of three coordinated experiments to target the tropical Western Pacific during Northern Hemisphere winter, when and where the most extensive deep convection in Earth’s climate system develops. The partner missions were ATTREX (Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment), which deployed the high-altitude NASA Global Hawk, and CAST (Coordinated Airborne Studies in the Tropics), which used the UK FAAM BAe 146 research aircraft to investigate the lower to mid-troposphere of the Western Pacific. A total of 16 research flights were conducted using the GV, with measurement of ozone, CO, CH4, and CO2, as well as a large suite of chemical tracer measurements including organic and inorganic halogen species, NMHCs, and OVOCs. The research flights from Guam covered 20°S to 40°N latitude, 130°E to 165°E longitude, and 0.1 to 15.2 km ASL in altitude, successfully sampled the recent and aged outflows from active deep convective storms and defined the background chemical conditions of the tropical western Pacific during boreal winter. The results are expected to bring new insights into the ozone and halogen budgets of the tropical troposphere. These airborne observations, especially in combination with the CAST and ATTREX data, provide key measurements and diagnostics for evaluating and constraining chemistry-climate models. Highlights of the experiment and initial findings will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Previous process-oriented modeling studies have highlighted the dependence of effectiveness of cloud brightening by aerosols on cloud regimes in warm marine boundary layer. Cloud microphysical processes in clouds that contain ice, and hence the mechanisms that drive aerosol-cloud interactions, are more complicated than in warm clouds. Interactions between ice particles and liquid drops add additional levels of complexity to aerosol effects. A cloud-resolving model is used to study aerosol-cloud interactions in the Arctic triggered by strong aerosol emissions, through either geoengineering injection or concentrated sources such as shipping and fires. An updated cloud microphysical scheme with prognostic aerosol and cloud particle numbers is employed. Model simulations are performed in pure super-cooled liquid and mixed-phase clouds, separately, with or without an injection of aerosols into either a clean or a more polluted Arctic boundary layer. Vertical mixing and cloud scavenging of particles injected from the surface is still quite efficient in the less turbulent cold environment. Overall, the injection of aerosols into the Arctic boundary layer can delay the collapse of the boundary layer and increase low-cloud albedo. The pure liquid clouds are more susceptible to the increase in aerosol number concentration than the mixed-phase clouds. Rain production processes are more effectively suppressed by aerosol injection, whereas ice precipitation (snow) is affected less; thus the effectiveness of brightening mixed-phase clouds is lower than for liquid-only clouds. Aerosol injection into a clean boundary layer results in a greater cloud albedo increase than injection into a polluted one, consistent with current knowledge about aerosol-cloud interactions. Unlike previous studies investigating warm clouds, the impact of dynamical feedback due to precipitation changes is small. According to these results, which are dependent upon the representation of ice nucleation processes in the employed microphysical scheme, Arctic geoengineering/shipping could have substantial local radiative effects, but is unlikely to be effective as the sole means of counterbalancing warming due to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Unaltered mountainous streams provide insight into natural processes and mechanisms of organic carbon (OC) retention in riparian ecosystems. Our prior work indicates that downed large wood and soil OC are the primary reservoirs for OC storage in mountainous headwaters streams of the Colorado Front Range. We surveyed downed large wood and floodplain soil along 24 study reaches in mountainous headwater streams in and around Rocky Mountain National Park, CO. Comparison of study reaches with various degrees of valley confinement in old growth (>200 yrs) and younger subalpine and montane forests reveals geologic and biogeomorphic controls for OC retention. Preliminary results indicate that unconfined valley segments store much more OC per area (783 Mg/ha) compared to partly confined and confined valley segments (153 Mg/ha). Unconfined valley segments store a significant amount of OC along single thread channels and facilitate potential for development of multithread channels. Multithread channels in old-growth forests, with trees large enough to create persistent channel-spanning logjams, store relatively little sediment and a disproportionately large amount of OC as large wood. Beaver dams also facilitate the development of multithread channels and high soil OC content in beaver meadows constitutes the largest OC pools among all channel types. Preliminary reach-average radiocarbon ages from charcoal in floodplain sediment of three study reaches with drainage areas <20 km2 (1438 ± 84 yBP), 20 – 100 km2 (539 ± 110 yBP), and >100 km2 (887 ± 84 yBP) indicate that floodplain sediment turnover time is much longer in small streams at higher, subalpine elevations. Snowmelt-dominated hydrographs in these high-elevation streams rarely exhibit bimodal characteristics typical of the hydrologic disturbance regime in lower elevation montane forests of the region, which are influenced by large convective thunderstorms and monsoons of the southwestern US. The downstream cumulative effect in larger basins at lower elevation appears to be faster turnover times for floodplain sediment and associated soil OC.",

            "abstract": "The GRAIL mission [1] has revealed a lunar crust that is globally less dense and presumably more porous [2] than anticipated. Measurements of the inferred (effective) density as a function of wavelength provide a way of probing the vertical density structure of the crust. Both the mean vertical density stratification [3] and spatial variations in the density structure [4] have been determined. Here we used an admittance approach [4] to investigate the subsurface structure of South Pole-Aikten (SPA) Basin.\nThe SPA-forming impact was large enough to generate enormous quantities of melt [5,6] and a global ejecta layer [7]. The pre-existing crust was probably completely removed [8]; GRAIL data indicate a depth to the base of the crust (or other density interface) at a depth of about 13-20 km beneath the basin center [2]. Cooling and crystallization of the melt pool will have generated a distinct stratigraphy and density structure [6,5]. This predicted density structure can then be compared to that inferred from the GRAIL observations.\nWe determined the effective density spectrum of SPA using a localized multitaper approach [4]. The effective density decreases from 2.7 g/cc at spherical harmonic degree l=250 to 2.6 g/cc at l=550, indicating an increase in density with depth. Two model predictions from [5] yield effective densities in the range 3.0-3.2 g/cc. The discrepancy between the predictions and the observations could be explained by 1) incorporations of large volumes of crustal material into the recrystallizing melt-sheet; or 2) ~20% fracture porosity extending to depths of 10 km or more. The latter possibility is more likely given SPA early formation and subsequent reprocessing and delivery of low-density material by impacts.\n[1] Zuber et al. 2013 [2] Wieczorek et al. 2013 [3] Han et al. 2013 [4] Besserer et al. 2014 [5] Hurwitz and Kring 2014 [6] Vaughan and Head 2013 [7] Petro and Pieters 2004 [8] Potter et al. 2012",

            "abstract": "Serpentinization is a common mineralogical process that occurs in ultramafic rocks when water interacts with the primary minerals olivine and pyroxene to form a rock dominated by serpentine. Temperature of hydration and the primary mineralogy of the peridotite strongly influence the alteration products. We studied peridotites with low to extremely low degrees of serpentinization from two settings, the Santa Elena ophiolite in Costa Rica and the Gakkel Ridge, to test how temperature and primary mineralogy control reactions, reaction sequences, and subsequent vein textures during peridotite hydration. Serpentinization of a harzburgite from Costa Rica occurred at around 250°C, resulting in olivine-hosted veins that are a mixture of brucite and serpentine – with a bulk composition approximately equivalent to hydrated host olivine – and later stage veins that also contain magnetite. Serpentinite that formed by hydration of orthopyroxene is accompanied by talc, with a bulk composition (serp + tlc) that is depleted in silica relative to the orthopyroxene host. In contrast, veins in orthopyroxene in an almost un-serpentinized peridotite (degree of serpentinization ~ 5 %) from the ultra-slow spreading Gakkel Ridge have an average composition very similar to the host orthopyroxene, whilst veins in olivine suggest slight enrichment in silica compared to the host olivine. Replacement of orthopyroxene here results in the formation of serpentine, talc and amphibole. The presence of amphibole in orthopyroxene and the higher degree of orthopyroxene replacement compared to olivine suggests that serpentinization occurred at higher temperatures than in the Santa Elena peridotites, resulting in the mobilization of more silica through the system.\nThermodynamic models of the hydration of olivine and orthopyroxene agree with the mineralogical observations and show that hydration of olivine first results in the simple formation of serpentine and brucite. Increasing water-rock ratios then increase fluid availability, permitting magnetite formation in olivine-hosted veins. At increased silica activity brucite becomes instable so that hydration of orthopyroxene results in the formation of serpentine and talc, with locally forming amphibole.",

            "abstract": "The present study provides a thermo-mechanical framework for modeling the temperature dependent behavior of oil shale. As a result of heating, oil shale undergoes phase transformations, during which organic matter is converted to petroleum products, e.g. light oil, heavy oil, bitumen, and coke. The change in the constituents and microstructure of shale at high temperatures dramatically alters its mechanical behavior e.g. plastic deformations and strength, as demonstrated by triaxial tests conducted at multiple temperatures [1,2]. Accordingly, the present model formulates the effects of changes in the chemical constituents due to thermal loading. It is well known that due to the layered structure of shale its mechanical properties in the direction parallel to the bedding planes is significantly different from its properties in the perpendicular direction. Although isotropic models simplify the modeling process, they fail to accurately describe the mechanical behavior of these rocks. Therefore, many researchers have studied the anisotropic behavior of rocks, including shale [3]. The current study presents a framework to incorporate the effects of transverse isotropy within a thermo-mechanical formulation. The proposed constitutive model can be readily applied to existing finite element codes to predict the behavior of oil shale in applications such as in-situ retorting process and stability assessment in petroleum reservoirs.\n[1] Masri, M. et al.\"Experimental Study of the Thermomechanical Behavior of the Petroleum Reservoir.\" SPE Eastern Regional/AAPG Eastern Section Joint Meeting.

            "abstract": "The Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon) campaign conducted from January 2014 – December 2015 in the vicinity of Manaus, Brazil, was designed to study the aerosol lifecycle and aerosol-cloud interactions in both pristine and anthropogenically influenced conditions. As part of this campaign, the DOE G-1 research aircraft was deployed from February 17th – March 25th 2014 and September 6th – October 5th 2014 to investigate aerosol and cloud properties aloft. An Aerodyne High Resolution Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) and an Ionicon Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTRMS) were part of the G-1 research aircraft payload and were used to investigate aerosol gas- and particle-phase chemical composition. Here we present preliminary analysis of the aerosol and gas phase chemical composition. PTR-MS measurements show that isoprene and its oxidation products are the dominant VOCs during research flights. HR-AMS measurements reveal that the particle phase is dominated by organic material with smaller concentrations of sulfate and nitrate observed. Organic particle concentrations are enhanced when encountering the urban plume from Manaus. During the wet season, we observe increased concentrations of organic particle when passing through low-altitude clouds. PMF analysis of the organic mass spectra shows that the chemical composition of the particles observed in-cloud is distinctly different from particles observed outside clouds. We will also compare measurements made during the wet and dry seasons.",

The position of these eclogites marks the suture zone between colliding cratons and the age of metamorphism constrains the transition from subduction-dominated tectonics to continental collision and mountain building. We investigated the metamorphic conditions and age of high-pressure (HP) and ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) eclogites from Mali, Togo and NE-Brazil . P-T estimates confirm UHP to HP conditions for all these localities. The U-Pb age and trace element composition of metamorphic zircon domains demonstrate that continental subduction in the WGO occurred within 20 m.y. over at least 2500 km during the Ediacaran period (620-610 Ma). We consider this to be the first record of modern, large-scale deep-continental subduction and the consequent appearance of Himalayan-scale mountains in the geological record. The rise of such mountains in the Late Ediacaran is perfectly timed to deliver by erosion the sediments (nutrients) that have been deemed necessary for life sustainability in the following Earth evolution.",

            "abstract": "Organic-soil horizons exert significant control on soil temperature and permafrost dynamics in high-latitude regions. Ecosystem protection of permafrost is governed by the low thermal conductivity of organic soils, which is sensitive to changes in horizon thickness (OHT), moisture content, and decomposition extent (and thus, porosity, and density) of organic matter. At broad spatial scales, the occurrence of permafrost is positively correlated with OHT when organic horizons are relatively thin (< 30 cm). Across sites where OHT is deeper, this correlation reverses and becomes negative. We hypothesize that this bi-modal relationship between OHT and permafrost occurrence is primarily governed by the contrasting thermal properties of upper organic-soil horizons and the underlying deep organic-soil and mineral-soil horizons. As documented with prior investigations on snow thermal properties, we find that that the underlying layers can have a profound impact on the insulating effect of the overlying layer. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examine the sensitivity of permafrost to soil properties (OHT, moisture content, and texture) and their variations across landscape positions and drainage class using field–based observations and generalized simulations using the Geophysical Institute Permafrost Laboratory model (GIPL). We observed significant negative correlations between minimum daily ground-surface temperature during summer and OHT across upland forest sites in interior Alaska. In peatlands, ground-surface temperature and OHT appear to be decoupled, which is likely due to variation in deposit thickness as determined by the timing of peatland formation across the region. Model results highlight the role of moisture content and water table position, both as controls on organic matter accumulation and on permafrost extent and thermal state.",

            "abstract": "The Pacific coast of northeast Japan has been subsiding at about 5 mm/yr before the 2011 M9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake. On the other hand, existence of stage 5e marine terraces indicated the same area is slowly uplifting in a long term. Thus significant uplift was expected to occur to balance between the short term and the long term vertical movements. However, the 2011 event caused additional subsidence over 1 m along the Pacific coast. How to reconcile all these observations is still an open question. The question is also related to the mechanical coupling on the plate boundary. There have been several studies on this topic and they unanimously reported that the plate boundary off Miyagi is almost fully locked. Deeper limit of the locked zone has been estimated as 50 – 70 km in most studies while Suwa et al. (2006) estimated the locked region extended down to 100 km depth in order to reproduce interseismic subsidence with their elastic dislocation model. This discrepancy is crucial in evaluating future seismic hazard.\nIn order to tackle these problems, a simple kinematic model of earthquake deformation cycle is considered. This model, in which viscoelastic relaxation of the asthenosphere is taken into account, shows that postseismic uplift may recover both interseismic and coseismic subsidence if the shallow portion of the plate interface has a much longer recurrence interval than the viscoelastic relaxation time of the asthenosphere. This inference is consistent with the observation that there has been no giant earthquake along the Japan Trench at least after 1611. Afterslip on the plate interface also plays a significant role in postseismic uplift at the coastal area, but the afterslip is considered to last for only several years after the main shock and its total contribution in the whole earthquake cycle is limited. Reduced interseismic slip deficit below 50 km depth and concentrated aftershock of the 2011 event around this depth range indicate that the plate interface shallower than 50 km is the main part of interplate coupling. On the other hand, the deeper portion should be characterized as the velocity-strengthening friction. It is demonstrated that consideration of viscoelastic relaxation effects and cyclic effects from plate boundary earthquakes are essential in interpreting the observed deformation.",

            "abstract": "The distribution of volcanic features is ultimately controlled by processes taking place beneath the surface of a planet. For this reason, characterization of volcano distribution at a global scale can be used to obtain insights concerning dynamic aspects of planetary interiors. In this work, description of the distribution of volcanic features observed on Earth and Venus is completed using density contours obtained with the Fisher kernel. Attention is focused on similar features observed in both planets. In particular two features are examined with more detail: First, a pattern of groups of clusters defining the boundaries of elliptical regions that tentatively can be associated to large mantle plumes. Second, the existence of a uniform distribution of background volcanism. The former pattern is considered to constitute the first order convective pattern of the mantle in Venus, and although it is present on Earth, it is not as prominent. In contrast, the persistent occurrence of volcanic clusters at a lower significance level, suggests the occurrence of a different scale of mantle convection that controls a more uniformly distributed volcanism. Both, the first order related to large mantle-plumes and the background volcanism are superimposed on Earth to the volcanism controlled by plate tectonics. Consequently, the global distribution of volcanism in both planets reveals that at least three types of mantle convection can take place in the terrestrial planets, and that such types of mantle convection can coexist simultaneously in one given planet, although in each case, a dominant mode is different.",

            "abstract": "There are multiple theories that aim to explain the behavior of the solar dynamo, and their associated models have been fiercely contested. The two prevailing theories investigated in this project are the Convective Dynamo model that arises from the pure solving of the magnetohydrodynamic equations, as well as the Babcock-Leighton model that relies on sunspot dissipation and reconnection. Recently, the supercomputer simulations CASH and BASH have formed models of the behavior of the Convective and Babcock-Leighton models, respectively, in the convective zone of the sun. These models show the behavior of the models within the sun, while much less is known about the effects these models may have further away from the solar surface. The goal of this work is to investigate any fundamental differences between the Convective and Babcock-Leighton models of the solar dynamo outside of the sun and extending into the solar system via the use of potential field source surface extrapolations implemented via python code that operates on data from CASH and BASH. The use of real solar data to visualize supergranular flow data in the BASH model is also used to learn more about the behavior of the Babcock-Leighton Dynamo. From the process of these extrapolations it has been determined that the Babcock-Leighton model, as represented by BASH, maintains complex magnetic fields much further into the heliosphere before reverting into a basic dipole field, providing 3D visualisations of the models distant from the sun.",

            "abstract": "CH4 is produced in wetland sediments from the microbial degradation of organic carbon through multiple fermentation steps and methanogenesis pathways. There are many potential sources of carbon for methananogenesis; in vegetated wetland sediments, microbial communities consume root exudates as a major source of organic carbon. In many methane models propionate is used as a model carbon molecule. This simple sugar is fermented into acetate and H2, acetate is transformed to methane and CO2 while the H2 and CO2 is synthesized to form an additional CH4 molecule. The hydrogenotrophic pathway involves the equilibrium of two dissolved gases, CH4 and H2.\nIn an effort to limit CH4 emissions from wetlands, there has been growing interest in finding ways to limit plant transport of soil gases through root systems. While this may decrease the direct emissions of methane, there is little understanding about how H2 dynamics may feedback into overall methane production. Since H2 is used in methane production and produced in propionate fermentation, increased subsurface H2 concentrations can simultaneously inhibit propionate fermentation and acetate production and enhance hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis.\nFor this study, we incubated soil samples from vegetated wetland sediments with propionate or acetate and four different hydrogen concentrations. The headspaces from these incubations were simultaneously analyzed for H2 and CH4 at multiple time points over two months. The comparison of methane production between different hydrogen concentrations and different carbon sources can indicate which process is most affected by increased hydrogen concentrations. The results from this study were combined with a newly formulated steady-state model of propionate degradation and formation of methane, that also accounts for the venting off both gases via plants. The resulting model indicates how methane production and emissions would be affected by plant volatilization.",

            "abstract": "Age constrains provided by oxygen isotope stratigraphy, biostratigraphy and paleomagnetics can provide fundamental insights for interpreting other paleoceanographic reconstructions at orbital scale. In the case of the high latitude in the North Pacific, most paleoceanographic studies investigating the evolution of the North Pacific climate since the intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (iNHG) face difficulties in establishing orbital-scale age models due to the low preservation of foraminifer fossils. Most North Pacific studies targeting the Pleistocene heavily rely on alternative approaches with higher preservation potential (e.g. MS: Magnetic Susceptibility) for orbital-scale age models, and assume such data are mainly reflecting the Glacial-Interglacial (G-IG) cycle. A continuous oxygen iope record from the subarctic North Pacific is long anticipated data set to test such assumptions.\nTwo sites (Sites U1417 and U1418) in the Gulf of Alaska (GoA) drilled during IODP Exp. 341 are expected to provide continuous sediment records back to the middle Pleistocene (U1418) and Miocene (U1417), respectively. Here we present age models at Sites U1417 and U1418 derived from refined biostratigraphy and planktic foraminiferal (PF) oxygen isotope (Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sinistral, 150-250 µm fraction) stratigraphy (~1.2Ma at Site U1418 and ~3.0Ma at U1417, respectively). General agreement between oxygen isotope stratigraphy and other age constraints (biostratigraphy and paleomagnetism) at Site U1418 confirms the reliability of those age models. Furthermore, general trends seen in PF oxygen isotope time series roughly matches MS, suggesting that MS can be used for further age model tuning or as an alternative solution for the orbital scale age constrains in the GoA.",

            "abstract": "Elevated springtime temperature has been convincingly linked to an increasingly earlier onset of phenological activity. Studies highlighting this phenomenon have generally been conducted in ecosystems where energy is the primary limiting factor. Importantly, phenological studies in semiarid ecosystems where water is the major limiting factor are rare. In semiarid ecosystems, the timing of phenological activity is also highly sensitive to discrete moisture pulses from infrequent precipitation events. The objective of this study is to identify the triggers of flowering phenology in a semiarid creosotebush-dominated ecosystem. Creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) is a repeat-flowering evergreen shrub that is the dominant species in three of the North American deserts. We present results from six years of daily meteorological and phenological data collected within the Santa Rita Experimental Range in southern Arizona. Our site is equipped with an eddy covariance tower providing estimates of water and carbon fluxes and associated meteorological variables including precipitation and soil moisture at multiple depths. Additionally, three digital cameras distributed within the footprint of the eddy provide daily images of phenological activity. Our results highlight substantial interannual variability in flowering phenology, both in spring and summer flowering. We show that spring flowering activity tends to be associated with energy triggers (e.g. temperature, growing degree days), whereas summer flowering activity tends to be associated with moisture triggers (e.g. large precipitation events, deep soil moisture). Our study suggests that changes in frequency and duration of precipitation events will impact timing of phenological activity resulting in important consequences for vegetation dynamics and pollinator behavior.",

            "abstract": "Centers of deep tropical convection can affect high Southern Hemisphere latitudes by mass outflow surges in the upper troposphere / lower stratosphere (UTLS) and radiation of planetary wave trains through the connecting westerly waveguide. Depending on the season and on the phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), these wave trains will alter high latitude patterns of temperature, geopotential height, wind, and the distribution of column ozone. We employ global observations and simulations with the University of Wisconsin Nonhydrostatic Modeling System (UWNMS) to investigate the hypothesis that ENSO and seasonal changes in the location of convective centers and changes in the UTLS wind structure modulate the propagation of planetary wave trains, thereby influencing the distribution of circulation anomalies from the surface of Antarctica into the polar stratosphere.\nColumn ozone anomalies correlate highly with barotropic temperature anomalies in the UTLS, and may be linked to distinctive patterns of Antarctic surface temperature and wind anomalies for El Nino versus La Nina. During the SH winter to spring transition a westward shift in convection during La Nina of 30-50° corresponds to a 30-50° westward shift of planetary wave patterns from the tropics to Antarctica and of the zonal asymmetry in column ozone. In SH winter and spring during La Nina, a region of significant poleward planetary wave activity flux in the UTLS occurs near (amplified) Indonesian convection, while during El Nino the poleward flux is weaker and more diffuse across the Pacific. A primary result is that La Nina favors a barotropic low pressure anomaly over the Ross Sea, a colder East Antarctica, and a more displaced but stronger polar vortex. The influence of ENSO on the structure of the subtropical jet, subpolar jet, and its vertical coherence with the polar night jet is highlighted.",

            "abstract": "A diagnostic study is conducted to determine the mechanisms involved in local jet accelerations and altered meridional circulation patterns associated with midlatitude cyclones. Regions of inertial instability, as they travel poleward and eastward through the sub-polar westerly jet, are analyzed, and the associated jet intensifications are the main features of interest. Streamfunction patterns and jet accelerations are driven by local regions of inertial instability. As air with negative potential vorticity (PV) moves upward and poleward from the surface it transports air from a lower latitude with higher angular momentum into the jet. The original speed of the air must increase as it moves poleward to conserve angular momentum. During inertial instability-driven poleward surges of absolute momentum a distinct increase in jet wind speed occurs. High resolution simulations with the University of Wisconsin Non-Hydrostatic Modeling System (UWNMS) show that the conformal agreement between the shapes of surfaces of inertial instability, angular momentum, and jet structure is remarkable, and that the nature of the jet downstream of a trough is consistent with simple poleward advection of high angular momentum. Mesoscale disturbances precisely rooted in regions of inertial instability create a jet-suturing effect, a possible new mechanism for merging the sub-polar and sub-tropical jets.",

By using a neural network created with a new method for extracting crevasse patterns, and remotely sensed images acquired from World View 1, it is possible to not only to classify crevasses formed during Bering's surges, but also to determine whether glacier crevasses form in pattern sequences. In order to understand the relationship between the geographic location of the crevasse types and the geophysical formation of those crevasses, an analysis of glacier flow, velocity, and the dependency on the type of force acting upon the glacier, will be used over a time sequence of Wold View 1 images. The importance of this study will allow for better understanding of the geophysical processes that occurs on surging glaciers, along with allowing for future prediction of crevasse formation which will be useful in determining hazardous regions of Bering glacier, ultimately allowing for higher safety for researchers.",

            "abstract": "The Mono Craters volcanic chain is one of the youngest areas of rhyolitic volcanism in the Mono Lake–Long Valley region of eastern California. Located just south of Mono Lake, the Mono Craters comprise at least 28 individual domes and flows (numbered 3–30, north to south); however, the timing and frequency of eruptions remain poorly resolved. The earliest signs of volcanic activity are preserved as numerous tephra layers (Ashes 1–19, top to bottom) in the late Pleistocene Wilson Creek formation of ancestral Mono Lake, which indicate that rhyolitic volcanism from Mono Craters began by at least ca. 62 ka [1]. Although the current chronology indicates that most of the Mono Craters are younger than ca. 20 ka [2–4], similar compositions of titanomagnetite from both pumice and lava potentially correlate several Wilson Creek tephras to porphyritic biotite-bearing domes 11, 24, and 19 of the Mono Craters [5], suggesting that multiple domes in the Mono Craters chain reflect volcanism older than ca. 20 ka. Ash 3 is correlated to dome 11 based on similar ca. 20 ka ages and titanomagnetite compositions [6]. More recently, we performed ion microprobe 238U–230Th dating of unpolished rims of allanite and zircon from domes 24 and 19, yielding isochron ages of ca. 38 ka and ca. 42 ka, respectively. The age of dome 24 is consistent with the ca. 38 ka age of its potential correlative tephra layers [1, 5], indicating that dome 24 is likely the extrusive equivalent of Ashes 9–10. Dome 19 has titanomagnetite crystals with similar bimodal chemistry to titanomagnetites from Ash 15 [5]. The age of dome 19 is indistinguishable from the 238U–230Th age of Ash 15 [1], which erupted during a prominent geomagnetic excursion, originally designated as the “Mono Lake” excursion. Combining geochronological and titanomagnetite compositional data confirms that Ash 15 and its extrusive equivalent, dome 19, erupted during the Laschamp excursion.\n[1] Vazquez, J.A. and Lidzbarski, M.I.

            "abstract": "Snow prediction within models is sensitive to the snow densities, habits, and degree of riming within the BMPs. Several microphysical schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model down to 1.33-km grid spacing are evaluated using aircraft, radar, and ground in situ data from the Global Precipitation Mission Cold-­season Precipitation Experiment (GCPEx) experiment over southern Ontario, as well as a few years (12 winter storms) of surface measurements of riming, crystal habit, snow density, and radar measurements at Stony Brook, NY (SBNY on north shore of Long Island) during the 2009-­2012 winter seasons. Surface microphysical measurements at SBNY were taken every 15 to 30 minutes using a stereo microscope and camera, and snow depth and snow density were also recorded. During these storms, a vertically­pointing Ku band radar was used to observe the vertical evolution of reflectivity and Doppler vertical velocities.\nThe GCPEx presentation will focus on verification using aircraft spirals through warm frontal snow band event on 18 February 2012. All the BMPs realistically simulated the structure of the band and the vertical distribution of snow/ice aloft, except the SBU-YLIN overpredicted slightly and Thompson (THOM) underpredicted somewhat. The Morrison (MORR) scheme produced the best slope size distribution for snow, while the Stony Brook (SBU) underpredicted and the THOM slightly overpredicted. Those schemes that have the slope intercept a function of temperature (SBU and WSM6) tended to perform better for that parameter than others. There was a large amount of super-cooled water near the center of the band, which was underpredicted by all schemes. Meanwhile, for the 15 cases at SBNY, which include moderate and heavy riming events, the non-spherical snow assumption (THOM and SBU-YLIN) simulated a more realistic distribution of reflectivity than spherical snow assumptions in the WSM6 and MORR schemes. The MORR, WSM6, and SBU schemes are comparable to the observed velocity distribution in light and moderate riming periods. The THOM is ~0.25 m s­1 too slow with its velocity distribution in these periods. During heavier riming, the vertical Doppler velocities in the WSM6, THOM, and MORR schemes were ~0.25 m s­1 too slow, while the SBU was 0.25 to 0.5 m s-1 too fast because of some excessive cloud water issues.",

            "abstract": "As urbanization continues to increase the impact of cities on their surrounding environments, the feasibility of implementing low-impact development such as green roofs is of increasing interest. Green roofs retain and attenuate storm water thereby reducing the load on urban sewer systems. In addition, green roofs can provide insulation and lower roof surface temperature leading to a decrease in building energy load. Green roof technology in North American urban environments remains underused, in part due to a lack of climate appropriate green roof design guidelines. The capacity of a green roof to moderate runoff depends on the storage capacity of the growing medium at the start of a rainfall event. Storage capacity is finite, which makes rapid drainage and evapotranspiration loss critical for maximizing storage capacity between subsequent storms. Here the retention and attenuation of storm events are quantified for experimental green roof sites located in three representative Canadian climates corresponding to; semiarid conditions in Calgary, Alberta, moderate conditions in London, Ontario, and cool and humid conditions in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The storage recovery and storm water retention at each site is modelled using a modified water balance approach. Components of the water balance including evapotranspiration are predicted using climate data collected from 2012 to 2014 at each of the experimental sites. During the measurement period there were over 300 precipitation events ranging from small, frequent events (< 2 mm) to a storm with a 250 year return period. The modeling approach adopted provides a tool for planners to assess the feasibility of implementing green roofs in their respective climates.",

            "abstract": "Ice roads are often the only cost-effective means of transporting goods and supplies to communities, mines, and other sites in remote parts of the Arctic. Yet, there is no global dataset for Arctic ice roads. However, remotely sensed images from the SUOMI NPP day/night band (DNB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) may allow for the construction of such a dataset. The DNB’s high sensitivity to low-level light suggests that while it is not feasible to view ice roads at night per se, other prominent features associated with ice roads can serve as proxies. Using a time series of images taken in winter 2012, 2013, and 2014, SUOMI NPP images are compared with Landsat 8 images and an existing map of the Tibbitt to Contwoyto ice road in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada. First results reveal that while the ice road’s exact path cannot be discerned, key points of human activity along the way can be made out. This bodes well for future applications of DNB imagery to detect ice roads in places like the Russian Federation, for which there is a dearth of publicly available maps. Knowing the location of ice roads is important for two reasons. First, these data can signal sites of natural resource extraction in places for which information is not widely disseminated, such as in the Russian Far East. Second, new geospatial datasets for ice roads can be combined with models assessing impacts of climate change on circumpolar land accessibility (Stephenson et al. 2011) in order to understand where the structural integrity of ice roads may be at risk. As warming temperatures threaten to shorten the season for ice roads, communities and mines alike will need to prepare for changes to their transportation infrastructure, made out of the changing landscape itself.",

Much has been studied revealing the importance of communities of practice to organizations, project success, and knowledge management and some of these same successes hold true for virtual communities of practice. Study participants were 75 Education and Public Outreach community members of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate Earth Forum. In this mixed methods study, online workspace metrics were used to track participation and a survey completed by 21 members was used to quantify participation. For a more detailed analysis, 15 community members (5 highly active users, 5 average users, and 5 infrequent users) selected based on survey responses, were interviewed. Finally, survey data was gathered from 7 online facilitators to understand their role in the community. Data collected from these 21 community members and 5 facilitating members suggest that highly active users (logging into the workspace daily), were more likely to have transformative experiences, co-create knowledge, feel ownership of community knowledge, have extended opportunities for community exchange, and find new forms of evaluation. Average users shared some similar characteristics with both the highly active members and infrequent users, representing a group in transition as they become more engaged and active in the online workspace. Inactive users viewed the workspace as having little value, being difficult to navigate, being mainly for gaining basic information about events and community news, and as another demand on their time. Results show the online workspace component of the Earth Science Education and Outreach Forum is playing an important and emerging role for this community by supporting knowledge building and knowledge sharing, and growing in value for those that utilizing it more frequently. The evidence suggests that with increased participation or “usage” comes increased value to the participant and the organization. This research illustrates the possible change in mindset held by participating community members when it comes to the nature of co-location. Additionally, it may be of particular importance in exploring changes in the community members’ feelings of connection and belonging.",

            "abstract": "There are various propositions to explain the formation of the Solar System, yet the information we have about the processes in the proto-Sun is not sufficient to explain its evolution. Studies on chondritic meteorites have shown that they have been formed in the early stages of Solar system growth. Similarly, comets that are mixtures of frozen volatiles and nonvolatile dust carry contents that can provide information about the dynamic processes in the nascent solar nebula. Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the Solar System, and its isotope variability shows indications of a wide range of phenomena such as CO self-shielding and secondary nucleosynthesis. The study of Oxygen isotopes in the nascent solar nebula itself enlightens some of the aforementioned processes as well as magnetic properties of the proto-Sun. Rosetta, an ESA cornerstone mission with a NASA contribution, is on its way to visit comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014. Instruments on board will sample the 16O, 17O, 18O content of this primitive body.\nIn this paper, we would like to address the potential for creation of reservoirs for the stable isotopes of oxygen, and their water isotopologues, including the imposition of radial excursions of proto-coronal flow on the inner edge of the proto-solar disc. The University of Michigan Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (AMPS) code is used in this study. The AMPS code employs the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method to solve Boltzmann Equation for probabilistic distributions of particles in rarefied gas flows. The magnetic and electric field structures are embedded in the model. The magnetic field is a scalar bipolar field, which is characterized by negative polarity surrounded by positive polarity that is similar to that of Coronal Bright Points observed in the Sun. Prelminary results from the study include oxygen formation via collisions, and other processes, in preparation for isotope fractionation work in future steps.\nThis project was supported at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA.",

            "abstract": "Indicators of climate change are designed to communicate key aspects of the status and trends of the physical climate, climate impacts, vulnerabilities, and preparedness to inform both decision makers and the public. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides a suite of “Indicators of Climate Change” and the US Global Change Research Program delivers indicators via its “Global Change Information System” (GCIS). The process of research, development and delivery of appropriate indicators of linked to climate change faces challenges including but not limited to (1) lack of data for relevant variables across longitudinal time scales with a defined relationship to climate variation or change, (2) sufficient density and distribution of data across spatial scales to support indicator development for researchers, natural resource managers and decision-makers, and (3) limited engagement of intended stakeholders who may not understand how the data were derived or the potential application of the indicator to their domain. Recent advances in the field of public participation in scientific research (PPSR), also known as “citizen science,” represents a potential innovation in monitoring, research, information management and public engagement that can address several of these challenges. Citizen science datasets already available can be decades long and collected at many sites across broad spatial scales; by their nature, they create direct engagement with stakeholders and the public. For example, bird distribution data collected by citizen scientists participating in the continental-scale Christmas Bird Count since 1900 are used in EPA’s indicator for “Bird Wintering Ranges.” Similarly, plant leafing data collected across the nation since 1956 are combined with meteorological data to create a modeled indicator of plant leafing dates for the GCIS. This presentation will focus on (1) challenges to the development of ecological indicators of biodiversity linked to environmental variation and climate change, (2) how citizen science can address these challenges within suitable domains or disciplines, and (3) minimal requirements for citizen science projects to maximize their contribution to the production of high-quality, traceable indicators of biodiversity.",

            "abstract": "Exchanges of carbon, water, and energy between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere not only influence Earth’s climate, but they are also sensitive to climate change. Terrain complexity (e.g. slope, aspect, upslope accumulated area and other variables) have the potential to mediate the sensitivity of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (RE) to climate variability by influencing soil water availability, which in turn mediates the sensitivity of terrestrial ecosystem fluxes to temperature and precipitation. Here we use 178 site-years of data from 31 different sites across the Ameriflux network to investigate the following questions: (1) How sensitive are NEE, GPP and RE to temperature and precipitation across a wide range of temporal scales, climate, vegetation and terrain conditions? (2) Where and when does terrain complexity mediate the sensitivity of NEE, GPP and RE to climate variability? and (3) Does terrain complexity provide a basic template to help to predict the sensitivities of NEE, GPP and RE to climate despite biophysical differences across sites? Our results suggest that temperature sensitivity of NEE, GPP and RE across sites was strongest at the daily timescale whereas sensitivity to precipitation was greater at the annual timescale. The magnitude of such sensitivities varied greatly among sites, suggesting the existence of locally imposed controls, including terrain complexity. Overall, NEE, GPP and RE sensitivities to temperature and precipitation were found to be influenced by slope and aspect across sites; however, other terrain variables such as upslope accumulated area help explain the climate sensitivity observed at certain sites. Altogether, our results suggest that terrain complexity does contribute to the sensitivity of terrestrial ecosystem fluxes to climate variability; therefore, our understanding of terrestrial carbon cycling may be improved by considering terrain complexity in addition to ecological characteristics as indicators of how terrestrial landscapes respond to climate variability and climate change.",

            "abstract": "We study energy conversion and particle acceleration during magnetic reconnection starting from a force-free current layer using two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and high-Lundquist-number MHD simulations. In PIC simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection, pressure anisotropy develops and is found to be stronger for particles with higher energies. When an external guide field is added, the pressure anisotropy is stronger with the magnitude of guide field. The energy conversion and particle acceleration through particle guiding center drifts, magnetization current, and parallel electric field are quantitatively evaluated and compared for a range of guide fields. The results are then explained using an electric current description associated with pressure anisotropy. This description is further used to study energy conversion during reconnection in high-Lundquist-number MHD simulations, where plasma pressure is assumed to be isotropic, and energy conversion is from compressional and Ohmic heating. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the influence of anisotropic velocity distributions on particle acceleration during magnetic reconnection.",

As demonstrated for a number of sensors (Polder, Meris) the molecular scattering signal may be used as a calibration source in the visible. The quality of the calibration depends in large part on controlling unavoidable contributions to the top of atmosphere reflectance such as gaseous transmittance, aerosols and variations in marine reflectance. The effect of a number of these parameters on the calibration uncertainty and their relative contribution to the calibration error budget is quantified. The technique is then applied to SNPP VIIRS bands M1 (412 nm) through M5 (672 nm).",

Rangelands in the Great Basin are of important ecological and economic significance for the United States; however, 40% of public rangelands fail to meet required health standards set by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This project provided a set of assessment tools for researchers and land managers that integrate remotely-sensed and in situ datasets to quantify and mitigate threats to public lands in the Great Basin ecoregion. The study area, which accounts for 20% of the total Great Basin ecoregion, was analyzed using 30 m resolution data from Landsat 8. Present conditions were evaluated from vegetation indices, landscape features, hydrological processes, and atmospheric conditions derived from the remotely-sensed data and validated with available in situ ground survey data, provided by the BLM. Rangeland health metrics were developed and landscape change drivers were identified. Subsequently, projected climate conditions derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) were used to forecast the impact of changing climatic conditions within the study area according to the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 projections. These forecasted conditions were used in the Maximum Entropy Model (MaxEnt) to predict areas at risk for rangeland degradation on 30 year intervals for 2040, 2070, and 2100. Finally, vegetation health risk maps were provided to the project partners to aid in future land management decisions in the Great Basin ecoregion. These tools provide a low cost solution to assess landscape conditions, provide partners with a metric to identify potential problematic areas, and mitigate serious threats to the ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Reservoirs are one of the main infrastructures that provide resilience against extremes (e.g., floods and droughts) and they play a key role in water resources management. Based on International Commission of Large Dams (ICOLD 2003) records, the total volume of reservoirs is over 6200 km3, which is twice larger than the global annual water use estimated as 3000 km3. Just a simple comparison of the two numbers indicates the importance of reservoirs and their role in providing resilience for water security. On the other hand, man-made reservoirs change the water distribution throughout the year. Most climate change impact studies ignore the role of reservoirs in water availability studies. However, water availability cannot be properly assessed without a thorough assessment of reservoir conditions. By combining classical methods for climate variability assessment (top-down approach) and influence assessment (bottom-up approach), this study offers a hybrid framework that integrates different drivers of water storage vulnerability. Final index is termed as the Multivariate Standardized Reliability and Resilience Index (MSRRI). This index investigates the adaptive capacity of the reservoir and exposure of the system to variable conditions. MSRRI has been investigated over several major reservoirs in Australia and California, United States. This presentation reviews recent findings and discusses reservoir conditions in Australia and California using MSRRI under different climatic change scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Fire reduces soil CO2 concentration by destroying vegetation and soil dwelling microbial communities thus reducing both heterotrophic and autotrophic contributions to soil respiration. While reductions in microbial respiration are short-lived, root respiration can take longer to recover, depending on the dominant growth forms (e.g. trees vs herbs) and modes of post-fire recovery (e.g. resprouting vs seedling establishment). This study aimed to quantify whether soil CO2 concentration was reduced ~5 years and ~10 years after a fire in a subalpine karst environment in south-eastern Australia and to consider the implications for karst dissolution processes and speleothem growth rate. Paired sites with burnt and unburnt soil were compared with regards to CO2 concentrations, soil moisture and soil temperature. Samples were taken from a grassland site and woodland site burnt ~5 years ago and a woodland site burnt ~10 years ago. The results showed that soil respiration was depressed in burnt sites relative to the unburnt pair in both the grassland and woodland sites after ~5 years; however, after ~10 years there was no significant difference between the burnt and control woodland sites. This indicates that soil CO2 concentration takes between 5-10 years to return to pre-fire levels in subalpine environments in south-eastern Australia. In a karst environment, this long-term reduction in soil CO2 concentration caused by fire is likely to cause a decreased stalagmite growth that could be incorrectly attributed to multiannual climatic drying, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, when reconstructing past environmental change from stalagmite records.",

            "abstract": "Sulfur isotope ratio data (δ34S) have been used to provide significant insights into global biogeochemical cycling over Earth history, providing a framework for reconstructing both global redox budgets and microbial metabolic activity. However, as the record of ancient oceanic conditions becomes better resolved, reports of coeval but divergent isotopic proxies are becoming increasingly common. These sulfur isotope records are characterized not just by divergent δ34S values, but also by differences in the spatial signature and magnitude of isotopic variability. Such discordant data suggest that we do not fully understand how isotopic signatures are incorporated and eventually preserved in the rock record. Here we examine the spatial signature and magnitude of isotopic variability in modern marine systems as a function of depositional environment and differential microbial metabolic activity. Varying depositional conditions, particularly sedimentary reworking, are seen to play a major role in generating and modifying the isotopic signatures of sulfur phases in modern environments. These observations can be extrapolated to investigate records of sulfur cycling in ancient strata. The results suggest that many apparent secular δ34S trends may be related to changing depositional environment rather than changes in the global sulfur cycle. Further, this environmental dependence can also help explain coeval but discordant δ34S data from within and between sedimentary basins. Together, these observations provide new insights that enable us to reflect on and refine our interpretations of chemostratigraphic δ34S data that have the potential to constrain the behavior of the sulfur cycle over geological timescales.",

As part of a field campaign with controlled methane releases at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC), a number of methane plumes were clearly visible at multiple flux rates and flight altitudes. Images of plumes appeared consistent with wind directions measured at ground stations and were present for fluxes as low as 14.2 cubic meters of methane per hour, equivalent to 0.09 kt/year. Direct comparison of results from AVIRISng and plume dispersion models is ongoing and will be used to assess the potential of constraining emission fluxes using AVIRISng. Methane plumes observed at RMOTC with the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) will also be presented. This controlled release experiment was used to determine the methane sensitivity of AVIRISng and inform sensor design for future imaging spectrometers that could constrain natural and anthropogenic methane emissions on local and regional scales. Imaging spectrometers permit direct attribution of emissions to individual point sources which is particularly useful given the large uncertainties associated with anthropogenic emissions, including industrial point source emissions and fugitive methane from the oil and gas industry.\nFigure caption: a.

This fluid undergoes a controlled and large volume expansion with a simultaneous increase in viscosity triggered by CO2 at EGS temperatures. We are presenting here the results of laboratory-scale hydraulic fracturing experiment using the fluid on small cylindrical rock cores (1.59 cm in diameter and 5.08 cm in length) from the Coso geothermal field in California. Rock samples consisted of Mesozoic diorite metamorphosed to greenschist facies. The experiments were conducted on 5 samples for realistic ranges of pressures (up to 275 bar) and temperatures (upt to 210 °C) for both the rock samples and the injected fluid. After fracturation, cores were subjected to a CO2 leakage test, injection of KI solution, and X-ray microtomography (XMT) scanning to examine the formation and distribution of fractures. The design and conduct of these experiments will be presented and discussed in details.\nBased on the obtained XMT images, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were then performed to visualize hydraulic fractures and compute the bulk permeability. OpenFOAM (OpenCFD Ltd., Reading, UK), was used to solve the steady state simulation. The flow predictions, based upon the laminar, 3-D, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for fluid mass and momentum, show the remarkable stimulation of the permeability in the core samples and demonstrate the efficiency of such a CO2 triggered fluid in EGS.",

            "abstract": "How the dynamics in the near-earth plasma sheet affects the heavy ion content, and therefore the ion pressure, of the ring current in Earth's magnetosphere is an outstanding question. Substorms accelerate plasma in the near-earth region and drive outflow from the aurora, and both these processes can preferentially enhance the population of heavy ions in this region. These heavy ions are then driven into the inner magnetosphere during storms. Thus understanding how the composition of the ring current changes requires simultaneous observations in the near-earth plasma sheet and in the inner magnetosphere. We use data from the CODIF instrument on Cluster and HOPE, RBSPICE, and MagEIS instruments on the Van Allen Probes to study the acceleration and transport of ions from the plasma sheet into the ring current. During the main phase of a geomagnetic storm on Aug 4-6, 2013, the Cluster spacecraft were moving inbound in the midnight central plasma sheet, while the apogees of the two Van Allen Probes were located on the duskside. The Cluster spacecraft measure the composition and spectral changes in the plasma sheet, while the Van Allen Probes measure the ions that reach the inner magnetosphere. A strong increase in 1-40 keV O+ was observed at the Cluster location during the storm main phase, and the Van Allen Probes observed both H+ and O+ being driven deep into the inner magnetosphere. By comparing the variations in phase space density (PSD) vs. magnetic moment at the Cluster and the Van Allen Probes locations, we examine how the composition changes non-adiabatically in the near-earth plasma sheet, and how those changes are propagated into the inner magnetosphere, populating the hto ion ring current.",

            "abstract": "Predictability of ENSO events depends on the existence and identification of appropriate precursors. Several ENSO precursors have been identified in the literature, both within the Tropics and extratropics. The extra-tropical influences may occur through SST anomalies in the form of “Meridional Modes” in both the northern and southern Hemispheres, as well as SST anomalies in the Western North Pacific. The relative roles of these different types of precursors are, however, still unclear, partly because they also depend upon the background state of the equatorial ocean in ways that are poorly understood at present.\nIn this study we investigate the efficiency of different aspects of ENSO precursor patterns in generating ENSO. We do this using the well-established Linear Inverse Modeling (LIM) methodology, which objectively identifies optimal initial conditions for ENSO development through a singular vector analysis of the appropriate system evolution operator. We perform this analysis using different observational and climate model datasets. The emphasis is on assessing the importance of local versus remote influences at different stages of ENSO development, and on the interplay between the surface and subsurface variations on that development.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we report results and discussion on the physical properties estimation of carbonate rocks using pore microstructures. We obtained high-resolution 3D microstructures with different porosity-types (inter-particle, vuggy/moldic, and fracture) from the X-ray microtomography technique. We calculated permeability, electrical conductivity, and P-wave velocity using the Lattice-Boltzmann method and finite element methods. We also applied the pore-scale simulation techniques to different sub-blocks from the original 3D pore geometry (2,0003 voxels) to determine the heterogeneity of pore geometry. For the inter-particle porosity-type, the calculated transport properties (permeability and electrical conductivity) show very similar trends to clastic sediments. These relations can be modeled by common empirical relations such as Kozeny-Carman relation for porosity-permeability or Archie’s equation for porosity-formation factor. For the vuggy or fracture porosity-type, it is difficult to determine any consistent relations; therefore we tried to build conceptual models with cracks or vugs to establish quantitative relations. On the other hand, P-wave velocity showed very little dependence on the porosity-types, due to high frame stiffness of carbonate rocks.\nAcknowledgements: This research was supported by the Basic Research Project of the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy of Korea (GP2012-029).",

            "abstract": "Great earthquakes with magnitudes equal to or greater than 9.0 rarely occur over the globe. The influence of great earthquake on intraplate regions in regional distances has been poorly known. The Korean Peninsula belongs to intraplate regime with low seismicity, and is located in the far-eastern Eurasia plate. The instrumental seismicity present diffused seismicity with relatively high population around paleo-tectonic regions. The Korean Peninsula is placed at about 1300 km away from the 2011 M9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Earthquakes triggered by the Tohoku-Oki megathrust are searched from continuous waveform data using an automated event detection algorithm. The detection algorithm is to find the optimum event location where inner product of theoretical and observed STA/LTA of the waveform is maximized at hypothetical origin time. Events are declared when the inner product is greater than an empirically determined threshold. The detected events are approved after manual examination of signals. Sixty-one earthquakes with magnitudes of 0.5-2.5 are detected in the Korean Peninsula within 18 hours after the megathrust, including 17 clustered earthquakes in northwestern peninsula. The spatial distribution of clustered events suggests\n∼\n279\n∘\n-directional strike-slip faulting. This fault geometry comprises a situation in which the great-circle direction is approximately subparallel with the fault strike. Most events occurred within 5 hours after the mainshock, yielding the p-value of\n∼\n1.0 in Omori's law. The elevated Gutenberg-Richter (GR) a value suggests the increase of seismicity after the megathrust. The spatial distribution of seismicity, GR b values, and focal mechanisms solutions of triggered events are consistent with those of natural earthquakes before the megathrust. The observations suggest that only the occurrence rates were increased for dynamic stress change inducing increase of pore pressure by fluid transfer or fault weakening by fault plane alteration. An exceptionally large frictional rate change is observed, suggesting the influence of lithospheric dislocations and strong passage of transient waves.",

            "abstract": "Managing landscapes for conservation requires a capacity to measure habitat quality. Although multiple factors are often responsible for the distribution and abundance of herbivores, spatial variations in the quality and quantity of plant forage are known to be important for many species. While we cannot see the chemical complexity of landscapes with our naked-eye, advances in imaging spectroscopy are making it possible to assess the quality of forage on a landscape-scale. Much research in this area has focused on the ability to estimate foliar nitrogen (N), because N is believed to be a limiting nutrient for many leaf eating animals. However, the total quantity of foliar N does not necessarily reflect the amount of N that can be utilized by herbivores. Available nitrogen (AvailN) is an invitro measure of forage quality that integrates the influence of tannins and fibre on the amount of foliar N that is available for digestion by herbivores. This may be a more meaningful measure of forage quality than total N for the many herbivorous species that are sensitive to the effects of tannins. Our previous research has demonstrated that it is possible to estimate this integrated measure of foliar nutritional quality at an individual tree crown level across multiple tree species using imaging spectroscopy (HyMap). Here we present a case study of how this remote sensing data is being used to help inform landscape management and conservation decisions for an iconic Australian species, the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). We review the methods involved in developing maps of integrated measures of foliar nutritional quality for browsing herbivores with airborne imaging spectroscopy data and discuss their applications for wildlife management.",

            "abstract": "Some of the main factors that contribute to changes in multiple ionospheric parameters are solar flux, geomagnetic activity, seasonal behavior, and coupling with lower atmosphere, which is particularly strong during sudden stratospheric warming events (SSW). Studying the way that these factors induce changes in the ionosphere is important, since these changes can have a negative effect on different types of communication systems. Multiple case studies have demonstrated large variations in ionospheric electron density in association with SSW in the low-latitude ionosphere, in particular near the crests of the equatorial ionization anomaly. However, the latitudinal extend of these variations was not addressed. In this study, we utilize data obtained in Puerto Rico by three instruments - Ramey digisonde, Arecibo Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) and GPS receivers to analyze four winter-time periods: two years with major SSW events (2005-2006, 2012-2013) and two years with minor SSW events (2006-2007, 2013-2014). In addition, selected cases represent two winters with low solar activity and two winters with moderate to high solar activity. The study focuses on the location of Arecibo, Puerto Rico (18.34°N, 66.75°W), ~15° to the north of the northern crest of the equatorial ionization anomaly. We report good agreement in ionospheric parameters between all three instruments. To investigate possible association with SSW events, we remove influences of seasonal behavior, solar flux, and geomagnetic activity by building empirical model and subtracting expected variations from the observational data. The analysis of residuals between the data and the model shows that ionospheric disturbances were observed in Puerto Rico for both minor and major SSW events in the ISR, digisonde and GPS Total Electron Content (TEC) data. We report 20-60% variations in NmF2 and TEC due to SSW effects. Large variations are also observed in electron density, electron temperature and plasma velocity during both daytime and nighttime.",

            "abstract": "Large earthquakes have long recurrence intervals. It is crucial to consider long-time seismicity for a proper assessment of potential seismic hazards. It is required to use historical earthquake records to complement the long-time seismicity records. Historical earthquake records remain as in seismic damage description with limited accuracy in source parameters including event location and its size. It is important to determine epicenters and magnitudes of historical earthquakes accurately. A noble method to determine the event location and magnitude from historical seismic damage records is introduced. Seismic damage is typically proportional to the event magnitude, and is inversely proportional to the distance. This feature allows us to deduce the event magnitude and location from spatial distribution of seismic intensities. However, the magnitude and distance trade off each other, inhibiting unique determination of event magnitude and location. The Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude relationship is additionally considered to constrain the source parameters. The Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude relationship is assumed to be consistent between instrumental and historical seismicity. A set of event location and magnitude that satisfy the chance of event occurrence according to the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude relationship is selected. The accuracy of the method is tested for synthetic data sets, and the validity of the method is examined. The synthetic tests present high accuracy of the method. The method is applied to historical seismic damage records, which allows us to calibrate the source parameters of historical earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The Seto Inland Sea (SIS), which is surrounded by Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku islands, is the largest enclosed sea in Japan. Water and bottom environments there deteriorated due to various anthropogenically-induced environmental changes from 1955 to 1973 (e.g. Yanagi, 2008). Then, several effluents have been regulated since the 1980s. Diatoms are one of important unicellular algae as a primary producer in waters. As diatoms respond rapidly to the nutrient supply in waters, they are good indicator of eutrophication. Thus, we clarified the spatio-temporal changes of diatom thanatocoenoses in Harima-Nada, eastern part of the SIS, and compared them with previous results in other areas in the SIS (Hirose et al., 2008; Hirose and Gotoh, 2009; Sako et al., unpublished data) to discuss the relationship between diatom thanatocoenoses and degree of anthropogenically-induced environmental changes in the SIS. The surface and/or core sediments were collected from the northern, northwestern, and southern parts of Harima-Nada. We conducted 14C, 210Pb and 137Cs dating of cores, diatom analysis, CHNS analysis, and grain size analysis of sediment samples. The results showed that marine environments in all areas of Harima-Nada deteriorated recently and the abundance of planktonic diatoms increased due to intense eutrophication. The comparison with the present and previous studies lead that Neodelphineis pelagica, small Thalassiosira spp., and resting spores of Chaetoceros spp. dominated other taxa in the most areas of the SIS since the mid-20th century, and the relative frequencies of the latter two taxa seem to be useful indicators for evaluating modern marine conditions.\n",

            "abstract": "Hydro-meteorological hazards can have cascading effects and far-reaching implications on water security, with socio-economic and environmental consequences. Worldwide the magnitude of recent floods highlight the necessity to generate a better understanding on their causes and associated risk. An improved flood risk strategy should incorporate the communication of uncertain research results to decision-makers. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to generate a robust framework that enables its quantification. The purpose of this study is to investigate the propagation of meteorological uncertainty within a cascade modelling approach to flood mapping. The methodology is comprised of a Numerical Weather Prediction Model (NWP), a distributed rainfall-runoff model and a standard 2D hydrodynamic model. The cascade of models is used to reproduce an extreme flood event that took place in Southern Mexico, during September 2013. The event is selected as high quality field data (e.g. LiDAR; rain gauges) and satellite imagery are available. Uncertainty in the meteorological model (Weather Research and Forecasting model) is evaluated through the use of a multi-physics ensemble technique, which considers twelve parameterisation schemes to determine a given precipitation. The resulting precipitation fields are used as input in a distributed hydrological model, enabling the determination of different hydrographs associated to this event. Lastly, by means of a standard 2D hydrodynamic model, resulting hydrographs are used as forcing conditions to study the propagation of the meteorological uncertainty to an estimated flooded area. Results show the utility of the selected modelling approach to investigate error propagation within a cascade of models. Moreover, the error associated to the determination of the runoff, is showed to be lower than that obtained in the precipitation estimation suggesting that uncertainty do not necessarily increase within a model cascade.",

The prediction of potential maximum magnitudes of earthquakes is important for seismic hazard mitigation. In this study, we calculate the Coulomb stress changes around the active plate margins for 507 events with magnitudes greater than 7.0 during 1976-2013 to estimate the cumulative stress releases. We investigate the spatio-temporal variations of ambient stress field from the cumulative Coulomb stress changes as a function of plate motion speed, plate age and dipping angle. It is observed that the largest stress drop occur in relatively high plate velocity in the convergent margins between Nazca and South American plates, between Pacific and North American plates, between Philippine Sea and Eurasian plates, and between Pacific and Australian plates. It is intriguing to note that the great earthquakes such as Tohoku-Oki earthquake and Maule earthquake occur in the highest plate velocity. On the other hand, the largest stress drop occur in the margins with relatively slow plate speeds such as the boundaries between Cocos and North American plates and between Indo-Australian and Eurasian plates. Earthquakes occur dominantly in the regions with positive Coulomb stress changes, suggesting that post-earthquakes are controlled by the stresses released from prior earthquakes. We find strong positive correlations between Coulomb stress changes and plate speeds. The observation suggests that large stress drop was controlled by high plate speed, suggesting possible prediction of potential maximum magnitudes of events.",

            "abstract": "Besides global stressors such as temperature rise and acidification, local anthropogenic disturbances, especially those connected with tourism, affect many Atlantic patch reefs off the Brazilian shore. Using reef-inhabiting foraminifera with algal symbionts as environmental indicators, we confirmed this problem in coastal reefs near Natal, Rio Grande do Norte. The foraminiferal community is particularly depauperate in the small reefs of Pirangi, about 25 km south of Natal (~6o S, water depth <5-m), showing the result of numerous tourists trampling or otherwise damaging the reef substrate. Shells of Amphistegina gibbosa, the characteristic reef foraminifer of tropical America, have an exceptionally patchy distribution here, with rare living individuals. A few other symbiont bearers, e.g. Archaias angulatus, Amphisorus hemprichii, and Heterostegina antillarum, are present, but in extremely small numbers. In general, the dominant species is Quinqueloculina lamarckiana, a eurytopic, small miliolid (without symbionts), but many specimens are brown or black, indicating a mixing of relict and living populations. Compared to known foraminiferal communities in other Brazilian reefs, species diversity at Pirangi is remarkably low. About 77 km north of Pirangi, in the more extensive patch reef system of Maracajaú, the foraminiferal community is apparently healthier, except in an area targeted for tourism. However, living Amphistegina is still rare, and the only living Amphisorus is found in seagrass habitats. In contrast, many symbiont-bearing taxa, including peneroplids (virtually absent in Pirangi and Maracajaú) exist in sizeable populations northwest of Maracajaú, in the small patch reefs of the drowned Açu river valley (~4o 50’ S).",

            "abstract": "The Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle refers to a sequence of abrupt climate change events during the last glacial period with a recurrence interval of 1470 years. Each event was associated with rapid, 5-10 C warming throughout much of the northern hemisphere and a more gradual 2 C cooling in the southern hemisphere. Although much has been learned about the potential mechanisms involved, the ultimate source of the 1470-yr periodicity of this climate signal is undetermined. Five theories have been proposed so far. Each identifies a causal agent with the requisite periodicity and a general mechanism to explain how its behavior could have induced global-scale climate change. Proposed agents include the ocean-atmosphere itself, the sun, the moon and the geomagnetic field. Proposed mechanisms include systematic variation in the thermohaline circulation of the ocean (‘salt oscillator’), the location of north Atlantic deepwater formation (‘stochastic resonator’), the intensity of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (‘super-ENSO’), the intensity of tidally-driven upwelling (‘super-tide’) and geomagnetically-induced cloud formation. This presentation lays the groundwork for the first theory to invoke the outer core. The theory identifies a causal agent with the requisite periodicity (the outer core’s azimuthal flow) and describes how systematic variation in its motion could have affected ocean-atmosphere motion and thus global climate during the last glacial period. Five criteria are used to evaluate the proposed theory and compare its performance to the other theories. Some ways to further test the new theory using paleoproxy data and data for the contemporary climate system are described.",

            "abstract": "Effective water resource management typically relies on numerical models to analyse groundwater flow and solute transport processes. These models are usually subject to model structure error due to simplification and/or misrepresentation of the real system. As a result, the model outputs may systematically deviate from measurements, thus violating a key assumption for traditional regression-based calibration and uncertainty analysis.\nOn the other hand, model structure error induced bias can be described statistically in an inductive, data-driven way based on historical model-to-measurement misfit. We adopt a fully Bayesian approach that integrates a Gaussian process error model to account for model structure error to the calibration, prediction and uncertainty analysis of groundwater models. The posterior distributions of parameters of the groundwater model and the Gaussian process error model are jointly inferred using DREAM, an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler.\nWe test the usefulness of the fully Bayesian approach towards a synthetic case study of surface-ground water interaction under changing pumping conditions. We first illustrate through this example that traditional least squares regression without accounting for model structure error yields biased parameter estimates due to parameter compensation as well as biased predictions. In contrast, the Bayesian approach gives less biased parameter estimates. Moreover, the integration of a Gaussian process error model significantly reduces predictive bias and leads to prediction intervals that are more consistent with observations. The results highlight the importance of explicit treatment of model structure error especially in circumstances where subsequent decision-making and risk analysis require accurate prediction and uncertainty quantification. In addition, the data-driven error modelling approach is capable of extracting more information from observation data than using a groundwater model alone.",

            "abstract": "Subduction to the west of South America spans 6000 km along strike and has been active for over 250 Myr. The influence of the history of subduction on the geodynamics of South America has been profound, driving mountain building and arc volcanism in the Andean Cordillera. Here, we investigate the long-wavelength changes in the topography of South America associated with subduction and plate motion and their interplay with the lithospheric deformation associated with the opening of the South Atlantic. We pay particular attention to the topographic expression of flat-lying subduction zones.\nWe develop time-dependent geodynamic models of mantle flow and lithosphere deformation to investigate the evolution of South American dynamic and total topography since the late Jurassic (150 Ma). Our models are semi-empirical because the computational cost of fully dynamic, evolutionary models is still prohibitive. We impose the kinematics of global plate reconstructions with deforming continents in forward global mantle convection models with compositionally distinct crust and continental lithosphere embedded within the thermal lithosphere. The shallow thermal structure of subducting slabs is imposed, allowing us to investigate the evolution of dynamic topography around flat slab segments in time-dependent models.\nMultiple cases are used to investigate how the evolution of South American dynamic topography is influenced by mantle viscosity, the kinematics of the opening of the South Atlantic and alternative scenarios for recent and past flat-slab subduction. We predict that the migration of South America over sinking oceanic lithosphere resulted in continental tilt to the west until ~ 45 Ma, inverting to an eastward tilt thereafter. This first-order result is consistent with the reversal of the drainage of the Amazon River system. We investigate which scenarios of flat-slab subduction since the Eocene are compatible with geological constraints on the evolution of the Solimoes Basin, the Chaco Basin, the Sierras Pampeanas and the Central Patagonian Basin. To broadly constrain mantle viscosity, we compare models to the total subsidence inferred from well data offshore Argentina and Brazil, and to mantle tomography, since the initial and boundary conditions are based on independent plate reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "The implementation of any real-time earthquake analysis for disaster mitigation requires not just scientific expertise and equipment but thoughtful, far-reaching, and long term education for emergency management personnel and the public. The “Cascadia EarthScope Earthquake and Tsunami Education Program” (CEETEP) is working to mitigate these potential disasters through collaboration building and professional development for K-12 teachers, park and museum interpreters, and emergency management outreach educators in communities along the Oregon and Washington coast (2013-2016). In this project nearly 150 coastal Cascadia educators are being introduced to critical knowledge about (among other things) earthquake monitoring and earthquake early warning systems. In collaboration last year with UNAVCO, CEETEP developed an animation explaining how GPS and seismic systems can work in concert to greatly enhance earthquake early warning systems for Cascadia and other subduction zone areas (\nwww.youtube.com/user/unavcovideos\n, “animations”). Science and preparedness educators are key partners in the endeavor of implementing earthquake and tsunami early warning systems. The knowledge of how to run effective professional development programs for such educators will greatly enhance outreach efforts.\nInitial results from CEETEP are very encouraging. Four of the planned six workshops were held in 2013 (northern coastal Oregon) and 2014 (Olympic Peninsula, Washington). Results from Year 1 show that participant content knowledge improved from 50% to 86% over the course of the workshop. Similarly, confidence in teaching about workshop topics increased from an average of 2.8 to 5.2 on a 6-point scale. Participant optimism about the efficacy and tractability of community-level planning also increased from 5.7 to 7.4 on a 9-point scale. Nearly 90% of participants continued to be active with the program through the time of the March 8, 2014 Share-a-thon and presented on a wide range of activities that they and their learners had undertaken related to earthquake and tsunami science and preparedness. Thousands of students, park visitors, and community members have subsequently learned Cascadia-specific earthquake and tsunami science and preparedness from CEETEP participant educators.",

            "abstract": "Field and laboratory measurements of the dielectric permittivity of first-year sea ice both show that below a frequency of about 10 Hz the real part of the relative permittivity (ε') increases with decreasing frequency. Field measurements in Barrow, Alaska and McMurdo Sound suggest that this rise in low frequency ε' steepens as the ice warms, and is confined primarily to the upper 0.50m of the ice cover as it approaches maximum thickness. We propose that this behaviour may be related to membrane polarization occurring in the pore structure within the ice. With ice-liquid interfaces carrying a net charge, an electric double layer forms within the brine filled pores. Polarization occurs at grain boundaries, intragranular films and “necks” in the pore structure where the effective thickness of the double layer approaches the width of the pore resulting in differential transport of ions. This process is dependent on both the characteristic lengths and radii of pores relative to the length and radii of the “necks” or the geometry of inter/intragranular brine layers. By representing the measured dielectric permittivity in terms of a Cole-Cole model it is possible to show that the distribution of pore sizes evolves with temperature. Derived values of complex conductivity are also examined in relationship to the temporal evolution of pore geometry including smoothness of the pore-ice interface.",

For example, given a contaminant transport model in a regional aquifer with specified porosity, initial concentrations, etc., we may analyze remediation strategies in order to achieve threshold tolerances in certain wells. Solution to this prediction problem is complicated by several sources of uncertainty. A primary source of uncertainty is in the specification of the input data and parameters that characterize the physical properties of a given state of the system. It is often impossible to experimentally observe the input data and parameters that characterize the physical properties of the modeled system, and any observable QoI are generally of the state of the system itself and may differ substantially from the QoI to be predicted. Thus, we must first solve an inverse problem using observable QoI to quantify uncertainties in the inputs to the model. ",

            "abstract": "Paratethys is a large epicontinental sea, stretching from Germany to China at the beginning of the Oligocene (~34 Myr ago), that progressively retreated by a complex combination of basin infill, glacio-eustatic sea-level lowering and tectonic uplift to its present-day remnants: Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Aral Lake. Paratethys experienced major paleoenvironmental changes towards anoxic, hypersaline, and fresh water conditions. An accurate geological time scale (GTS) is crucial to understand the timing and rates of these change and to determine the underlying mechanisms. Geological time scales for the Paratethys region are notoriously controversial and encompass mainly regional stages, which are all defined on the basis of characteristic faunal assemblages (mainly mollusks and ostracods) endemic to the Paratethys Sea.\nDuring the last decade, we have performed numerous integrated magneto-biostratigraphic studies on the Mio-Pliocene sedimentary successions of the Eastern Paratethys, which resulted in revised chronological frameworks for the Dacian, Black Sea and Caspian Sea basins. This allows high-resolution stratigraphic correlations between the individual Paratethys subbasins and with the Mediterranean successions and help to better understand the dramatic paleoenvironmental changes in the region, such as the Messinian Salinity Crisis. Rock magnetic analyses of the sedimentary sequences of the Paratethys indicate that greigite is the main magnetic carrier and that a range of magnetic properties cannot be explained by the presence of diagenetic greigite, but are instead consistent with those expected for a biogenetic (bacterial) origin.",

            "abstract": "The Na exosphere of Mercury is flux-limited, and a careful accounting of the surface reservoir is necessary in order to understand the relative importance of proposed source mechanisms for this exosphere. At the Moon, a similar analysis has not yet been performed, but recent data acquired by the Kaguya spacecraft suggest an analogous depletion of the dayside reservoir for exospheric Na. New measurements of the lunar exosphere obtained by the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) and of Mercury's exosphere by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft provide the opportunity to constrain the main parameters determining the reservoirs for these exospheres. We present a model of the exosphere-surface system that attempts to unify these two datasets. We have developed a simulator that accepts as input partially constrained microphysical parameters of the gas-surface interaction (e.g., source rates/cross sections for different source processes, degree of thermal accommodation) to make testable predictions regarding the exosphere and uppermost surface (top 10-10 m). These flux-balance simulations demonstrate that the lunar exosphere is limited by the recycling rate of Na atoms mobilized by micrometeoroid vaporization. An important consequence is that, to obtain consistency with ground-based observations of the Na exosphere, the inferred impact vapor at the Moon must peak near the equator and decrease towards the poles because of migration of surface particles toward the poles through exospheric transport. Micrometeoroid streams can have a long-term effect on the lunar exosphere because, as shown in our model, particles introduced by such streams survive in the soil and exosphere for at least two lunations. Important but secondary effects must be provided by the solar wind in order to account for the variations observed within one lunation by LADEE. In its application to Mercury, the code uses new estimates of the micrometeoroid impact vaporization rate and solar wind influx onto Mercury's high-latitude regions. We demonstrate that a model similar to that for the Moon can approximately reproduce the near-surface densities and the dawn-dusk asymmetry in the Na exosphere observed by MESSENGER during part of a Mercury year.",

            "abstract": "Global flood modelling is a relatively new framework in earth system studies, and there still exist many rooms for improving model physics. A typical grid size of global models (generally >5 km) is coarser than the scale of the topography of river channels and floodplains, therefore flood dynamics in global flood models is represented by sub-grid parameterization. Here, we introduce two latest updates in flood dynamics parameterization, i.e. channel bifurcation scheme and global river width database.\nThe upstream-downstream relationship of model grids is prescribed (i.e. parameterized) by a river network map, where each grid has been assumed to have only one downstream grid. We abandoned this “only one downstream” assumption, and succeeded to represent channel bifurcation in a global flood model. The new bifurcation scheme was tested in the Mekong River, and showed the importance of channel bifurcation in mega-delta hydrodynamics.\nChannel cross-sectional shape has been parameterized using an empirical equation of discharge (or drainage area), and it is a major source of uncertainties in global flood modelling. We recently developed a fully-automated algorithm to calculate river width from satellite water mask. By applying this algorithm to SRTM Water Body Data, the Global Width Database for Large Rivers (GWD-LR) was constructed. The difference between the satellite-based width and empirically-estimated width is very large, suggesting the difficulty of river width parameterization by an empirical equation.\nImprovement in flood dynamics parameterization reduces uncertainties in global flood simulations. This enables advanced validation/calibration of global flood models, such as direct comparison against satellite altimeters. A future strategy for advanced model validation/calibration will be mentioned in the conference presentation.",

            "abstract": "Rapid, millennial-scale climate events characterised the last global glacial-interglacial transition (18-11 ka). In New Zealand, the timing and magnitude of climatic events during this period are poorly understood. Improving our understanding of these events will help to identify the mechanisms via which rapid shifts in climate occur. In this study, we report results from geomorphological mapping, cosmogenic 3He exposure dating and numerical glacier modelling, which show evidence for re-advance of mountain glaciers on Mt Ruapehu in central North Island, New Zealand (39°S) during the late glacial chron (15-11 ka). Using a distributed energy balance model, coupled with a 2D ice flow model, we perform a range of experiments and sensitivity analyses to constrain estimates of past temperature associated with the mapped and dated former ice limits. We find that glaciers in North Island re-advanced early in the late glacial period in response to a likely temperature cooling of 2.5 - 3.4 °C relative to present day, assuming precipitation remained within ± 20% of present. This reconstructed cooling is greater than recorded in nearby pollen archives, which may reflect a seasonal bias between climate proxies. Using our glacier model, we quantify the length sensitivity of glaciers on Mt. Ruapehu to seasonal climate changes. We find that a 3 °C cooling relative to present causes a c. 80% increase in glacier length when applied to the austral summer months (Dec-Feb), compared to c. 20% in winter (June-August). Thus, glaciers in North Island, New Zealand are most sensitive to temperature changes during summer. Strong agreement between our late-glacial reconstructions and other summer temperature proxy records (e.g. mountain glaciers, chironomids) from the Southern Alps, suggest New Zealand experienced uniform summertime cooling during the late-glacial climate reversal.",

            "abstract": "Water accounting is becoming critical globally, and balancing consumptive water demands with environmental water requirements is especially difficult in in arid and semi-arid regions. Within the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia, riparian water use has not been assessed across broad scales. This study therefore aimed to apply and validate an existing U.S. riparian ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) algorithm for the MDB river systems to assist water resource managers to quantify environmental water needs over wide ranges of niche conditions. Ground-based sap flow ET was correlated with remotely sensed predictions of ET, to provide a method to scale annual rates of water consumption by riparian vegetation over entire irrigation districts. Sap flux was measured at nine locations on the Murrumbidgee River between July 2011 and June 2012. Remotely sensed ET was calculated using a combination of local meteorological estimates of potential ET (ETo) and rainfall and MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from selected 250 m resolution pixels. The sap flow data correlated well with MODIS EVI. Sap flow ranged from 0.81 mm/day to 3.60 mm/day and corresponded to a MODIS-based ET range of 1.43 mm/day to 2.42 mm/day. We found that mean ET across sites could be predicted by EVI-ETo methods with a standard error of about 20% across sites, but that ET at any given site could vary much more due to differences in aquifer and soil properties among sites. Water use was within range of that expected. We conclude that our algorithm developed for US arid land crops and riparian plants is applicable to this region of Australia. Future work includes the development of an adjusted algorithm using these sap flow validated results.",

            "abstract": "During the late Miocene, a dramatic global expansion of C4 plant distribution occurred with broad spatial and temporal variations. Although the event is well documented, whether subsequent expansions were caused by a decreased atmospheric CO2 concentration or climate change is a contentious issue. In the present study, we used an improved inverse vegetation modeling approach that accounts for the physiological responses of C3 and C4 plants to quantitatively reconstruct the paleoclimate in the Siwalik of Nepal based on pollen and carbon isotope data. We also studied the sensitivity of the C3 and C4 plants to changes in the climate and the atmospheric CO2 concentration. We suggest that the expansion of the C4 plant distribution during the late Miocene may have been primarily triggered by regional aridification and temperature increases. The expansion was unlikely caused by reduced CO2 levels alone. Our findings suggest that this abrupt ecological shift mainly resulted from climate changes related to the decreased elevation of the Himalayan foreland.",

            "abstract": "Methane migration is a crucial link between locations of methane generation and natural gas hydrate reservoirs, yet migration mechanisms are poorly understood in the natural environment. In this study, we evaluate constraints on methanogenesis and methane diffusion through the development of a 1-dimensional diagenetic model of the Gulf of Mexico Gas Hydrate Joint Industry Project Site Walker Ridge 313 in the Gulf of Mexico. High saturation gas hydrate was confirmed at Walker Ridge from borehole logs, which measured both high compressional velocity and high resistivity in hydrate-bearing sand layers. Gas hydrate formation depends largely on organic matter concentration and methanogenesis rates. We will test how much organic matter is required to achieve gas hydrate saturations observed at Walker Ridge. Our model will incorporate methane generation around a sand layer as it is moves down through the sediment column. Variable porosity across the sediment column due to early diagenesis and sediment compaction will also be considered. Since methane solubility is higher in finer grained sediments due to smaller pore spaces, gas hydrate will form in the sand layer from methane transported by the relatively slow process of diffusion from finer grained layers. The results of this model are critical to the development of the basin scale simulation of overall methane flux based on the geometry of WR313. The simulation results will improve scientific characterization of how hydrates form and distribute within continental margin sediments.",

            "abstract": "Field line resonances (FLR) often occur in the magnetosphere owing to the coupling of compressional and transverse waves in inhomogeneous space plasmas. It has been well known that the wave energy is transferred from the fast mode to standing shear Alfven mode or FLR, which have been extensively studied in the models of axisymmetric geometry. However, the realistic plasmasphere often shows serious asymmetry between the dawn- and dusk-side or around the different local times. In such fully three-dimensional nonuniform space, it has not been investigated until now how much the previous ansatz works well. In this study, we have developed a new 3-D model, which allows an arbitrarily non-axisymmetric plasmasphere in dipole geometry. We have performed three-dimensional MHD simulations to investigate how FLR are affected by the inhomogeneity along each direction. Our numerical results show that the FLR persist regardless of field-aligned inhomogeneity, but their nature of shear mode and its polarization is disturbed seriously by the non-axisymmetric plasmasphere. Its polarization pattern is found to vary with the local angle between the magnetic surface and the constant Alfven speed surface. It is shown how the FLR signals appear in each LT location when reasonable non-axisymmetric plasmaspheres are assumed, where both ground and space signals are compared and discussed compared to the previous axisymmetric cases.",

            "abstract": "In the North Atlantic Ocean, contour-following bottom currents have eroded regional unconformities and deposited contourite drifts that exceed two km in thickness and extend for 100s of km. The character of deep-water masses that are conveyed through ocean basins by such currents influence global heat transfer and ocean-atmosphere partitioning of CO2. The Newfoundland Ridge Drift Complex lies directly under the modern Deep Western Boundary Current southeast of Newfoundland, close to the site of overturning in the northwest Atlantic Ocean and at the intersection of the warm Gulf Stream and cool Labrador surface currents. To the south are regions of the western North Atlantic basin that are influenced by southern- as well as northern-sourced bottom waters. Here, we document the evolution of North Atlantic deep-water circulation by seismic-stratigraphic analysis of the long-lived and areally extensive Newfoundland Ridge Drift Complex. IODP Expedition 342 boreholes provide age control on seismic units, allowing sedimentation patterns to be placed in a temporal framework.\nWe find three major phases of sedimentation: pre-contourite drift (~115-50 Ma), active contourite drift (~50-2.6 Ma), and late-contourite drift (~2.6-0 Ma). Bottom-current-controlled deposition of terrigenous-rich sediment began at ~50 Ma, which correlates to the onset of a long-term global cooling trend. A further change in deep circulation near the Eocene-Oligocene transition (~30 Ma) is indicated by more focused drift sedimentation with greatly increased accumulation rates and stratal architecture dominated by mud waves. At ~2.6 Ma to present the axis of drift accumulation shifted markedly towards shallower water depths, corresponding with the onset of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. We discuss how these reorganizations of deep circulation correlate with results of other North Atlantic seismic stratigraphic studies to the north and south.",

            "abstract": "With the Aquarius mission having completed its second full year of acquiring global sea surface salinity (SSS) measurements, many corrections were accounted for and biases were removed. However, some biases remain, keeping the mission from achieving its goal of +/- 0.2 psu accuracy for monthly products (150 km pixel size). Uncertainties in the Southern Ocean (among other biases) not only keep the mission from attaining such accuracy globally, but it also forces continued reliance on in situ point data sources. A Python script package is developed to process the Level 2 data for use, allowing users to target specific variables and to prepare ship and buoy data for analysis with the Aquarius data. To test the application of the scripting package, multiple assessments are completed. (1) The relationship between Aquarius brightness temperatures (Tb) and the percentage of ice and land cover is analyzed. Exponential and linear increases in Tb are observed with increasing ice and land, respectively. Little to no effect on Tb is found when there is less than 1% ice or land cover. (2) In situ SSS, in situ sea surface temperature (SST), and Aquarius Tb within a Response Surface Model are used to generate an equation to predict SSS using only Tb and SST as inputs. SSS is found strongly relying on SST, nearly removing the need for Aquarius Tb. While this does not assist in converting Aquarius Tb into SSS, the use of SST alone proved a significantly more accurate method in predicting SSS over current Aquarius estimations for the Southern Ocean. This is not to say that SST should be used to predict SSS, but rather that the two are highly linked. Discrepancies in the relationships between SSS, SST, and Tb require further investigation before SSS can be estimated from Tb­ in the Southern Ocean.",

            "abstract": "Deformation of the Mexican Ridges fold belt (MRFB), western Gulf of Mexico, initiated in the Late Neogene in response to normal faulting along the Quetzalcoatl Extensional System offshore Veracruz. Previous authors analyzed stacking patterns of growth strata concluding deformation occurred in two stages: the western section of the fold belt developed during the Upper Miocene whereas the eastern part became active during the Lower Pliocene. Here we analyze a regional seismic line to determine whether deformation migrated progressively eastward. In contrast to previous studies we do not use stacking patterns but excess area. This parameter provides direct information of both linear shortening, and superficial mass transport. We construct excess-area plots for each of the folds comprising the MRFB; from them we estimate the shortening and the degradation path of the seafloor deformed by folding. Moreover, by assuming denudation is in steady state, we are able to differentiate sediments derived locally from sediments transported from distant sources.\nResults show tectonic transport in the MRFB is 11.8 km; shortening of individual folds ranges 3-16%, with an average strain for the entire MRFB of ~10%; structures grew at a mean uplift rate of 0.2 mm/yr. We estimate the constant of mass diffusivity, which controls the rate of degradation, has a mean value of 0.27 m2/yr. This value is characteristic of rapid, episodic mass movements. Finally, the sedimentation rate is ~0.2 mm/yr. Those parameters, however, are not constant; they decrease toward the deepwater portion of the fold belt. The structures proximal to the continental shelf are rising rapidly and are being degraded more intensely than those in the distal part of the fold belt.\nOur results reveal that deformation started synchronously throughout the MRFB during the Late Miocene and not in two episodes as previously reported. The reason for the seeming discrepancy is due to the copious sedimentation in the eastern section of the fold belt with respect to tectonic uplift. This hindered the development of onlap and thinning upward patterns that commonly signal the beginning of fold growth. The delay, in turn, introduces a bias toward younger ages in the identification of the pre-growth/growth strata limit.",

Based on nonlinear wave growth theory of whistler-mode chorus emissions, we examined the applicability of the nonlinear theory to the discrete hiss emissions. We have generalized the derivation of optimum wave amplitudes for triggering rising tone chorus emissions for both falling and rising tone hiss elements. The amplitude profiles of the hiss emissions are well approximated by the optimum wave amplitudes for triggering rising or falling tones. Through formation of electron holes for rising tones and electron hills for falling tones, the coherent waves grow up to the optimum amplitudes. We find an excellent agreement between the optimum amplitudes and the observed amplitudes as a function of instantaneous frequency. The frequency sweep rates and time scales of the hiss emissions also agree those predicted by the nonlinear theory. Based on the theory, we can infer properties of energetic electrons generating hiss emissions in the equatorial region of the plasmasphere.",

            "abstract": "Knickpoints, or convexities in a stream’s longitudinal profile, often delineate boundaries in stream networks that separate reaches eroding at different rates resulting from sharp temporal or spatial changes in uplift rate, contributing drainage area, precipitation, or bedrock lithology. We explicitly defined the geometry of a knickpoint in a manner that can be identified using an algorithm which operates in accordance with the stream power incision model, using a chi-plot analysis approach. This method allows for comparison between the real stream profile extracted from a DEM, and a linear best-fit line profile in chi-elevation space, representing a steady state theoretical stream functioning in accordance to uniform temporal and spatial conditions listed above. Assessing where the stream of interest is “under-steepened” and “over-steepened” with respect to a theoretical linear profile reveals knickpoints as certain points of slope inflection, extractable by our algorithm. \nWe tested our algorithm on a 1m resolution LiDAR DEM of Santa Cruz Island (SCI), a tectonically active island 25km south of Santa Barbara, CA with an estimated uplift rate between 0.5 and 1.2mm/yr calculated from uplifted paleoshorelines. We have identified 1025 knickpoints using our algorithm and compared the position of these knickpoints to a similarly-sized dataset of knickpoints manually selected from distance-elevation longitudinal stream profiles for the same region. Our algorithm reduced mapping time by 99.3% and agreed with knickpoint positions from the manually selected knickpoint map for 85% of the 1025 knickpoints. Discrepancies can arise from inconsistencies in manual knickpoint selection that are not present in an automated computation. Additionally, the algorithm measures useful characteristics for each knickpoint allowing for quick statistical analyses. Histograms of knickpoint elevation and chi coordinate have a 3 peaked distribution, possibly expressing 3 levels of uplifted marine terrace platforms on SCI. Few knickpoints exist with a contributing drainage area >200,000m2, demonstrating a cutoff drainage area where knickpoint migration has stalled. We intend to use this tool to further explore the significance, evolution, and dynamics of knickpoint features on SCI.",

            "abstract": "Sulfate and nitrate aerosols are major component of PM2.5. In East Asia, it is well known that sulfate aerosols are widely distributed due to large-scale trans-boundary air pollution. For nitrate aerosols, it is considered that fine-mode nitrate can be converted into coarse-mode nitrate on reactions with sea-salt aerosols over East China Sea when transported from China to Japan, however, contributions of trans-boundary air pollution on fine-mode nitrate is not clarified. We observed sulfate and nitrate aerosols on the basis of ACSA (Aerosol Chemical Speciation Analyzer; KIMOTO Electric Co., LTD.) in high-temporal resolution (1 hr) on fine- and coarse-mode at Dazaifu, Fukuoka located in western-part of Japan. Two-way nested (81-27 km) simulation in East Asia by WRF-CMAQ modeling system was developed to investigate the source contributions of fine- and coarse-mode nitrate when the trans-boundary air pollution was occurred. Observed monthly mean concentration in January 2014 at Dazaifu site were 3.41 μg/m3 for fine-mode nitrate, 1.51 μg/m3 for coarse-model nitrate, and 3.81 μg/m3 for fine-mode sulfate. Simulation in fine scale resolution can reproduce the observed concentration with 4.79 μg/m3 (r = 0.60) for fine-mode nitrate, 1.24 μg/m3 (r = 0.51) for coarse-model nitrate, and 3.36 μg/m3 (r = 0.46) for fine-mode sulfate. At urban site in Japan, local-scale contributions are also considered to attribute fine-mode nitrate, and in order to further examine the contributions of trans-boundary air pollution, emission sensitivity analysis with switching off the anthropogenic emissions from Japan was conducted. This sensitivity simulation calculated that monthly mean concentration of 1.19 μg/m3 for coarse-mode nitrate and 3.26 μg/m3 for fine-mode sulfate, suggesting the dominance of trans-boundary air pollution for coarse-mode nitrate and fine-mode sulfate. On the other hand, monthly mean concentration was 1.80 μg/m3 for fine-mode nitrate on sensitivity simulation. That means the contribution from trans-boundary air pollution and local-scale air pollution were respectively 37.6% and 62.4% on monthly mean basis. Temporal variations of contribution of\ntrans-boundary/local-scale air pollution during the transportation from China to western-part of Japan are further studied, and presented.",

            "abstract": "Observations from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) and from SPICAV/SOIR aboard Venus Express (VEx) have shown the upper haze (UH) of Venus to be highly spatially and temporally variable. Previous models of this system, using typical temperature profiles representative of the Venus atmosphere as a whole, did not investigate the effects of temperature variations on the UH particle distributions. Parkinson et al. (2014, submitted) showed that the inclusion of latitudinally dependent temperature profiles retrieved from SPICAV/SOIR observations in the Venus cloud model of Gao et al. (2014) resulted in markedly different cloud distributions between the different latitude cases, such as a lowered cloud base near the equator and a slightly thicker UH at the poles. Thus, temperature variations across Venus could help explain spatial variations in the atmospheric aerosol distribution. In this work, we expand on the aforementioned study by including VIRA temperature profiles derived from Venera and PVO observations (Kliore et al. 1985) at similar latitudes as the SPICAV/SOIR profiles to assess how the aerosol distribution varies spatially and temporally. By comparing the simulated cloud and haze distributions arising from the two sets of temperature profiles, we can evaluate whether secular changes have occurred in the ~30 years between the PVO and VEx epochs.",

            "abstract": "Initiated by the strong Kuril Islands (Simushir) earthquake and tsunami of 15 November 2006, the Institute of Marine Geology and Geophysics (IMGG), Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia, deployed a network of bottom pressure recorders (BPRs) in bays and harbours of the South Kuril Islands (offshore from Shikotan, Kunashir, and Iturup islands). To investigate the local resonant properties of different bays/harbours we used long-term series of background oscillations and estimated topographic admittance functions for each site. The deployed instruments measured several tsunamis, including the 2007 and 2009 Kuril Islands (Simushir), 2009 Samoa, 2010 Chile and 2011 Tohoku tsunamis. At the same time, these BPRs recorded several strong tsunami-like oscillations associated with atmospheric activity (“meteotsunamis”). Two most interesting events of 3-4 August 2010 and 15-16 October 2011 were induced by an intense thunderstorm and by a fast moving atmospheric front, respectively, passing through the region. The second event is of particular interest because it created 50-80 cm sea level oscillations and strong currents (of several knots) in bays of Shikotan Island; we analyzed these oscillations together with simultaneous high-precision records of atmospheric pressure. In general, tsunami and meteotsunami events recorded at the same sites enabled us to estimate and compare the corresponding spectral characteristics of the events, including spectral ratios of tsunami (meteotsunami)/background, which are free from the topographic effects and describe the source. We also used DART 21401 in the vicinity of the South Kuril Islands to examine the spectral transformation and amplification of the waves approaching the coast. We found that most of the spectral properties of tsunamis and meteotsunamis are quite similar; however, tsunami spectra have certain features related to the specific source, while meteotsunami spectra are more uniform.",

            "abstract": "China is suffering from serious photochemical pollution and haze. It has been reported that Chemical Transport Model (CTM) may underestimate the level of ambient ozone (O3) and second organic aerosol (SOA) especially in polluted regions (Hodzic et al., 2010). In China, the simulated SOA concentrations might be underestimated by 0–75% (Jiang et al., 2012), which might result from the underestimated emissions of precursors. A major source of simulation uncertainty is the BVOC emission inventory due to their high emissions and activities. Studies have shown that the isoprene emissions in China might be underestimated significantly in the existing inventories (Fu et al., 2007; Geng et al., 2011).\nAiming to reduce the large uncertainties of isoprene emissions estimation, the emission inventory of isoprene in China at a high spatial and temporal resolution of 36 km×36 km and 1 hour is established. Based on the most detailed and latest vegetation investigations, China’s official statistical data and Vegetation Atlas of China (1:1,000,000), isoprene emissions from 82 plant functional types (PFTs) are computed firstly using MEGANv2.1 driven by WRF model. More local species-specific emission rates are developed combining statistical analysis and category classification, and the leaf biomass is estimated based on vegetation volume and production with biomass-apportion models. The total annual isoprene emissions in 2003 are 23.9 Tg C. Our isoprene emission is much higher than those in other studies for China’s isoprene emission estimation. The discrepancy in isoprene emissions is mostly due to the higher emission rate used in this study. In order to validate the species-specific emission rates determined in this study, the measurements of isoprene emissions from dominant tree species in China are conducted. Our study will be very significant for improving the accuracy of SOA and O3 simulation in China.",

            "abstract": "Taal volcano, Philippines, is one of the world’s most dangerous volcanoes given its history of explosive eruptions and its close proximity to populated areas. A key feature of these eruptions is that the eruption vents were not limited to Main Crater but occurred on the flanks of Volcano Island. This complex eruption history and the fact that thousands of people inhabit the island, which has been declared a permanent danger zone, together imply an enormous potential for disasters. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) constantly monitors Taal, and international collaborations have conducted seismic, geodetic, electromagnetic, and geochemical studies to investigate the volcano’s magma system. Realtime broadband seismic, GPS, and magnetic networks were deployed in 2010 to improve monitoring capabilities and to better understand the volcano. The seismic network has recorded volcano-tectonic (VT) events beneath Volcano Island. We located these VT events based on high-frequency seismic amplitudes, and found that some events showed considerable discrepancies between the amplitude source locations and hypocenters determined by using onset arrival times. Our analysis of the source location discrepancies points to the existence of a region of strong S-wave attenuation near the ground surface beneath the east flank of Volcano Island. This region is beneath the active fumarolic area and above sources of pressure contributing inflation and deflation, and it coincides with a region of high electrical conductivity. The high-attenuation region matches that inferred from an active-seismic survey conducted at Taal in 1993. Our results, synthesized with previous results, suggest that this region represents actively degassing magma near the surface, and imply a high risk of future eruptions on the east flank of Volcano Island.",

            "abstract": "In the preparedness phase of the disaster cycle, willingness to invest resources in prevention and mitigation doesn’t depend only on quantitative judgments of the probability of a disaster. People also evaluate the risks of situations in qualitative ways. Psychological studies of risk perception have shown that risk attitudes toward everyday technologies and activities (e.g., electric power, air travel, smoking) can be mapped onto two orthogonal dimensions: how unknown the risks seem, and how dread or severe they feel. Previously, this psychometric approach to risk perception has focused mostly on man-made risks (e.g., Fischhoff et al. 1978, Slovic 1987). In this paper we examine how natural hazards fit into the established unknown/dread risk space.\nHazards that are high on the unknown dimension of risk tend to be perceived as having effects that are unknown to science and to the exposed, uncontrollable, and new. Hazards that rank high on the dread/severity dimension are seen as immediate, catastrophic, highly dreaded on a gut level, new, and likely to be fatal. Perceived risk tends to be highest for hazards that are both high on the dread dimension and low on the unknown dimension.\nWe find that weather-related hazards rank lowest on both dimensions: blizzards, heat waves, hailstorms, fog, and ice storms are all feel very known and not particularly dread. The exception for this group is hurricanes and tornadoes, which are viewed as more similar to geophysical hazards and mass movements: high on dread, though not particularly unknown. Two notable outliers are climate change and sea-level rise, which are both considered very unknown (higher than any other natural hazard save sinkholes), and not at all dread (less dread even than fog and dust storms).\nBut when compared with perceptions of technological hazards, nearly every natural hazard ranks as more dread than any technology or activity, including nuclear power. Man-made hazards fall with technologies, rather than with natural hazards—climate change and sea-level rise are both only as dread as electric power and motor vehicles, yet feel as unknown as terrorism and GMO foods. We discuss the implications of these qualitative elements of hazard risk perception for the preparedness phase of the disaster lifecycle, and offer recommendations to practitioners and educators.",

            "abstract": "At Kongsfjorden bay, DOC, CDOM, FDOM, composition of phytoplankton and MAAs were measured from seawater. The relationship between CDOM, DOC vs Chl a was also investigated. DOC of seawater in 2010 and 2011 was increased 68% and 34% respectively in average compared to DOC in 2009. CDOM was in the range of acdom(375): 0.1855 m-1 ~ 0.0965 m-1, and it showed clear decreasing gradient form inside bay to offshore. CDOM vs DOC and Chl a was inversely related in the study area. Biomass of phytoplankton during 2009~2011 was 0.43~ 0.76 mg/m3 and little change was observed, but the composition and dominant classes have changed. Phaeocystis sp. was rare and diatom and cryptophyte were dominant in the center of bay and coastal area, respectively. 5 different MAAs, shinorine, palythine, mycosporine-glycine, porphyra-334, asterine-330 are identified and separated from Arctic phytoplanktons by HPLC and an unknown MAA was identified from Phaeocystis pouchetti. The spatial distribution pattern of MAAs in the study area was similar with the distribution of Phaeocystis sp. in 2009. The concentration of MAA in 2011 was decreased upto 50% with maximum concentration and seems to related with very low abundance of Phaeocystis sp. in the bay. The results from UV B exposure experiment with Phaeocystis pouchetti. and Porosira glacialis revealed clear discrepancy in the response to carbon uptake rate and photo-inhibition, and also the organic matter from these phytoplankton showed a different photo reactivity. Porosira glacialis, larger than Phaeocystis pouchetti. was more resistant to harmful UV B effect and result of carbon uptake rate using 13C support this tendency. In case Phaeocystis pouchetti becomes the dominant species, it is likely CDOM will be easily degraded and the UV screening effect of seawater will be reduced. acdom(375) 0.14m-1in spring in the arctic was higher than 0.11m-1 in the antarctic at monitoring station. These 3 year monitoring in the arctic Kongsfjorden showed a recent change in the composition of phytoplankton, increase in DOC, decrease in MAAs in the seawater. Supporting data from incubation experiments with dominant species of polar region and monitoring data will be a guide to predict the direction of the feasible changes in ecosystem in the polar environment and clue to understand the biogeochemichl cycle of carbon.",

            "abstract": "The reconstructed stress fields for intermediate depths in slabs (between 100 and 300 km) remain enigmatic. Slab pull should enhance downdip tension, but downdip compression is often observed.\nBased on hotspot tracks (indicating a relative motion between the lithosphere and the mantle) several researchers proposed a westward drift of the lithosphere with debated velocities (2-13 cm/yr). Available data indicates that dominant down-dip tension occurs along E-directed subductions (e.g., Chile) sustained by the eastward relative mantle flow and down-dip compression along W-directed subductions (e.g., Tonga) encroached by the mantle motion. In this perspective, 3D viscoelastic models (FEM) were performed to investigate the origin of stress in slabs at intermediate depths. Geometries inspired to real subduction zones, were used to analyze the effect of the principal geodynamic forces (slab pull, mantle flow, plate convergence), the correlation between subduction polarity (i.e., how the mantle flow approaches the slab) and geometry, the nature of down-dip and along-strike stresses (poorly investigated in the literature).\nWe conclude that, although the stress in slabs is controlled by several geodynamic processes, down-dip compression is favored by mantle flow opposing the slab, whereas down-dip tension is enhanced by mantle flow sustaining the slab. These predictions are in agreement with available geophysical observations.\nSubstantial along-strike deformation affects intermediate and deeper regions of the slab when mantle flow is enhanced. Down-dip and along-strike axes form couples that tend to rotate approaching the slab sides. The larger the lateral extent of the plate the most this effect is evident. According to these findings, along-strike tension or compression comes out in response to the flexure (forward or backward) of the lithosphere depending on the slab longitudinal curvature. Along-strike tension occurs in case of slabs curved towards the mantle flow direction while along-strike compression occurs if the slab has an opposite curvature relative to the mantle flow direction. 3D results suggest that the stress axes direction is largely influenced by the subduction geometry, but down-dip and along-strike stress axes regime is controlled by the mantle flow direction.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture measurement from space is yet, the only feasible way of procuring global moisture data. These global measurements typically result in spatial resolutions of ~ 9-56 km which are not always appropriate for direct use in various applications like agricultural yield predictions, weather and climate forecasting etc. The science for transferring soil moisture information between scales is still developing and no formal theory exists that describes the scaling relationship of soil moisture at remote sensing footprint scales. Based on past studies which describe the relationships between land surface based heterogeneity (typically determined by hydro-climate of a region) and soil moisture, we hypothesized that as opposed to the existence of a universal scaling relationship, there exist hydro-climate specific scaling relationships of soil moisture. To this effect, we have developed a hydro-climate specific soil moisture scaling triangle whose sides represent land surface heterogeneity, soil wetness and scale. The region enclosed within the triangle is divided into sub-regions corresponding to various combinations of the three sides of the triangle. Each sub-region defines a variogram of soil moisture. These variograms are a weighted sum of the variograms of the land surface based heterogeneity, namely soil, vegetation and topography observed at different support scales of measurement as represented by the particular sub-region. The weights for the variograms of soil, vegetation and topography differ for different wetness conditions, thus, also highlighting the dominant processes at different wetness conditions and their evolution across remote sensing footprint scales. The study has been conducted for three different hydro-climates i.e. semi-arid (Arizona), humid (Iowa) and sub-humid (Oklahoma).",

            "abstract": "Most of Earth’s surface is created by seafloor spreading, which is one of a handful of fundamental global tectonic processes. While most seafloor spreading is orthogonal, that is, the strike of mid-ocean ridge segments are perpendicular to transform faults, examples of significant non-orthogonality have been noted since the 1970s, in particular in regions of slow seafloor spreading such as the western Gulf of Aden with the non-orthogonality up to 45°. In contrast, here we focus on fast and ultra-fast seafloor spreading along the East Pacific Rise.\nFor our analysis, instead of comparing the strike of mid-ocean ridges with the strike of nearby transform faults, the azimuth of which can be uncertain, we compare with the direction of plate motion determined from the angular velocity that best fits all the data along the boundary of a single plate pair [DeMet, Gordon, and Argus 2010]. The advantages of our approach include greater accuracy and the ability to estimate non-orthogonality where there are no nearby transform faults.\nEstimating the strikes of fast-spreading mid-ocean ridge segments present several challenges as non-transform offsets on various scales affect the estimate of the strike. Moreover, the strike may vary considerably within a single ridge segment bounded by transform faults. This is especially evident near overlapping spreading centers along with the strike varies rapidly with distance along a ridge segment. We use various bathymetric data sets to make our estimates including ETOPO1 [Amante and Eakins, 2009] and GeoMapApp [Ryan et al., 2009].\nWhile spreading is orthogonal or nearly orthogonal along much of the East Pacific Rise, it appears that some ridge segments along the Pacific-Nazca boundary near 30°S and near 16°S−22°S deviate significantly from orthogonality by as much as 6°−12° even when we exclude the portions of mid-ocean ridge segments involved in overlapping spreading centers. Thus modest but significant non-orthogonality occurs where seafloor spreading is the fastest on the planet. Implications for mid-ocean ridge processes, hypothesized lithosphere deformation, and non-closure of plate motion circuits will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "This study analyzes the different variability patterns of the Urban Heat Island intensity (UHII) in the Metropolitan Area of Rio de Janeiro (MARJ), one of the largest urban agglomerations in Brazil. The UHII is defined as the difference in the surface air temperature between the urban/suburban and rural/vegetated areas. To choose one or more stations that represent those areas we used the technique of cluster analysis on the air temperature observations from 14 surface weather stations in the MARJ. The cluster analysis aims to classify objects based on their characteristics, gathering similar groups. The results show homogeneity patterns between air temperature observations, with 6 homogeneous groups being defined. Among those groups, one might be a natural choice for the representative urban area (Central station); one corresponds to suburban area (Afonsos station); and another group referred as rural area is compound of three stations (Ecologia, Santa Cruz and Xerém) that are located in vegetated regions. The arithmetic mean of temperature from the three rural stations is taken to represent the rural station temperature. The UHII is determined from these homogeneous groups. The first UHII is estimated from urban and rural temperature areas (Case 1), whilst the second UHII is obtained from suburban and rural temperature areas (Case 2). In Case 1, the maximum UHII occurs in two periods, one in the early morning and the other at night, while the minimum UHII occurs in the afternoon. In Case 2, the maximum UHII is observed during afternoon/night and the minimum during dawn/early morning. This study demonstrates that the stations choice reflects different UHII patterns, evidencing that distinct behaviors of this phenomenon can be identified.",

            "abstract": "The impacts of dams in New England are especially acute as it possesses one of the highest densities of dams in the US, with the NID documenting more than 4,000 dams, and state agency records indicating that >14,000 dams are peppered throughout the landscape. This large number of dams contributes to pervasive watershed fragmentation, threatening the ecological integrity of rivers and streams, and in the case of old, poorly maintained structures, posing a risk to lives and property. These concerns have generated active dam removal efforts throughout New England. To best capture the geomorphic, hydrologic, and potential ecological effects of dam removal at a regional level, we have compiled a dataset of 127 removed dams in New England, which includes information about structural characteristics, georectified locations, and key watershed attributes (including basin size, distance to next upstream obstacle, and number of free-flowing river kms opened up). Our specific research questions address (1) what is the spatial distribution of removed dams and how does this pattern relate to stated management goals of restoring critical habitat for native resident freshwater and diadromous fish, (2) what are the structural or management commonalities in dam types that have been removed, and (3) what has been the incremental addition of free-flowing river length? Rather than reflecting an overall management prioritization strategy, results indicate that dam removals are characterized more by opportunistic removals. For example, despite a regional emphasis on diadromous fish protection and restoration, most removals are inland rather than coastal settings. Most of the removed dams were small (~ 45% < 4 m) although ~10% of the removed dams were 6-8 m high. However, despite the predominant removal of small dams, these dams were not restricted to headwater locations; most (38%) occurred in medium-sized watersheds having upstream drainage areas between 100-1,000 km2 with 8% formerly impounding watersheds between 1,000 – 10,000 km2. The combined effect has been significant in opening up >2,300 river kms over the past several decades, with implication for both resident and diadromous fish, and with many removals located in mid-sized rivers that are a key link between upstream and downstream/coastal aquatic ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "One of the world’s largest rare earth element carbonatite deposits is located at Mountain Pass in the eastern Mojave Desert, California. The 1.4 Ga carbonatite deposit is hosted by and intruded into 1.7 Ga gneiss and schist that occurs in a narrow north-northwest trending belt along the eastern parts of Clark Mountain Range, Mescal Range, and Ivanpah Mountains. The carbonatite is associated with an ultrapotassic intrusive suite that ranges from shonkinite through syenite and granite. Regional geophysical data reveal that the eastern Mojave carbonatite terrane occurs along the northeast edge of a prominent magnetic high and the western margin of a gravity high along the eastern Clark Mountain Range.\nTo improve our understanding of the geophysical and structural framework of the eastern Mojave carbonatite terrane, we collected over 1900 gravity stations and over 600 physical rock property samples to augment existing geophysical data. Carbonatite intrusions typically have distinct gravity, magnetic, and radiometric signatures because these deposits are relatively dense, contain magnetite, and are enriched in thorium or uranium. However, our results show that the carbonatite is essentially nonmagnetic with an average susceptibility of 0.18 x 10-3 SI (n=31) and the associated ultrapotassic intrusive suite is very weakly magnetic with an average susceptibility of 2.0 x 10-3 SI (n=36). Although the carbonatite body is nonmagnetic, it occurs along a steep gradient of a prominent aeromagnetic anomaly. This anomaly may reflect moderately magnetic mafic intrusive rocks at depth.\nEast of the ultrapotassic intrusive rocks, a prominent north trending magnetic anomaly occurs in the central part of Ivanpah Valley. Based on geologic mapping in the Ivanpah Mountains, this magnetic anomaly may reflect Paleoproterozoic mafic intrusive rocks related to the 1.7 Ga Ivanpah Orogeny. Physical property measurements indicate that exposed amphibolite along the eastern Ivanpah Mountains are moderately magnetic with an average susceptibility of 26.7 x 10-3 SI (n=15). The north trending gravity anomaly along the eastern part of the Clark Mountain Range probably reflects dense gneissic rocks of a similar age, rather than the suite of relatively lower density ultrapotassic intrusive rocks.",

This field campaign, monitoring raw water DOM concentration and character on three contrasting rivers across the region captured the late recession curve (October 2011- September 2012).\nDOM was characterized using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra with PARAFAC analysis; δ 13C-DOC; and molecular size using liquid chromatography with organic carbon, UV254 and nitrogen detection (LC-OCD) to identify DOC fractions: biopolymers, humic substance (HS), building blocks (BB), low molecular weight acids, and low molecular weight neutrals.\nDespite the difference in catchment and climatic zones, similar trends were observed in all three rivers, where DOC concentrations gradually decreased in river streams over a year from 8-11 mgCL-1 to 3-4 mgCL-1, followed by similar changes of HS, BB and fluorescent terrestrially delivered DOM components (C1-C3). In Allyn and Patterson rivers the proportion of HS, fluorescent terrestrially delivered DOM components (C1, C2) in DOC have decreased, in contrast to Logan River, where the ratio of HS/DOC was highly variable and showed no particular trends. The proportion of other DOC components remained almost the same. Molecular weight of the HS declined from 700 gmol-1 to 610 gmol-1 in all sites. δ 13C-DOC increased during monitoring, this could be linked to general decrease of DOM proportion delivered from C4 type plants after the flood.\nOverall, although DOC concentration decreased over the year post flood at all sites, most importantly the composition of DOM changed, with major changes occurring in proportion of humic-like and fluorescent terrestrially delivered DOM. Therefore it is important to monitor DOM character to be able to assess the impact of climate change and extreme weather events on the DOM transport and transformation.",

            "abstract": "Substorms are one of the most dramatic disturbances of the global magnetotail-ionosphere coupling system that release large amounts of solar wind energy accumulated in the magnetotail and are associated with auroral activations. A critical, long-standing problem in substorm research is to identify what physical mechanism leads to substorm auroral onset. It has been suggested that pre-onset waves with ~1-2 min periodicity are an important facet of the instability in the near-Earth region that leads to substorm onset and auroral beads. It is thus critical to determine if, and if so how, pre-onset waves in the near-Earth plasma sheet evolve to substorm onset waves. We found using the THEMIS satellite-imager conjunction events that westward-propagating pre-onset waves evolve to the beginning part of onset waves soon after auroral streamers, indicating an importance of the coupling process between incoming flows and pre-existing waves to substorm onset. On the other hand, a portion of the onset waves propagates eastward in contrast to westward propagation of the pre-onset waves and part of the onset waves. These unique propagation characteristics as well as the wavelength and periodicity can be used to identify a possible mechanism of near-Earth plasma sheet instability. We have compared the observation results with 3-D kinetic simulations with a localized tailward entropy gradient. This initial condition induces weak waves propagating westward that can be interpreted as due to kinetic ballooning/interchange instability and electromagnetic current-driven ion cyclotron instability. Part of those waves grows much larger in amplitude and propagated eastward and earthward due to charge separations between magnetized electrons and unmagnetized ions, indicating that kinetic effects are responsible for the onset wave propagation. These propagation features of simulated waves are consistent with the observations, and therefore suggest that these kinetic waves may play an important role in initiating the instability responsible for substorm expansion phase onset.",

Using its two sensors, ATLID (High spectral resolution lidar) and MSI (Multi-spectral imager), we are developing the synergy algorithm to retrieve the vertical profiles of extinction coefficients at 355 nm of four aerosol components (Water-soluble, black carbon, dust, and sea-salt particles), and the column mean of mode radii of water-soluble and dust particles. The ATLID data are extinction coefficient, backscatter coefficient, and depolarization ratio for total aerosols at 355 nm. The MSI data are radiances at 670 and 865 nm. The dry volume concentrations of four aerosol components at each altitude and the mode radii of water-soluble and dust particles in the column are simultaneously optimized to ATLID and MSI data by the gauss newton method. After the optimization, the vertical profiles of the extinction coefficient at 355 nm of four aerosol components are obtained. The size distributions of four aerosol components are assumed to be a lognormal distribution. The refractive indices of four aerosol components are given from previously observational studies. The humidity growth is considered for water-soluble and sea-salt particles. The volume concentration and the mode radius of the sea-salt particle are parameterized using the surface wind speed on the ocean. We assumed that the shape of the water-soluble, black carbon, and sea-salt particles are spherical, and the shape of the dust particle is spheroidal. We tested the algorithm using the ATLID and MSI data simulated using clean, dust-transported, and smoke-transported aerosols. The extinction coefficients of each component at 355 nm are retrieved well. The mode radius of water-soluble and dust particles were somehow overestimated.",

Here, we investigate the influence of climate uncertainty on projections of U.S. ground-level ozone beyond greenhouse gas emissions scenario by evaluating the roles of natural variability and climate sensitivity. The Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry is used to simulate ozone concentrations and driven by meteorological fields generated through the MIT Integrated Global System Model (IGSM-CAM). Under unconstrained and stabilization greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, 30-year simulations centered around the years 2000, 2050 and 2100 are carried out using multiple initial conditions to assess the influence of internal variability on projected ozone changes. The climate penalty on U.S. air quality is estimated by fixing anthropogenic emissions of conventional air pollutants and precursors at year 2000 levels. The effect of climate model response is evaluated by perturbing climate sensitivity within the IGSM-CAM through a cloud radiative adjustment method and comparing ozone projections under climate sensitivities equal to 3.0 and 4.5˚C. In addition, we explore the propagation of these uncertainties into population-weighted pollutant concentrations and their potential impact on health impact assessments. In the ensemble simulation of 21st century climate we identify an important influence of natural variability and climate model response on ozone projections and find that they contribute significantly to the uncertainty associated with climate penalty estimates.",

            "abstract": "In this study, the sediment-related disaster prediction method which based ground gauged rainfall-data, currently practiced in Japan was coupled with satellite rainfall data and applied to domestic large-scale sediment-related disasters. The study confirmed the feasibility of this integrated method.\nIn Asia, large-scale sediment-related disasters which can sweep away an entire settlement occur frequently. Leyte Island suffered from a huge landslide in 2004, and Typhoon Molakot in 2009 caused huge landslides in Taiwan. In the event of these sediment-related disasters, immediate responses by central and local governments are crucial in crisis management.\nIn general, there are not enough rainfall gauge stations in developing countries. Therefore national and local governments have little information to determine the risk level of water induced disasters in their service areas.\nIn the Japanese methodology, a criterion is set by combining two indices: the short-term rainfall index and long-term rainfall index. The short-term rainfall index is defined as the 60-minute total rainfall; the long-term rainfall index as the soil-water index, which is an estimation of the retention status of fallen rainfall in soil.\nIn July 2009, a high-density sediment related disaster, or a debris flow, occurred in Hofu City of Yamaguchi Prefecture, in the western region of Japan. This event was calculated by the Japanese standard methodology, and then analyzed for its feasibility.\nHourly satellite based rainfall has underestimates compared with ground based rainfall data. Long-term index correlates with each other. Therefore, this study confirmed that it is possible to deliver information on the risk level of sediment-related disasters such as shallow landslides and debris flows. The prediction method tested in this study is expected to assist for timely emergency responses to rainfall-induced natural disasters in sparsely gauged areas.\nAs the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Plan progresses, spatial resolution, time resolution and accuracy of rainfall data should be further improved and will be more effective in practical use.",

These parameters have significant correlation among them. The effects of buildings on flow speed were analyzed. As the plan fraction of building becomes low and the frontal fraction of building becomes high, roughness length and displacement height become increase.

            "abstract": "For the geological disposal of radioactive wastes, geological settings and groundwater conditions are significantly important because of their effects on a radionuclide migration. One of the preferred host rocks for the radioactive waste disposal is crystalline rock. Fractures in crystalline rocks are main fluid pathways. Groundwater reacts with fracture filling minerals in fracture zones, resulting in physicochemical changes in the minerals and groundwater. In this study, fracture filling mineral-groundwater interactions were investigated by conducting microfluidic tests using thin sections at various conditions (i.e., fluid chemistry and flow rate). Groundwater and rock core samples collected from the KAERI Underground Research Tunnel (KURT) located in the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) were used in this study. Dominant bedrock is two-mica granite, which contains both biotite and muscovite. Secondary minerals (e.g., chlorite, calcite and clay minerals) occur in fracture and alteration zones. In nature, water-mineral interactions generally take long time. Microfluidic tests were conducted to simulate water-mineral interactions in shorter time with smaller scale. Thin sections of fracture filling minerals, minerals from alteration zones, and natural and synthetic groundwater samples were used for the microfluidic tests. Results showed that water-mineral interactions at various conditions caused changes in groundwater chemistry, dissolution of minerals, precipitation of secondary minerals, and formation of colloids, which can affect radionuclide migration. In addition, the fluid chemistry and flow rate affected characteristics of water-rock interactions.",

            "abstract": "Super‐cooled liquid water (SCW) clouds, where liquid droplets exist at temperatures below 0oC, impact both the radiative budget and the development of precipitation. They also present an aviation hazard due to their role in aircraft icing. The two recent NASA's field campaigns POlarimeter Definition EXperiment (PODEX, based in Palmdale, California, January - February 2013) and Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS, based in Houston, Texas in August - September 2013) provided a unique opportunity to observe SCW clouds from the high-altitude airborne platform of NASA's ER-2 aircraft. We present an analysis of the measurements made by the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) during these experiments. This instrument measures both polarized and total reflectance in 9 spectral channels with central wavelengths of 410, 470, 555, 670, 865, 960, 1590, 1880 and 2250 nm. The RSP is a scanning sensor taking samples at 0.8o intervals within 60o from nadir in both forward and backward directions. This unique high angular resolution allows for characterization of liquid water droplet size using the rainbow structure observed in the polarized reflectances in the scattering angle range between 135o and 165o for every pixel independently. Simple parametric fitting algorithms applied to the polarized reflectance provide retrievals of the droplet effective radius and variance assuming a prescribed size distribution shape (gamma distribution). In addition to this, we use a non-parametric method, Rainbow Fourier Transform (RFT), which allows us to retrieve the droplet size distribution itself. The latter is important in the case of SCW clouds, which often have complex spatial and microphysical structure. For example the measurements made on 22 September 2013 during SEAC4RS indicate a cloud that alternates between being in glaciated and liquid phases, with super-cooled liquid drops at altitudes as high as 10 km, which correspond to temperatures close to the homogeneous freezing temperature of pure water drops (about -38oC). The multi-modal droplet size distributions retrieved from RSP data in this case are consistent with the multi-layer cloud structure observed by correlative Cloud Profiling Lidar measurements.",

            "abstract": "A limitation on the application of geophysical methods for the study of the upper mantle is the effect of lateral variations in the structure of the overlying crust that obscure the signal from the mantle. However, the North American upper mantle is particularly well-suited for geophysical study because crustal corrections can be made based on the results from numerous active- and passive-source seismic investigations that have determined lateral variations in crustal properties, including crustal thickness, P- and S-wave velocities, and crustal density estimated from empirical velocity-density relations. We exploit this knowledge of the crust of North America to construct an integrated 3D model of variations in density, temperature and composition within the upper mantle to a depth of 250 km. Our model is based on a joint analysis of topography, gravity, and seismic tomography data, coupled with mineral physics constraints. In the first step we remove the effect of the laterally-varying crust from the observed gravity field and topography (assuming Airy isostasy) using our crustal model NACr2014 (Tesauro et al., submitted). In the second step the residual mantle gravity field and residual topography (obtained in the first step) are inverted to obtain a 3D density model of the upper mantle. Thermal effects dominate this initial density model. To compensate for the thermal effects we invert for mantle temperatures based on the S-wave velocities determined by two seismic tomography models (S40RTS and NA2007). After removing the thermal effect from the mantle gravity anomalies we are left with the upper mantle density variations that are due to compositional variations. We recover two long-wavelength (5°-10°) features in the upper mantle compositional density model that are not evident in seismic tomography models: (1) a strong (+200 mgal) positive compositional anomaly beneath the Gulf of Mexico, perhaps due to eclogite in the uppermost mantle, and (2) a NE-SW trending positive (+140 mgal) anomaly beneath the Grenville-Appalachian suture that may indicate a remnant slab fragment in the uppermost mantle that dates to the Appalachian orogeny. These and other features in the mantle density model allow us to construct an evolutionary model for the development of the North American upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "In the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory lies Rivendell, a heavily-instrumented steep forested hillslope underlain by nearly vertically dipping argillite interbedded with sandstone. Under this convex hillslope lies “Zb”, the transition to fresh bedrock, which varies from less than 6 m below the surface near the channel to 20 m at the divide. Rempe and Dietrich (2014, PNAS) show that the Zb profile can be predicted from the assumption that weathering occurs when drainage is induced in the uplifting fresh bedrock under hillslopes by lateral head gradients driven by channel incision at the hillslope boundary. Infiltrating winter precipitation is impeded at the lower conductivity boundary at Zb, generating perched groundwater that dynamically pulses water laterally to the channel, controlling stream runoff. Below the soil and above the water table lies an unsaturated zone through which all recharge to the perched groundwater (and thus all runoff to channels) occurs. It is this zone and the waters in them that profoundly affect critical zone processes. In our seasonally dry environment, the first rains penetrate past the soil and moisten the underlying weathered bedrock (Salve et al., 2012, WRR). It takes about 200 to 400 mm of cumulative rain, however, before the underlying groundwater rises significantly. Oshun et al (in review) show that by this cumulative rainfall the average of the wide-ranging isotopic signature of rain reaches a nearly constant average annual value. Consequently, the recharging perched groundwater shows only minor temporal isotopic variation. Kim et al, (2014, GCA) find that the winter high-flow groundwater chemistry is controlled by relatively fast-reacting cation exchange processes, likely occurring in transit in the unsaturated zone. Oshun also demonstrates that the Douglas fir rely on this rock moisture as a water source, while the broadleaf trees (oaks and madrone) use mostly soil moisture. Link et al (2014 WRR) show that Doug fir declines in transpiration rate significantly compared to the madrone during summer high water stress periods, with may induce feedbacks from the forest to atmospheric temperature and humidity. Collectively these studies spotlight the seasonally dynamic unsaturated zone in the weathered bedrock beneath the soil as key to understanding critical zone processes.",

            "abstract": "Microbes mediate fluxes of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in soils depending on ratios of available C, N, and P relative to microbial demand. Hence, characterizing microbial C and nutrient limitation in soils is critical for predicting how ecosystems will respond to human alterations of climate and nutrient availability. Here, we take a stoichiometric approach to assessing microbial C, N, and P limitation by using threshold element ratios (TERs). TERs enable shifting resource limitation to be assessed by matching C, N and P ratios from microbial biomass, extracellular enzyme activities, and soil nutrient concentrations. We assessed microbial nutrient limitation in temperate forests dominated by trees that associate with one of two mycorrhizal symbionts: arbsucular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. We found that both ECM and AM microbial communities were co-limited by C and N, supporting conventional wisdom that microbes are C-limited and temperate forests are N-limited. However, AM microbial communities were relatively more C-limited than ECM communities (P=0.001). In response to chronic field N fertilization, both AM and ECM communities became relatively more P-limited (P=0.011), but they remained N- and C-limited overall. Thus, realistic levels of N deposition may not dampen microbial N limitation. Reflecting differences in relative limitation, N mineralization rates were higher in AM soils than in ECM soils (P=0.004) while C mineralization rates were higher in ECM soils than in AM soils (P=0.023). There were no significant differences in P flux between AM and ECM soils or detectable mineralization responses to N addition, indicating that mineralization rates are closely tied to C and nutrient limitation. Overall, we found that 1) microbial resource limitation can be detected without resource addition; and 2) TERs and ratios of labile resources are viable tools for predicting mineralization responses to resource additions.",

Different extreme precipitation indices, in three categories of percentile, absolute threshold, and maximum indices, are studied and compared with the same indices from the East Asia (EA) ground-based gridded daily precipitation dataset. The results show that PERSIANN-CDR depicts similar results, as the ground-based EA product in terms of capturing the spatial and temporal patterns of daily precipitation extremes, particularly in the East China monsoon region where the intensity and frequency of heavy rainfall events are very high. However, the agreement between the datasets in dry regions such as Tibetan Plateau in the West and the Taklamakan Desert in the Northwest is not strong. An important factor which may have influenced the results is that the ground-based stations from which EA gridded data was produced is very sparse. In the station-rich regions in the East, the performance of PERSIANN-CDR is significant. PERSIANN-CDR slightly underestimates the values of extreme heavy precipitation.",

(2010) allows us to test whether a size relationship between drainage basin area and distributive fluvial system (DFS) area exists. We are testing this hypothesis using a combination of SRTM-based digital elevation models and Landsat satellite imagery in ArcGIS. Sedimentary basins are delineated by preforming a Gaussian smoothing on the DEM, followed by optimal edge detection through application of a modified Canny edge detector. The pour points defining the link between contributing hydrologic basins and these sedimentary basins are then located by generating a stream network in ArcGIS and intersecting the stream network arcs with the sedimentary basin polygons. From these pour points we delineate the adjacent contributing drainage basin using the watershed tool in ArcGIS. We manually digitize the boundary and geometry of the DFS identified for each drainage basin, using the higher resolution imagery found on Google Earth for visual confirmation if the scale or resolution of the Landsat imagery requires it. We then extract drainage basins and DFS polygon parameters and calculate areal extents in order to evaluate whether such a size relationship exists within basins, regionally across several basins, or across different basin types (e.g., endorheic vs exhoreic). A limitation of this approach is that we cannot evaluate sediment volumes, only aerial coverage. Results from this study may provide a better understanding of extrabasinal processes that control DFS shape and size.",

            "abstract": "Since 1994, the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) has been operating a continuous GPS array, later known as GEONET, for surveying and crustal deformation monitoring in Japan. Here we review how this geodetic observing system contributes to the mitigation of geohazards, focusing on our recent experience with the devastating 2011 Tohoku Earthquake (M9.0), and on our new real-time analysis system for assisting early Tsunami warning.\nAt the time of the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, GEONET recorded the largest horizontal coseismic deformation of about 5.3 meter at Oshika station, and revealed the land subsidence of about 0.5~1 meter along the Pacific coastal line near epicenter. The deformation field with 20km and 1 Hz resolution is an important geodetic constraint to understand the nature of the mega earthquake. It should be noted that the subsidence information was directly used for public warning against high tide water along the submerged coast by Tsunami.\nDue to the large area crustal deformation, GSI released new official site coordinates for surveying for eastern part of Japan 80 days after the earthquake, confirming that the rate of postseismic deformation can be corrected by yearly update of semi-dynamic parameters. The early update of the official coordinates was urged from surveyors involved in reconstruction works after the earthquake.\nBased on the hard lessons learned from the Tsunami disaster, GSI and Tohoku University developed a new real-time analysis system of GEONET named \"REGARD\" for real-time crustal deformation monitoring to assist Tsunami early warning. The system is designed to estimate moment magnitudes for large earthquakes by real-time fault model inversions.\nTo prepare for possible future mega earthquakes, the update and modernization of GEONET were accelerated, and from May 2013 QZSS and GLONASS data become available. This multi GNSS capability is expected to enhance stability of real-time crustal deformation monitoring as well as the availability of satellite surveying in mountainous and urban areas.",

            "abstract": "Active continental margins characterized by continuous convergence experienced overimposed tectonic configurations that allowed the formation of volcanic arcs, back arc basins, transtensional divergent tectonics or the accretion of exotic volcanic terranes. Such record, particularly the extensional phases, can be partially destroyed and obscure by multiple deformational events, the accretion of exotic terranes and strike slip fragmentation along the margin.\nThe tectonic evolution of the northern Andes during the Mesozoic is the result of post Pangea extension followed by the installation of a long-lived Jurassic volcanic arc (209 – 136 ma) that apparently stops between 136 Ma and 110 Ma.\nThe Quebradagrande Complex has been define as a single Lower Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary unit exposed in the western flank of the Central Cordillera of the Colombian Andes that growth after the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous magmatic hiatus. The origin of this unit have been related either to an oceanic volcanic arc or a marginal basin environment. The existence of such contrasting models reflect the regional perspective followed in published studies and the paucity of detail analysis of the volcano-sedimentary sequences.\nWe integrate multiple approaches including structural mapping, stratigraphy, geochemistry, U-Pb provenance and geochronology to improve the understanding of this unit and track the earlier phases of accumulation that are mask on the overimposed tectonic history. Our preliminary results suggest the existence of different volcano-sedimentary units that accumulated between 100 Ma and 82 Ma.\nThe older Lower Cretaceous sequences was deposited over Triassic metamorphic continental crust and include a upward basin deepening record characterized by thick fan delta conglomerates, followed by distal turbidites and a syn-sedimentary volcanic record at 100 ma. The other sequence include a 85 – 82 Ma fringing arc that was also formed close to the continental margin or associated with a continental terrane.\nThis two volcano-sedimentary domains were finally juxtaposed due to the collision with an allochthonous oceanic arc that collide with the Continental margin in the Late Cretaceous marking the initiation of the Andean Orogeny.",

            "abstract": "Since hydrogen plays an important role in dynamic processes in the mantle, we conducted high-strain torsion experiments on aggregates of Fe-bearing olivine [(Mg,Fe)2SiO4; Fo50] under hydrous condition. Olivine with a composition of Fo50 was used because of its enhanced grain growth kinetics and low strength relative to Fo90. Two pieces of an oriented San Carlos olivine crystal were embedded in the aggregates to monitor water fugacity both before and after deformation. We deformed samples to high enough strain, γ ≈ 4, to achieve a steady-state microstructure.\nA non-linear, least-squares fit to the stress versus strain rate data yielded a stress exponent, n ≈ 3.5, indicative of deformation involving dislocations. The water content determined from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses of the single crystals demonstrate that the samples are water saturated after deformation. Fabric analyses of the polycrystalline olivine samples, determined using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), indicate that the strength of the lattice preferred orientation (LPO) increases with increasing strain. Further, at low strain, γ < 2, two slip systems contribute to deformation: (i) [100] axes parallel to the shear direction with the [001] axes normal to the shear plane, indicative of the (001)[100] slip system, plus (ii) [001] axes are parallel to the shear direction with the [100] axes normal to the shear plane, suggestive of the (100)[001] slip system. With increasing strain, the LPO evolves until (100)[001] becomes the dominant slip system at γ > 3. We interpret the observed fabric evolution to represent the competition between the two easiest slip systems in olivine, (100)[001] and (001)[100]. The evolution of fabric can be applied to investigations of upper mantle seismic anisotropy especially in a mantle wedge or in a shear zone, locations in which hydrous conditions prevail.",

            "abstract": "Most of the forearc region along the Central American Subduction Zone shows a series of trench-parallel, positive gravity anomalies with corresponding gravity lows along the trench and toward the coast. These features extend from Guatemala to northern Nicaragua. However, the Costa Rican segment of the forearc does not follow this pattern. In this region, the along-trench gravity low is segmented, the coastal low is absent, and the forearc gravity high is located onshore at the Nicoya Peninsula which overlies the seismogenic zone. Geodetic and seismological studies along the Costa Rican Subduction Zone suggest the presence of coupled areas beneath the Nicoya Peninsula prior to the 2012, magnitude Mw 7.6 earthquake. These areas had previously been associated with asperities. Previous publications have proposed a mechanical model for the generation of asperities along the Chilean convergent margin based on the structure of the overriding plate above the seismogenic zone in which dense igneous bodies disturb the state of stress on the seismogenic zone and may influence seismogenic processes. In Costa Rica, surface geology and gravity data indicate the presence of dense basalt/gabbro crust overlying the seismogenic zone where the coupling is present. Bouguer anomaly values in this region reach up to 120×10-5 m/s2, which are the highest for Costa Rica. In this work, the state of stress on the Cocos-Caribbean plate interface is calculated based on the geometry and mass distribution of a 3D density model of the subduction zone as interpreted from gravity data from combined geopotential models. Results show a correlation between the coupled areas at the Nicoya Peninsula and the presence of stress anomalies on the plate interface. The stress anomalies are calculated for the normal component of the vertical stress on the seismogenic zone and are interpreted as being generated by the dense material which makes up the forearc in the area. The dense material of the Nicoya Complex mafic rocks and the topographic load of the peninsula on the seismogenic zone may play a role in the distribution of coupled areas and the seismic behavior of the region since the anomalous normal stress on the plate interface may increase the shear stress threshold for rupture.",

Molecular level composition is required to better evaluate the roles of organic aersols on climate, air quality and public health. Diacids and oxoacids account for a significant fraction of atmospheric organic matter and their secondary sources are more important than their primary sources. Atmospheric aerosol samples (n = 698) were collected during 2001-2008 at Gosan site in Jeju Island, South Korea. They were analyzed for saturated (C2-C10), unsaturated aliphatic (C4-C5), multifunctional (C3-C7) and aromatic (C8) diacids and oxoacids (C2-C9). According to monthly average concentration, oxalic acid (C2) is the most abundant followed by malonic acid (C3) and succinic acid (C4) in the homologous series of saturated diacids (C2-C10) whereas glyoxylic acid (ωC2) is most abundant in the homologous series of oxoacids (C2-C9). The monthly median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile concentrations of saturated and multifunctional diacids and oxoacids showed the highest in spring (March-May). In contrast, those concentrations for unsaturated aliphatic and aromatic diacids were observed the highest in winter (December-February). The monthly median and percentile (25th and 75th) concentrations of all diacids and oxoacids showed the second peak in the autumn (September-November) while those concentrations were recorded lowest in summer (June-August). A steady increment or decrement was not found in the monthly median and percentile (25th and 75th) concentrations of diacids and oxoacids in any month. However, the curve fitting of those concentrations over the study period shows an incremental trend for major diacids and oxoacids in winter and spring. For example, the monthly median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile concentrations of all major diacids and oxoacids increased up to 3 times from 2001 to 2008 in winter and spring. This study for the first time demonstrates the decadal increase of organic aerosols in East Asia and we discuss the bimodal seasonal variations and incremental trend of organic aerosols based on the annual behavior of ozone, carbon monoxide, and air mass transport pattern in East Asia.",

By performing Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on satellite observations of high cloud cover, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) — including both EP-ENSO (canonical ENSO) and CP-ENSO (ENSO Modoki) — is found to be the leading source of variability in high cloud cover. High cloud distributions are further shown to be closely associated with SST variations. The observations are compared to simulations from 20 AMIP5 models. In general, the models are able to simulate the first EOF, the EP-ENSO, in the data. However, only about half of the AMIP5 models could realistically reproduce the second EOF, the CP-ENSO. Improved understanding of high cloud variabilities will advance climate model simulations and facilitate more accurate predictions of future climate, specifically the climate response to increasing greenhouse gases such as CO2.",

We evaluated the skills of CMIP5 (Climate Model Inter-comparison project, phase 5) climate models in reproducing retrospective climatology over the state of Florida for the key climate variables important from the hydrological and agricultural perspectives (i.e., precipitation (Precp), maximum and minimum temperature (Tmax and Tmin), and wind speed (Ws)). The biases of raw CMIP5 were estimated using two different grid-based observational datasets as references. Based on the accuracy of various predictors such as mean climatology, temporal variability, extreme frequency, etc., the GCMs were ranked for each of the different reference datasets, climate variables, and predictors. The variation of the ranks was examined and rank-based GCM weights were assigned. The weights were then used to develop future ensembles (for 4 different RCP gas-emission scenarios) for the annual cycle of monthly mean and variance of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Finally the differences between the retrospective and future ensembles were investigated to assess future climate change impacts on water vulnerability using simple indices (e.g., ETo/Precp., drought index, and Standardized Precp. index). The uncertainties of the assessment were quantified by the spread range of ensembles and a reliability factor for the GCMs estimated using a measure of model biases and convergence criterion.",

            "abstract": "The dry granular flowmap can be broken into two broad categories, the Elastic and the Inertial. Elastic flows are dominated by force chains and stresses are generated by the compression of the interparticle contacts within those chains, and thus are proportional to the stiffness of the contacts. The Elastic zone can be subdivided into two regimes, the Elastic-Quasistatic where forces are independent of the shear rate which at high shear rates transitions to Elastic-Inertial where the particle inertia is reflected in the forces and the stresses increase linearly with the shear rate. In the Inertial regime, the stresses vary with the square of the shear rate. It also is divided into two regimes, the Dense-Inertial where the flow is dominated by clusters of particles, and the Inertial-Collisional where the flow is dominated by binary collisions. Appropriately the elastic theory grew out of an old study of landslides.\nBut like most such studies, all of the above depend on idealized computer simulations of uniform sized spherical particles. Real particles are never round, never of uniform size, and the process of flowing changes surface properties and may even shatter the particles. But all indications are that real systems still fit into the pattern drawn out in the last paragraph. A grave problem facing the field is how to incorporate these effects without losing a fundamental understanding of the internal rheological processes.\nThis talk will begin with an overview of the Elastic flowmap and the behaviors associated with each flow regime. It will then discuss early work to include effects of particle shape and size mixtures and perhaps some effects of particle breakage.",

            "abstract": "Model simulations have suggested that the hydrologic fluxes and stores of Arctic wetlands are constrained by the micro-topographical features of ice wedge polygons, which are abundant in lowland tundra landscapes. Recently observed changes in ice wedge polygon landscapes - in particular, ice wedge degradation and trough formation - emphasize the need to better understand how differing ice wedge polygon morphologies affect the larger hydrologic system. Here we present three seasons of measured end-of-winter snow accumulation, continuous soil moisture and water table elevations, and repeated frost table mapping. Together, these describe the hydrologic characteristics of three main ice wedge polygon types: low centered polygons with limited trough development (representative of a ~500 year old vegetated drained thaw lake basin), and low- and high-centered polygons with well-defined troughs. Dramatic spatiotemporal variability exists both between polygon types and between the features of an individual polygon (e.g. troughs, centers, rims). Landscape-scale end-of-winter snow water equivalent is similar between polygon types, while the sub-polygon scale distribution of the surface water differs, both as snow and as ponded water. Some sub-polygon features appear buffered against large variations in water levels, while others display periods of prolonged recessions and large responses to rain events. Frost table elevations in general mimic the ground surface topography, but with spatiotemporal variability in thaw rate. The studied thaw seasons represented above long-term average rainfall, and in 2014, record high June precipitation. Differing ice wedge polygon types express dramatically different local hydrology, despite nearly identical climate forcing and landscape-scale snow accumulation, making ice wedge polygons an important component when describing the Arctic water, nutrient and energy system.",

            "abstract": "Recently many of the chimney-shape gas hydrate concentrated beneath the seafloor have been confirmed off Shimane and off Akita as well as off Joetsu in the eastern margin of Japan Sea, which are quite different from the occurrences of pore space hydrate filling the intergranular pore system of sands recognized in Nankai Trough, Mallik and other sites. Sediment samples below the seafloor were retrieved in 2010 up to 40 m long at the Umitaka Spur, Joetsu Channel, Toyama Trough, Japan Basin, Nishi Tsugaru and Okushiri Ridge areas. Small amounts of sandy sediment have been retrieved as thin intercalations in Pleistocene and Holocene muddy layers transported approximately around 3 to 30 ka according to the tephra ages, where supplying sediments might have not been abundant due to sea level fluctuation during the Pleistocene ice age.\nIt is important to clarify the relationship between burial depths and absolute porosities of the argillaceous sediments in relation to early diagenesis. Macroscopic observations and descriptions, measurements of porosity and permeability, SEM (scanning electron microscope) observations, and X-ray diffraction analyses have been performed. They consist of silt- to clay-grained particles, and they sometimes contain very fine- to medium-grained thin sandy layers. Average porosities of these fine-grained sediments are 50 % in all study areas, which quickly reduce from 60% to less than 50% within 10 meters and gradually decrease to the depth. However, mean pore sizes in the Nishi Tsugaru are around 1000 nm while 100 nm in the other areas, which tend to decrease with depth. It is suggested that repacking of the muddy particles gradually advances by mechanical compaction, which may crucially influence permeability.\nThey usually contain much opal-A, quartz, feldspar, illite and smectite that do not change definitely with depth. By optical and microscopic observations, diatom tests, foraminifers and framboidal pyrites are commonly observed, and, in particular, the shapes of diatom are usually various, dominantly fragmental and infrequently preserved. It is remarked that physical diagenesis proceeds first due to mechanical compaction, whereas chemical diagenesis advances very slowly in early diagenesis.\nThis study was performed as a part of the MH21 Research Consortium on methane hydrate in Japan.",

Accurate monitoring of regional meteorological drought and its impact on vegetation is essential for practical purpose; meanwhile, it is an important scientific issue of climate change and regional responses. To date, studies have been mainly based on investigating meteorological drought and its impact using meteorological data, but the usage of satellite data is still limited. This study focused on monitoring regional drought and its impact on vegetation by using multi-sensor satellite based Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI) over northern China. The MIDI can consistently and continuously monitor drought cross space and time in all weather conditions. Spatial-temporal comparisons among MIDI, climate variables (precipitation and temperature), drought indices and vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) were carried out. In general, the spatial patterns of drought trend were heterogeneous, while drought intensified during summer accompanied by higher temperature and lower precipitation; nevertheless, the opposite trend was observed in spring. The vegetation (NDVI) showed similar trend and variation as MIDI. The study is expected to improve meteorological drought monitoring and impact assessment, and will provide valuable information for drought early warning and risk management of water resources and agricultural production.",

The present experimental results indicate that the dehydration reactions are weakly pressure-dependent below a peak shock pressure of ~21 GPa and becomes violent at pressures of 21-60 GPa dependent on the initial porosity and sample amount.

            "abstract": "The advent of extremely high-resolution data such as lidar DEM enables us to use fine resolution topographic attributes over large spatial areas for understanding micro-topographic controls on the land-surface. These relate to impacts of micro-topography on surface runoff paths, moisture availability to plants and biota, and the exchange fluxes between surface and subsurface water flow. To address such challenges by taking advantage of extreme-resolution data, a new class of models are required that explicitly resolve processes at high resolution over large areas, including micro-topographic effects, while at the same time maintaining fidelity to governing principles. To this end a modeling system that links MLCan, a vertically resolved model of canopy-root-soil biophysical processes, with GPU-based fully conjunctive surface-subsurface flow model (GCSFlow) has been developed. The MLCan model incorporates both C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways and resolves the vertical radiation, thermal, and environmental regimes within the canopy. In addition to plant water uptake, hydraulic redistribution is included to simulate the passive transport of moisture throughout the root and soil column following water potential gradients. The GCSFlow model simulates both surface runoff and vertical and lateral transport of moisture belowground. Modifications of the conjunctive flow model for utilizing GPU parallel computing capability significantly enhance the performance of the simulations. Several comparisons with analytical solutions and other numerical models have been carried out for a number of soil properties, flow conditions, and domain geometries to benchmark the physical responses of the conjunctive flow model. An application to a real-world catchment, the Goose Creek watershed located in central Illinois, USA, is also presented to demonstrate the scalability of the parallel, coupled model and its robust performance. The coupled model thus provides more capabilities to address large-scale ecohydrologic modeling problems at extremely high-resolution.",

            "abstract": "We examine radio observations of Jupiter to discuss the response of Jupiter’s electron-belt emission to external influences during the Cassini flyby of Jupiter. To demonstrate that Jupiter's synchrotron emission was varying during the last weeks of December 2000 and first weeks of January 2001, we compare the radio measurements from 2-3 January 2001 with VLA observations obtained on 20-21 December 1988, when viewing geometry and array configuration were comparable. Our analysis of interferometric and tomographic maps of brightness distribution indeed shows that the electron-belt emission was differently distributed around the planet in December 1988 and January 2001. The analysis of the 1988 and 2001 VLA data sets with VLA data from May 1997 further confirms that the spatial distribution of the electron belt on 2-3 January 2001 was different from that usually observed. The dynamical behavior of the solar activity at the time of the Cassini flyby of Jupiter strongly suggests that the emission from the electron radiation belt was responding to external influences on a timescale of days to a couple of weeks. We argue that the radiation belt was responding to solar wind structures rather than to solar irradiation, as the correlation with the solar UV/EUV radio flux is ruled out. Here we present our latest results obtained from a multi-source data analysis of the response of Jupiter’s electron-belt emission to solar wind structures that involves the use of spacecraft, solar, and Earth-based measurements.",

In the vicinity of the Arbuckle Mts., thick mafic to intermediate lava packages interbedded with rhyolite lavas and sedimentary strata are exposed in the subsurface and penetrated by oil and gas exploration wells. We have sampled cuttings from six wells exposed along the strike of the SOA with the aim of petrographically, geochemically, and isotopically characterizing the rocks to better understand their tectonomagmatic affinity. Cuttings were observed under a binocular microscope to ensure textural homogeneity; XRF bulk chemistry from these samples show that they are relatively unaltered based on analytical totals and alteration indices. The samples plot as basalts to andesites (e.g., 47-64 wt. % SiO2) and are primarily tholeiitic. On discrimination diagrams, these samples fall in “intraplate” fields, consistent with continental basalt volcanism, including flood basalt eruptions. These lavas show Zr/Nb values ranging from 6.8 to 11.1, K/Nb values ranging from 300-600, and Ba/Nb values ranging from 10-20, which are similar to EM1 OIB. The samples also show trace element patterns consistent with OIB-like mantle sources when normalized to primitive mantle, and similar geochemical traits to the Roosevelt Gabbros that crop out along strike of the SOA in the Wichita Mts.. Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope analysis is ongoing. Chemostratigraphic variations show the possibility of several lava packages. The geochemical analyses of the SOA lava flows provide insight into how these magmas formed as well as what tectonic regime (e.g., lower-mantle derived plume, upper-mantle extension, or “leaky” transform fault) produced the volcanism that affected the southern margin of Laurentia during the formation of the SOA; we favor the involvement of a deep mantle plume.",

We have conducted in situ X-ray diffraction measurements on Ca-Pv under H2O saturated conditions in the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell at the GSECARS and HPCAT sectors of the Advanced Photon Source. Glass starting materials were mixed with platinum powder (10 wt%) for laser coupling and internal pressure scale. Cold compressed foils of the mixtures were loaded in the diamond-anvil cell together with Ne or water.\nThe X-ray diffraction patterns of the Ca-Pv sample synthesized in a Ne medium are consistent with a cubic perovskite structure at both 300 K and high temperatures up to 2,400 K at 50 GPa. No clear peak splittings were observed within the resolution of the angle-dispersive powder diffraction technique. However, in the experiments with water, clear splitting of the 200 diffraction line appears during heating to temperatures over 2000 K and remain after temperature quench at 32 GPa. The peak splittings were clearly observed at high temperatures to 2400 K, which is close to the melting point of water at the pressure. The different structural behaviors of Ca-Pv depending on media (Ne and water) may suggest that OH might enter into the crystal structure of nominally anhydrous Ca-Pv phase at high pressure and high temperature.",

            "abstract": "Focal mechanism studies and other stress indicators indicate that intraplate earthquakes in central and eastern North America are consistent with an ENE-WSW compressive stress field that acts on existing faults. Here we argue that either locally thinned lithosphere (as beneath the Reelfoot Rift, central US) or regional lithospheric thinning (as beneath the edge of the North American craton or the rifted continental margin) constitutes zones of relatively low lithospheric strength where crustal strain accumulates. We use seismic surface waves to determine the 3D shear-wave seismic velocity structure of the lithosphere, and find that the Reelfoot Rift is underlain by a zone with low mantle seismic velocities that extends to at least 200 km depth. Thus, the Reelfoot Rift, which hosts the New Madrid Seismic Zone, is unique among North American paleo-rifts in term of the properties in the mantle. We hypothesize that this low-velocity mantle volume is weaker than its surroundings and that the Reelfoot Rift consequently has relatively lower elastic plate thickness that would tend to concentrate tectonic stress within this zone. On a continental scale, the 3D velocity model clearly identifies an approximately 220-km-thick, high seismic velocity lithospheric root beneath the North America craton which has a low rate of crustal seismicity and very few events with Mw≥6. We attribute the relatively aseismic nature of the craton to dry, cold conditions within the cratonic lower crust and mantle lithosphere. Conversely, we find that a high proportion of intraplate events are concentrated around the pronounced lateral gradient in lithospheric thickness that surrounds the craton. We attribute this observation to a lateral decrease in lithospheric strength at the edge of the North American craton. This relationship between intraplate seismicity and lithospheric properties is apparent in maps that compare regional and continental lithospheric thickness with crustal seismicity. We conclude that we should not expect intraplate earthquakes to be uniformly distributed. They are found to be associated with zones of reduced lithospheric strength that can be identified in 3D seismic models. This conclusion lends support to the concept that historical seismicity is a useful indicator of potential future earthquake locations.",

            "abstract": "Extracting the information contained in seismograms for better description of the Earth structure and evolution is often based on only selected attributes of these signals. Exploiting the entire seismogram, Full Wave Inversion based on an adjoint estimation of the gradient and Hessian operators, has been recognized as a high-resolution imaging technique. Most of earthquake kinematics inversion are still based on the estimation of the Frechet derivatives for the gradient operator computation in linearized optimization. One may wonder the benefit of the adjoint formulation which avoids the estimation of these derivatives for the gradient estimation. Recently, Somala et al. (submitted) have detailed the adjoint method for earthquake kinematics inversion starting from the second-order wave equation in 3D media. They have used a conjugate gradient method for the optimization procedure. We explore a similar adjoint formulation based on the first-order wave equations while using different optimization schemes. Indeed, for earthquake kinematics inversion, the model space is the slip-rate spatio-temporal history over the fault. Seismograms obtained from a dislocation rupture simulation are linearly linked to this slip-rate distribution. Therefore, we introduce a simple systematic procedure based on Lagrangian formulation of the adjoint method in the linear problem of earthquake kinematics. We have developed both the gradient estimation using the adjoint formulation and the Hessian influence using the second-order adjoint formulation (Metivier et al, 2013, 2014). Since the earthquake kinematics is a linear problem, the minimization problem is quadratic, henceforth, only one solution of the Newton equations is needed with the Hessian impact. Moreover, the formal uncertainty estimation over slip-rate distribution could be deduced from this Hessian analysis. On simple synthetic examples for antiplane kinematic rupture configuration in 2D medium, we illustrate the properties of sensitivity kernels for different receivers configurations, the performances of different optimization algorithms (see open software at http://www-ljk.imag.fr/membres/Ludovic.Metivier). We may conclude about the acquisition configuration needed for successful imaging reconstruction of seismic kinematic rupture.",

            "abstract": "Tektites (natural glasses formed as quenched impact melt ejecta) commonly contain inclusions of nearly pure silica glass (“lechatelierite”) thought to be quenched from molten silica produced by melting of quartz grains. We investigated chemical diffusion between lechatelierite (~100% SiO2) and surrounding felsic glass (~73% SiO2) in a natural indochinite tektite and in experimental analogues. We discovered concentration profiles of major elements across lechatelierite-felsic glass contacts that reflect diffusion between the two melts at high T as the they followed a ballistic trajectory prior to quenching. The profiles provide information on multicomponent diffusion at the high-silica end of composition space and on the thermal histories of tektites.\nTo reproduce the profiles, we undertook a series of high T melting experiments using an aerodynamic levitation laser furnace. A starting mixture of powdered natural tektite plus quartz grains was exposed to temperatures of 1800-2400˚C for 1-120 s. Direct comparison of concentration profiles between the indochinite and experiments reveals a best match at 2200˚C and 50 s. This experiment successfully reproduced all major aspects of the concentration profiles observed in the natural sample including diffusion length scale, asymmetry, order of steepness of major element profiles, and uphill diffusion of K2O.\nNot enough information is available to model the full multicomponent diffusion problem, but SiO2 and Al2O3 concentration profiles from lechatelierite to surrounding felsic glass in the experiments can be fit well as a diffusion couple between silica melt and adjacent felsic melt using an effective binary diffusion approach and assuming that the effective binary SiO2 and Al2O3 diffusivities depend exponentially on SiO2 concentration. Further quantification of the diffusion behavior should allow constraints on the thermal histories of tektites.",

While, the SST variability in the central-to-eastern tropical Pacific is highly negatively correlated with that in the central-to-eastern North Pacific after the 1998/99 regime shift, it is not before the 1998/99 regime shift. It is found that the anomalous Aleutian low pressure in response to the tropical SST forcing becomes stronger and its center is shifted to the south and to the west after the 1998/99 to regime shift, which plays a key role to tighten the relationship in the tropical Pacific-North Pacific SST variability. Such a modulation of Aleutian low pressure is mainly due to the location of tropical heating, which is shifted to the west around the dateline in the tropical Pacific across the 1998/99 regime shift. Simple atmospheric model experiments also support this hypothesis that the shift of tropical heating to the west is responsible for strengthening the relationship in the tropical Pacific-North Pacific SST variability via the modulation of atmospheric teleconnections.",

            "abstract": "Stromatolites are organic-sedimentary structures that form by trapping and binding of sediments and calcium carbonate precipitation through microbial activity. The largest modern stromatolite province is the hypersaline Hamelin Pool, Western Australia. Microbial precipitation generates a rigid framework with a wide range of porosities and pore sizes that influence the ultrasonic velocity permeability and resistivity in stromatolites.\nStromatolites generally have simple and large pore structures and an impressive high permeability values. In the 55 core plugs, permeability varies from 0.5 D to 9 D, while porosity ranges from 17% to 46%. Ultrasonic velocity, measured under dry and saturated conditions, is generally high with a large scatter at any given porosity. Likewise large variations of porosity exist at any given velocity. For example, at 29% porosity, (dry) velocity ranges from 3611m/s to 5384m/s. Similarly at a velocity of 4048m/s the porosity ranges from 23% to 46%. Digital image analysis indicates that the main control on the variations is the pore complexity and size. Larger pores produce faster velocities at equal porosity. In saturated plugs compressional velocities increase up to 365m/s. In contrast, shear velocities show both a decrease (up to 578m/s) and an increase (up to 391m/s) in shear velocity (vs) with saturation. These changes in vsindicate that the stromatolites do change the shear modulus with saturation, thus violating the assumption by Gassmann.\nThe cementation factor “m” (from Archie’s equation, F = φ-m) determined from electrical resistivity varies in a narrow range from 2.1 to 2.6. This narrow range reduces the uncertainty in predicting the hydrocarbon/water saturation in stromatolites. The large range of porosities at a given velocity, however, makes porosity estimates from seismic inversion a challenge and, similarly, the shear moduli changes and the resultant shear strengthening and weakening add uncertainties to AVO analysis in microbialite strata.",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET), especially in the mainland of the Indochina peninsula, can impact and is impacted by the Asian monsoonal (AM) system, thereby prompting interest in its long-term variability. To separate physical and biological factors controlling ET variability in a tropical deciduous forest under the AM influence, 7-year eddy-covariance and ancillary measurements were collected and analyzed. The 7-year mean rainfall (Pr) and ET along with their standard deviations were 1335 ± 256 and 1027 ± 77.9 mm (about 77% of Pr), respectively, suggesting close coupling between these two hydrologic fluxes. However, other physical and biological drivers de-couple seasonal and annual variations of ET from Pr. To explore them, a big-leaf model complemented by perturbation analysis was employed. The big-leaf model agreed well with measured ET at daily to multi-year time scales, lending confidence in its skill to separate biological from physical controls on ET. Using this formulation, both first-order and second-order Taylor series expansion of total ET derivatives were applied to the big-leaf model and compare with measured changes in ET (dET). Higher-order and joint-terms in the second-order expansion were necessary for matching measured and analyzed dET. Vapor pressure deficit (D) was the primary external physical controlling driver on ET. The leaf area index (LAI) and bulk stomatal conductance (gs) were shown to be the main significant biological drivers on the transpiration component of ET. It can be surmised that rainfall variability controls long-term ET through physical (mainly D) and biological (mainly LAI and gs) in this ecosystem.",

Although δDwax values and their lapse rates differ at the three vapor thansport paths, altitude is the predominant factor in determining soil δDwax values along three transects, combined as the Southeast Tibetan Plateau (R2= 0.75; with lapse rate of 2.2‰/100 m). The isotopic altitude effect or the lapse rates of δDwax was more close to river altitudinal gradients along the Southern Himalayas transect. The lapse rate of soil δDwax with altitude is the largest in the Southern Himalaya, due to a large altitude contrast over a short distance, the monsoon precipitation and the monsoonal-driven convection controlling the \"amount effect\". The lapse rate of the Lhasa-Bayi transect is much smaller than the Southern Himalayas transect and the Zayu-Bomi transect, due to they have experienced intensive evaporation. The smaller altitudinal lapse rate is consistent with the report of the lapse rate of river water δD and δ18O values from the Lhasa River and Nyang branch of the Yarlung Zangbo River. Our results have important implications for the evolution of the southern to central Tibetan Plateau. Paleoelevation reconstructions of the southern to central Tibetan Plateau (Such as Lunpola basin) should take into account the impact of monsoon strength variations (through the amount effect), latitude and (or) vapor transport or distance from the coast, mixing between continental and monsoon-derived moisture, evaporation and recycling of surface water under arid conditions, topography, local environment and climate conditions on the relationships with elevation and δDwax (and linear isotopic lapse rates) for central Tibet.",

            "abstract": "Recently off-shore tsunami observation stations based on cabled ocean bottom pressure gauges are actively being deployed especially in Japan. These cabled systems are designed to provide real-time tsunami data before tsunamis reach coastlines for disaster mitigation purposes. To receive real benefits of these observations, real-time analysis techniques to make an effective use of these data are necessary. A representative study was made by Tsushima et al. (2009) that proposed a method to provide instant tsunami source prediction based on achieving tsunami waveform data. As time passes, the prediction is improved by using updated waveform data. After a tsunami source is predicted, tsunami waveforms are synthesized from pre-computed tsunami Green functions of linear long wave equations. Tsushima et al. (2014) updated the method by combining the tsunami waveform inversion with an instant inversion of coseismic crustal deformation and improved the prediction accuracy and speed in the early stages.   For disaster mitigation purposes, real-time predictions of tsunami inundation are also important. In this study, we discuss the possibility of real-time tsunami inundation predictions, which require faster-than-real-time tsunami inundation simulation in addition to instant tsunami source analysis. Although the computational amount is large to solve non-linear shallow water equations for inundation predictions, it has become executable through the recent developments of high performance computing technologies. We conducted parallel computations of tsunami inundation and achieved 6.0 TFLOPS by using 19,000 CPU cores. We employed a leap-frog finite difference method with nested staggered grids of which resolution range from 405 m to 5 m. The resolution ratio of each nested domain was 1/3. Total number of grid points were 13 million, and the time step was 0.1 seconds. Tsunami sources of 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake were tested. The inundation prediction up to 2 hours after the earthquake occurs took about 2 minutes, which would be sufficient for a practical tsunami inundation predictions. In the presentation, the computational performance of our faster-than-real-time tsunami inundation model will be shown, and preferable tsunami wave source analysis for an accurate inundation prediction will also be discussed.",

The spectral reflectance of the canopy is determined by optical properties (spectral reflectance and transmittance) of single leaves and their spatial arrangements in the canopy. The optical properties of leaves reflect their pigments contents and anatomical structures. Thus detailed information and understandings of the consequence between ecophysiological traits and optical properties from single leaf to canopy level are essential for remote sensing of canopy ecophysiology.\nTo develop the ecophysiological remote sensing of forest canopy, we have been promoting multiple and cross-scale measurements in “Takayama site” belonging to AsiaFlux and JaLTER networks, located in a cool-temperate deciduous broadleaf forest on a mountainous landscape in Japan. In this forest, in situ measurement of canopy spectral reflectance has been conducted continuously by a spectroradiometer as part of the “Phenological Eyes Network (PEN)” since 2004. To analyze the canopy spectral reflectance from leaf ecophysiological viewpoints, leaf mass per area, nitrogen content, chlorophyll contents, photosynthetic capacities and the optical properties have been measured for dominant canopy tree species Quercus crispla and Betula ermanii throughout the seasons for multiple years.\nPhotosynthetic capacity was largely correlated with chlorophyll contents throughout the growing season in both Q. crispla and B. ermanii. In these leaves, the reflectance at “red edge” (710 nm) changed by corresponding to the changes of chlorophyll contents throughout the seasons. Our canopy-level examination showed that vegetation indices obtained by red edge reflectance have linear relationship with leaf chlorophyll contents and photosynthetic capacity. Finally we apply this knowledge to the Rapid Eye satellite imagery around Takayama site to scale-up the leaf-level findings to canopy and landscape levels on a mountainous landscape.",

Surface groundwater can flow along fractures into the deep geological repository, which may cause oxic conditions. In the oxic conditions, uranium can be oxidized from U(Ⅳ) to U(Ⅵ) and U(Ⅵ) can easily migrate in groundwater due to its high mobility. Chlorite with Fe(Ⅱ), which is a phyllosilicate minerals generally occurred in fractures, can help maintenance of the reducing condition because chlorite can consume oxidizing agents by redox reactions. In this study, redox kinetics of chlorite were investigated by conducting redox batch kinetic tests at various conditions (i.e., concentration of oxidizing agent, pH, and presence of NaCl). Colloidal particle formation during redox reactions of chlorite was also investigated. Two types of chlorite samples: low iron content (CCa-2) and high iron content (Chlorite from Daejeon, South Korea) were used. Redox batch kinetic tests were conducted for 60 days. The solutions, reactants, and colloidal particles collected from the redox batch kinetic tests every 10 days were characterized. Results show that the concentration of oxidizing agent decreased more in the chlorite sample having higher Fe(Ⅱ) content than that having lower Fe(Ⅱ) content. After 10 days, both the chlorite samples tend to be reached steady-state conditions and then no changes in the concentration of oxidizing agent were observed. SEM analysis shows that surface and edge of the chlorite samples tend to be crispy and smoothy with increasing reaction time. SEM-EDS analysis on colloidal particles shows that colloidal particles consisted of Fe and O, which were identified as ferrihydrite.",

            "abstract": "We have investigated symmetry/asymmetry properties in climate-terrestrial carbon dynamics by conducting a literature review and a data analysis based on both existing field data and modeling data. We hypothesize that in bidirectional interactions of climate and carbon, the greenhouse effect of carbon on climate is symmetric and unconditional. On the other hand, climate controls on carbon exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and atmosphere are asymmetric. Symmetry-breaking of climate control on photosynthesis occurs at temperature thresholds, while symmetry-breaking of climate control on terrestrial respiration occurs at soil-moisture thresholds. These climate thresholds switch climate control mechanism on NEE from one to another. Also these climate thresholds characterize optimal (or worst) climate conditions for transfer of atmospheric CO2 into terrestrial ecosystems. Taking climate thresholds as a reference climate, the impact of climate extremes on terrestrial carbon sequestration can be estimated by a perfect-deficit approach. This hypothesis has been testified by abundant observational data and modeling data.\nAcknowledgements: This research was financially supported by PSC-CUNY Award (PSC-CUNY-ENHC-44-83).",

            "abstract": "Point-to-point magnetic connectivity has a stochastic character whenever magnetic fluctuations cause a field line random walk, with observable manifestations such as dropouts of solar energetic particles and upstream events at Earth’s bow shock. This can also change due to dynamical activity. Comparing the instantaneous magnetic connectivity to the same point at two different times, we provide a nonperturbative analytic theory for the ensemble average perpendicular displacement of the magnetic field line, given the power spectrum of magnetic fluctuations. For simplicity, the theory is developed in the context of transverse turbulence, and is numerically evaluated for two specific models: reduced magnetohydrodynanmics (RMHD), a quasi-two dimensional model of anisotropic turbulence that is applicable to low-beta plasmas, and two-dimensional (2D) plus slab turbulence, which is a good parameterization for solar wind turbulence. We take into account the dynamical decorrelation of magnetic fluctuations due to wave propagation, nonlinear distortion, random sweeping, and convection by a bulk wind flow relative to the observer. The mean squared time-differenced displacement increases with time and with parallel distance, becoming twice the field line random walk displacement at long distances and/or times, corresponding to a pair of uncorrelated random walks. These results are relevant to a variety of astrophysical processes, such as electron transport and heating patterns in coronal loops and the solar transition region, changing magnetic connection to particle sources near the Sun or at a planetary bow shock, and thickening of coronal hole boundaries.

The relationship between permafrost degradation and development of thermokarst ponds is still unclear. The lack of understanding of the hydrological regimes of the thermokarst ponds in different permafrost regions hinders the prediction of its development, as well as the hydrological responses to climate change. Here we investigate the permafrost features of a shallow thermokarst pond in a rainfall-controlling catchment and the major hydrological processes that influence its development using intensive geotechnical and geophysical surveys like ground-penetrating radar and electrical resistivity tomography. We then characterize its hydrological regime with field observations and reproduce it with a hydrological model - GEOtop. By the end, the effects of permafrost degradation on the development of the rainfall-controlling thermokarst pond are evaluated by projecting an increase in air temperature till 2050 using the latest climate model (CanESM2 from CMIP5) data. These findings suggest that not only thermal regime of thermokarst ponds but also the highly climate-related hydrological regime should be considered in modeling the development of thermokarst ponds on the QTP.",

            "abstract": "The potential decadal predictability of land hydrological and biogeochemical variables in North America is examined using a 900-year-long pre-industrial control simulation, conducted with the NCAR Community EarthSystem Model (CESM). The leading modes of simulated North American precipitation and soil water storage are characterized by qualitatively similar meridional seesaw patterns associated with the downstream activity of the westerly jet. Whereas the corresponding precipitation variability can be described as a white noise stochastic process, power spectra of vertically integrated soil water exhibit significant redness on timescales of years to decades since the predictability of soil water storage arises mostly from the integration of precipitation variability. As a result, our ensemble hindcasts conducted with the CESM for various initial conditions are skillful with lead times of up to several years due to the long-term memory of damped persistence. Our control simulation further suggests that decadal variations in soil water storage also affect vegetation and wildfire occurrences. Our results demonstrate that skillful decadal predictions of soil water storage, carbon stock, and fire frequency are feasible with proper initialization of soil conditions. Although the potential predictability in our idealized modeling framework would overestimate the real predictability of the coupled climate-land-vegetation system, the decadal climate prediction may become beneficial for water resource management, forestry, and agriculture.",

            "abstract": "This study aims to compare the GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement)-derived precipitation data with other precipitation products and numerical model simulations as the first step toward the possible use of GPM-derived precipitation data in numerical weather prediction through data assimilation. In February 2014, the GPM satellite was launched successfully and started observing global precipitation between 65S and 65N using the new DPR (Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar) sensor. The GPM/DPR observes three-dimensional meteorological echoes with Ku-band and Ka-band radars. It is among our interests how the precipitation data from GPM/DPR compare with other precipitation data. In this study, we compare the GPM/DPR precipitation data with simulated precipitation from the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) at a 3.5-km horizontal resolution. Precipitation products derived from GPM/GMI (GPM Microwave Imager) and GSMaP/NRT are also compared. We focus on two precipitation types from May to July, 2014: frontal precipitation cases and tropical cyclone cases. The spatial pattern of the frontal precipitation measured by GPM/DPR agrees generally well with those of the other precipitation data. However, GPM/GMI-derived precipitation is systematically less than that of the NICAM simulation. By contrast, the vertical structures are considerably different between GPM/DPR and the NICAM simulation. The simulated mixing ratios indicate snow and graupel at upper levels, but these are not captured by GPM/DPR. The tropical cyclones captured by GPM/DPR are simulated reasonably well by NICAM. Further investigations will be made and will be included in this presentation.",

Recently, the GRIMs-DFS dynamical core was updated in two respects: (1) better scalability on high-performance computing platform; and (2) reduction of numerical time-stepping error.\nTo improve the parallel efficiency, the archived wave domain was designed not to be sliced in the meridional direction, but to be decomposed in the horizontal and vertical directions. Although the computational cost slightly increased due to the requirement of temporary work array, the revised DFS dynamical core yielded higher scalability in terms of the wall-clock-time than the original one. In addition, its efficiency gain became greater with the increase of horizontal resolution when the number of processors is increased.\nThe Robert-Asselin-Williams (RAW) time filter has been proposed as a simple improvement to the widely used Robert-Asselin filter, in order to reduce time-stepping errors in semi-implicit leapfrog integration. This new approach was implemented into the GRIMs-DFS dynamical core and its impact was quantitatively evaluated on medium-range forecast and seasonal ensemble prediction frameworks. Preliminary results showed that the RAW time-filter properly reduced spurious light rainfalls that might be produced from unphysical computational mode generated by leap-frog time stepping.

            "abstract": "A large red tide bloom in the south East/Japan Sea had occurred during the summer of 2013. The bloom had lasted for 51 days from 17th of July to 5th of September. During this time period, the red tide dinoflagellate, Cochlodinium polykrikoides was found. C.polykrikoides has been known for preventing oxygen exchanges of fish gills by attaching, leading to perish fishes. Thus, it is important to understand various stages of conditions of red tide developing progress, especially C.polykrikoides, because the fishery industry was damaged due to sporadic and fatal red tide. According to previous research, optimum growth parameters for C.polykrikoides are relatively high temperature and salinity (30-32°C, 30-33psu). We examined causes of red tide bloom using multi-satellite measurements. Research results show that this red tide bloom is related to three processes: enough sunlight, upwelling favorable winds, and warm water. Based on Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), cloud presence during August 2013 was smallest during last three years. So the first condition to form such a large bloom is insolation. At the same time, the wind was favorable for the Ekman pumping off the coast of the south East Japan Sea estimated using wind data measured by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E). In addition to offshore Ekman pumping, the onshore upwelling was also observed, which shows relatively cold water on the coastal regions, measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of Sea Surface Temperature (SST). Accordingly, coastal upwelling supplies nutrients for flourishing C.polykrikoides which is the second condition. The third condition is relatively warm sea surface water of August of 2013 in the region compared to previous years. Furthermore, the Sea Surface Height Anomaly (SSHA) data was also used to understand the current systems around the red tide bloom. In the summer of 2013 at the East/Japan Sea, abundance of insolation, offshore Ekman pumping and coastal upwelling, and warm waters work together contributing to the largest red tide bloom.",

            "abstract": "For seismic velocity tomography, Vp, Vs and Vp/Vs models can be inverted by first arrival P, S times and their differences, respectively (Zhang et al., 2009). These models are only indirectly linked by common earthquake locations. Because of different data quality and quantity, these models may have different resolutions and uncertainties, thus leading to some artifacts in model structures. As a result, it causes some difficulties in interpreting anomalies in these models because anomaly boundaries could be shifted among Vp, Vs, and Vp/Vs models. In this research, we enforce structure similarity among different models using the cross-gradient approach proposed by Gallarado and Meju (2003), where the cross product of the spatial gradients of different models is forced to be zero.\nFor seismic attenuation tomography, the velocity model is fixed and the attenuation model is inverted using the t* values. In generally, the attenuation model has a lower resolution compared to the velocity model because of lower amount of t* data. For this reason, the structures in the attenuation model may also be different from the velocity model although their real structures could be same. For mitigating this issue, we enforce the attenuation model to be structurally similar to the velocity model by the cross gradient constraint. For both seismic velocity and attenuation tomography, the structure constraint and data fitting are balanced by a weighting parameter found by the L-curve analysis.\nWe test the new methods on the 2013 Lushan earthquake dataset. On April 20, 2013, an Mw6.6 earthquake occurred in the Lushan, Sichuan area, about 80 km southwest of the epicenter of the catastrophic 2008 Mw 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake. To monitor aftershocks, we installed a temporary seismic network consisting of 29 short period seismic stations in the aftershock zone. Within 3 weeks of operation, ~4000 events were detected and located. Previous velocity models clearly showed a velocity contrast at a depth of ~8 km, below which the velocity is much higher than the above zone. As expected, although Vp, Vs and Vp/Vs models share similar features, they show different model structures to some extent. By incorporating the structure constraint, the velocity models have more similar structures and at the same time they can also fit the separate data at a similar level.",

            "abstract": "Projections of anthropogenic aerosol emissions are uncertain. In Asia, it is possible that emissions may increase if business continues as usual, with economic growth driving an increase in coal burning. But it is also possible that emissions may decrease rapidly due to the widespread adoption of cleaner technology or a shift towards non-coal fuels, such as natural gas. In this study, the transient climate impacts of three aerosol emissions scenarios are investigated: an RCP4.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5) control; a scenario with reduced Asian anthropogenic aerosol emissions; and a scenario with enhanced Asian anthropogenic aerosol emissions. A coupled atmosphere-ocean configuration of CESM (Community Earth System Model), including CAM5 (Community Atmosphere Model version 5), is used. Enhanced Asian aerosol emissions are found to delay global mean warming by one decade at the end of the century. Aerosol-induced suppression of the East Asian and South Asian summer monsoon precipitation occurs. The enhanced Asian aerosol emissions also remotely impact precipitation in other parts of the world: over the Sahel, West African monsoon precipitation is suppressed; and over Australia, austral summer monsoon precipitation is enhanced. These remote impacts on precipitation are associated with a southward shift of the ITCZ. The aerosol-induced sea surface temperature (SST) response appears to play an important role in the precipitation changes over South Asia and Australia, but not over East Asia. These results indicate that energy production in Asia, through the consequent aerosol emissions and associated radiative effects, might significantly influence future climate both locally and globally.",

In order to understand the large scales of its interactions, a temporal and spatial variation of polynyas and, areas of open water in the middle of ice shelf, around the Antarctica were analyzed based on remote sensing measurements. Especially, the polynya in the Ross Sea (Ross polynya) was analyzed, which was the largest on among the all of them around the Antarctica for last decades. Accordingly, the main purpose of this presentation is to (1) evaluate a variability of Ross polynya spatial and temporal characteristics and (2) address relationship between spatial polynya variability and global warming effect. In order to conduct research the observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMAR-E) were used. The products (SST, wind speed, cloud vapor, atmospheric water vapor and rain rate), including sea ice extent, are from June 2002 to October 2011. Additionally, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data sets were used to estimate mass changes in adjacent ice sheet affected by local atmospheric condition. Based on the nine year’s data, research results suggest that Ross polynya normally started to appear around the end of December and persist for about 77.5 days. The extent of Ross polynya in 2011 is the largest and had a tendency to increase year after year. SST in adjacent sea has slightly decreased for the same period (as 0.054◦C yr-1) due to the melting ice and variation of wind, water vapor and rain rate are 0.054 m s-1 yr-1, -0.027 mm yr-1 and 0.001 mm hr-1 yr-1, respectively. Increase land mass in the west-southern Antarctica could be the result of accumulating snow which is made of vapor induced by extended polynya. In addition, we would conduct to evaluate a correlation with characteristics of other global and local components corresponding climate change and understand that how the climate change effect have implications for Ross polynya and glacial or environmental condition in the vicinity.",

We collected continuous ambient noise data of two weeks from 17 stations in the center of city with a lateral scale about 5 km by 7 km. The S-transform technique is used to stack vertical-component cross-correlation functions from hourly data, which yields much higher SNR of the high frequency surface waves than traditional linear stack. We developed a ray-tracing based iterative surface wave tomography method with spatial smoothing constraints (model regularization) based on ray path density.This method is used to construct frequency-dependent phase velocity maps in the study area, which can account for the effect of ray bending in the tomographic inversion. We also developed a new direct surface wave inversion method to iteratively invert surface wave dispersion data of all paths for 3-D variations of shear wave velocity in the study area without the intermediate step of phase or group velocity maps.The method uses frequency dependent propagation paths and a wavelet-based sparsity-constrained tomography inversion.\nHefei city is located in a basin and its southern suburb close to the Chao Lake, the fifth largest lake in China. The inversion results show that the north part has much higher velocity(~2.5 km/s) in the top several hundred meters than the south part(~0.8 km/s), basically consistent with the regional geology and some borehole data. Since the variation of near surface velocity structure is large, we observe complex ray paths. In order to study deeper structure (e.g., around a few kilometers at depth), we need to extend the array to a broader area in order to retrieve surface waves at lower frequencies from ambient noise cross-correlation.",

            "abstract": "Reanalysis data have global coverage and faithfully render large-scale phenomena. On the other hand, regional and small-scale characteristics of atmospheric variability are poorly resolved. In an attempt to improve reanalysis data for regional use, statistical downscaling method is developed based on CSEOF analysis. Low-resolution data are downscaled into a high-resolution data. The developed algorithm is applied to National Center for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data and European Center of Medium range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA-interim reanalysis data to downscale them into a form of Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) measurements at 60 stations over the Korean Peninsula. The developed downscaling algorithm is evaluated by predicting winter daily temperatures from Nov 17 – Mar 16 for the period of 34 years (1979-2013). For validation of the method, the Jackknife method is used, in which winter daily temperature is predicted over a one-year period not used for training. This procedure is repeated for the entire data period. The mean and variance of the resulting downscaled dataset match well with those of the KMA measurements. Validation results show that correlation increases and error variance decreases significantly at grid points near the KMA stations with and without the seasonal cycle. We will also address the utility of this technique for downscaling model predictions based on future scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Although there is little doubt that fluid-induced earthquakes contribute significantly to the seismic hazard in some parts of the United States, assessing this contribution in ways consistent with hazard assessment for natural earthquakes is proving to be challenging. For natural earthquakes, the hazard is considered to be independent of time whereas for fluid-induced seismicity there is considerable time dependence as evidenced, for instance, by the dramatic increase in recent years of the seismicity in Oklahoma. Case histories of earthquakes induced by the development of Enhanced Geothermal Systems and wastewater injection at depth illustrate a few of the problems. Analyses of earthquake sequences induced by these operations indicate that the rate of earthquake occurrence is proportional to the rate of injection, a factor that, on a broad scale, depends on the level of energy production activities. For natural earthquakes, in contrast, the rate of earthquake occurrence depends on time-independent tectonic factors including the long-term slip rates across known faults. Maximum magnitude assessments for natural and fluid-induced earthquake sources also show a contrast in behavior. For a natural earthquake source, maximum magnitude is commonly assessed from empirical relations between magnitude and the area of a potentially-active fault. The same procedure applied to fluid-induced earthquakes yields magnitudes that are systematically higher than what is observed. For instance, the maximum magnitude estimated from the fault area of the Prague, OK, main shock of 6 November 2011 is 6.2 whereas the magnitude measured from seismic data is 5.65 (Sun and Hartzell, 2014). For fluid-induced earthquakes, maximum magnitude appears to be limited according to the volume of fluid injected before the largest earthquake. This implies that for a given fluid-injection project, the upper limit on magnitude increases as long as injection continues.",

            "abstract": "The air quality community uses satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) for a variety of applications, including daily air quality forecasting, retrospective event analysis, and justification for Exceptional Events. AOD is suitable for ambient air quality applications because is related to particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5) concentrations in the atmosphere; higher values of AOD correspond to higher concentrations of particulate matter. AOD is useful for identifying and tracking areas of high PM2.5 concentrations that correspond to air quality events, such as wildfires, dust storms, or haze episodes. Currently, the air quality community utilizes AOD from the MODIS instrument on NASA’s polar-orbiting Terra and Aqua satellites and from NOAA’s GOES geostationary satellites (e.g, GASP). The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument on the Suomi-NPP satellite is making AOD measurements that are similar to MODIS AOD, but with higher spatial resolution. Two AOD products are available from VIIRS: the 750 m nadir resolution Intermediate Product (IP) and the 6 km resolution Environmental Data Record (EDR) product, which is aggregated from IP measurements. These VIIRS AOD products offer a substantial increase in spatial resolution compared to the MODIS AOD 3 km and 10 km AOD products, respectively. True color (RGB) imagery is also available from VIIRS as a decision aid for air quality applications. It serves as a complement to AOD measurements by providing visible information about areas of smoke, haze, and blowing dust in the atmosphere. Case studies of VIIRS AOD and RGB data for recent air quality events will be presented, with a focus on wildfires, and the relative pros and cons of the VIIRS AOD IP and EDR for air quality applications will be discussed in comparison to MODIS AOD products. Improvements to VIIRS aerosol products based on user feedback as part of the NOAA Satellite Air Quality Proving Ground (AQPG) will be outlined, and an overview of future outreach activities will be provided, including training events designed to build the capacity of users.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution studies of ODP Leg 199 and IODP Exp 320 reported several carbonate accumulation events (CAEs) during the middle to late Eocene in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP), suggesting hundred meter-scale fluctuations of the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) (Lyle et al., 2005; Pälike et al., 2010). Pälike et al. (2012) proposed that partitioning of labile and refractory organic matters may account for these frequent CCD fluctuations. Depth-transect approach on benthic foraminifera with trophic condition may be useful to test this hypothesis. Additionally, deep-sea benthic foraminifera experienced small faunal transitions in the late middle Eocene and the late Eocene (e.g., Nomura, 1995). This hypothesis may be also clue to understand biotic responses of deep-sea benthic foraminifera. We analyzed faunal composition of benthic foraminifera at ODP Site 1218 (3500–3090 m paleo-depth) during ~42–38 Ma and compared it with the results (Takata et al., 2013) of IODP Site U1333 (3720–3560 m paleo-depth) during CAE-3 and CAE-4.\nAfter common occurrence of Quadrimorphina profunda (opportunist?) in the early part of CAE-4, Virgulinopsis navarroana, morphologically infauna, increased in the late part of CAE-4 with an increase of Benthic Foraminiferal Accumulation Rate (paleo-productivity) both at Sites 1218 and U1333. This species became common in the abyssal EEP from this timing to the latest Eocene (Takata, unpublished data). Such occurrence may reflect the increased export of labile organic matter to seafloor. In contrast, Globocassidulina globosa was more common during middle part of the CAE-3 at Site U1333 than at Site 1218, suggesting some seasonal food supply at the deeper depth. Such occurrence might be related to transient diatom abundance (Lyle et al., 2002), implying the presence of the depth gradient on the export of organic matter from the surface ocean. The hypothesis about partitioning of labile and refractory organic matters may have potential to interpret the faunal transitions of deep-sea benthic foraminifera in the middle to late Eocene.",

            "abstract": "The State of Alaska is reviving analyses of the Susitna River’s hydroelectric potential by supporting a multitude of field and modeling studies for the proposed Susitna-Watana Hydroelectric project. Critical to any effective hydroelectric development is a firm understanding of the basin-wide controls on river runoff and how seasonal reservoir recharge may change over the course of the structure’s life-span. Effectively projecting future changes in watershed-scale stream flow for the Susitna river demands understanding and quantifying glacier melt in the Alaskan range. Our research is restricted to a sub-catchment of the upper Susitna basin that feeds the Susitna River covering 2,230 km2, of which 25% is glacierized. The goals of our study are to investigate the spatial and seasonal variations of the energy balance and its components across the glaciers and to model resulting streamflow from the catchment for the summer of 2013 using two models of different complexity. We apply DEBAM, a distributive energy balance model and DETIM, an enhanced temperature-index model, both coupled to a linear-reservoir runoff model, to simulate hourly surface energy fluxes, melt rates and glacier runoff using meteorological observations from an automated weather station located in the ablation zone of the West Fork glacier. Model results are compared to measurements of streamflow and mass balance at 20 ablation stakes across the glacierized area. The largest source of energy contributing to 85% of melt is net radiation followed by the sensible and latent heat fluxes. Both models capture well the seasonal and diurnal variations in streamflow and show good agreement with the mass balance point observations. The discrepancies between modeled and measured discharge can be attributed to the high uncertainty in precipitation and initial snow cover across the unglaciated part of the basin which accounts for over 75% of the modeled area.",

            "abstract": "The Source Physics Experiment (SPE) is a series of underground chemical explosions at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) that are improving our physical understanding how explosion sources generate seismic waves. Better understanding the origin of S-waves from explosions is a primary goal of the SPE. Even at distances of a few kilometers from the SPE sources, seismic recordings include arrivals of unknown origin that could originate as S-waves at the explosive source or from topographic and subsurface scatterers. Back propagation of time reversed seismograms has been used to determine the location of seismic events (e.g. Tromp et al., 2005; Larmat et al., 2006), and Myers et al. (2007) demonstrated that the time-reversal method can be used to determine the origin of direct and scattered waves in seismic simulations. In this study we identify the origin of distinct features in synthetic seismograms that are generated by elastic, finite-difference simulation of seismic propagation from SPE explosions through a model that has been developed specifically for the SPE. The SPE model includes 3-dimensional velocity discontinuities at geologic boundaries, as well as free-surface topography. Although the largest arrivals in the synthetic seismograms are expected to originate at the explosion source, other prominent features are likely to originate as scattered energy from model discontinuities. Scattering sources in the SPE model that are needed in order to match synthetic seismograms to field recordings of SPE shots will be identified. Conversely, model structures may be removed if they result in disagreement between synthetic seismograms and field recordings. Ultimately, we plan to constrain the origin of prominent features in field recordings of SPE shots by directly using the field recordings as inputs to time reversal simulations. Direct use of field recordings will require development of methods that account for the uncertainty of the seismic model through which time-reversed signals are propagated.

The composition of particles collected by a micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI) first subjected to different OH exposures is analyzed by Raman and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy coupled with near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (STXM/NEXAFS). Levoglucosan (LEV), 4-methyl-5-nitrocatechol (MNC), and potassium sulfate (KS) serve as representative compounds found in BBA that have different hygroscopicity, chemical functionalities, and reactivity with OH radicals. BBA surrogate-particles are generated following atomization of aqueous solutions with mass ratios LEV:MNC:KS of 1:0:0, 0:1:0, 0:0:1, 1:1:0, 0:1:1, 1:0:1, 1:1:1, and 1:0.03:0.3. OH radicals are generated in the AFR following photolysis of O3 in the presence of H2O using a variable intensity ultra-violet (UV) lamp, which allows equivalent atmospheric OH exposures from days to weeks. In addition, we investigate how κ changes i) in response to varying [O3] with and without OH, and ii) at a fixed OH exposure while varying RH. The impact of OH exposure on the CCN activity of BBA will be presented and its atmospheric implications will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "We simulate the present and potential future atmospheric transport and fate of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), using the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. PCBs are toxic, persistent, and bioaccumulative chemicals whose production and use have been banned internationally. PCBs continue to cycle through the global atmosphere, however, because of their persistence, passive emissions from remaining stocks, and release from natural storage reservoirs such as oceans or soils. In particular, PCBs have been shown to transport long distances in the atmosphere to locations remote from emissions, such as the Arctic, where they can accumulate in wildlife and humans, putting health at risk. Previous studies have suggested that PCBs may be remobilized in a changing climate because higher temperatures will cause greater re-emissions from surface reservoirs. Here, we modify GEOS-Chem to simulate atmospheric PCB transport and investigate the relative effects of predicted climate changes and projected declines in primary emissions, especially on transport to the Arctic. We quantify changes in atmospheric concentrations of two PCBs (CB28 and CB 153) under 2050 climate (“FC”); 2050 emissions (“FE”); and 2050 climate and emissions combined (“FCFE”); relative to a 2000 climate, 2000 emissions control scenario, and determine the major processes affecting these changes. In the version of the model presented here, only soil-atmosphere surface interactions are considered, though future versions will include interaction with other surface media. Our results suggest projected 2050 emissions will play a stronger role than 2050 climate in controlling PCB concentrations of different volatilities. Temperature increases under FC cause increases in emissions of only 4% at most, resulting in negligible concentration changes relative to the FE scenario, in which primary emissions are projected to decline to <0.05% of present-day. Thus, the concentrations in the combined FCFE scenario are dominated by changes from the FE scenario. Likewise, changes in re-emissions are more strongly impacted by the substantial decline in atmospheric concentrations under FE than they are by temperature changes under FC.",

The area is mainly composed of unconsolidated to semi-consolidated sand where breccia, mud, clay, etc. are associated as alternating layers. For the prediction of the optimal location of steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) technique, the conventional approach of cumulating the predicted thickness of the media with higher bitumen bearing possibility (i.e. Breccia and Sand) was pursued. As an alternative measure, mean vertical extension of the permeable media was also assessed based on vertical transition rate of each media and the corresponding optimal location was decided. For the both predictions, 110 borehole data acquired from the study area were analyzed under Markovian transition probability (TP) framework and three-dimensional distributions of the composing media were predicted stochastically through an existing TP based geostatistical model. The effectiveness of the two competing measures (cumulative thickness and mean vertical extension) for SAGD applications was verified through two–dimensional dual-phase flow simulations where high temperature steam was injected in the delineated reservoirs, and the size of steam chamber was compared. The results of the two-dimensional SAGD simulation has shown that the geologic formation containing the highest mean vertical extension of permeable media is more suitable for the development of the oil sand by developing larger size of steam chamber compared to that from the highest cumulative thickness. Given those two-dimensional results, the cumulative thickness alone may not be a sufficient criterion for an optimal SAGD site and the mean vertical extension of the permeable media needs to be jointly considered for the sound selections.",

Snowpack, soil moisture, streamflow, reservoir and groundwater levels are at record lows. Mandatory water restrictions are being implemented, statewide fines for wasting water have been authorized, and billions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs have been lost. Enhanced monitoring and modeling of the state’s dwindling water supplies can help manage what remains while looking forward to a post-drought, sustainable water future. Here we demonstrate the role of satellite observations in comprehensive drought characterization and monitoring. In particular we highlight changing water supply, declining groundwater and reservoir levels, agricultural and urban stress. Potential contributions to water management will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "In recent decades, nitrate loads to rivers and coasts have increased dramatically and contributed to eutrophication and hypoxia in coastal waters. A major sink for nitrate in the environment is denitrification in aquatic sediments. Here, I show that nitrate removal rates are as much as 100 times more efficient in heterogeneous than equivalent homogeneous aquatic sediments. Numerical experiments quantify nitrate removal from groundwater discharging through shallow columns of heterogeneous aquatic sediment. The steady groundwater flow equation was coupled to the advection-dispersion-reaction equations for dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Bimodal sediments composed of sand and clay were simulated using TPROGS for a wide range of clay fractions. Small (centimeter-scale) sedimentary structures were intended to represent infilled burrows or clay rip-up clasts. Clay structures were assigned a relatively high organic carbon content (2%). The local source of DOC fuels oxygen consumption in clay structures and promotes restricted zones of denitrification in otherwise aerobic sediments. As a result, redox transformations do not strictly depend on residence times but rather on distributions of organic carbon in aquatic sediments. Furthermore, bimodal sand and clay deposits are more efficient than either clean sand or homogeneous sandy-clay at removing nitrate. These results help explain observations of efficient nitrate removal in relatively sandy, oxygenated aquatic sediments when small organic-rich structures are present. The results also suggest that models of reactive transport in homogeneous sediment underestimate biogeochemical transformation rates relative to heterogeneous sediment. Similarly, laboratory-derived denitrification rates on homogenized cores are likely underestimated relative to intact cores.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude of natural hazard events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and floods are traditionally measured by wind speed, energy release, or discharge. In this study we investigate the scaling of the magnitude of individual events of the 20th and 21stcentury in terms of economic and life losses in the United States and worldwide. Economic losses are subdivided into insured and total losses. Some data sets are inflation or population adjusted. Forecasts associated with these events are of interest to insurance, reinsurance, and emergency management agencies.\nPlots of cumulative size-frequency distributions of economic and life loss are well-fit by power functions and thus exhibit self-similar scaling. This self-similar scaling property permits use of frequent small events to estimate the rate of occurrence of less frequent larger events. Examining the power scaling behavior of loss data for disasters permits: forecasting the probability of occurrence of a disaster over a wide range of years (1 to 10 to 1,000 years); comparing losses associated with one type of disaster to another; comparing disasters in one region to similar disasters in another region; and, measuring the effectiveness of planning and mitigation strategies.\nIn the United States, life losses due to flood and tornado cumulative-frequency distributions have steeper slopes, indicating that frequent smaller events contribute the majority of losses. In contrast, life losses due to hurricanes and earthquakes have shallower slopes, indicating that the few larger events contribute the majority of losses. Disaster planning and mitigation strategies should incorporate these differences.",

The Amazon-Cerrado Transitional Forest exhibits little seasonal variation in evapotranspiration (ET) due to its ability to extract water from deep soil profiles and water tables. Seasonal variability of ET over the transitional forest was monitored using an eddy covariance (EC) tower that acquired energy balance flux measurements from about 45 m above the ground surface near Sinop, Mato Grosso, Brazil. The remote sensing based surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model was applied to test its ability to provide estimates of ET that can be used to account for the spatial and temporal variability over such regions. SEBAL-based estimates of ET were compared with EC measurements during the 2006 season using multiple Landsat 5 TM images. Our results indicate that the SEBAL algorithm is capable to reproducing the seasonal variation in ET of the Amazon-Cerrado Transitional Forest and areas surrounding the EC tower.\nM.S.B. acknowledges a grant from CAPES (9750/13-4).

            "abstract": "Stable carbon isotope stratigraphy of the Late Cambrian mixed carbonate-siliciclastics from an epeiric platform allows a good stratigraphic marker and interpretation of paleoenvironmental conditions. The SPICE (Steptoean positive carbon excursion) and HERB (Hellnmaria-Red Tops Boundary) events are distinctly developed in the Furongian (Late Cambrian) of mixed carbonate-siliciclastics (Sesong and Hwajeol Formations) deposited on an epeiric platform of the Taebaeksan Basin, Korea, part of the North China Platform. The SPICE event occurs in the Prochuangia mansuyi zone and in the lower part of Chuangia zone of trilobite in the Sesong Formation with the δ13C values ranging from 1.1 to 1.8‰; it occurs in the stratigraphic interval mostly composed of nodular shale, massive to laminated fine sandstone with intercalation of limestone conglomerate beds which is interpreted to have been deposited in the inner to middle ramp. The HERB event begins at about the Eoconodontus notchpeakensis FAD of conodont and ends in the lower part of the range of E. notchpeakensis in the Hwajeol Formation. The HERB event shows negative δ13C values up to -5.5‰ forming a conspicuous and distinctive peak. The HERB event occurs in the stratigraphic interval mostly composed of nodular shale, limestone-shale couplet, and limestone conglomerate which is interpreted to have been deposited in the middle ramp. The onset of HERB event at the E. notchpeakensis FAD in the Taebaeksan basin, Korea suggests that the HERB event may be an excellent tool for intercontinental correlation defining the base of the terminal Cambrian (Stage 10). The paleoenvironmental conditions of the SPICE and HERB events seem to be contrary to each other; the SPICE event may be caused by the high rate of primary production and the high rate burial of organic matter with probable association of the high rate of input of terrigenous sediments. In contrast, the HERB event may be caused by the low rate of primary productivity, the reduced burial of organic matter, and the high rate of oxidation of organic matter.",

However, a lack of data on the quality of harvested rainwater hinders adoption of rainwater harvesting systems and makes development of rainwater harvesting regulations difficult. We conducted monthly surveys of 6 existing residential rainwater harvesting systems ranging in age from 1 to 11 years measuring pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, dissolved organic carbon, and coliform bacteria. We also examined a subset of the samples for iron, lead, mercury and arsenic. Many of the systems routinely met the water quality requirements for non-potable use without additional treatment, which is often required by regulations. In addition, while previous studies have shown that roof runoff contains heavy metals, the water in all systems showed very low or undetectable levels of metal contamination. Coliform bacteria concentration ranged from 20 to greater than 1400 CFU's per 100 mL and correlated with total suspended solids, which ranged from 2 - 7 mg l-1. The relationship between suspended solids and bacteria population was confirmed in a controlled experiment on the impact of filtering the rainwater before storage. Filtration decreased total suspended solids and total coliforms and increased dissolved oxygen concentration. This project provides insight into the effects of system design and a baseline assessment of the quality of harvested rainwater in existing systems.",

            "abstract": "In general, atmospheric motions are categorized into two: One is the quasi-geostrophic (QG) flows including planetary waves (PWs), and the other is gravity waves (GWs). The GWs are largely affected by the QG flows in their generation, propagation, and dissipation, but GWs can modify the QG flows such as the weak wind layer in the upper mesosphere by their ability of momentum transport. In the winter mesosphere, a necessary condition of barotropic and/or baroclinic instability for the QG flow, i.e., negative latitudinal gradient of potential vorticity (PV), is often satisfied. This study examines dynamical mechanism of the formation of such instability condition in boreal winter and discusses the significant role of the GW forcing. We used simulation data from a GW-resolving general circulation model (GCM). As this GCM does not include any GW parameterizations, all waves including GWs are resolved, which allows us to analyze the role of GWs in the momentum budget in the middle atmosphere explicitly.\nFirst, a two-dimensional (2-d) analysis using the transformed Eulerian-mean equations was made. It is seen that the negative PV gradient is regarded as an enhanced PV maximum. This maximum is due to the poleward shift of the westerly jet in association with strong EP-flux divergence caused by PWs from the troposphere. Strong GW drag slightly above the westerly jet shifts poleward as well, which can be understood by a selective GW-filtering mechanism. It seems that this GW-drag shift induces strong upwelling in the middle latitudes and adiabatically cools the middle mesosphere. Resultant enhanced static stability is the main cause of the PV maximum in the upper mesosphere. Because of the dominance of PWs during this event, this process may not be zonally uniform.\nThus, second, a 3-d analysis was made using a recently derived 3-d transformed Eulerian-mean theory. As expected, the GW drag is distributed depending on the longitude. The zonal structure of PV maximum is consistent with the GW drag distribution. An interesting fact is that the spatial distribution of GW drag is not largely correlated with that of the zonal wind at the same level but highly correlated with that in the stratosphere where PWs are dominant. This result indicates significant coupling between the stratosphere and mesosphere via the selective GW filtering.",

Asian space and agriculture related agencies launched an Asia-Rice Crop Estimation & Monitoring (Asia-RiCE) component for the GEOGLAM initiative. However, there are some difficulties to monitor rice crop by satellite imagery, which is different from other crops: 1) rice is mainly cultivated in rainy season and a large amount of cloud cover limits rice crop monitoring by the optical sensors; 2) adequate rainfall and temperature enable to cultivate rice two or three times a year in the tropics; 3) each field size is small compared to croplands in Western countries; and 4) water related agricultural disasters such as flood and drought are frequently occurred. To overcome these issues, C-band backscattering coefficient from RADARSAT-2 and reflectance data from MODIS were blended to estimate rice planted area over the West Java, Indonesia. By blending SAR and optical data, roughness and spectral information can be effectively used to differentiate paddy rice from other landcovers. The methodology using multi-wavelength data including optical (visible to thermal infrared) and SAR (X/C/L) would be a promising way for monitoring paddy rice in terms of the accuracy improvement and also the operational use to meet the requirement of observing the whole country with high-revisit frequency. In particular, the combining C-band SAR with other frequency SAR data such as L-band SAR onboard the ALOS-2 would be a challenge.",

            "abstract": "Although significant work has been done on LIPS and OIB, no complete record of the evolution of a mantle plume is available at this point. Galapagos-related lavas provide a complete record of the evolution of a mantle plume since the plume's initial stages in the Cretaceous. Our petrological models (PRIMELT2) suggest that the Galapagos plume head that formed the Caribbean Large Igneous Province (CLIP) at ~95 Ma melted at hotter temperatures than the ocean island basalt (OIB) equivalents of the modern archipelago. While this work suggests a significant decrease in mantle potential temperatures (Tp) over time, the exact mechanism responsible for secular cooling of the Galapagos plume remains unclear. One viable explanation is that plumes entraining recycled oceanic crust (pyroxenite) will be cooler than purely peridotite plumes, due to the effect of dense pyroxenite on the plume’s buoyancy. High-precision electron microprobe analyses on olivine cores from the ~70 Ma Galapagos-related Quepos terrane in Costa Rica indicate a mixed peridotite-pyroxenite source lithology, not evident during the LIP stage. The appearance of this pyroxenitic component correlates with the first record of an EMII isotopic signature (Northern Galapagos Domain), and significant high-field strength enrichments in the Galapagos plume related lavas. This dense pyroxenite component may explain the marked decrease in Tp observed at ~70 Ma due to its effect on the plume’s buoyancy. Otherwise, the pyroxenite component may have been diluted during voluminous basalt production of the CLIP by high peridotite melt fractions. Future research will incorporate further petrological modeling, olivine chemistry, and radiogenic isotope work of accreted Galapagos terranes in Central America to test whether or not a decrease in Tp correlates with increasing pyroxenite content in source melts.",

Through Giovanni TOVAS, users can conduct intercomparison of TMPA 3-hourly, daily and monthly products as well as other TRMM and climatology products in areas of interest without downloading data and software. In this presentation, samples of using the IPWG validation statistics will be presented. In addition, a new method will be presented to reveal the difference between two products at the grid point level over a selected time period, giving local information regarding how the two products perform at such level, compared to the regional approach on the IPWG web site. During the GPM era, the first implementation is to include the GPROF daily and monthly precipitation products in Giovanni TOVAS. For the time being, there are 9 GPROF products for the daily and monthly, respectively. Meanwhile, online services for comparing Level-2 data, such as TRMM TMI, PR and TCI will be prototyped because for multi-sensor products, such as TMPA or IMERG, the capability to compare Level-2 products is needed for further understanding of product differences. Examples of such activity will be presented as well.",

            "abstract": "The northern Gulf of California Rift System consist sofa series faults that accommodate both normal and strike-slip motion. The faults formed a series of half-greens ﬁlled with more than 7 km of siliciclastic suc­cessions. Here, we present tectonostratigraphic and heat flow models for the Tiburón basin, in the southern part of the system, and the Wag­ner basin in the north. The models are constrained by two-dimensional seis­mic lines and by two deep boreholes drilled by PEMEX­-PEP.\nAnalysis of the seismic lines and models’ results show that: (i) subsidence of the basins is controlled by high-angle normal faults and by ﬂow of the lower crust, (ii) basins share a common history, and (iii) there are signiﬁcant differences in the way brittle strain was partitioned in the basins, a feature frequently observed in rift basins. On one hand, the bounding faults of the Tiburón basin have a nested geometry and became active following a west-to-east sequence of activation. The Tiburon half-graben was formed by two pulses of fault activity. One took place during the protogulf extensional phase in the Miocene and the other during the opening of Gulf of California in the Pleistocene. On the other hand, the Wagner basin is the result of two fault generations. During the late-to middle Miocene, the west-dipping Cerro Prieto and San Felipe faults formed a domino array. Then, during the Pleistocene the Consag and Wagner faults dissected the hanging-wall of the Cerro Prieto fault forming the modern Wagner basin.\nThermal modeling of the deep borehole temperatures suggests that the heat flow in these basins in the order of 110 mW/m2 which is in agreement with superficial heat flow measurements in the northern Gulf of California Rift System.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric deposition of reactive nitrogen (N) species from large fires may contribute to enrichment of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems. Here we use an atmospheric chemistry transport model to investigate the supply of soluble organic nitrogen (ON) from open biomass burning to the ocean. The model results show that the annual deposition rate of soluble ON to the oceans is increased globally by 13% with the increase being particularly notable over the coastal water downwind from the source regions. The estimated deposition of soluble ON due to haze events from the secondary formation is more than half of that from the primary sources. We examine the secondary formation of particulate C-N compounds (e.g., imidazole) from the reactions of glyoxal and methylglyoxal with atmospheric ammonium in wet aerosols and upon cloud evaporation. These ON sources result in a significant contribution to the open ocean, suggesting that atmospheric processing in aqueous phase may have a large effect. We compare the soluble ON concentration in aerosols with and without open biomass burning as a case study in Singapore. The model results demonstrate that the soluble ON concentration in aerosols is episodically enriched during the fire events, compared to the without smoke simulations. However, the model results show that the daily soluble ON concentration can be also enhanced in the without smoke simulations during the same period, compared to the monthly averages. This indicates that care should be taken when using in-situ observations to constrain the soluble ON source strength from biomass burning. More accurate quantification of the soluble ON burdens with no smoke sources is therefore needed to assess the effect of biomass burning on bioavailable ON input to the oceans.",

            "abstract": "As the only major undammed river on the west slope of California’s Sierra Nevada, with over 100 years of USGS streamflow data, and the location of several floodplain conservation and restoration efforts, the Cosumnes River offers a unique opportunity to study connections between a river’s flow regime and floodplain functions. Flow regime, including frequency and magnitude of floods, and its interaction with the surrounding landscape are primary drivers of floodplain structure and ecosystem dynamics. However, these floodplain processes and functions are often altered by water management schemes, land uses, and hydroclimatic alteration induced by climate warming. Improved understanding of ecologically relevant aspects of flow regime and potential future alteration is central to managing floodplain ecosystems and their services. In order to describe the inundation regime of the lower Cosumnes River floodplain, California, this research moves beyond flood frequency analysis to examine other flood event characteristics and identify flood types using statistical cluster analysis. Floods are characterized using metrics of ecological relevance, such as magnitude, timing, duration, and total volume. To explore potential effects of climate change, non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value models are fit to historical floods based on temperature and precipitation at the monthly scale. Temperature and precipitation variables from downscaled Global Climate Models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase-5 are then applied to develop flood distributions for climate change scenarios. These results are used to adjust the magnitude of clustered flood events identified in the historical record, and the sensitivity of the inundation regime to these changes is assessed. This research provides useful scientific insights for management and restoration efforts within the Cosumnes watershed and demonstrates the utility of applying these methods to other floodplain systems.

            "abstract": "It has long been known that the microwave response is sensitive to near-surface (~5 m) liquid meltwater within ice sheets. Since the beginning of the satellite-era, active and passive microwave instruments have frequently been used to detect what have been assumed to be melt processes from space. Microwave melt models are typically threshold-based binary detections – liquid meltwater is either present or it is not. The recent discovery of substantial quantities (~140±20 Gt) of liquid meltwater stored within Greenland’s extensive firn aquifer highlights evolving knowledge of melt and retention processes within the upper layers (< ~35 m) of the percolation facies of the Greenland ice sheet, as well as limitations in current microwave melt models. Firn aquifers form as the result of high melt rates that saturate snow and firn layers with liquid meltwater during the melt season, and high snow accumulation rates that thermally insulates this saturated layer during the winter season - allowing it to be stored in liquid form at decreasing depths as refreeze propagates from the ice sheet surface downward. While subsurface liquid meltwater is known to influence the microwave response, current microwave melt models do not distinguish between the introduction of liquid meltwater controlled by melt processes and the continued presence of liquid meltwater controlled by the retention process. This research exploits the multidecadal (1992-2014) satellite-borne active (ERS, ASCAT) and passive (AMSR-E) microwave climate record to provide the first long-term, spatiotemporally continuous, observational evidence of winter season meltwater storage within Greenland’s firn aquifer. We use multi-frequency backscatter and brightness temperature image time series reconstructed at enhanced resolution (~12 km), and a microwave signature algorithm derived from a coupled two-layer radiative transfer model, to characterize both melt and retention processes using simple, time-dependent, parameters that are calibrated using thousands of airborne (IceBridge O1B accumulation radar) observations. Comparisons are made between calibrated microwave aquifer model results and aquifer simulations generated by the regional climate model RACMO2.",

            "abstract": "Can enzymology and thermodynamics shed light on the response of the biosphere to a changing climate? We have recently developed a theory describing the temperature dependence of biological rates. We have called this MacroMolecular Rate Theory (MMRT) to reflect some fundamental thermodynamic properties peculiar to biological macromolecules. This theory scales well from enzymes to ecosystems and explains the curved temperature dependence of ecosystem processes such as respiration, as described by Lloyd and Taylor 20 years ago. MMRT also accounts for temperature optima which are a feature of all biological processes including respiration, photosynthsis and net ecosystem exchange. MMRT begins with enzymes. Enzymes drive metabolism and enable life by catalysing a myraid of chemical reactions with phenomenal rate enhancements. According to the classical thermodynamics description, enzymes achieve catalysis by binding to the transition state for the reaction and thus, lowering the reaction barrier. The dissociation constant, Kd, for the enzyme-transition state complex, commensurate with the observed rate enhancements, is extreme (Kd ~ 10-22 M). Such tight binding of the transition state influences the thermodynamic parameter, Cp, the heat capacity of the molecule. The difference in heat capacity, ∆C‡P, between the enzyme-substrate complex (Kd ~ 10-5 M) and the enzyme-transition state complex (Kd ~ 10-22 M) has important implications for the temperature dependence of enzyme catalyzed rates. ∆C‡P is close to zero for reactions that involve small molecules, but is generally large and negative for reactions that involve macromolecules such as enzymes. The result is a curved temperature dependence of enzyme catalyzed rates and a temperature optimum above which, the rate decreases. This ∆C‡P signature is pervasive and scales from enzymes, to microbial growth rates, to microbial metabolism and ecosystem fluxes. It also has important implications for the temperature sensitivity of all biologically driven processes and the response of the biosphere to climate change.",

            "abstract": "The finding of ultra-high pressure minerals in continental orogens like the Western Alps implies that continental crust can subduct to depths as great as 100 km and then be exhumed to the Earth’s surface. The onset mechanism of continental subduction, including how the continental plate overwhelms the buoyancy resistance and how it is exhumed, however remains elusive. Using data of a new temporary seismic array deployed in the French-Italian Alps, we present here new evidence that in the Western Alps the European plate subducted deeply beneath the Adria plate. This study uses teleseismic P receiver functions and shear-wave splitting measurements from SKS phases.\n In the depth-migrated receiver function cross-section, the positive P to S (Ps) conversions (corresponding to velocity increase with depth) on the Moho interface can be continuously traced beneath the European plate. This Moho conversion fluctuates in depth, amplitude and dipping angle. Beneath the external zone, the Moho shows up strongly at depths of 25-40 km, exhibiting an eastward dip angle < 5°. Starting from beneath the outcrop of the Frontal Penninic Thrust (FPT) eastward, the dip of the European Moho strongly increases and Moho conversions can be traced to 70-80 km depth beneath the Adria plate.\nShear wave splitting measurements demonstrate that fast polarization directions of seismic anisotropy are parallel to the strike of the orogen, which is consistent with previous studies. The most prominent new result is that the delay time increases rapidly from the external zone to the internal zone and then decreases rapidly from the FPT to the westernmost Po Plain. This rapid change of delay time suggests that the mantle lithosphere, partly serpentinized, has a major contribution to the observed SKS splitting. The largest delay times in the vicinity to the west of the Frontal Penninic Thrust may suggest localized strong shear in the lithospheric mantle beneath the boundary zone between the European and Adria plates.\nIn summary, our receiver function cross-section is the first direct evidence of subduction of the European lower crust in the Adria mantle beneath the Western Alps; SKS splitting data demonstrate that the left-lateral shear due to the post-Miocene counterclockwise rotation of the internal zone may also be detected in the lithospheric mantle.",

            "abstract": "It has been suggested that state-of-the-art climate models, both with interactive chemistry and without interactive chemistry (CCMVal-2 and CMIP5) do not reproduce the observed lower stratosphere temperature anomalies that are observed by satellite microwave sounding instruments. We find that making two changes in the analysis can eliminate this disagreement. One is a change in the definition of the temperature anomalies as being zero for the 4-year mean (1979-1982) at the beginning of the data and modeling analysis period. Such a definition of the zero temperature anomaly does not take into proper account that observations over a relatively short period represent a single realization of several possible climate states, and thus this zero anomaly definition can be misleading when comparing anomalies from observations and models. The other change is our taking into account all CMIP-5 and CCMVal-2 model runs that ran realistic scenarios for the period 1979-2005. With these two changes in the analysis, we conclude that temperature changes from both CMIP-5 and CCMVal-2 models agree well with MSU-4 observations over the period 1979-2005.",

            "abstract": "An apparent increase in the occurrence rate of large, spontaneous rock avalanches in New Zealand’s Southern Alps has been suggested by Allen et al. 2011 and Allen and Huggel, 2013. They suggest a link to alpine permafrost decay due to anthropogenic global warming, similar to the increased occurrence rate in the European Alps which they attribute to this cause. The rock avalanche inventory is now more complete for the interval since 1976 because we have updated and added to the inventory. The threshold event volume of the inventory is ill-defined, but is probably of the order of 100,000 cubic metres; many events exceed 1,000,000 cubic metres. It is not credible that the earlier observers missed 75 % of the region's occurrences which would be needed if the true rate had been uniform over the last 50 years. The rate has been about 20 events per decade for the last 10 years, whereas for the period 1976-1999, it was 4 per decade.\nAlthough the altitude range associated with most events is around the expected lower limit for present-day permafrost (Allen et al. 2011), it also is coincident with the altitudes of the region’s topographically protruding slopes which favour stress concentration and failure. In addition, the earliest documented spontaneous rock avalanche in the Southern Alps occurred in 1873 and fell from a similar altitude on the same face of the same mountain as the most recent event in 2014.\nCox et al. (In Press) shows that valley-bottom hot springs in the Southern Alps respond to distant strong earthquakes in a manner suggesting weak local ground deformation and increased bedrock permeability. Here we suggest that the surrounding slopes may respond to the same stimuli. As also observed elsewhere, the passage of seismic waves through a closely jointed rock mass under high static shear stress may lead to incremental permanent deformation and may accelerate stress corrosion. We suggest that the observed occurrence-rate increase may be associated with a seismic-moment-release increase in New Zealand, which is approximately coincident with a global increase in seismic moment release. It may also be associated with the accumulating slope deformations since about 1717 AD, when a great earthquake triggered much slope collapse in the region.",

            "abstract": "Evidence from both observations and model results suggests a link between changes in the Arctic sea ice conditions and atmospheric circulation in the NH mid latitudes with its possible impacts on severe winters and extreme weather events. This study investigates underlying mechanisms for this Arctic-midlatitudes climate connection based on numerical experiments using a high-top AGCM. We compare and evaluate results from two sets of perpetual simulations (60yrs run each), one with an annual cycle of sea ice conditions from the period of 1979-1983 and the other from the 2005-2009 period while other variables and parameters including SST and GHGs are fixed.\nResults from the numerical experiments show that the Arctic sea ice reduction leads to cold winters in the mid-latitude land areas centered in Siberia, Europe and the North America. The winter (DJF) mean temperature at 850 hPa averaged over the mid-latitude continents decreases by about 0.4 K associated due solely to sea ice reduction.\nThe analysis based on a wave-activity flux indicates that this cooling is due to low-level cold advection. In early winter negative geopotential height anomalies over Siberia and the North America develop as a stationary Rossby wave response to anomalous turbulent surface heat fluxes associated with the sea-ice reduction in the Barents and Kala Seas. As winter progresses further wave propagation acts to intensify positive geopotential height anomalies over the high Arctic, which eventually leads to cold advections in the lower troposphere. In addition, we identify a pathway via the stratosphere which appears to aid this intensification of positive geopotential height anomalies.\nObservations in general support a similar relationship. For example, on interannual timescale there is a significant positive relationship between the September NH SIE time series and surface temperatures in continental regions.\nOur results have significant implications that sea ice can be used as a basis for mid-range prediction and that underlying mechanisms can be in part understood within the framework of the Rossby wave propagation and wave-mean interaction theory.

            "abstract": "Long-wavelength artifacts in InSAR data are the main limitation to measure long-wavelength displacement; they are traditionally attributed mainly to the inaccuracy of the satellite orbits (orbital errors). However, most satellites are precisely tracked resulting in uncertainties of orbits of 2-10 cm. Orbits of these satellites are thus precise enough to obtain precise velocity fields with uncertainties better than 1 mm/yr/100 km for older satellites (e.g. Envisat) and better than 0.2 mm/yr/100 km for modern satellites (e.g. TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1) [Fattahi & Amelung, 2014]. Such accurate velocity fields are achievable if long-wavelength artifacts from sources other than orbital errors are identified and corrected for. We present a modified Small Baseline approach to measure long-wavelength deformation and evaluate the uncertainty of these measurements.\nWe use a redundant network of interferograms for detection and correction of unwrapping errors to ensure the unbiased estimation of phase history. We distinguish between different sources of long-wavelength artifacts and correct those introduced by atmospheric delay, topographic residuals, timing errors, processing approximations and hardware issues. We evaluate the uncertainty of the velocity fields using a covariance matrix with the contributions from orbital errors and residual atmospheric delay. For contributions from the orbital errors we consider the standard deviation of velocity gradients in range and azimuth directions as a function of orbital uncertainty. For contributions from the residual atmospheric delay we use several approaches including the structure functions of InSAR time-series epochs, the predicted delay from numerical weather models and estimated wet delay from optical imagery.\nWe validate this InSAR approach for measuring long-wavelength deformation by comparing InSAR velocity fields over ~500 km long swath across the southern San Andreas fault system with independent GPS velocities and examine the estimated uncertainties in several non-deforming areas. We show the efficiency of the approach to study the continental deformation across the Chaman fault system at the western Indian plate boundary.

Core A is immediately west of the Kuroshio feeder current and is off the slope while Core B is from a bathymetric high located almost west of Core A. XRF-, CHN- and LOI-derived geochemical proxies are utilized for reconstruction. A decrease in sediment input from ~12.9 to ~11.6 kyr BP corresponding to the YD event is indicated by the proxies, Ti, Al, and Al/Ti, in both cores. This is consistent with the drier climate during this period. Primary productivity indicators in the cores show opposing trends during the YD; Core A shows an increasing trend while Core B shows a decreasing trend. The decreasing trend in Core B can be due to a decrease in terrestrial nutrient input due to a decrease in precipitation. On the other hand, the increasing trend in Core A can be due to a swifter Kuroshio Current caused by a swifter and more southerly NEC bifurcation which in turn is due to a southerly shift of the ITCZ during YD. A swifter Kuroshio would have enhanced upwelling induced by steeper sea surface across the current and by more intense cyclonic gyres due to flow separation where the shelf width suddenly decreases north of the Bicol Shelf.",

            "abstract": "The seismic velocity structure beneath Texas Gulf Coastal Plain (GCP) is imaged by fitting of surface wave dispersion and velocity analysis of Ps receiver functions. The GCP is a portion of an ocean-continental transition zone, or \"passive margin\", which have only been subject to a few seismic investigations that are capable of revealing 2-D structure. Seismic data from a linear array of 22 broadband stations, spaced 16-20 km apart along a ~330-km-long profile across the Texas-Gulf of Mexico passive margin, were employed to construct a coherent image of the crust and uppermost mantle. A Common Conversion Point (CCP) stacking technique is applied to teleseismic earthquake data to improve the signal-to-noise ratios of receiver functions and to map Ps phases to their conversion points to produce a 2-D image.\nUsing an incorrect velocity model for time-to-depth migration of a stacked CCP image may produce an inaccurate image of the subsurface, especially in the presence of substantial lateral velocity variations. To find accurate P- and S-velocity models, we first apply a nonlinear modeling technique to fit Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves via Very Fast Simulated Annealing (VFSA), a global optimization method. We use ambient noise cross-correlation to compute Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves. Based on our results, the Moho disappears in the vicinity of the Balcones Fault System and outboard, which suggests that the Balcones is a through-going fault system. The RF CCP results suggest that tectonic events in the study area have created pathways for fluids to penetrate to the uppermost mantle, which reduces the impedance contrast across the Moho by serpentinization of the mantle.",

            "abstract": "We compare crustal stress and strain rates on the Island of Kyushu as measured from inversions of focal mechanisms, GPS and shear wave splitting on shallow and deep earthquakes to determine how well anisotropy can be used to predict stress or strain. Shear wave splitting of local and regional earthquakes was measured on the NIED network between 2004 and 2012, and on Aso, Sakurajima, Kirishima and Unzen volcano networks. Strain measurements were made from the Geonet stations. JMA-determined S arrival times processed with the MFAST shear wave splitting code measure fast polarisations (phi), related to the orientation of the anisotropic medium and time delays (dt), related to the path length and the percent anisotropy. We apply the TESSA 2-D delay time tomography and spatial averaging code to the highest quality events with the most nearly vertical incidence angles, separating the 3455 shallow (depth < 40 km) from the 4957 deep (>=40 km) earthquakes. Using 30 km grids for all the inversions and interpolating where measurements are not available, the average difference between maximum horizontal stress axes (Shmax) and phi is nearly identical to that between maximum compressional strain rate (Mstrain) and Shmax (35 degrees). Shmax and mstrain are each also significantly correlated with Shmax, but less so with each other. Amplitudes of splitting delay time/km, strain eigenvalues and stress ratio R follow similar patterns. All three orientations are E-W in central Kyushu, where the compressional strain is highest. Both splitting and stress suggest plate-boundary-parallel maximum principal stress just off the coast of Kyushu, where strain measurements are sparse. Southwestern Kyushu has the largest difference between strain and stress. Phi from shallow and deep earthquakes is not well correlated, suggesting that the deep earthquake waveforms are not simply re-split in the crust. Causes for the anisotropy may be olivine crystals aligned by drag of the subducting Phillipine Sea plate in the mantle and stress-aligned microcracks in the crust. We have begun inverting for 3-D anisotropic structure to determine the relation of the mantle anisotropy to plate flow.",

            "abstract": "Very large solar cycle (SC) variations are observed in the zonal winds and temperatures of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The effect is too large to be produced by the small SC variations of the solar flux in the lower stratosphere. Dynamical downward coupling must be involved, and we present a review of the mechanism that emerged from studies with the Numerical Spectral Model (NSM). In the NSM, the QBO is generated with parameterized gravity waves and planetary waves. For a SC period of 10 years, the applied heat source varies exponentially with altitude: 0.2% (surface), 2% (50 km), 20% (100 km and above). With that solar forcing, the model reproduces qualitatively the SC modulations of the QBO zonal winds around the equator and temperature variations extending to high latitudes. The QBO is spawned in the lower mesosphere by a hemispherically symmetric equatorial annual oscillation (EAO) of the zonal wind velocities. Though small in magnitude, the SC modulation of the EAO is large. Like the symmetric QBO, the EAO extends into the lower atmosphere under the influence of, and amplified by, wave mean flow interactions. The amplitude modulations of the QBO and EAO are in phase with the imposed SC heat source. Essentially, the EAO provides the pathway and pacemaker for the SC modulation of the QBO – and wave interactions amplify the oscillations as they propagate down into the lower atmosphere. Analysis of NCEP temperature and zonal wind data (1958 to 2006) produces the hemispherically symmetric equatorial annual oscillation (EAO), and it contains spectral signatures with periods around 11 years. Moving windows of 44 years show that below 20 km the 11-year modulation of the EAO is phase locked to the SC. The spectral features from the 48-year data record reveal modulation signatures of 9.6 and 12 years, which produce EAO variations that mimic in limited altitude regimes the varying maxima and minima of the 10.7 cm solar index. In the lower stratosphere, the 40-year record of NCEP data also shows that the zonal winds reveal a pronounced 5-year modulation of the symmetric EAO confined to equatorial latitudes. And this modulation is observed in temperature variations that extend to high latitudes. The NSM produces a 5-year oscillation through nonlinear interaction between the 30-month QBO and annual oscillation.",

            "abstract": "Statistical downscaling methods are widely used to reconcile the spatial and temporal difference between climate model outputs and input requirements of climate change impact assessments. Quantile-mapping, due to its simplicity and general good performance, is one of the most popular. However, its simplicity also leads to variations in the procedure among studies, and it is not always well cross-validated. There is also less attention paid to sub-daily precipitation downscaling which is important for urban hydrologic purposes. The study explores the potential of quantile-mapping by comparing four of its variations, and extends its application by linking it to an hourly k nearest-neighbor resampling disaggregation. The methods are trained with NCEP/NCAR 40-year reanalysis. Seven-fold cross-validation on various mean, variability, and extreme precipitation statistics is performed with hourly observations at rain gauges along the eastern coast of the United States. The best performance on mean monthly precipitation and annual maximum 5-day precipitation is found when quantile-mapping is trained without regard to seasonality. However, the best performance on all other statistics is contingent upon the method being trained separately for each month and combined with a monthly bias-correction factor. Deficiencies in quantile-mapping carry over to the hourly disaggregation step. When the downscaled daily precipitation is satisfactory, the hourly disaggregation performs very well on all statistics after careful selection of its two parameters. These results demonstrate the importance to consider seasonality in the implementation of quantile-mapping and highlight some clear, though limited, deficiencies. That it is feasible to generate realistic hourly precipitation series with easy-to-implement empirical methods is also of interest to water managers.",

CarbonTracker, an inverse modeling system based on ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), estimates the surface CO2 flux using the atmospheric CO2 concentrations as a constraint. While application of CarbonTracker for Asian region needs the optimization of EnKF parameters (e.g., ensemble size, assimilation window length, etc), appropriate parameters for Asian region have never been investigated. Therefore, in this study, several experiments using different parameters were conducted to find the optimal parameters of EnKF in CarbonTracker for Asian region. The assimilation window lengths tested are 3, 5, and 10 weeks, and the ensemble sizes tested are 100, 150, and 300. The experimental period is from 2006 to 2008.\nIn 2007, the optimized CO2 flux uptake was greater than the prior CO2 flux uptake. For each experiment, the spatial distributions of the optimized surface CO2 flux varied seasonally. Differences between the optimized surface CO2 fluxes of the experiments were the largest in Eurasia Boreal (EB), followed by Eurasia Temperate (ET) and Tropical Asia (TA), which is especially notable in summer. The optimized surface CO2 flux in EB was more sensitive to the window length than the ensemble size, whereas the optimized surface CO2 flux in ET was more sensitive to the ensemble size than the window length. In TA with few observation sites, differences between the optimized surface CO2 fluxes of the experiments were small, which implies that determining optimal parameters in TA may be inappropriate given the current situation with few observation sites. The root mean square error (RMSE) and bias of the model CO2 concentrations calculated by the optimized surface CO2 flux in Asia were more sensitive to the ensemble size than the window length. More comprehensive results will be presented in the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves play an important role in the overall dynamics of the Earth’s magnetosphere, including the energization and loss of particles. We perform a statistical study of EMIC waves detected by the Van Allen Probes mission to investigate their occurrence, spatial distribution, and properties (e.g., wave power, normal angle, and ellipticity). Magnetic field measurements from the Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science (EMFISIS) onboard Van Allen Probes are used to identify EMIC wave events from the beginning of the mission (September, 2012) to the present. EMIC waves are examined in hydrogen, helium and oxygen bands. So far, about 280 EMIC wave events have been identified over the three different bands. Preliminary results show that hydrogen-band EMIC waves have been primarily observed in the dusk sector, while helium-band EMIC waves have been observed in all Magnetic Local Times (MLTs). Particularly, the Van Allen Probes provide a better resolution of lower frequencies (0.2-0.9 Hz), within which oxygen-band EMIC waves can occur in the inner magnetosphere. This allows us to obtain better insight into the characteristics of this previously largely unavailable band of EMIC waves, and allows for comparisons amongst EMIC waves in different bands.",

            "abstract": "High-energy superhalo electrons are present in the interplanetary medium even in absence of any solar activity, carrying important information on the electron acceleration in the solar wind. We present a statistical survey of ~20–300 keV superhalo electrons measured at 1 AU by the WIND 3DP instrument during quiet-time periods from 1995 January through 2013 December. The velocity distribution function of the observed quiet-time superhalo electrons generally fits to a power-law spectrum, f ~ v-γ, with γ ranging from ~4 to ~10. The integrated density of these superhalo electrons at 20–300 keV, nsup, ranges from 10−9 cm−3 to 10−5 cm−3. Both log(nsup) and γ show a good correlation with the sunspot number, with larger density and softer spectrum (γ~ 6-8) at solar maximum, and smaller density and harder spectrum (γ~ 4-5) at solar minimum. The observed power-law spectrum also has no clear association with flares, CMEs, active regions and solar wind core populations, while it shows a weak (~0.3) correlation with in situ solar wind turbulence spectrum. These results suggest that the seed particles of quiet-time superhalo electrons could originate from the Sun, and their acceleration could mainly occur in the interplanetary medium, probably by the electron interaction with solar wind turbulence, or by acceleration at the CIRs.",

            "abstract": "The product-to-parent reversion of metabolites of trenbolone acetate (TBA), a steroidal growth promoter used widely in beef cattle production, was recently observed to occur in environmental waters. The rapid forward reaction is by direct photolysis (i.e., photohydration), with the much slower reversion reaction occurring via dehydration in the dark. The objective of this study is to quantify the potential effect of this newly discovered reversible process on TBA metabolite concentrations and total bioactivity exposure in fluvial systems. Here, we demonstrate increased persistence of TBA metabolites in the stream and hyporheic zone due to the reversion process, increasing chronic and acute exposure to these endocrine-active compounds along a stream. The perpetually dark hyporheic zone is a key location for reversion in the system, ultimately providing a source of the parent compound to the stream and increasing mean in-stream concentration of 17α-trenbolone (17α-TBOH) by 40% of the input concentration under representative fluvial conditions. As such, regulatory frameworks for compounds undergoing product-to-parent reversion will require new approaches for assessing total exposure to bioactive compounds. Further, we demonstrate generalized cases for prediction of exposure for species with product-to-parent reversion in stream-hyporheic systems.",

The immense difficulties in resolving complex processes and their spatio-temporal variations, combined with a lack of observations means the accuracy of our predictions is often unknown. An immense amount of research is undertaken to quantify uncertainty in hydrologic predictions. With all this effort, there seems to be little appreciation of how this uncertainty quantification will be utilised in practice. Planners and decision makers who rely on modelling output from hydrologists and engineers are traditionally interested in a single point estimate – for instance, a single 1% Annual Exceedance Probability flow value. How can water scientists encourage practitioners to move beyond a “point estimate” mentality to appreciate the potentially wide range of uncertainty in our estimates? How can this uncertainty be translated into an appropriate risk based decision making framework? In this talk I investigate some of the problems with adopting a single answer for decision making and discuss some ways to promote a greater appreciation of uncertainty in practice.",

            "abstract": "Mysteries abound regarding the mechanism generating deep-long-period earthquakes (DLPs). DLPs are most commonly associated with the process of magma ascent from a deep source to a crustal reservoir, and plausible ideas include dehydration embrittlement, sluggish faulting, gurgling flow of magmatic fluids, and cooling of relic magma conduits.\nBy good fortune, at least four DLPs occurred since the imaging Magma Under St Helens (iMUSH) experiment began in late June 2014. The DLPs were captured by 70 broadband seismometers in the passive array, and several were also recorded by the 3500 short-period seismometers deployed for the active experiment.\nThese lower crust/upper mantle events were 20-35 km deep, offset less than 15 km from the crater, and have the low-frequency, long-duration reverberative waveforms, and lower crust/upper mantle locations characteristic of DLPs. One DLP had numerous bursts across ~100s, and two others consisted of two bursts within a minute. These are similar to the 19 DLPs seen beneath Mount St. Helens (MSH) previously [Nichols et al., 2011, JVGR]. We will also use these DLPs as templates in the search for others that are too small to be found otherwise.\nDLPs at MSH occur beneath the St. Helens Seismic Zone, proposed to be the block boundary between the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor and Siletzia rocks to the west. This actively-slipping and weak structural boundary could enhance the ability of magmatic fluids to reach the surface, and the co-located DLPs provide evidence for such fluid migration.\nWe plan to investigate the frequency content, time evolution, spatial location, and clustering of DLPs under Mount St. Helens to shed light on the underlying physics and implications for shallower activity.",

            "abstract": "The seismic anisotropy in Earth’s upper mantle is explained by the crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of rock-forming minerals, which have anisotropic elasticity. Our team showed that the CPO of forsterite is produced even during diffusion creep (Miyazaki et al. 2013). The purpose of this study is to understand the mechanism of the development of CPO of forsterite by observations of samples surface after the sample deformation where the fine-scale strain markers were imposed.We deformed cylindrical polycrystalline samples of synthesized forsterite plus 20 vol. % diopside at its diffusion creep regime. We polished the lateral side of the sample where we imposed grooves parallel to the compression axis of the sample using a focused ion beam. These marker lines allow us to observe grain rotation due to a plastic deformation of the sample. After the high temperature compression creep experiment under atmosphere, we observed the marker lines under scanning electron microscope.We succeeded to observe the marker lines after the deformation. Strain of bulk sample and of the marker line exhibit the similar value indicating the similar deformation proceeded both at bulk and surface regions of the samples. Grain rotation, which is identified by misfits of the markers at grain boundaries and rotation of intra-granular markers, were observed in all the samples. No distortion of the markers within the grains was found indicating the absence of intragranular deformation process such as a glide of dislocations; however, in the samples deformed at high stress (~300 MPa), curved intra-granular markers were observed, which is consistent with dislocation activity at high stress condition. Our results show the significant grain rotation, which is necessary process for the development of CPO, during diffusion creep as well as the ability of identification of the deformation mechanism of the bulk sample by the observation of the sample surface.",

            "abstract": "The northern Gulf of Mexico, including the subaqueous Mississippi River delta front (MRDF), has been productive for oil and gas development since the early 1900s. In 1969 cyclic seafloor wave loading associated with the passage of Hurricane Camille triggered subaqueous mudflows across the MRDF, destroying several offshore oil platforms. This incident spurred geophysical and geotechnical studies of the MRDF, which found that the delta front is prone to mass failures on gentle gradients (<0.5°) due to (1) high rates of fine-grained sedimentation and associated underconsolidation, (2) excess sediment pore pressure attributed to in-situ biogenic gas production, and (3) the frequent passage of tropical cyclones. In June 2014, a geophysical pilot study was conducted 8 km southwest of Southwest Pass, the distributary that currently receives the largest fraction of Mississippi River sediment supply. The resultant dataset encompasses 216 km of subbottom Chirp seismic profiles and a 60 km2 grid of bathymetry and sidescan data. Preliminary interpretation of these data shows the survey area can be classified into four primary sedimentary facies: mudflow gullies, mudflow lobes, undisturbed prodelta, and undisturbed delta front. Subbottom profiles reveal extensive biogenic gas from 20 to about 80 m water depths on the delta front; sidescan data show a variety of bottleneck slides, mudflow gullies and mudflow noses. Previous studies have attempted to constrain the periodicity and magnitude of subaqueous mudslides on the MRDF. However, large age gaps and varied resolution between datasets result in ambiguity regarding the cause and magnitude of observed bathymetric changes. We present high-temporal resolution MRDF bathymetric variations from 2005 (post Hurricane Katrina), 2009 (relatively quiescent storm period), and 2014 (post 2011 Mississippi River flood). These data yield better magnitude and timing estimates of mass movements. This exercise represents a first step towards (1) assembling a comprehensive geologic dataset upon which future MRDF geohazard assessments can be founded, and (2) understanding the dynamics of a massive passive margin deltaic lobe entering a phase of decline.",

            "abstract": "We carried out large-scale biaxial friction experiments (Fukuyama et al., 2012; 2014) using a pair of meter-sized Indian gabbro as specimens, whose contacting area was 1.5 × 0.1 m2, normal stress was up to 6.7 MPa and loading velocity was up to 3 × 10-2 m/s. After each experiment, we found localized damages (i.e. grooves) were generated on the fault surface and gouges were distributed around them. We confirmed work rate dependency of rock friction as revealed by centimeter-sized rock samples (Di Toro et al., 2011), but further found that the meter-sized rock friction starts to decrease at one order of magnitude smaller work rate than that of the centimeter sized rock (Yamashita et al., 2013, AGU fall meeting). Here, we concluded that this difference is caused by stress localization and associated increase in heterogeneity on the fault as shown by: 1) Total amount of deviations of each local shear stress from the average, which were monitored by strain gauge array, increased with the decrease in friction. 2) Friction coefficients were negatively correlated with degree of spatial heterogeneity evaluated from the distribution of grooves and gouges. 3) Melt textures were found in the collected gouges by microscopic observation using HRSEM. Based on these observations, we propose a stress localization model; the fault surfaces are composed of patched and non-patched areas with high and low normal stress, respectively. The high normal stress patch leads to high shear stress, high mechanical work and thus production of much wear material (gouge), which further causes additional increase in normal stress. Assuming that the local friction follows the results by centimeter-sized gabbro experiments, we numerically simulated a slip-dependent friction for both patched and non-patched areas, and successively reproduced a weakening in macroscopic friction. We confirmed that the work rate dependency of simulated friction was consistent with that of biaxial experiments (Fig. 1). This result suggests this scale dependency should be taken into consideration since such heterogeneity should be common in nature.",

During the boreal winter monsoon, mean precipitation over much of the Maritime Continent is strongly correlated with ENSO phase. Over these regions, the prospect of accurate seasonal precipitation forecast is optimistic. Unfortunately, the ENSO signal in precipitation is known to be much weaker over the western Maritime Continent, which covers the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, and west Java. We investigate the ENSO teleconnection with mean precipitation using simple statistics on merged observation-remote sensing and model hindcast products. These diagnostics suggest an additional reason for why the winter monsoon mean precipitation over the western Maritime Continent is poorly correlated with the ENSO phase, and why some forecast models may not reflect this observed situation. We make recommendations for some process-based forecast products that are desirable for the Western Maritime Continent.",

            "abstract": "Low-frequency earthquake templates obtained for southern Vancouver Island reveal waveforms consistent with moment-tensor point sources and shallow thrusting in the direction of plate motion (Royer and Bostock 2013). For near-vertical source-receiver geometries, pre-critical S-wave arrivals are dominantly excited on horizontal component seismograms and likely to exhibit waveform similarity. As previously proposed by Rubin et al. (2013) and Armbruster et al. (2014), such similarity across stations can be exploited in cross-station detection approaches. In order to identify raw LFE waveforms that can be used to construct high SNR templates, we developed a multi-channel cross-correlation-based cross-station algorithm that we have applied to 4 composite arrays in northern Cascadia, employing data from EarthScope (Transportable and Flexible Arrays, Plate Boundary Observatory), POLARIS and permanent network (Canadian National Seismograph Network, Pacific Northwest Seismic Network ) sources. We obtained thousands of epicenters with horizontal errors under 3 km per ETS episode that reveal high spatio-temporal clustering, suggesting repeated failing at localized asperities on the plate interface. These detections allow for spatial targeting of initial templates that may be incorporated within network correlation approaches to extend LFE template catalogues. In addition, we examine the scales of clustering and the migration velocities and directions, some of which are consistent with the rapid tremor reversals (RTR) (Houston et al. 2011). During inter-ETS periods, our epicenters are clustered near the 40 km depth contour of plate interface models, downdip of asperities that dominate activity during ETS. We identify P-wave arrivals for a few hundreds of detections and obtain hypocenters concentrated along a surface consistent with the plate interface. The method performs best for the high SNR records of southern Vancouver Island, but we also present results for Washington state and northern Vancouver Island, where similar clustering behaviour is observed.",

            "abstract": "We report results from 5-7 keV Field Emission EPMA experiments on selected natural minerals and synthetic materials to illustrate some strengths -- and pitfalls --of low keV FE-EPMA. In a silicate mineral in pseudotachylite from South Mountain, AZ (Goodwin, 1999), the spatial resolution (equation of Merlet & Llovet, 2012, with an 80 nm diameter beam) at 7 keV for Si Ka is calculated to be 588 nm, 391 nm for Ca Ka and 641 nm for Fe La. This pseudotachylite contains abundant 5-10 um sieve-textured crystals full of inclusions with low BSE intensity. Previous 15 keV work suggested the sieve phase was amphibole. At 7 keV, it is possible to identify the compositions of the submicron inclusions as SiO2 and a K-rich alumino-silicate phase; the host composition is epidote.\nThe enhanced resolution of FE-EPMA reveals problems with some microanalytical standards. Vicenzi and Rose (2008) showed submicron inclusions in the Smithsonian Kakanui hornblende standard. Our 7 keV experiments show the ~400 nm inclusions consist of a silicate phase (glass?), Fe-Ti oxide and possibly a gas bubble, concentrated along planes or grain boundaries. SEM imaging of an inclusion analyzed with a focused FE beam shows radiating trails of debris on the hornblende host, consistent with residue from a popped vapor bubble in the inclusion. How should FE-EPMA handle standards that may have inclusions? Use a focused beam avoiding inclusions? Sometimes, perhaps. However, we used a defocused beam to \"average\" the phases. The results show little or no deviation from the published wet chemical analysis.\nOperation at reduced keV may require use of non-traditional X-ray lines (e.g. Gopon et al, 2013 for Fe Ll vs Fe La). Experiments at 5 keV were also performed upon a synthetic material enriched in Nd (Nd-Mg-Zn). Fischer & Baun (1967) demonstrated problems with the Ma/Mb lines of REE; we find that use of the Nd Mz line is necessary in order to achieve reasonable results in this material (98 wt% total, Nd 36 wt% vs 126 wt% total, Nd 67 wt% with Mb line). We also report on 7 and 15 keV time dependent intensity variations in Ir-coated calcite and dolomite and on the lack of interfering lines with 6 Å Ir.",

            "abstract": "Aerial photography has proven an efficient method to collect a wide range of continuous variables for large sections of rivers. These data include variables such as the planimetric shape, low-flow and bank-full widths, bathymetry, and sediment sizes. Mapping these variables in a continuous manner allows us to explore the heterogeneity of the river and build a more complete picture of the holistic riverscape. To explore a low-cost option for aerial photography and riverscape mapping, I used the combination of a piloted helicopter and an off-the-shelf digital SLR camera to collect aerial imagery for a 32 km segment of the Middle Fork John Day River in eastern Oregon. This imagery was processed with Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry to produce high-resolution 10 cm orthophotos and digital surface models that were used to extract riverscape variables. The Middle Fork John Day River is an important spawning river for anadromous Chinnook and Steelhead and has been the focus of widespread restoration and conservation activities in response to the legacies of extensive grazing and mining activity. By mapping the riverscape of the Middle Fork John Day, I explored downstream relationships between several geomorphic variables with hyperscale analysis. These riverscape data also provided an opportunity to make a continuous map of habitat suitability for migrating adult Chinook. Both the geomorphic and habitat suitability analysis provide an important assessment of the natural variation in the river and the impact of human modification, both positive and negative. ",

The long term variations of the REF clearly shows the 27-days period associated with the high speed solar wind velocity caused by the CIRs, whereas it is very few that the enhancement of REF lasts for several days after passage of CMEs. The 27-days period enhancement of REF represents the quite strong peak in 2003 when the high speed stream of the solar wind were quit active.\nWe also conducted the same analysis for the Pc5 pulsations observed on the ground. The ground magnetic variations data globally observed by National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) and International Center for Space Weather Science and Education (ICSWSE) Kyushu University are used to investigate the long term variations of Pc5 power. The same signature in the REF variations is shown in the time variability of the Pc5 power on the ground. These results indicate that the solar wind condition strongly affects the acceleration process of the relativistic electron flux by the ULF wave. In particular the dependence of the REF and Pc5 variations on the sector structures and their seasonal variations strongly suggest that the relationship between Pc5 and REF variations could be controlled by the Russell-McPherron effect.",

            "abstract": "Sea surface salinity (SSS) variability associated with the Congo River discharge is examined using Aquarius satellite-retrieved SSS data and vertical profiles of salinity measured by the Argo floats. The Congo River plume can be clearly identified in the Aquarius SSS data with a westward extension of 500 to 1000 km off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The peak amplitude of the SSS variability associated with the Congo River discharge exceeds 2.0 psu. Using the first two years of Aquarius data, a well-defined seasonal cycle is described: maximum fresh-water anomalies are found in the boreal winter and spring seasons. The fresh-water anomalies during the 2012-2013 winter and spring seasons are significantly fresher than the 2011-2012 winter and spring seasons. Vertical profiles of salinity derived from the Argo floats reveal that these fresh-water anomalies can be traced to 40 meters below the sea surface. Combining the Aquarius SSS data with the Argo vertical profiles of salinity, the 3D volume of these fresh-water anomalies can be inferred and used to estimate the Congo River discharge. Reasonably good agreement is found between the Congo River discharge as observed by a stream gauge at Kinshasa and that estimated from the combined Aquarius and Argo data, indicating that Aquarius data can be used to close the fresh-water budget between the coastal ocean and the Congo River. The precipitation minus evaporation portion of the freshwater flux is found to play a secondary role in this region.",

            "abstract": "Large lecture courses are traditional teaching practices of most large institutions of public higher education. They have historically provided an efficient way to deliver content information to the large number of students with the least amount of faculty resources. However, research of student learning indicates that the traditional lecture format does not provide the best learning experience for students, and students learn better in the active learning environments in which students engage in meaningful learning activities rather than just listening. In this study, we compare two offerings of Introduction to Environmental Science, a large-lecture general education course, offered in two formats by the same instructors in subsequent years. In the first offering (Spring 2013) the course was offered as a traditional large-lecture course, with lecture to large audiences and a limited number of exams for assessment. In the second offering (Spring 2014), the course included small-group discussion periods, peer-review of writing assignments, guest lectures, and online learning with limited traditional lecture. Our primary objective was to quantify differences in student engagement and learning outcomes between the two course offerings. Results of our study show that the students in the transformed course indicated higher interest, engagement level, and satisfaction than the students in the traditional lecture course. Furthermore, students in the transformed course reported increased behavior, emotional, and cognitive engagement over those in the traditional course, and also increased satisfaction with the course.",

            "abstract": "The Peninsula section of the San Andreas Fault (SAFP) is within 10 km of downtown San Francisco, making it among the most significant sources of seismic hazard in the San Francisco Bay area. However, the history of earthquakes along this fault segment is poorly known. The most recent ground-rupturing earthquake occurred in 1906, but the dates of earlier surface-rupturing earthquakes on this segment remain uncertain. Earlier work at the Crystal Springs South trench site showed that a ground-rupturing paleo-earthquake occurred 830-930 Cal. yr BP, but poor stratigraphic resolution hampered our ability to determine whether or not earthquakes occurred between then and 1906. We combined existing airborne LiDAR data with newly-collected terrestrial laser scanner data to create a high-resolution digital elevation model that we used to guide the locations of two trenches at a new site near Scarp Creek on the Filoli Estate, about 0.5km to the southeast along the fault. The new trenches exposed a stratigraphic section of faulted fluvial, overbank, and lacustrine deposits overlying a massive colluvial deposit. Our preliminary results show evidence for at least three surface ruptures, including the 1906 earthquake, since deposition of the colluvial material. Preliminary radiocarbon analyses show that these three earthquakes occurred during the last 900 years. We expect that radiocarbon analyses of samples of the abundant organic material exposed in the trenches will constrain more closely the ages of the prehistoric events. In addition, we anticipate that additional work at this site will provide an opportunity to test our earlier results and will provide additional data to better constrain the timing of pre-1906 surface ruptures on the SAFP.",

            "abstract": "It appears that the global magnetic topology of the solar corona predetermines to a large extent the magnetic flux transfer during solar eruptions. We have recently analyzed the global topology for a source-surface model of the background magnetic field at the time of the 2010 August 1-2 sympathetic CMEs (Titov et al. 2012). Now we extend this analysis to a more accurate thermodynamic MHD model of the solar corona. As for the source-surface model, we find a similar triplet of pseudo-streamers in the source regions of the eruptions. The new study confirms that all these pseudo-streamers contain separatrix curtains that fan out from a basic magnetic null point, individual for each of the pseudo-streamers. In combination with the associated separatrix domes, these separatrix curtains fully isolate adjacent coronal holes of the like polarity from each other. However, the size and shape of the coronal holes, as well as their open magnetic fluxes and the fluxes in the lobes of the separatrix domes, are very different for the two models. The definition of the open separator field lines, where the (interchange) reconnection between open and closed magnetic flux takes place, is also modified, since the structurally unstable source-surface null lines do not exist anymore in the MHD model. In spite of all these differences, we reassert our earlier hypothesis that magnetic reconnection at these nulls and the associated separators likely plays a key role in coupling the successive eruptions observed by SDO and STEREO. The results obtained provide further validation of our recent simplified MHD model of sympathetic eruptions (Török et al. 2011).\nResearch supported by NASA's Heliophysics Theory and LWS Programs, and NSF/SHINE and NSF/FESD.",

To obtain the residual mantle Bouguer anomaly (RMBA), we deducted the anomaly from lateral changes in bathymetry or topography, the gravity anomaly due to changes in sediment thickness and density from the free air anomaly firstly, and then corrected the lithosphere thermal gravity anomaly from the rifted margin to the spread ridge. According to the relationship between the control points and RMBA, we calculated the initial Moho depth, from which, we done an iterative cycle of gravity inversion to predict the final Moho depth and crustal thickness. To calculate the lithosphere thermal gravity anomaly, we defined a critical thinning factor for the initiation of oceanic crust production, and a maximum oceanic crustal thickness; for this study area, values of 0.5 and 9 km were used respectively, consistent with the Moho depth of 20km and 14km respectively, with the initial thickness of continental crust of 32km.\nThe RMS(root mean square) difference with the control points is 1.54km. Over most of the South China Sea basin, the Moho depth is 11 and 13km, the crustal thickness is 5-8km. The Moho depth of the Northwest sub basin has values between 12 and 13km, the crustal thickness is mostly ~7km. The NW trending fault divides obviously the extinct spreading centers of the East and southwest sub basin. Meanwhile, on the north side of the two sub basin extinct spreading centers, the crustal thickness is slightly thicker 1km than the south. The ocean-continent transition (OCT) is enclosed by the 14km and 20km Moho depth contour. At the East sub basin, the OCT shows asymmetry, and is broader and longer on the northern margin than the southern margin. One of the most noticeable characteristics in the northeastern margin of the OCT is that the crustal thickness is 10-16km. However, at the southwest sub basin, the OCT is symmetrical.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost contains a large pool of carbon that has accumulated for thousands of years, and remains frozen in organic form. As climate warms, permafrost thaw will increase rates of microbial breakdown of old soil organic matter (SOM), accelerating release of carbon to the atmosphere. Higher rates of microbial decomposition may also release reactive nitrogen, which may increase plant production and carbon fixation. The net effect on atmospheric carbon, and the strength of climate feedback, depends on the balance between direct and indirect effects of increased microbial activity, which depends on changes in soil conditions and microbial responses to them. In particular, soil moisture and availability of C and N for microbes strongly influence soil respiration and primary production. Current understanding of changes in these factors as climate warms is limited. We present results from analysis of soil extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) from a long-term warming and drying experiment in subarctic Alaskan tundra (the CiPEHR experiment) as an indicator of changes in soil microbial activity and relative availability of C and N for microbes. We collected soil samples from control (C), warming (W), and warming + drying (WD) treatments and used fluorometric methods to estimate EEA in shallow (0-5 cm) and deep (5-15) soils. We measured soil moisture, SOM, and C:N, and plant tissue C:N as an indicator of N availability. Activity of N-acquiring enzymes was higher in WD soils at both depths. Carbon EEA in W soils was lower in surface, but higher in deeper soils. We also found significantly lower soil C:N in both W and WD in deeper soils, where C:N was generally lower than surface. In general, EEA results suggest drying leads to increased C availability relative to N. This may be due to lower soil moisture leading to greater aeration of soils in WD plots relative to W plots, which may be saturated due to significant land subsidence. Greater aeration may increase efficiency of carbon use by microbes, effectively increasing carbon availability for microbes in WD soils relative to W soils. This suggests that drying may reduce N recycling by microbes, potentially reducing plant production and increasing soil respiration relative to carbon fixation, increasing the likelihood that permafrost thaw will be a positive feedback on climate change.",

Crucially, in developing this theory MTT introduced the “entrainment hypothesis” in which the rate of entrainment of atmospheric air by the large eddies forming at the edge of the plume is proportional to some bulk velocity. In the presence of wind a key question is whether the additional stirring deforms eddies sufficiently to alter their mixing properties. In particular, under what conditions will wind effects enhance or reduce entrainment? Can these effects be captured in a modified form of the MTT similarity theory or is a new theory required?\nWe use an extensive set of experiments on wind-forced turbulent plumes in order to overcome the restricted dynamical conditions explored in previous experimental studies. We introduce a new regime parameter allowing to quantitatively separate three distinct plume regimes. Remarkably, we show that for reasonable conditions on Earth, the major effects of wind can still be captured by a modified scaling law derived from the self-similar theory of MTT, with an entrainment rate including the contributions of wind. However, analysis of the turbulence motions in our experiments shows that even weak winds introduce large asymmetries in the structure of entraining eddies. Our successful application of a mean entrainment rate at the plume edge and a modified MTT similarity theory is, thus, surprising. Does this apparent contradiction simply reveal the way turbulent instabilities driven by wind manifest themselves?",

These TEM results indicate aerosol types and mixing states, both of which are important for evaluating particle optical properties and cloud condensation nuclei activity. The samples were collected at the T3 site, which is located in the Amazon forest with influences from the urban pollution plume from Manaus. Samples were also collected from the T0 site, which is in the middle of the jungle with minimal to no influences of anthropogenic sources. The aerosol particles mainly originated from 1) anthropogenic pollution (e.g., nanosphere soot, sulfate), 2) biogenic emissions (e.g., primary biogenic particles, organic aerosols), and 3) long-range transport (e.g., sea salts). We found that the biogenic organic aerosol particles contain homogeneously distributed potassium.\nParticle viscosity is important for evaluating gas-particle interactions and atmospheric chemistry for the particles. Viscosity can be estimated from the rebounding behavior at controlled relative humidities, i.e., highly viscous particles display less rebound on a plate than low-viscosity particles. We collected 1) aerosol particles from a plate (non-rebounded), 2) those that had rebounded from the plate and were then captured onto an adjacent sampling plate, and 3) particles from ambient air using a separate impactor sampler. Preliminary results show that more than 90% of non-rebounded particles consisted of nanosphere soot with or without coatings. The coatings mostly consisted of organic matter. Although rebounded particles also contain nanosphere soot (number fraction 64-69%), they were mostly internally mixed with sulfate, organic matter, or their mixtures. TEM tilted images suggested that the rebounded particles were less deformed on the substrate, whereas the non-rebounded particles were more deformed, which could reflect differences in their viscosity.",

            "abstract": "The South China Sea (SCS) surface circulation is mainly forced by seasonally varying monsoon winds and flow through the Luzon Strait. In winter, positive wind curl (due to the northeasterly winds) in the southern half of SCS drives a cyclonic gyre. The strong western boundary current south off Vietnam on the continental slope separates the Sunda Shelf to the west and deep SCS basin to the east. The advection of cold water due to the slope current results in a unique cold tongue in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from November to February. The inter-annual variability of this cold-tongue is investigated by analyzing the NCEP OISST version-2 dataset. Dynamics of the evolution, growth and decay of the cold tongue during the period 1982-2012 are addressed using the OISST and ERA-interim surface wind datasets. The role of water mass advection in the inter-annual variability of SCS cold-tongue is also investigated through the analysis of lateral heat fluxes estimated from NCEP-Climate Forecast System Re-analysis dataset. The vertically integrated Ekman transport (i.e., the Sverdrup transport) plays a vital role in the formation this cold tongue. The southward Sverdrup transport brings cold water from the northern parts of the SCS. Inter-annual variations in the cold tongue SST during the northeast monsoon (November to February) are strongly linked to the north-south Sverdrup and zonal Ekman transport anomalies. The positive SST anomalies over the cold-tongue region are associated with positive transport anomalies, reflecting the weakening of the southward and westward advection. The formation and termination of this cold tongue has significant correlation with the El Nino phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean.",

A new approach was developed to determine total porosity of materials as function of loading. The total porosity can divided into two portions, compliant porosity (φc(P)) and framework one (φr(P)). The former is well fitted by exponential function and reaches zero at the pressure Pcp – “compliant pore closure pressure”, and the latter described by a linear function. An interesting and startling phenomenon is that framework pores can survive in specimens beyond 450 MPa, even higher than 1000MPa. ρ and Vp linearly increase with pressurization at pressures beyond Pcp, however, the pressure derivatives of density (Dρ) and of velocity (Dv) are at least one order of magnitude higher than the counterparts of crystallized rocks. We attribute these higher values (Dρ and Dv) to the existence of pores within specimens even when pressure reaches 450 MPa.",

            "abstract": "function (RF) analysis is one of the most powerful methods. In many cases, one draws spatial geometry of seismic velocity interface by using depth-migrated radial component RFs observed at several stations. On the other hand, many studies including Shiomi and Park (2008) have proposed the RF stacking method to estimate a depth of seismic velocity discontinuity and/or anisotropic features beneath each station. When we applied the RF stacking method to each station, we assumed the close stations have similar results. However, the depth and plunge azimuth of the Moho beneath two close stations, N.WATH and N.WTRF located in the Kii Peninsula, central Japan, were different as reported in Shiomi and Park (2008). These two stations are only 2.5 km apart from each other. Now, we focused on the data at these two stations and tried to understand why they have different RFs.\nAlthough the distance between these stations is only 2.5km, the RFs are clearly different each other, especially transverse component. At N.WATH, the short-period (fc = 1Hz) velocity seismograph is installed at the bottom of the borehole with depth of 110m. At N.WTRF, the STS-2 is equipped at the end of the tunnel. In the transverse RFs at station N. WATH, later phases with large amplitudes arrived 0~2s after the initial P wave for earthquake in SW direction. However, earthquakes in W~NW directions had large amplitude at N.WTRF. This characteristic is confirmed by checking the cross-correlation coefficients (CCs) of the teleseismograms used to estimate the RFs. The CCs of vertical, radial, and transverse components are about 0.8, 0.7 and 0.4, respectively. Thus, CCs of the teleseismograms from SW to NW were low for particularly transverse component.\nThis large discrepancy of transverse RFs might be due to the localized strong anisotropic crust and/or steep velocity discontinuity because these stations are located in the accretionary prism along the subducting Philippine Sea plate. In fact, we confirmed that the result could be affected by the crustal anisotropy by simple numerical check. We show the RF result in this region by considering the localized strong anisotropic crust and steep velocity discontinuity.",

So far, we employed GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) RL-4 and earlier versions of the EGMs and the in-situ gravity data obtained by the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE), i.e., land gravity data since 1967, surface ship data since 1985 and airborne gravity data in 2006. Using these data sets, we calculated the precise gravity fields by means of Least Squares Colocations (LSC) and evaluated the GOCE EGMs by comparing with the in-situ gravity data.\nRecently, new GOCE EGMs, TIM RL-5 and DIR RL-5 have been released. In addition, JARE ship borne gravity data have been reprocessed following a more unified procedure and some land gravity data have been added. Accordingly, we have recalculated the gravity fields using all the data combined. Practically, using those data sets, we estimated gravity anomalies and geoid heights in the area of 60-80S and 20-60E by means of LSC using a GOCE EGM as the long wave-length gravity fields and an empirical covariance function estimated from the airborne gravity data. In this procedure as well as using the obtained gravity field data, we also evaluated GOCE EGMs and other recent EGMs.",

            "abstract": "The timing and rate of uplift and topographic evolution in many parts of the Andes is still under debate. One of these areas is the segment of flat-slab subduction of north-central Chile (27-32°S). Geomorphological studies along this segment define two levels of Oligo-Miocene low-relief surfaces that are incised and partially covered by gravel sequences. These surfaces are interpreted as pediments and suggest that two pulses of uplift and incision occurred during the Oligo-Miocene time; one during the Oligocene-early Miocene and another during the late Miocene-Pliocene. Existing data from apatite fission-track show exhumation during the Oligocene-early Miocene in the entire segment, however, only south of 29.5°S does a second pulse of exhumation occur in the late Miocene-Pliocene. Most low-temperature thermochronometers may be insensitive to low rates of exhumation in the more arid north, however the increased sensitivity of 4He/3He thermochronometry (70-40°C) has successfully been applied to unravel the denudation history and landscape evolution in arid mountain areas. This work provides low-temperature thermochronometry data (including 4He/3He thermochronometry) indicating a late Miocene-Pliocene pulse of exhumation at ~29°S. Calculated exhumation rates are very slow prior to 15-10 My, ~ 20 m/My, then increase to ~ 50 m/My from ~10 My to present. These denudation rates are in agreement with those calculated from cut and fill volumes between pediments that were sealed by ash layers of known ages. These new thermochronometric data suggest that the topographic evolution of the northern segment of the studied region was not only controlled by the Oligocene – early Miocene deformation, but also by a late Miocene period of uplift and valley incision. This late Miocene deformation/exhumation may be a consequence of the initiation of flat-slab subduction, leading to a decrease of convergence rates and underthrusting of the mountain's core.",

However, not all front-side CMEs can hit the Earth. Thus, which CMEs hit the Earth and when they do so are important issues in the study and forecasting of space weather. In our previous work (Shen et al., 2013), the de-projected parameters of the full-halo coronal mass ejections (FHCMEs) occurred from 2007 March 1 to 2012 May 31 were obtained, and there are 39 front-side events could be fitted by the GCS model. In this work, we continue to study whether and when these front-side FHCMEs (FFHCMEs) hit the Earth. It is found that 59% of these FFHCMEs hit the Earth, and for central events, whose deviation angles , which are the angles between the propagation direction and the Sun-Earth line, are smaller than 45 degrees, the fraction increases to 75%. After checking the deprojected angular widths of the CMEs, we found that all of the Earth-encountered CMEs satisfy a simple criterion that the angular width (ω) is larger than twice the deviation angle. This result suggests that some simple criteria can be used to forecast whether a CME could hit the Earth. Furthermore, for Earth-encountered CMEs, the transit time is found to be roughly anti-correlated with the de-projected velocity, but some events significantly deviate from the linearity. For CMEs with similar velocities, the differences of their transit times can be up to several days. Such deviation is further demonstrated to be mainly caused by the CME geometry and propagation direction, which are essential in the forecasting of CME arrival.",

            "abstract": "The Marcellus Shale is the most expansive shale gas reserve in play in the United States, representing an estimated 17 to 29 % of the total domestic shale gas reserves. The rapid and extensive development of this shale gas reserve in the past decade has stimulated significant interest and debate over the climate and environmental impacts associated with fugitive releases of methane and other pollutants, including volatile organic compounds. However, the nature and magnitude of these pollutant emissions remain poorly characterized. This study utilizes the tracer release technique to characterize total fugitive methane release rates from natural gas facilities in southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia that are at different stages of development, including well completion flowbacks and active production. Real-time downwind concentrations of methane and two tracer gases (acetylene and nitrous oxide) released onsite at known flow rates were measured using a quantum cascade tunable infrared laser differential absorption spectrometer (QC-TILDAS, Aerodyne, Billerica, MA) and a cavity ring down spectrometer (Model G2203, Picarro, Santa Clara, CA). Evacuated Silonite canisters were used to sample ambient air during downwind transects of methane and tracer plumes to assess volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector was used to quantify VOCs following the EPA Method TO-14A. A preliminary assessment of fugitive emissions from actively producing sites indicated that methane leak rates ranged from approximately 1.8 to 6.2 SCFM, possibly reflecting differences in facility age and installed emissions control technology. A detailed comparison of methane leak rates and VOCs emissions with recent published literature for other US shale gas plays will also be discussed.",

This paper develops an implicit integration algorithm for the bounding surface model, using the standard return mapping approach (elastic predictor-plastic corrector), to obtain the updated stresses for the given strain increments. The formulation of the constitutive integration requires the derivation of a supplementary differential equation to describe the evolution of a key variable, i.e., the ratio between the image stress and the current stress quantities. It is essentially an extension of the integration scheme presented in an earlier work used for the simple bounding surface version of modified Cam Clay associated with a substantially simplified hardening rule. The integration algorithm for the bounding surface model is implemented into the finite element analysis commercial program, ABAQUS, through the material interface of UMAT (user defined material subroutine), and then used for the analysis of wellbore stability problem. The predictions from the ABAQUS simulations are generally in excellent agreement with the available analytical solutions, thus demonstrating the accuracy and robustness of the proposed integration scheme.",

            "abstract": "The Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake resulted in an unprecedented coseismic slip of >50 m in the shallow portion of the Japan Trench subduction zone. We present analyses of core recovered during IODP Expedition 343/343T (JFAST) that define structures surrounding the inferred plate boundary décollement, and use the results to constrain the fault’s long-term strength. The plate boundary fault is centered at 821.5 m below the sea floor, with a damage zone extending 15.5 m below and 51.5 m above. The damage zone is defined by shear fractures, subsidiary faults, deformation bands, mode I fractures, breccia zones, and sediment-filled veins. Orientations of mutually crosscutting shear fractures decrease in dip angle nearing the fault in the hanging wall, from 67° at 50 m above the fault down to 25°. In the footwall, dips range from 88° at 9.6 m below the fault to 30° at 11 m below. The damage zone characteristics were established using a set of criteria to eliminate drilling-, coring-, and handling-induced damage in core. Core-scale fracture density increases from 21 fractures/m at 51 m above the fault to 247 fractures/m adjacent to the fault in the hanging wall, and from 28 fractures/m at 11 m below the fault to 254 fractures/m adjacent to the fault in the footwall. The fall-off in fracture density is fit by power law functions in the hanging wall and footwall, with decay exponent n values of 0.70 and 1.45, respectively. Microstructures include shear fractures, veins, crystallographic preferred orientation bands, shear zones, and undifferentiated fractures. Microstructure density in the footwall increases from 0.32 fractures/mm 10 m below the fault to 2.04 fractures/mm adjacent to the fault, and is fit by a power law function with n = 1.27. Orientations of shear fractures have attitudes consistent with normal and reverse faults, indicating the stress field underwent significant reorientations multiple times. This is consistent with the inferred stress field changes accompanying great earthquakes measured from borehole breakouts (Lin et al., 2013). Compared to similar offset faults, the décollement has a steep fall-off in damage, which we interpret to indicate the fault is weak over geologic time; hence small changes in stress magnitudes could result in large stress field rotations.",

            "abstract": "The biomass of tropical forests sequestrates tons of carbon and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle regulating the climate. Also its high biodiversity ecosystems bring us many valuable resources and cultural and educational ecosystem services. However, large areas of the tropical forest are deforested and converted to oil palm or acacia plantation for the economic benefit of the local society mainly in Southeast Asia. Monitoring of the tropical forest from satellites provides us the information about the deforestation for decadal time period over extensive areas and enables us to discuss it from a scientific point of view. The purpose of this study is to reveal the interannual change and recent trend of deforestation in relation to the land elevation for decadal time period over Borneo by using data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).   We acquired the atmospherically corrected and cloud free Terra-MODIS and Aqua-MODIS daily data products (MOD09GA and MYD09GA; collection 5) from 2001 to 2013 for Borneo. We extracted the pixel values in the 500m surface reflectance bands 1 (red) and 4 (green) products and calculated the green–red vegetation index (GRVI), (band 4 – band 1) / (band 4 + band 1), at a daily time step. GRVI shows a positive value for the land prevailed by green vegetation, while it shows a negative value for the land prevailed by no-green components such as bare land. As for the elevation data, ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) which has 33.3m spatial resolution was employed. The original resolution was resampled to the grid system of MODIS data (i.e. 500m resolution).   Pixels which had a negative GRVI ratio more than 80 % (termed as “no green pixel”) in each year were regarded as the land characterized by no vegetation, and mapped the distribution for each year. Throughout the 13 years, no green pixels mainly found over the coastal low land below 20m of the elevation and the area was almost constant (around 3000km2). It is considered the deforestation for the plantations generally occurred over the easy access low lands. By contrast, it was obvious that no green pixels extended their distribution up to high elevation (20 to 120m) areas mainly after 2006. This trend suggests recent development of the plantation has been extended to relatively inland and high elevation areas.",

            "abstract": "While much attention has been focused on the exoplanetary “bestiary” of super-Earths, lava worlds, and diamond planets, habitable planets are more likely to be found in a more similar exoplanetary “zoo.” Many planet-hosting stars are similar in composition to the Sun, with moderate variations in metal abundances. Even for those stars with O and Fe abundances similar to the Sun, many have 100% variations in the refractory, rock-forming elements such as Si, Mg, Al and Ca. For an Earth sized planet, this variation creates planets with drastically different mantle mineral assemblages and variable melting, elastic, and viscous properties, leading to variable dynamical behavior. This dynamical behavior dictates the dominant mode of heat extraction, be it through a conducting rigid lid or via plate tectonics. Without tectonics, there is no mechanism known with which to create a deep water and carbon cycle, thus creating a long-lived habitable surface.\nWe present the results of integrated modeling in which we consider the effects of variations in bulk mantle composition on Earth-mass planets. To explore the variations expected in this planetary zoo, we present condensation sequence calculations for stars of varying refractory element abundances. These calculations constrain the potential refractory mineral reservoir from which Earth-mass terrestrial planets will form. As planets of this size inevitably will convect, the thermal structure of the mantle is controlled by surface melting temperature and the first crust can be estimated from decompression melting of a convecting mantle. The thermodynamic code HeFESTo determines the mineralogy and resulting thermoelastic properties of both the mantle and potential foundering of crustal material. Finally, with parameterized convection modeling and 2- and 3-D convection modeling, we determine terrestrial mantle’s convective regime as a function of bulk composition. We therefore consider a planet’s potential for Earth-like plate tectonics by applying compositional perturbations from the Earth. Aspects affecting this potential include the location of the basalt-eclogite transition in the upper mantle and the density contrast, and thus negative buoyancy, between the foundering crust and mantle. Portions of this work were initiated at the CIDER 2014 program.",

            "abstract": "Multi-scale, finite-frequency tomography across the Himalayas-Tibet shows a clear, subhorizontal anomaly of high VP and VSin the upper mantle that can be traced from under N. India all the way to beneath central Tibet. This configuration of the “Greater India” (GI), or the submerged, northern portion of the Indian shield, is combined with other constraints to reconstruct position of the Indian lithospheric mantle (ILM) relative to Asia back to about 15 Ma ago, or the onset of the latest magmatic activity in Tibet. By then, the leading edge of the ILM (Indian mantle front, IMF) has advanced subhorizontally past the entire Lhasa terrane and also probably have caused the lithospheric mantle beneath the Qiangtang terrane to thicken. The thickening is likely to have led to Rayleigh-Taylor instability, causing widespread but small volume of magmatic activity in northern Tibet.\nMeanwhile, the detached lithospheric mantle foundered through the upper mantle to rest at the bottom of the mantle transition zone (MTZ), just above the lower mantle. This detached lithospheric mantle manifests itself as a large-scale seismic anomaly of high compressional wave speed (VP) but curiously is undetectable through shear-waves. Based on laboratory data for nominally anhydrous olivine and its high-pressure polymorphs (NAO), the discordant results between P- and S-waves is explained by abundant hydroxyls in the foundered lithospheric mantle, a hypothesis supported by other evidences as well. Since NAO can hold ~1 wt% of water throughout the upper mantle and the MTZ, foundering of thickened lithospheric mantle caused by continental collision is an under-appreciated but effective pathway for water to enter the deep mantle.\nCurrently, the Indus-Yarlung suture between northern India and the Lhasa terrane appears to be an inactive, crustal feature, as the GI continues to pass beneath it. On the other hand, even though the IMF has now advanced northward beyond the Bangong-Nujiang suture (BNS), which marks the suture between the Lhasa (southern Tibet) and the Qiangtang terranes (central Tibet) in the Mesozoic, the BNS seems to have been a zone of deformation over lithospheric scale when the IMF interacted with the Qiangtang lithosphere about 15 Ma ago. Indeed the Moho around this zone is highly disturbed, a feature not found elsewhere under Tibet.",

            "abstract": "Manganese is a pollutant in worldwide environments contaminated with metals and organics, such as acid mine drainage (AMD), freshwater ponds, and agricultural waste storage sites. Microorganisms contribute to the removal of dissolved Mn compounds in the environment by promoting Mn(II) oxidation reactions. The oxidation of Mn(II) results in the precipitation of sparingly soluble Mn(IV) oxide minerals, effectively removing the metal from the aqueous milieu (e.g., groundwater or wastewater streams). In recent years, our research has identified a diversity of Mn(II)-oxidizing fungi inhabiting these polluted environments, however their overall contribution to the remediation process in situ remains poorly understood. Here we present results of culture-based and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) studies in AMD treatment systems actively remediating Mn and other metals where we profile the bacterial, fungal, algal and archaeal communities to determine the overall community diversity and to establish the relative abundance of known Mn(II) oxidizers.\nA variety of treatment systems with varying Mn-removal efficiencies were sampled to understand the relationship between remediation efficiency and microbial community composition and activity. Targeted-amplicon sequencing of DNA and RNA of the 16S rRNA genes (bacteria and archaea), 23S rRNA genes (algae) and ITS region (fungi) was performed using both 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina platforms. Results showed that only the fungal taxonomic profiles significantly differed between sites that removed the majority of influent Mn and those that did not. Specifically, Ascomycota (which include known Mn(II) oxidizers isolated from these treatment systems) dominated greater efficiency systems whereas less efficient systems were dominated by Basidiomycota. Furthermore, known Mn(II) oxidizers accounted for only a minor proportion of bacterial sequences but a far greater proportion of fungal sequences. These culture-independent studies lend further evidence to numerous culture-based studies (of AMD remediation systems here, as well as a variety of other metal-rich systems) that establish Mn(II)-oxidizing fungi as important contributors to the remediation of Mn, and likely other metals, in metal polluted environments.",

The spatangoid sea urchin genus, Metalia Gray 1885, a member of the spatangoid family Brissidae, is known primarily from the Indo-pacific region, although one species is known from the west coast of North America. Examination of new material is adding significantly to our knowledge of the morphology and taxonomy of Metalia. There are nine known species: Metalia spatagus (Linnaeus, 1758); Metalia sternalis (Lamarck, 1816); Metalia townsendi (Bell, 1904); Metalia nobilis Verrill, 1867-71; Metalia robillardi (de Loriol, 1876); Metalia dicrana H.L. Clark, 1917; Metalia latissima H.L. Clark, 1925; Metalia persica (Mortensen, 1940); Metalia angustus de Ridder, 1984; and Metalia kermadecensis Baker & Rowe, 1990. In addition, we have discovered two Philippines species new to science. Our work is presently removing ambiguities among characters used to typify all known Metalia, allowing for the establishment of more reliable species identification. A morphology-based phylogenetic analysis of Metalia using outgroup comparisons among brissid taxa such as Anametalia, Granobrissoides, Rhynobrissus, Brissopsis, Eupatatus, Meoma, and Brissus suggests that Metalia is monophyletic. An intriguing possibility is that the very distinctive and beautiful form from North America, Plagiobrissus, is very closely related to and possibly evolved from within Metalia. We are also studing various aspects of the biogeography and growth of Metalia.",

We identify some microseismic signals from North Atlantic Ocean (NAO) based on the seismic data recorded in 439 EarthScope stations in the United States and 15 permanent stations in Greenland. Among EarthScope stations, microseismic signals are found correlated but only within close azimuths, with the directions of the correlated station pairs pointing to NAO, indicating presence of microseismic sources in NAO. The sources are active in some time periods and quite in others. Travel time analysis between the correlated station pairs further indicates that the observed microseismic signals propagate with a velocity of 3.3 km/s, consistent with surface Rayleigh wave. In Greenland stations, the signals are more correlated between the stations along the eastern coastline. In this presentation, we report location, strength and temporal change of the microseismic sources determined by back projecting the energy of cross-correlations of the sets of stations in the USA and Greenland.",

The primary production and phenology in the Arctic Ocean has been successfully simulated and studied using this model as released in CICE 5.0. This talk will focus on the model analysis of the Antarctic Ocean to the south of 45S. The model results were validated with the remote sensing sea ice extent (1979-2009), sea surface Chl-a (1998-2009) and in situ observations. Sea ice extent has slightly increased in the Antarctic over the last decades and we will show how the primary production and its timing vary in response to the sea ice conditions in seasonal to interannual time scales.",

            "abstract": "Most of the existing aerosol sensitive passive sensors focus on detecting day time aerosol properties. The Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) contains a Day/Night Band (DNB) which is capable of remote sensing of aerosol signals at night. This brings an opportunity for studying nighttime aerosol optical properties at a high spatial and temporal resolution. Using VIIRS DNB data, several methods are developed for retrieving aerosol optical depth values over regions with artificial city lights. These methods are based on changes in diffuse scattering of artificial light due to particles in the atmosphere. The first method compares average radiance values of artificial light sources against that of nearby dark pixels. The second method examines the dispersion of radiance values above an artificial light source. The strengths and weaknesses of each method are investigated over selected artificial city light sources that are within close proximity to Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites. This study suggests that nighttime retrievals of aerosol properties at high spatial and temporal resolution using the VIIRS DNB may be viable in the future.",

            "abstract": "Seasonally dry ecosystems, which include Mediterranean, tropical monsoonal and tropical savannah climates, cover approximately 30% of the planet's land area and are globally significant biodiversity hotspots. Due to a highly variable climate, the streamflow available for ecosystems and ecosystems services in these regions is typified by large inter-annual variability. Methods to quantify this variability could shed light on stream ecosystem stress, particularly new stresses imposed by human activity or climate change.\nThis study develops a probabilistic framework to examine controls on dry season flow characteristics in seasonally dry climates. Assuming a typical recession pattern, which is conditioned on an initial value that is sampled from the wet season flows [1,2], analytical PDFs for the arrival time of a given dry season flow threshold can be obtained. Below-flow-threshold persistence time distributions are computed as the difference between an (assumed) normally distributed dry season length and the mean flow threshold arrival time. A number of hypotheses are proposed to explain unexpected sources of variability in the empirical arrival time distributions. The ecologic implications of extended low flow persistence, such as the hydrologic fragmentation of lower order watersheds, are discussed.\n[1] Müller, M. F., D. N. Dralle, and S. E.

            "abstract": "The world’s climate has changed and human activities will continue to contribute to the acceleration of greenhouse gases and temperature rise. The major drivers of these changes are increased temperature, altered hydrological cycles and shifts in wind patterns that might alter coastal currents. Increasing temperatures alone have the potential to strengthen pycnoclines in estuarine and coastal waters, but lower surface salinity (e.g., from increased freshwater runoff) would be more of a factor in stratifying the water column. The combination of increased nutrient loads (from human activities) and increased freshwater discharge (from GCC) will aggravate the already high loads of nutrients from the Mississippi River to the northern Gulf of Mexico, strengthen stratification (all other factors remaining the same), and worsen the hypoxia situation. Reduced precipitation, on the other hand, would lower the amount of nutrients and water reaching the coastal zone and, perhaps, lead to oligotrophication and reduced fisheries productivity, or perhaps alleviate hypoxia. The increase or decrease in flow (whichever occurs), flux of nutrients and water temperature are likely to have important, but as yet not clearly identifiable, influences on hypoxia. In anticipation of the negative effects of global change, nutrient loadings to coastal waters need to be reduced now, so that further water quality degradation is prevented.",

An algorithm using three infrared (IR) bands of the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to retrieve cirrus radiative and microphysical properties has been applied to global-scale remote sensing at a 1-km horizontal resolution. Results present geospatial and seasonal variation of single-layer high clouds. Global mean of effective particle radius of single-layer cirrus cloud is about 30 µm with mean optical thickness of 1.6, whereas the optical thickness exhibits large dispersion with nearly flat frequency distribution over a range between 0.1 and 10. Tropical cirrus clouds have smaller particle sizes, compared to midlatitude cirrus. The effective particle size generally increases at warmer temperature with lower depolarization ratio obtained from collocated CALIPSO lidar observations. Optically thick cirrus clouds are geometrically thick and composed of larger particles. Using these results, useful parameterizations of effective particle radius are proposed for use in general circulation models. The analysis using only the IR measurements reveals that there is no significant day–night differences in the statistics of microphysical and optical properties when averaged over the globe, whereas diurnal variations are significant in cloud amount and cloud-top pressure. Radiative effects of cirrus cloud should be reproduced in models by including the characteristics obtained.",

            "abstract": "Hindcasts of cyclonic wind fields are crucial for extreme analysis in the oil and gas industry. Recent scientific developments have increased the number of parameterization options for tropical cyclone vortices, leading to well over 8000 permutations of model choices. Which is best? Also problematic is how best to blend modelled vortex winds into a global wind model (such as the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR)) in order to resolve tropical cyclones to sufficient detail for wave modelling. Standard blending schemes can leave a ‘moat’ between the vortex and the CFSR circulation (see Figure 1 from TC Olivia 1996).\nUsing a 35-year track database from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, this study assesses model configurations and blending schemes against the most extensive measured meteorological dataset in the north-east Indian Ocean (largely commercial-in-confidence). The Holland profile models of 1980 and 2008 are two starting points, with other options examined for radius to maximum wind calculations, pressure-wind relationships, averaging periods, atmospheric profiles, gust factors, and asymmetry methods. Once a vortex is modelled, the winds are then fitted to the radius of gales and blended into the CFSR before further verification. Initial results support recent theoretical developments by Hu et al (2012), with additional results that call for a new asymmetry method and the separation of pressure and wind field modelling.",

            "abstract": "The continental shelf of the East China Sea has been experiencing a fast growing input of terrestrial nutrients in recent decades, in additional to constant incursion of marginal nutrients sources with low oxygen concentration, which together could be responsible for one of the largest hypoxic zone off the Changjiang River estuary and the adjacent coast especially in the northern East China Sea. However, the onset and spreading of hypoxia varies from year to year, and its mechanism is poorly known due to a variety of nutrient cycling and complicate circulation systems. Intensive survey suggested association of the tremendous increase in the area of the hypoxic zone with strong cross-shelf exchanges and steady growth of riverine nutrients for 2006. A high-resolution 3D primitive equation model coupled with a 13-component biological module has been applied to the area in an attempt to evaluate the terrestrial and marginal contributions. Sediment processes is simplified by formulating a relation of the oxidation of carbon and nitrification of ammonium to nitrate with oxygen consumption. The biological module is based on the Carbon, Silicate, Nitrogen Ecosystem Model (CoSiNE).",

            "abstract": "We performed frequency-dependent polarization analysis for all USArray TA broadband seismic stations from the inception of the project (April, 2004) through the present time. For each hour of data, at each station, the processing resulted in nine frequency-dependent quantities: power on the vertical component, power on the north/south component, power on the east/west component, power of the largest eigenvalue of the spectral covariance matrix, the degree of polarization, the azimuth and inclination of the polarization ellipsoid, the phase difference between the two horizontal components, and the phase difference between the vertical and radial components. Strong seasonal variations in these parameters exist at essentially all stations, however the year-to-year variation is much smaller. Therefore, a single year of data is sufficient to determine the average properties of the ambient seismic wavefield at a specific station.\nHere we focus on the characteristics of ambient seismic noise in the double-frequency microseism band of 3-10 s. The strength and dominant period of this energy vary significantly and coherently across North America: proximity to a coastline generally leads to increased amplitude; sedimentary basins show increased amplitudes and shorter dominant periods; and the western U.S. shows longer dominant periods than the central and eastern U.S. Many stations have a bimodal distribution of dominant periods with individual power spectral density estimates that show a splitting of the double-frequency peak into two distinct sub-peaks. Such a phenomenon has been observed previously for data recorded by ocean bottom seismometers, with the shorter-period peak attributed to the local sea and the longer-period peak attributed to more distant, coastally generated microseisms. In the case of the TA data, the splitting appears to arise from simultaneous microseism generation at primarily coastal source areas (Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, North Atlantic) with distinct, preferred excitation frequencies. Microseism source properties estimated from ocean wave models support this interpretation.",

This modeling uses the diffusion wave equation to calculate temporal changes in variables involved in surface runoff, such as flow depth and velocity. This technique can simulate the propagation of flood waves around stormwater infrastructure by calculating the volume of water flowing into inlets within the infrastructure and the time taken for this water to be removed from the infrastructure via outfalls. Therefore, it produces a time-specific flow depth and accumulative flux for each cell on the DEM as well as for inlets and outfalls of the stormwater infrastructure, enabling the spatial and temporal analyses of surface runoff. This study describes the concept behind, and details of, the new technique, and outlines potential applications for this technique using synthetic and real-world datasets.

            "abstract": "Chaman fault system, the transform boundary between the Indian and Eurasian plates, is a group of sinistral faults including the Chaman, Ghazaband and Ornach Nal faults. This fault system accommodates ~3 cm/yr relative motion between the Indian and Eurasian plates. Previous studies based on seismic data have suggested a significant slip deficit on this fault system, likely accommodated by aseismic creep; however no clear evidence for the suggested creep has yet been provided. Here, we use several tracks of Envisat ASAR data acquired over ascending and descending orbits during the years 2003-2011 to study the tectonic deformation across the Chaman fault system and resolve how deformation is accommodated along this plate boundary.\nOur InSAR analysis yield a coherent velocity field, composed of multiple tracks, which are consistent in overlapping areas. The velocity map shows left-lateral relative motion across the Chaman fault system with strain partitioning among different faults. One of our key findings is a ~50 km long creeping segment of the Chaman fault with a maximum creeping rate of ~7 mm/yr during 2003-2011. This creeping segment is located between Nushki and Chaman cities, north of the rupture area of Mw 7.7 2013 Balouchistan earthquake. This observation of fault creep is the first geodetic evidence for steady aseismic slip on Chaman fault. Additionally, our InSAR velocity field reveals typical (arctangent) long wavelength crustal displacement across different segments of the fault system, suggesting interseismic strain accumulation, likely to be released seismically in future earthquakes. We also detect deformation induced by a Mw 5 earthquake on the Ghazaband fault, south of the Mw 7.5, 1935 Quetta earthquake, with long-lasting (~2 years) aseismic afterslip, similar to a recent observation reported by Furuya and Satyabal, [2008].\nOur analysis shows that the deformation in the western Indian plate boundary is accommodated in three different forms: aseismic slip along creeping segments, interseismic strain accumulation along locked fault segments, and aseismic afterslip following moderate earthquakes. The observed creep and afterslip are consistent with the lack of seismic activity on parts of the Chaman fault system, and could ultimately provide new constraints to refine seismic hazard in the area.",

            "abstract": "Despite the recent explosion of quantitative geological data, geology remains a fundamentally qualitative science. Numerical data only constitute a certain part of data collection in the geosciences. In many cases, geological observations are compiled as text into reports and annotations on drill cores, thin sections or drawings of outcrops. The observations are classified into concepts such as lithology, stratigraphy, geological structure, etc. These descriptions are semantically rich and are generally supported by more quantitative observations using geochemical analyses, XRD, hyperspectral scanning, etc, but the goal is geological semantics. In practice it has been difficult to bring the different observations together due to differing perception or granularity of classification in human observation, or the partial observation of only some characteristics using quantitative sensors.\nIn the past years many geological classification schemas have been transferred into ontologies and vocabularies, formalized using RDF and OWL, and published through SPARQL endpoints. Several lithological ontologies were compiled by stratigraphy.net and published through a SPARQL endpoint. This work is complemented by the development of a Python API to integrate this vocabulary into Python-based text mining applications.\nThe applications for the lithological vocabulary and Python API are\nautomated semantic tagging of geochemical data and descriptions of drill cores,\nmachine learning of geochemical compositions that are diagnostic for lithological classifications, and\ntext mining for lithological concepts in reports and geological literature.\nThis combination of applications can be used to identify anomalies in databases, where composition and lithological classification do not match. It can also be used to identify lithological concepts in the literature and infer quantitative values. The resulting semantic tagging opens new possibilities for linking these diverse sources of data.",

            "abstract": "Recently, Zhang et al. (2014, Pure and Appiled Geophysics) have developed a joint inversion code incorporating body-wave arrival times and surface-wave dispersion data. The joint inversion code was based on the regional-scale version of the double-difference tomography algorithm tomoDD. The surface-wave inversion part uses the propagator matrix solver in the algorithm DISPER80 (Saito, 1988) for forward calculation of dispersion curves from layered velocity models and the related sensitivities. The application of the joint inversion code to the SAFOD site in central California shows that the fault structure is better imaged in the new model, which is able to fit both the body-wave and surface-wave observations adequately.\nHere we present a new joint inversion method that solves the model in the wavelet domain constrained by sparsity regularization. Compared to the previous method, it has the following advantages:\n(1) The method is both data- and model-adaptive. For the velocity model, it can be represented by different wavelet coefficients at different scales, which are generally sparse. By constraining the model wavelet coefficients to be sparse, the inversion in the wavelet domain can inherently adapt to the data distribution so that the model has higher spatial resolution in the good data coverage zone. Fang and Zhang (2014, Geophysical Journal International) have showed the superior performance of the wavelet-based double-difference seismic tomography method compared to the conventional method.\n(2) For the surface wave inversion, the joint inversion code takes advantage of the recent development of direct inversion of surface wave dispersion data for 3-D variations of shear wave velocity without the intermediate step of phase or group velocity maps (Fang et al., 2014, Geophysical Journal International). A fast marching method is used to compute, at each period, surface wave traveltimes and ray paths between sources and receivers.\nWe will test the new joint inversion code at the SAFOD site to compare its performance over the previous code. We will also select another fault zone such as the San Jacinto Fault Zone to better image its structure.",

            "abstract": "The Taranaki-Ruapehu Line (TRL) is a geophysical boundary that runs east-west adjacent to the southern end of arc-volcanism in New Zealand. The TRL is defined by gravity, magnetotelluric, and seismic attenuation observations, which may be related to a proposed Moho “step”, yet the geometry of this step is not well constrained. Here we present an improved image of the Moho interface across the TRL, assembled from teleseismic receiver functions at 8 new temporary and 2 regional seismic stations, which augment a network of 7 temporary stations originally used to image the step. A total of 790 receiver functions from 17 stations and 281 earthquakes were arranged into geographical bins, then stacked to form a north-south Common Conversion Point (CCP) profile 130 km long and approximately centered on the TRL. Consistent with previous investigators, 2D velocity effects from basin sediments and station elevation are compensated for with a static time shift of the receiver functions, which were first rotated into the LQT (i.e. P-SV-SH) domain. Ray tracing and pre-stack depth migration then operated on a simple 1D velocity model. The new 17 station CCP profile compares favorably with the original 7 station profile; the extra data density improves attenuation of P multiples and results in noticeably clearer Ps converted phases along the profile, including better delineation of the previously identified crustal step where the Ps conversion deepens from ~25 km to ~35 km over a distance of several kilometers. Synthetic receiver functions have also been calculated for station-event pairs and formed into CCP stacks, and we assess the potential of synthetics as an interpretational tool for a large change in crustal thickness over a relatively short distance. We hypothesize that such a change in Moho depth may be related to dynamic mantle instabilities, such as subduction interaction at depth or a Rayleigh-Taylor instability, both of which have been proposed to occur in the vicinity of this study area.",

            "abstract": "Understanding sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2 is important to estimate the impact of CO2 on climate change and environment. Although surface CO2 sources and sinks in Asia affect the global carbon cycle considerably, the atmospheric CO2 observation network is sparse in Asia. Due to the sparse observations in Asia, the estimated surface CO2 fluxes in the Eurasian Boreal region differ considerably depending on the inversion systems used in the estimation. In this study, to investigate the effect of additional CO2 observations in the Eurasian Boreal region on the surface carbon flux analysis in the globe and Asia, two experiments using different observation data set were performed with CarbonTracker developed in NOAA. One experiment was conducted using a data set that includes additional observations of Siberian tower measurement data (Japan-Russia Siberian Tall Tower Inland Observation Network: JR-STATION) and data observed in China and India, and the other experiment was conducted using a data set without the above additional observations.\nGlobal balance of the source and sink of surface CO2 fluxes was maintained for both experiments with and without additional observations. While the magnitude of the optimized surface CO2 flux uptake in Siberia was decreased for the experiment with the additional observations, the magnitude of the optimized surface CO2 flux uptake in Western Europe and North America was increased. This result implies that the impact of the Siberian observation data is as large as other continuous measurements (e.g., tower measurements in North America). The average RMSE and bias of the model CO2 concentrations calculated using the optimized CO2 flux exhibited better agreement with the observed CO2 concentrations when the additional observations were used, which implies that the additional observations provide beneficial impact on the surface CO2 flux analysis in Asia.",

            "abstract": "We collected 23,940 tangential broadband regional seismic records with their ray paths cross the Tibetan plateau. The waveforms are selected based on criteria that these earthquakes were located in the crust, with magnitudes ranging 3.5-6.6, and epicentral distances 200-2000 km. We extract Sn waveforms using a 0.7 km/s group-velocity window around the IASP91 arrival times, and collect the noise in an equal-length time window before the first arriving P wave. By correcting Sn spectra with the noise, we obtain the source-station amplitudes between 0.05 and 10.0 Hz. Both dual- and single-station data are used in the joint inversion for the Sn Q distribution and Sn-wave excitation functions. The wave paths are calculated using the CRUST1.0 model, and the source radiation patterns are obtained from the Harvard CMT. Strong Sn attenuations are observed in the Tibetan plateau, particularly in its northern part, which are correlated with strong Lg wave attenuations in this area. The part of the Tibetan plateau with elevations above 4,000 m has an average Sn Q of 210. On the contrast, regions surrounding the Tibetan plateau are mostly characterized by high Q values except for Yungui plateau, where a relatively low Q of 203 is observed. The dynamic processes of plateau formation are accompanied by strong thermal activities. The temperature variations affect both material rheology and seismic velocity and attenuation. Thus, seismic attenuations may serve as indicators for material flow. We use attenuation data to constrain the flow pattern in the low crust and uppermost mantle. Combining the Lg- and Sn-wave Q models with other geophysical data, a lower-crustal flow channel is found from north Tibet to east and then towards the southeast along the western edge of the rigid Sichuan basin.

            "abstract": "The westward-tilted Kivu rift in East Africa is bounded by the ~100 km-long, seismically active West Kivu border fault, and dammed at its northern end by flows from the Virunga Volcanic Province. Earlier work delineated faults along the basin margins, but little was known of active faults beneath Lake Kivu, and the lithospheric structure was unexplored. The aims of this study are to determine the kinematics of normal faults and their relation to pre-existing basement structures; to examine the locations of earthquakes with respect to faults in order to delineate zones of active faulting; to evaluate models for the modification of lithosphere by extension and mantle plume processes using seismic shear wave splitting measurements; and to evaluate the role of volcanic loading within the Virunga volcanic province on the evolution of the Kivu basin. We determine rift fault and volcanic fissure locations and orientations using merged high-resolution CHIRP bathymetric and Space Radar Topography Mission data. The majority of faults in the northern sector strike NNE, whereas NE faults are equally important in the southern basin, marking the Kivu-Rusizi accommodation zone. Seismic data was acquired from an 8-station array deployed between March 2012 and April 2013. Although the majority of earthquakes beneath the rift (excluding the active volcanoes) occur at depths of 8-20 km, unusually shallow earthquakes (2-4 km) are located along submerged faults within the East Kivu basin and suggest high pore pressures within the upper crust. Using simple elastic plate flexure model calculations we estimate the maximum deflection of the plate to be ~7 km, using an effective elastic thickness of ~7.5 km. We propose that the rapid subsidence of the ~400 m deep northern Kivu basin occurred in response to volcanic construction. We evaluate models for the modification of lithosphere using shear wave splitting measurements. Splitting results with backazimuths ranging from 88˚ – 98˚ and 240˚ - 286˚ showed fast polarization directions in close agreement with the apparent plate motion (330˚), while results ranging from 32˚ - 48˚ have fast polarization directions consistent with the magmatic fabric of the Eastern Kivu Province (NE), suggesting that fluid flow associated with mantle plume processes have modified the lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Geomorphic and geodetic measurements of coseismic ground surface displacement due to the 2012 Mw=7.6 Nicoya, Costa Rica Earthquake are unprecedented datasets due to their proximal location relative to the megathrust seismogenic zone. This unique situation presents an opportunity for in-depth analysis of the plate interface geometry on which the earthquake occurred, and the surface displacement data that constrain coseismic slip models. Estimated coseismic slip on a strike-and-dip variant surface based on the USGS Slab1.0 model yielded a Mw=7.7 earthquake, producing 1.3x more moment than published values using dip-variant segmented planes. This is consistent with the depth contrast between Slab1.0 and the segmented planes, where the deeper surface geometry requires more slip to predict an equivalent amount of surface displacement. This result presents the possibility that the earthquake was larger than originally estimated, which has relevance to evaluating future seismic hazards and emphasizes the importance of considering the true plate interface geometry when estimating earthquake slip. \nDensely spaced geomorphic measurements of coseismic vertical displacement along the SW coast of the Nicoya Peninsula reveal local heterogeneities in deformation not captured by sparser geodetic data. Model-predicted vertical displacements better fit the geomorphic data as compared to the geodetic data, both in the context of spatial distribution and magnitude. This signifies that the slip distribution models using a strike-and-dip variant plate interface geometry can successfully fit local heterogeneities revealed by an independent dataset. This research has relevance to both Nicoya seismicity and earthquake research worldwide, as large-scale and interdisciplinary analysis of these unprecedented data provides insight into how we model earthquakes and analyze their hazards.",

For this case study we employed a source fault model proposed by HERP (2012) for future M9-class event in the Nankai trough. Velocity structure is 3-D JIVSM model developed for long-period ground motion simulations. The target site OSKH02 “Konohana” is located in center of the Osaka basin. Green's functions for large number of sub-sources (>1000) were calculated by FDM using the reciprocity approach. Depths, strike and dip angles of sub-sources are adjusted to the shape of upper boundary of the Philippine Sea plate. The target period range is 4-20sec. Strongly nonuniform distribution of peak amplitudes of Green's functions is observed (see Figure), and two areas have anomalously large amplitudes: (1) a large along-strike elongated area just south of Kii peninsula and (2) a similar area south of Kii peninsula but shifted toward the Nankai trough. Elongation of the first anomaly fits well 10-15km isolines of the depth distribution of the Philippine Sea plate, while target site is located in the direction perpendicular to these isolines. For this reason, preliminarily we suppose that plate shape may have critical effect on the simulated ground motions, via a cumulative effect of sub-source radiation patterns and specific strike and dip angle distributions. Analysis of the time delay of the peak arrivals at OKSH02 demonstrates that Green’s functions from the second anomaly, located in shallow part of plate boundary, are mostly composed of surface waves.",

Here we examine possible localized tidal triggering of earthquakes near Japan, including time periods before and after the 2010 Mw 9.1 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Ideally studies of possible tidal triggering of earthquakes should compute the tidal stresses on the earthquake faults to establish directly when earthquakes should be encouraged and discouraged. However, because event catalogs typically only include focal mechanisms for relatively large earthquakes, this prevents analysis of the much more numerous smaller events. Here we adopt the simpler approach of searching for non-random distributions of event times with respect to tidal phase, without establishing any explicit relationship to stress or the most likely tidal phase to promote triggering. Our method could fail to detect tidal triggering if a variety of focal mechanisms are present in a region, which trigger at different times during the tidal cycle. However, because nearby events typically have similar focal mechanisms, it is likely that sufficiently localized regions will show clear peaks in occurrence time phase if tidal triggering is present. We examine 74610 earthquakes of M ≥ 3 from the JMA catalog from Jan. 2000 to Apr. 2013. We experiment by dividing the data into cells with a range of spatial (0.2, 1.0, 1.5) and temporal dimensions (100, 200, 400 days). We compute p-values using Schuster's test applied to the distribution of events times with respect to both semidiurnal and semimonthly tidal phase. Because these p-values may be biased by temporal earthquake clustering (e.g., aftershock sequences), we apply two different declustering methods, including that of Reasenberg [1985] and an approach that retains only one event per tidal cycle per phase increment. Our results show a wide range of p-values for the localized earthquake bins, but the number of bins with very small p-values (e.g., p ≤ 0.05) is no more than might be expected due to random chance.",

            "abstract": "The American Climate Prospectus (ACP), the technical analysis underlying the Risky Business project, quantitatively assessed the economic risks posed to the United States by six categories of climate change impacts: crop yield, energy demand, coastal storm damage, criminal activity, labor productivity, and mortality [1]. At a national level, measured by impact on gross domestic product, increased mortality and decreased labor productivity pose the large risks, followed by increased energy demand and coastal damages. Changes in crop yield and crime have smaller impacts.\nThe ACP was not intended to conduct a benefit-cost analysis of climate change mitigation. It assessed the economic consequences of future impacts on an economy with a structure equivalent to that of the current economy, not accounting for socio-economic development and adaptation, and did not assess the cost of mitigation. One of its primary goals was to inform adaptation decisions that are conventionally considered 'endogenous' in economic analyses of climate change. Nonetheless, its results provide insight into the potential of mitigation to manage climate risk.\nDifferences between RCP 8.5 (moderately-high business-as-usual emissions), RCP 4.5 (moderate mitigation) and RCP 2.6 (extremely strong mitigation) are not apparent until mid-century and become significant only late in the century. For all impacts except coastal damages, mitigation significantly reduces uncertainty in late-century impact estimates. Nationally, mitigation significantly and monotonically reduces median projected labor productivity losses and violent crime.\nSwitching from RCP 8.5 to RCP 4.5 also significantly reduces median projections of mortality and energy demand, but the domestic value to the U.S. of further mitigation to RCP 2.6 is less clear. The marginal benefits decline in part because some regions of the country (especially the Northwest) may experience increased crop yields, reduced mortality, and reduced energy demand under all RCPs. Because of the slow response time of sea level to change in emissions, the coastal risk reduction in the current century from mitigation is least clear.\n",

            "abstract": "Increasing river discharge to the Arctic Ocean is a very significant change in the Arctic system. Increase in surface temperature in the Arctic over the past decades was exceptionally higher in the history of arctic observations. The increased temperature resulted in changes in ice freezing and melting and water temperature in Arctic rivers. However, there are significant knowledge gaps in our understanding of the river-ice dynamics and river water temperature. Therefore, we assessed changes in ice sheet thickness, the timing of ice freezing and melting, and water temperature in Arctic major rivers during the period 1979–2009, based on observations and a hydrological model. The model can estimate ice thickness and water temperature using air temperature, snow depth, and river discharge. The calculated ice thickness and water temperature were compared with observations, showing generally significant correlations. The observed and calculated maximum ice thickness indicated decreasing trends at the outlet and inner points of rivers. The timing of ice breakup was also advanced. These changes were mostly significant during the recent three decades when the increase in air temperature was significant. The model also estimated increasing water temperatures, which is consistent with the observations. The warming of water temperature suggests influences on heat budget in the Arctic Ocean. This study validated the applicability for river-ice calculation of the hydrological model, and the model simulation provided useful information relating to the changing river-ice environments in the Arctic rivers.",

            "abstract": "Brackish tidal shrimp ponds, traditionally referred to as gei wais, have been constructed along coastal areas in many parts of the world. The regular exchange of pond water with the surrounding coastal environment is important as it brings shrimp larvae and nutrients, etc. into and out of the pond. Such a water exchange can reduce the quality of the receiving waters; though there are opposing views recently because farming practices are becoming more sustainable while other sources of pollutions in the surroundings are increasing. This project monitors the water quality of a tidal shrimp pond and its receiving water at high temporal resolution. The pond is located within the wetland complex of Mai Po Nature Reserve in Hong Kong, China. Water quality parameters (i.e., dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, pH, water depth and chlorophyll) were recorded at 15-minute interval from December 2013 to March 2014 within the pond and also at its receiving water which is a water channel within a mangrove forest. Data reveals both daily and fortnightly fluctuations. Daily variations in mangrove correspond to both tidal flushing and insolation, whereas those within the pond correspond mainly to insolation. For example, dissolved oxygen in mangrove shows two peaks daily which correlate with tidal elevation, and that within the pond shows only one peak which correlates with sunlight. Dissolved oxygen within the pond also shows a fortnightly pattern that corresponds to the schedule of water exchange. Such high temporal resolution of monitoring reveals the two-way water quality influences between the pond and the mangrove. It sheds insights that can possibly lead to refinement of water exchange practice and water sampling schedule given the temporal variations of the water quality both inside and outside the pond. It thus enables us to take a step closer in adopting more sustainable farming practices despite increasing pollution in the surrounding areas. ",

            "abstract": "With higher temperatures increasing extreme rainfall intensities are predicted. However, as rainfall is highly variable spatially and temporally trends in historical records are often difficult to identify. Instead studies focus on developing statistical relationships between meteorological variables which have an underlying physical relationship. For example, studies have exploited the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship by linking rainfall intensity to temperature. This relationship is then used to predict extreme rainfall intensities for a future warmer climate.\nUsing sub-daily and daily rainfall data throughout Australia (which represents good spatial and temporal coverage across all dominant climatic zones in the world) we extend this logic to spatial and temporal attributes of rainfall. By separating the change in storm shape, both temporally and spatially, from the change in storm volume, we find that storms are intensifying with increasing temperatures. As a result, consistent changes are being noticed in their temporal and spatial patterns, required inputs for design flood estimation. It is also shown that for a warmer climate, storms are likely to have characteristics which result in floods with shorter durations and greater flood peaks.",

            "abstract": "Assessing the influence of climate forcing on streamflow, and how it varies from place to place is an important component of catchment hydrology. A great number of studies have explored this issue analytically or empirically. One widely used framework is the Budyko curve, which describes catchments by the partition of precipitation between flow and evapotranspiration at annual scale. Both climate change and human activities such as water management and land use have important effects on the seasonal water balance. However, with the increased complexity of soil water storage change at seasonal scale, more research is needed to extend the Budyko framework for the intra-annual relationship between climate and streamflow. In this study, we extended the equation quantifying the propagation of variability from climate to runoff at annual scale to monthly scale. Besides the aridity index (AI), the variance ratio between soil storage change and precipitation as well as the covariance among the soil water storage, precipitation and evapotranspiration could also play significant roles in intra-annual variability. The new equation was then applied to 232 catchments across the continental US for validation. The calculated variance ratio and the observed variance ratio of runoff and precipitation agree reasonably well. The new relationship suggested that when the intra-annual variability in precipitation is larger, the amount of intra-annual variability propagating to streamflow is dominated by the annual AI. When the variability in precipitation is small, the interaction between soil water storage and climate has to be taken into account, which may be also related to the vegetation type. This new analytical framework will improve the understanding of the close interactions between climate, soil, vegetation and topography at the catchment scale, and has the potential to facilitate the parameterization of coupled ecological and hydrological processes in the land surface and earth system models.",

            "abstract": "Clouds have greenhouse effects that prevent cooling of ground surface and lower atmosphere by absorbing terrestrial infrared radiation, along with cooling effects by blocking the solar radiation. Those effects play an important role in determining the Earth's radiative energy budget which varies regionally and seasonally. Especially, in cloud-resolving scale, complex geometry and inhomogeneity of clouds affect significantly on three dimensional radiative energy budget of the solar and terrestrial radiation. Modeling of three-dimensional radiative processes and its spatial-scale characteristics is key issues for reliable simulations of cloud-resolving system.\nIn this study, three-dimensional atmospheric radiative transfer model has been developed for the purpose of evaluating the cloud-resolving radiation budget. Broadband calculations covering solar and terrestrial radiations are required for the reliable estimates of radiative energy budget. In addition, multiple-scattering, absorption, and emission effects should be taken into account properly to radiative transfer process. Those requirements to radiative transfer model tend to make it complicated and time-consuming scheme. Monte Carlo method has been employed as a basic scheme in this study because the method is easily applicable to complex three-dimensional system rather than explicit analytical radiative transfer scheme. Especially, the dependent sampling approach enables simultaneous calculations at multi-wavelength, which is suitable to both broad- and narrow-band calculation based on the correlated-k distribution method. The Monte Carlo radiative transfer model was applied to cloud scenes calculated by large eddy simulation model, and cloud-resolving radiative energy budgets were estimated for several different spatial-scales. Performance of the Monte Carlo radiative transfer model and the spatial-scale characteristics of three dimensional radiation effects will be discussed from the point of view of cloud-resolving radiation budget.",

The results show that the blocking frequency of Atlantic was the highest in the three regions of NH, while that of the eastern Europe-Asia was the lowest. From the aspect of blocking intensity, it is revealed that the strong blocking all exhibited decreased trend over the three regions, especially in the Atlantic, where weak blocking increased slightly. The increased trend for long duration (≥13 days) NH blocking were insignificant from 1968-2000. However, long duration NH blocking presented remarkable increase since 2000. A decrease of short duration blocking frequency was only found in Atlantic region. In addition, long duration blocking contributed 25% for the strong blocking in Atlantic region, whilst 14% for Pacific blocking region. It was found that the increased probability was accompanied by the enhanced intensity of blocking. Different blocking intensity and duration yielded a significant difference on temperature. Negative anomaly of the temperature difference between the more long duration blocking years and the fewer long duration blocking years were mainly in the mid-low latitude regions, while it showed positive anomaly temperature in high latitudes. Comparison with strong blocking, the influence of long duration blocking on temperature were more remarkable over the Atlantic and Pacific regions. ",

An ultra high-resolution water isotope record from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide (WAIS Divide) Ice Core Project has been developed with three key water isotope parameters that offer insight into this debate: δD, δ18O, and deuterium excess (dxs). δD and δ18O are a proxy for local temperature and regional atmospheric circulation, while dxs is primarily a proxy for sea surface temperature at the ice core’s moisture source(s) (relative humidity and wind speed also play a role). We build on past studies that show West Antarctic climate is modulated by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection mechanisms, which originate in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, to infer how past ENSO changes may have influenced abrupt climate change. Using frequency analysis of the water isotope data, we can reconstruct the amplitude of ENSO-scale climate oscillations in the 2-15 year range within temporal windows as low as 100 years. Our analysis uses a back diffusion model that estimates initial amplitudes before decay in the firn column. We combine δD, δ18O, and dxs frequency analysis to evaluate how climate variability at WAIS Divide is influenced by tropical climate forcing. Our results should ultimately offer insight into the role of the tropics in abrupt climate change.",

            "abstract": "We present SKS splitting measurements for the first two years of data collected by the Cascadia Initiative (CI) amphibious array. Our analysis includes observations from over 100 ocean bottom seismometers (OBS), as well as 31 onshore stations, and spans both the Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates. The CI dataset is unique in that it includes several regions that can distinctly influence anisotropic fabric development such as: the upwelling mantle beneath the Juan de Fuca and Gorda ridges, the young evolving oceanic lithosphere of the plate interior, the Blanco transform fault, and the Cascadia subduction zone. For the first time, we are able to analyze these regions with a single dataset, and using a common methodology. Splitting measurements are routinely done on land sites, but have been completed on relatively few OBS stations. This is largely due to the low signal to noise present in OBS data, which can obscure the splitting results. To address that nearly all the OBS data exceeds the global high noise limit at the frequencies used for splitting, we implement a rigorous quality control scheme. Our method specifically takes into account the response of common splitting methods to high noise data and addresses known issues such as cycle skipping, false minima, low transverse energy, and near-null measurements. Individual measurements are filtered at 0.03-0.1 Hz, manually checked for quality, and stacked. Preliminary results show trench perpendicular onshore measurements consistent with previous studies. Oceanic measurements in the plate interior show a coherent fast axis roughly aligned with absolute plate motion. Several measurements near the ridge and trench appear to be rotated in the ridge and trench parallel directions. Continuing work will integrate splitting measurements from the final two years of the CI with these findings, which will be used to characterize the ridge-to-trench mantle flow across the Juan de Fuca plate system.",

Irrigation, which plays an important role in agricultural production, occupies the largest share of human consumptive water use in the basin. Given increasing water demands, the basin faces acute water scarcity. Previous studies have suggested that decrease in irrigation water availability under climate change might have an overall adverse impact on the food production of the basin. The timing and area that would face severe water stress are yet to be identified. We used a land surface hydrological model forced with the bias-corrected climatic variables from 5 climate models under 4 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to estimate total water availability in the sub-basins of the Yellow River basin. The future socioeconomic conditions, the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), were used to estimate the water requirement in the nonagricultural water use sectors. The irrigation water availability was estimated from the total water availability and nonagricultural water use, and the irrigation water demands were estimated based on the current irrigation project efficiencies. The timing and area of irrigation water shortage were shown and the implication of change in irrigation water availability on food production was assessed. The results show that the sub-basins with high population density and gross domestic product (GDP) are likely to confront severe water stress and reduction in food production earlier because irrigation water was to be appropriated by the rapid increase in nonagricultural water use sectors. The study stresses the need for adaptive management of water to balance agriculture and nonagricultural demands in northern China.",

            "abstract": "The Mitchell Creek Landslide of northwestern British Columbia is a large structurally controlled bedrock instability, with an estimated volume of 75 Mm3. It has developed over the last 60 years in response to rapid deglaciation, offering insight into changing conditions at juvenile rock landslides. The landslide is located in altered volcanic & volcaniclastic rocks of the Stikine Terrane at the intersection of two major regional faults. Multiple failure mechanisms have been identified over the 0.8 km2 landslide area including toppling along steep foliation in the lower landslide and sliding along a well-defined rupture surface in the upper landslide. Geomorphological and engineering geological assessments have been completed at the site to characterize landslide properties and behaviour. Historic aerial photographs have been used to observe changes to the slope since 1956 and have captured the onset of surface deformation. Mapping of morphological and deformation features were undertaken on imagery from 1956, 1972, 1992, and 2010 to evaluate slope processes, failure mechanisms, and damage accumulation within the slope. Natural targets were also used to estimate landslide displacements over the past 60 years. Annual movement rates have been estimated to range from 0.1 to 0.8 m/yr over the landslide area. Displacement rates have been compared with historic glacial levels in the valley and modern environmental monitoring. A reconstruction of pre-failure geometry of the landslide was created from displacement estimates and structural geologic information. Rock mass properties and discontinuity orientations have been assessed from geotechnical investigations carried out between 2008 and 2013. A conceptual model of landslide behaviour and evolution has been developed and evaluated using both continuum and discontinuum numerical modeling techniques.",

            "abstract": "We recently discovered a material, aqueous dispersions of colloidal nanoparticles, whose rheology depends strongly on solid particle fraction fp, being Newtonian at low fp, and presenting yield stress, shear thinning, elasticity, and brittle properties as fp increases. Moreover, the rheology is time-dependent, with shear stress causing damage, which can heal due to electrostatic interactions between the colloidal particles. The competition between damage and healing results in long-term weak zones. Such a behaviour is analogue to the rheology of mantle rocks as temperature decreases.\nWe therefore undertake a systematic laboratory study of convection in such fluids, where the system is continuously cooled and dried from above and heated or not from below. As the dispersion is dried, a skin (\"lithosphere\") forms at the surface on the convective fluid, and instabilities develop on several scales as shear bands (0.01 mm-scale), folds (mm-scale), fractures (0.1-10 mm-scale), small-scale convection (cm-scale) and plates (2-20 cm-scale). The system always describes several dynamic regimes through time: an initially very soft lithosphere would result in a stagnant lid regime of convection, which can then evolve in episodic and/or partial subduction, sometimes continuous plate tectonics, and finally stagnant lid. Regime diagrams will be presented as a function of the effective rheology of lithosphere. This \"effective\" rheology depends on the cascade of instabilities at smaller scales, thanks to which it is much weaker than the material properties measured on small samples.",

            "abstract": "We tried to constrain lunar internal structure by combining the Apollo seismic travel time data and selenodetic data including those from GRAIL and LLR. We used a seven-layer model consisting of crust, upper mantle, middle mantle, lower mantle, low-velocity layer (LVL), fluid outer core and solid inner core. The model is constrained by the following observations; three selenodetic data of mass, mean moment of inertia, tidal Love number k2 from [1], and Apollo seismic travel time data from [2]. Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used to infer the model parameters. We collected 140 million samples from 10 chains. Viscosity is not taken into account in this calculation. Mean crustal thickness of 46 ± 4 km is estimated by fitting a normal distribution curve to the posterior distribution, which is to be compared with the previous estimate of 34 - 43 km [3]. Major part of crustal densities is sampled between 2500 and 2600 kg/m3, which is consistent with the value of 2550 kg/m3 reported by [3]. In general, seismic wave velocities in the mantle are consistent with the previous estimates [4][5]. The ranges of size and density of the outer core which satisfy the observation are relatively wide and it is difficult to tightly constrain them. Strong correlation between outer core size and LVL thickness is observed. The smaller outer core should be accompanied by thick LVL and vice versa. When we take into account the upper bound of the fluid core size of 400 km which is predicted by magnetic observation [6], the thickness of the LVL is at least about 100 km. The S-wave velocity within this low-velocity layer is estimated to be less than about 3 km/s. The effect of low viscosity [7] may change the estimate of the S-wave velocity in the LVL. The inner core radius is expected to be smaller than 280 km. The lunar displacement Love number is predicted to be h2= 0.0423 ± 0.0004.\n",

            "abstract": "The northern margin of the South China Sea (SCS) has particular characteristics compared with typical passive margins. Several tectonic movements and volcanic activities have happened in the SCS and resulted in diverse structures along its northern margin. Based on several crustal-scale, high-resolution, multi-channel seismic reflection profiles and satellite gravity data across the northern SCS margin, this paper analyses the structures, volcanoes and deep crust of the continent-ocean transition zone (COT) at the mid-northern margin of the SCS to study the pattern and extension model of the SCS.\nGravity modelling revealed that a stepped crustal thinning occurs across the COT and a High Velocity Layer (HVL) with 0.8-6 km thick is located in the slope below the lower crust. Results show that the COT close to the Dongsha uplift is characterized by a syn-rift depression and structural highs with igneous rocks bounded by seamounts seaward. Farther west, the COT shows a zone including syn-rift depressions, structural high with igneous sills, volcanic zone, and tilted fault blocks bounded by normal fault seaward. Reflector T60 may represent an important unconformity in Pearl River Mouth Basin indicating a delayed rift in the northern SCS margin related to a ridge jump in 23.8 Ma.\nOur study delineates an extent of HVL just located in the eastern portion of the northern SCS margin based on the geophysical data. The non-coupling of the spatial extent between HVL and COT shows that the HVL may not be a necessary sign of the COT at the northern SCS margin. The magmatic intrusions and HVL may result from post-rifting underplating due to the partial melting from lithospheric extension and the passive mantle/asthenospheric upwelling.\nThis study proposed an intermediate rifting mode to explain the mid-northern margin of the SCS which is closer to the magma-poor margins than volcanic margins.",

            "abstract": "The Northeast Japan (NEJ) arc has experienced strong extension in Early to Middle Miocene time and contractive deformation since Pliocene time. We determined the amounts of the Miocene extension and Pliocene contraction along four transects across the back-arc region of NEJ arc by area-balancing restoration using seismic reflection, gravity, and surface geologic data. We found that the Miocene extension is as much as 31–56 km while the Pliocene-Quaternary contraction is only 10–15 km. The style of the Miocene extension in the back-arc region of NEJ is highly asymmetric; the zone of concentrated extension (mainly along the Japan Sea margin) is characterized by a breakaway fault on the west, a rollover basement anticline on the east, and abnormally deep (∼10 km) basins and strongly rotated fault blocks in between, suggesting the existence of a large-scale detachment fault at a mid-crustal level beneath the extended zone. We suggest that the Pliocene-Quaternary contractive surface deformation in the back-arc region of NEJ, which is represented by fault-bend folds and fault-propagation folds in rift basins, resulted principally from positive tectonic inversion using the same detachment fault at a mid-crustal depth.\nAlthough the strong Pliocene-Quaternary contraction has occurred mainly in the NEJ’s back-arc, week deformation has occurred also in the NEJ’s forearc, suggesting that the underlying detachment fault has propagated eastward beneath the forearc. To reveal more details of crustal extension and shorting of NEJ arc, it is necessary to estimate the amounts of extension and shortening of the inland area and forearc side precisely. In this presentation, we will demonstrate the tectonic evolution in the back-arc region of Northeast Japan since Miocene time, with recent results of seismic reflection surveys in the inland area and forearc side of NEJ.",

            "abstract": "The Late Cretaceous-Eocene granitoids and mafic rocks are widely exposed in the Motuo tectono-magmatic belt (southeast Lhasa terrane). LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating shows that the granitoids have magma crystallization ages of 83 and 71-45 Ma, and the mafic rocks have magma crystallization ages of 69-50 Ma. The 83 Ma granitoids exhibit adakitic characteristics (high Sr/Y ratios) and display weakly evolved Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic composition (whole-rock ISr=0.7060 to 0.7065, εNd(t)=-3.0 to -0.3, and zircon εHf(t)=-4.2) . The 71-45 Ma granitoids have slightly variable Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic composition (whole-rock ISr=0.7056 to 0.7100, εNd(t)=-4.0 to +3.0, and zircon εHf(t)=-4.0 to +10.8). The chemical composition of the mafic rocks is comparable with low-MgO high-alumina basalts to basaltic andesites. These mafic rocks also have weakly evolved Sr-Nd-Hf composition (whole-rock ISr=0.7064 to 0.7086, εNd(t)=-3.4 to +1.2, and zircon εHf(t)=-3.8 to +6.4). Whole-rock geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic and zircon Hf isotopic data suggest that the 83 Ma adakitic granitoids were derived from partial melting of over-thickened lower crust, the 71-45 Ma granitoids result from diverse magma sources including both juvenile and reworked mature crustal materials, and the mafic rocks were derived from partial melting of metasomatised lithospheric mantle. Our compilation of new and published data from the eastern Lhasa terrane granitoids show a marked variation in Sr/Y ratios and a step change in Sr-Nd isotope compositions during the Late Cretaceous. Besides, a synthesis of available whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopic data on lithospheric mantle-derived basalts provides an insight into the different secular evolution of the lithospheric mantle beneath the central part and the eastern part of the southern Lhasa terrane. In the central part of the southern Lhasa terrane, the Paleocene to Eocene basaltic rocks exhibit variable Sr-Nd isotopic composition. However, Sr-Nd isotopic composition of the Motuo Late Cretaceous-Eocene mafic rocks argue that they were derived from partial melting of an relatively homogeneous and depleted lithospheric mantle. We propose that the Late Cretaceous delamination resulted in the replacement of ancient lithospheric mantle by the juvenile homogeneous lithospheric mantle in the eastern Lhasa terrane.",

This earthquake was a right lateral faulting on the nearly vertical Rokko fault trending in the NE-SW direction. Coseismic deformations were studied using campaign GPS, leveling and InSAR, but postseismic deformations have not been well investigated. Nakano and Hirahara (1997) and Kato et al. (1997) reported postseismic deformation detected by GPS up to 1996, while Ozawa et al. (2004) presented the results of the analysis of JERS-1 SAR images acquired during 1995 - 1998.\nWe reexamined postseismic deformation from the 1995 Kobe, Japan, earthquake using ERS/Envisat and JERS-1 SAR data. 14 ERS-1/2, 22 Envisat and 7 JERS-1 images acquired during 1992 to 2007 that cover the Kobe and northern Osaka areas were collected and analyzed. We applied 2-pass interferometry. We divided whole period into 5 intervals, preseismic, coseismic and 1995 - 2004 for ERS-1/2, 2003 - 2004 and 2004 - 2007 for Envisat, and stacked interferograms during each period.\nWe found that rapid subsidence in a wedge shaped region near the northeastern tip of the source fault. This wedge shaped area is bounded by two active faults; the Arima-Takatsuki fault on the north side, and the Rokko fault on the other side. This deformation is already pointed out by Ozawa et al. (2004). It is noteworthy that this subsidence is not clear in the preseismic interferogram, which implies the Kobe earthquake may have triggered this subsidence. Considering the shape of subsided region, the configuration of basement structure is closely related to the deformation, while it is difficult to explain any model of simple afterslip or viscoelastic relaxation with the assumption of homogeneous structure. This subsidence decayed slowly and became less clear after 2007 according our previous study using ALOS/PALSAR.\nFurthermore there are two spots of further rapid subsidence of > 10 mm/yr in this region. These two spots are located in the old river terraces, while the Osaka plain is covered with marine sediments. Our previous study with ALOS/PALSAR showed that the subsidence at these spots still continues up to 2010. This infers the difference in surface geology affects the postseismic deformation siginificantly.",

            "abstract": "Biofuel crops in high temperature environments, e.g, sorghum in southern California, USA, have a high capacity to assimilate atmospheric CO2. Photosynthates from the canopy may provide extra labile carbon source to feed soil microorganisms and influence trace gas fluxes, including CO2, N2O and NOx. Understanding how soil microorganisms balance the carbon (energy) and nitrogen (nutrients) allocation between growing microbial biomass and respiration is critical for evaluating the GHG emissions and emissions of regional air quality pollutants. We conducted experiments in a high temperature agroecosystem both in fallow and sorghum production fields with an experimental nitrogen gradient (0,50 and 100 kg/ha, marked as control, low and high with triplicate repeat) to investigate the CO2, N2O and NOx flux responses. All gas fluxes were measured simultaneously from three replicate locations for each treatment in the field biweekly. Measurements were performed 2-5 days after irrigation. We found that planting sorghum has significant effects on soil CO2 (p<0.0001), N2O (p<0.0001) and NOx (p=0.04) fluxes, but nitrogen amendments only have marginally significant effects on CO2 flux (p=0.07). Surprisingly, no significant response of N2O (p=0.27) and NOx (p=0.61) were observed in responses to N amendments. Compared to the fallow field, the CO2 flux in sorghum field increased 77%, 134% and 202% in control, low and high N level amendments, respectively. N2O flux from the sorghum field are consistently higher than from fallow field, with 207%, 174% and 1064% increase in control, low and high N level amendments, respectively. For the NOx flux, no significant difference was found between fallow and sorghum field. Although nitrogen amendments did not show significant effects on CO2, N2O and NOx flux, the high N treatment in sorghum field continuously gains the highest flux rates. Our results suggested additional C inputs may be an important factor regulating CO2, N2O and NOx fluxes in high temperature agroecosystems.",

            "abstract": "We investigate spreading pathways of basal meltwater released from all Antarctic ice shelves using a circumpolar coupled ice shelf-sea ice-ocean model that reproduces major features of the Southern Ocean circulation, including the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Several independent virtual tracers are used to identify detailed pathways of basal meltwaters. The spreading pathways of the meltwater tracers depend on formation sites because the meltwaters are transported by local ambient ocean circulation. Meltwaters from ice shelves in the Weddell and Amundsen--Bellingshausen Seas in surface/subsurface layers are effectively advected to lower latitudes with the ACC. Although a large portion of the basal meltwaters is present in surface and subsurface layers, a part of the basal meltwaters penetrates into the bottom layer through active dense water formation along the Antarctic coastal margins. The signals at the seafloor extend along the topography, showing a horizontal distribution similar to the observed spreading of Antarctic Bottom Water. Meltwaters originating from ice shelves in the Weddell and Ross Seas and in the Indian sector significantly contribute to the bottom signals. A series of numerical experiments in which thermodynamic interaction between the ice shelf and ocean is neglected regionally demonstrates that the basal meltwater of each ice shelf impacts sea ice and/or ocean thermohaline circulation in the Southern Ocean.",

            "abstract": "There are clear variations in maximum earthquake magnitude among Earth’s subduction zones. These variations have been studied extensively and attributed to differences in tectonic properties in subduction zones, such as relative plate velocity and subducting plate age [Ruff and Kanamori, 1980]. In addition to maximum earthquake magnitude, the seismicity of medium to large earthquakes also differs among subduction zones, such as the b-value (i.e., the slope of the earthquake size distribution) and the frequency of seismic events. However, the casual relationship between the seismicity of medium to large earthquakes and subduction zone tectonics has been unclear. Here we divide Earth’s subduction zones into over 100 study regions following Ide [2013] and estimate b-values and the background seismicity rate—the frequency of seismic events excluding aftershocks—for subduction zones worldwide using the maximum likelihood method [Utsu, 1965; Aki, 1965] and the epidemic type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model [Ogata, 1988]. We demonstrate that the b-value varies as a function of subducting plate age and trench depth, and that the background seismicity rate is related to the degree of slab bending at the trench. Large earthquakes tend to occur relatively frequently (lower b-values) in shallower subduction zones with younger slabs, and more earthquakes occur in subduction zones with deeper trench and steeper dip angle. These results suggest that slab buoyancy, which depends on subducting plate age, controls the earthquake size distribution, and that intra-slab faults due to slab bending, which increase with the steepness of the slab dip angle, have influence on the frequency of seismic events, because they produce heterogeneity in plate coupling and efficiently inject fluid to elevate pore fluid pressure on the plate interface. This study reveals tectonic factors that control earthquake size distribution and seismicity rate, and these relationships between seismicity and tectonic properties may be useful for seismic risk assessment.",

            "abstract": "Rivers and aquifers are connected through the hyporheic zone (HZ). Pore water in the subsurface sediments is continuously exchanged with the overlying surface water. The exchange of water, mass and energy occurring along the surface-subsurface interface or within the HZ exerts a strong influence on the quality of both surface and subsurface waters, and fluvial ecology. Moreover, the HZ is rich in biologically active sediment, creating a favorable condition for microbially-facilitated reactions to occur, including organic carbon oxidation (aerobic respiration), nitrification, and denitrification. Inorganic N, especially NO3－, is of concern as a drinking water pollutant and as a cause for eutrophication that threatens ecosystems. The biogeochemical reactions in the HZ could produce or consume NO3－ and thus the HZ could serve a nitrate source or sink role in the fluvial system. In addition, hyporheic exchange across the sediment-water interface (SWI) leads to penetration of diel temperature cycles from the river, leading to dynamic HZ temperature pattern. This in turn affects biogeochemical reactions in the HZ. The main objective of this study is to integrate all the processes that occur along the SWI to understand how diurnal temperature variations affect the biogeochemical function of the HZ. We conducted numerical simulations of coupled turbulent open-channel fluid flow, porous fluid flow, porous heat transport and reactive solute transport to study feedbacks and coupling between these processes. We assumed sinusoidally varying diurnal temperature variations. We studied the effects of different mean temperatures and different amplitudes of the diurnal temperature variations on nitrate removal or production efficiency in the HZ. The simulation results show that the average temperature effect on the HZ nitrate source-sink functionality and its associated efficiency has strong dependence on the [NO3-]/[NH4+ ] ratio in the river. However, the effects of the amplitude of temperature variations on over-all nitrate removal and production efficiency is very small.",

            "abstract": "Various types of a landslide, such as a deep-seated landslide, a shallow landslide, and a debris flow, exist. And the risk and the damage area of a landslide change greatly with the types. Therefore it is very important to guess the type of a landslide generated in the future, in order to decrease the damage of a landslide. In this research, I investigated and studied the landslide disaster which occurred in the typhoon No.12 disaster in 2011 and the northern Kyusyu-island heavy rain disaster 2012, in Japan. The purpose of the study presumes the types of a landslide generated in the future by analyzing geographical and geological features.\nMany deep-seated landslides and shallow landslides (debris flows) occurred by the typhoon No.12, 2011 in Japan. The precipitation exceeds 1,800 mm in four days in part regionally. Landslides occurred frequently in the Totsukawa area (Northern part) and Nachi-Katsuura area (Southern part), both area were the precipitation of about 1000 mm in four days. In the Totsukawa area, deep-seated landslides occurred frequently, and in Nachi-Katsuura area, shallow landslides (debris flows) occurred frequently. On the other hand, many deep-seated landslides and shallow landslides occurred by the northern Kyusyu-island heavy rain disaster 2012 in Japan too. Landslides occurred frequently in the Hoshino village area (Northern part) and Asodani area (Southern part). In both area, the total precipitation exceeds 500 mm and the hourly precipitation is about 80 mm. In the Hoshino village area, deep-seated landslides occurred frequently, and in Asodani area, shallow landslides occurred frequently.\nThe result compared with the deep-seated landslide area (Totsukawa and Hoshino village) and the shallow landslide area (Nachi-Katsuura and Asodani), area of landslide is larger and number of landslide is fewer in the deep-seated landslide area. In the shallow landslide area, the slope is steeper and the drainage network is more developed. It is surmised that these geographical differentiations are the geographical features formed of the past landslide. Therefore, it is important to read and analyze the past landslide disaster hysteresis from geographical feature for specifying the type of a landslide.",

This paper presents the information on the location of high energy electrons derived from the hard X-ray and microwave spectra obtained with the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager(RHESSI) and the Korean Solar Radio Burst Locator (KSRBL), respectively. The KSRBL microwave spectrum shows significant fluxes at low frequencies, implying that the high energy electrons reside in a coronal volume highly concentrated at strong magnetic fields, and rapidly expanding with decreasing magnetic fields. After a simple modeling of the microwave spectrum, we found that the microwave source should be located above the inner pair of magnetic poles in a large quadrupolar configuration. The time-dependent evolution of magnetic field distribution and total nonthermal energy derived from the microwave spectra is also consistent with the standard picture of multiple magnetic reconnections recurring at a magnetic null point that forms above the magnetic quadrupoles and moves up with time.",

            "abstract": "A carbonate-rich, partially lithified microbial mat from Little Hot Creek (Long Valley Caldera, CA) was studied as a potential proxy for ancient stromatolites. This microbial mat was characterized through a combination of water chemistry, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and incubation experiments. Four distinct layers were observed in three replicate microbial mat samples based on color, texture, and microbial composition. The bacterial populations changed significantly across the mat layers: layer A (top) was dominated by the phyla Cyanobacteria (55%), Chloroflexi (14%), and Bacteroidetes (11%); layer B was dominated by Cholorflexi (57%) and Bacteroidetes (17%); layer C was dominated by Nitrospirae (23%) and Chlorobi (11%); and layer D was dominated by Nitrospirae (35%). Microbial diversity increased with depth (from layer A to layer D). The fraction of inorganic carbon and its δ13C values as well as the δ13Corg, however, remained nearly constant throughout the mat at 0.93 ± 0.03, -1.22 ± 0.10‰, and -20.44 ± 0.27‰, respectively. SEM images of the carbonate revealed similar features and highly conserved structure between layers. Incubations with δ13Cbicarbonate showed bicarbonate uptake in all layers of the mat with the highest rate of uptake occurring with the top layer in the light. The growth experiments, the microbial taxonomy and diversity, and the SEM analysis suggest top-down mat growth, with each layer originating from the “A” (top) layer. Incubation experiments with nutrient additions to each mat layer showed enhanced growth in the presence of added Mg2+ and Mn2+, but growth was inhibited with the addition of Fe2+. This data suggests that Mg2+ and Mn2+ may play an important and overlooked role in the growth of microbial mats and the biological origin of stromatolites.",

            "abstract": "Throughout the scientific literature, measurements across soil depth and density fractions suggest that, with few exceptions, mineral-associated organic matter (OM) has higher δ15N than non-mineral-associated OM. This implies that the δ15N difference between N inputs and mineral-stabilized OM may characterize the microbial processes involved in stabilization and mineral association. Yet current understanding of observed N isotope fractionation in terrestrial ecosystems suggests the large isotope effects are expressed during inorganic N transformations from NH4 to gaseous loss pathways of NH3 volatilization and denitrification. How can the relative importance of N isotope fractionation during OM stabilization versus loss pathways be resolved?\nWe recently examined N isofluxes when a temporary nitrogen excess is created by urine deposition in a New Zealand dairy pasture.\nWe found that the N isotopic composition of volatilized NH3, and NO3 available for leaching or denitrification could not be linked back to the added N using Rayleigh distillation models. Instead, the results imply that the added N was immobilized, and the N available for losses was increasingly derived from mineralization of organic matter during the course of the experiment. These results are consistent with recent evidence of enhanced OM mineralization in urine patches, understanding of N isotope mass balances and long-standing evidence that gross mineralization and immobilization fluxes greatly exceed net mineralization and nitrification, except at very high N saturation.\nThese results suggest that where 15N enrichment occurs due to fractionating loss pathways, the isotope effects are primarily transmitted to immobilized N, forming 15N enriched stabilized OM. This further explains earlier findings that the δ15N of soil OM represents an integrated indicator of losses, reflecting the intensity and duration of pastoral agriculture. We suggest that development of an indicator based on δ15N in mineral-associated OM might relate mineralization rates to the δ15N of stabilized or immobilized N.",

We present a regional compilation of tidal-attenuation information for Hawaii, and estimate hydraulic properties using groundwater-level records from more than 250 wells in volcanic rock and more than 200 wells in coastal sediments. Results are combined in a regional context with respect to the hydrogeologic framework of each island in Hawaii. The tidal response in groundwater levels can help to distinguish and identify hydrogeologic units. For example, no tidal signal was observed in dike-intruded volcanic rock, and the lower-permeability coastal sediments caused a damping effect of the tidal signal. Aquifer-diffusivity and hydraulic-conductivity estimates in dike-free volcanic rock decrease with island age, consistent with a reduction in permeability through weathering. The results will be useful for developing island-wide numerical groundwater models of Hawaii.",

            "abstract": "The energy balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) is strongly impacted by changes in snow albedo. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) observations indicate that the GIS albedo has dropped since the early part of this century. We analyze data from the MODIS products MOD10A1 for broadband snow albedo and MOD09A1 for surface spectral reflectance since 2001 to better explain the physical mechanisms driving these changes. The MODIS products are filtered, and the data is masked using microwave-derived surface melt maps to isolate albedo changes due to dry snow processes from those driven by melt impacts. Results show that the majority of recent changes in the GIS albedo - even at high elevations - are driven by snow wetting rather than dry snow processes such as grain metamorphosis and aerosol impurity deposition. The spectral signature of the smaller changes occurring within dry snow areas suggests that grain metamorphosis dominates the albedo decline in these regions.",

            "abstract": "Gravity waves have been known to deposit energy and momentum through dissipation during their upward propagation, which changes the dynamic flow and thermal structure in the lower thermosphere. For an upward propagating gravity wave packet with rich spectrum, various theoretical works and model simulations have indicated that the wave components with high frequency and larger vertical wavelength experience dissipation at higher altitude and dominate earlier stage, while the low frequency components, with short vertical wavelength, dominate during the latter part of the propagation. However, the evidences of such critical dissipation mechanism in the gravity wave packet propagation process have yet been comprehensively studied and discussed in the experimental observations. In this paper, utilizing the observations from the Na lidar, the Meteor Wind Radar (MWR) and the Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM) at Utah State University, we investigate several cases of this dynamic scenario over Logan, Utah (41.7°N, 111.8°W), to study the waves’ evolution as they are propagating upward.",

            "abstract": "The tropical marine low-cloud cover (LCC) feedback is a key component of global cloud feedbacks. Differences in simulations of the feedback (ranging from a considerably negative to large, positive) are sources of significant spread in the temperature responses of climate models to anthropogenic forcing. Despite its importance, the underlying processes driving the feedback are not well-understood. Here we present evidence that in models it is mainly driven by three warming-induced changes---(1) strengthening tropical inversion, (2) increasing surface latent heat flux, and (3) an increasing moisture gradient in the lower-troposphere. The sensitivities of LCC to these changes, diagnosed through 20th-century climate variability, vary a great deal across models, contributing to the spread in the projected LCC changes over 21st-century. A methodology is devised to observationally constrain these sensitivities. We find that averaged over five main tropical low cloud regions, LCC decreases by 2% or more in models where the simulated sensitivities are consistent with the observed. This suggests that a positive LCC feedback is more consistent with observation than a negative one. Correcting biases in the simulated sensitivities will clearly be an important step towards a better simulation of cloud feedbacks in climate models.",

            "abstract": "During March of 2014, the Naval Research Laboratory and the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory collected an integrated set of airborne and in-situ measurements over two areas of floating, but land-fast ice near the coast of Barrow, AK. The near-shore site was just north of Point Barrow, and the “offshore” site was ~ 20 km east of Point Barrow. The in-situ data provided ground-truth for airborne measurements from a scanning LiDAR (Riegl Q 560i), digital photogrammetry (Applanix DSS-439) and a snow radar procured from the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets of the University of Kansas. The objective of the survey was to aid our understanding of the use of the airborne data to calibrate/validate Cryosat-2 data.\nSampling size or “footprint” plays a critical role in the attempt to compare in-situ measurements with airborne (or satellite) measurements. Thus the in-situ data were arranged to minimize aliasing. Ground measurements were collected along transects at both sites consisting of a 2 km long profile of snow depth and ice thickness measurements with periodic boreholes. A 60 m x 400 m swath of snow depth measurements was centered on this profile.\nAirborne data were collected on five overflights of the two transect areas. The LiDAR measured total freeboard (ice + snow) referenced to leads in the ice, and produced swaths 200-300 m wide. The radar measured snow thickness. The freeboard and snow thickness measurements are used to estimate ice thickness via isostasy and density estimates. The central swath of in situ snow depth data allows examination of the effects of cross-track variations considering the relatively large footprint of the snow radar. Assuming a smooth, flat surface the radar range resolution in air is < 4 cm, but the along-track sampling distance is ~ 3 m after unfocussed SAR processing. The width of the footprint varies from ~ 9 m up to about 40 m (beam-limited) for uneven surfaces. However, the radar could not resolve snow thickness except in areas of relatively flat snow and ice. The LiDAR had a ground point spacing of ~25-50 cm (depending on survey altitude) and so easily encompassed all other data.\nComparisons and processing methodology will be shown. The results of this ground-truth experiment will inform our analysis of grids of airborne data collected over areas of sea-ice illuminated by Cryosat-2.",

            "abstract": "The performance of existing energy balance snow models exhibits a large spread in the simulated snow water equivalent, snow depth, albedo, and surface temperature. Indentifying poor model representations of physical processes within intercomparison studies is difficult due to multiple differences between models as well as non-orthogonal metrics used. Efforts to overcome these obstacles for model development have focused on a modeling framework that allows multiple representations of each physical process within one structure. However, there still exists a need for snow study sites within complex terrain that observe enough model states and fluxes to constrain model choices.\nIn this study we focus on an intensive snow observational site located in the maritime-transitional snow climate of Snoqualmie Pass WA (Figure 1). The transitional zone has been previously identified as a difficult climate to simulate snow processes; therefore, it represents an ideal model-vetting site. From two water years of intensive observational data, we have learned that a more honest comparison with observations requires that the modeled states or fluxes be as similar to the spatial and temporal domain of the instrument, even if it means changing the model to match what is being observed. For example, 24-hour snow board observations do not capture compaction of the underlying snow; therefore, a modeled “snow board” was created that only includes new snow accumulation and new snow compaction. We extend this method of selective model validation to all available Snoqualmie observations to constrain model choices within the Structure for Understanding Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA) framework. Our end goal is to provide a more rigorous and systematic method for diagnosing problems within snow models at a site given numerous snow observations.",

            "abstract": "The Iranian Plateau is a tectonically complex region resulting from the continental collision between the African and Eurasian plates. The convergence of the two continents created the Zagros Mountains, the high topography southwest of Iran, and active seismicity along the Zagros-Bitlis suture. Tomographic studies in Iran reveal low seismic speeds and high attenuation of Sn wave in the uppermost mantle beneath the Iranian Plateau relative to adjacent regions. The deeper structure, however, remains curiously inconclusive. By contrast, a prominent fast seismic anomaly is found under central Tibet near depth of 600 km in the mantle transition zone (TZ), and it is speculated to be the remnant of lithosphere detached during the continental collision.\nWe conduct a comparative study that utilizes triplicate arrivals of high-resolution P waveforms to investigate the velocity structure of mantle beneath the central Iranian Plateau and surroundings. Due to the abrupt increase in seismic wave speeds and density across the 410- and 660-km discontinuities, seismic waves at epicentral distances of 15–30 degrees would form multiple arrivals and the relative times and amplitudes between them are most sensitive to the variations in seismic speeds near the TZ. We combine several broadband arrays to construct 8 seismic profiles, each about 800 km long, that mainly sample the TZ under central Iranian Plateau, Turan shield and part of South Caspian basin. Move-outs between arrivals are clear in the profiles. Relative timings suggest a slightly smaller 660-km contrast under stable Turan shield. In the next stage, it is necessary to model waveforms after the source effect being removed properly. Our preliminary tests show that the F-K method can efficiently calculate the synthetic seismograms.\nWe will determine the 1D velocity model for each sampled sector by minimizing the overall misfits between observed and predicted waveforms. The lateral variations may be further explored by comparing adjacent sectors. The results are important for understanding the lithosphere-mantle interaction during the process of continental collision.",

            "abstract": "Isotope-enabled Global Climate Models (GCMs) are becoming important tools in facilitating the synthesis of disparate isotope proxy data, allowing for uncertainties in proxy-based reconstructions to be tested in a way not possible with inversion methods. They also provide a means to test processes and parameterizations in the GCMs themselves, as new in-situ and remote sensing systems now can measure water isotopes at the spatial and temporal scale needed to validate global models. However, one issue with isotope-enabled GCMs is that much of the past focus and development has been on the atmosphere and ocean, which means other components of the earth system are poorly understood in comparison. Newly developed isotope-enabled GCMs with fully-functional land surface models, along with new observational platforms, allow for one to examine the importance of the land surface on the distribution of water isotopes in the earth system. We report here on experiments using the new NCAR isotope-enabled Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (iCAM5) and the isotope-enabled Community Land Model Version 4 (iCLM4), as well as a growing number of measurements of isotopic ratios in precipitation and water vapor. In particular, iCAM5 is used to simulate the modern isotopic climate coupled to a. a simple bucket model for isotopes, b. iCLM4 with equilibrium fractionation only, and c. fully-fractionating iCLM4. Along with the use of iCLM4, numerous variations in the representation of kinetic fractionation are examined, as well as different parameterizations for the impact of dew and frost on the isotope ratios in the surface water vapor, snow, and soil moisture. Results show that having a fully-functioning land surface model has a large impact on the simulated isotope ratios, and is necessary if one wants to simulate water isotopes in the earth system accurately. Accurately simulating d-excess and O17-excess requires having a kinetic fractionation factor that properly accounts for the influence of both turbulent and kinetic diffusion in the surface layer. Finally, matching observed isotope ratios in the polar regions requires an adequate simulation of the influence of dew and frost. These findings show that with the observational constraints now available, models of water exchange between the atmosphere and land can be improved.",

We use flood damage data from the National Climatic Data Center to examine the nature of historical flood damages in the continental United States. Using the location information for each flood event, we link each damaging flood to the nearest stream channel, and to the nearest meteorological station from NCDC. Using this combined dataset, we find that 1) flood events associated with first order streams (typically <300 km2) account for approximately 50% of inland flooding damages nationwide; 2) the number of damaging events in the historical record decreases as a power function of stream order; and 3) the distribution of monetary damages per event is similar across all stream orders. Using this information, we evaluate potential changes in monetary damages from flooding of small catchments under different climate change scenarios. We extract daily precipitation data from the historical record for each damaging event, and determine the approximate recurrence interval of the precipitation associated with each flood event. Then, using modeled daily precipitation projections from the IGSM-CAM model, we project regional changes in the magnitude and frequency of extreme events under two climate change mitigation scenarios compared to a reference scenario. For each scenario, we translate changes in flood frequency into flood damages using the observed historical distribution of damages. We then compile damage projections by region and by scenario to estimate the potential monetary value of inland flooding damages averted by climate change mitigation policies.",

In fact, recent studies have reported the observation of EM field variations possibly caused by devastating tsunamis including the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami. During the period from June 2010 to November 2011, we deployed a small array consisting of 4 ocean bottom electro-magnetometers (OBEMs) in the northwestern Pacific basin, about 1,000 km to the east from the epicenter, to explore the mantle structure. This array successfully recorded EM signals associated with the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami.\nWe found that the observed EM signal propagated in the array as a wave with a phase velocity approximately equal to that of an oceanic long wave. Also, we estimated the motional impedance and tipper corresponding to the propagation direction at each site from the major components of observed EM signals and found that they were approximately equal to the phase velocities of the tsunami propagation as suggested by a simple theory. Besides, ocean bottom seismograms and tilt data show that observed EM variations were not produced by instrumental shaking. These results gave us a clear proof that observed EM signals were generated by the motional induction of the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami and therefore can be used to estimate tsunami parameters such as wave height, arrival time, and propagation direction.\nThen, we estimated the tsunami propagation direction from observed tsunami-induced EM fields at four seafloor sites through several methods (both single station and array analyses). Resulting frequency dependence of the propagation direction was found consistent with a source model of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. We also estimated the tsunami height from EM data recorded at each site, and obtained the tsunami amplitude in the array to be approximately 1 m. The same set of parameters (propagation direction and wave height) was calculated from EM signals simulated by using a tsunami flow model with a linear long-wave approximation. Resulting parameters showed a reasonable agreement with those of the tsunami simulation, which indicates the accuracy of an OBEM or OBEM array used for tsunami detection.",

However, the growth responses to climate change of the widely distributed semi-arid forests are unclear. Here, we synthetically investigate the tree growth patterns during past decades and its interannual response to climate variations in Inner Asia combining the ground truth field survey and samplings, remote sensing observations and climate data. We identified a pervasive tree growth decline since mid-1990s in semi-arid forests in Inner Asia. The widely observed tree growth decline is dominantly attributable to warming-induced water stress during pre- and early growing season. Tree growth of semi-arid forests in Inner Asia is particularly susceptible to spring warming and has been suffering a prolonged growth limitation in recent decades due to spring warming-mediated water conditions. Additionally, we identified a much slower growth rate in younger trees and a lack of tree regeneration in these semi-arid forests.\nThe widely observed forest growth reduction and lack of tree regeneration over semi-arid forests in Inner Asia could predictably exert great effects on forest structure, regionally/globally biophysical and biochemical processes and the feedbacks between biosphere and atmosphere. Notably, further increases in forest stress and tree mortality could be reasonably expected, especially in context of the increase frequency and severity of high temperature and heat waves and changes in forest disturbances, potentially driving the eventual regional loss of current semi-arid forests. Given the potential risks of climate induced forest dieback, increased management attention to adaptation options for enhancing forest resistance and resilience to projected climate stress can be expected.\nHowever, the functionally realistic mechanisms beneath the pervasively climate-induced forest decline/dieback still remain unclear. Network-based long-term surveys and experiment studies are urgently needed for further understandings regarding the responses of forest/tree growth to climate warming/variations.",

During the study period, GOCI AOD provides the best temporal coverage (80%), followed by VIIRS Intermediate Product (IP) (75%), VIIRS Environmental Data Record (EDR) (59%), and MODIS C6 3 km AOD (27%). The mean bias of VIIRS EDR, VIIRS IP, GOCI, and MODIS C6 3 km AOD are 0.08, 0.25, 0.01, and 0.15, respectively. When compared with ground observations, 56% of EDR, 27% of IP, 51% of GOCI, and 47% of MODIS C6 3 km AOD fall within the global expected error (EE) range of MODIS over land (±0.05±0.15AOD). EDR, IP, and MODIS C6 3km aerosol products perform better in rural areas, with a bias less than half of that in urban areas and more than 80% more retrievals falling within EE relative to in urban areas. Over Metro Beijing, comparing with AOD measured by handheld sunphotometers, 51% of VIIRS EDR AOD, 31% of VIIRS IP AOD, 33% of GOCI AOD, and 17% of MODIS AOD fall within the MODIS EE.\nKeywords – Aerosol Optical Depth; VIIRS; MODIS; GOCI; AERONET; DRAGON",

            "abstract": "Inshore coral reefs of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are threatened by terrestrial sediment loads that are argued to have increased by five to six times since coastal catchments were settled by Europeans in the mid-1850s. Nutrient and contaminant delivery to the inshore GBR has also increased over this period. However, direct evidence that European colonisation has changed the ecology of inshore reefs on the GBR remains limited, partly due to a lack of baseline historical data on coral reef growth. Coral reefs have been growing in inshore areas of the GBR since 6 or 7 ky BP, and have experienced natural fluctuations in terrestrial sediment loads over this period. For example, floods associated with episodic cyclones and major rainfall events often deliver pulses of sediment, especially if they follow prolonged dry spells. To better understand this history of sediment influx and reef development, we have examined in detail the chronostratigraphy of several inshore GBR reefs that have grown since the mid-Holocene. Here, we report on eight percussion cores collected at Bramston Reef (148°15’E, 20°03’S). Two cores terminate in the pre-Holocene substrate and therefore capture the entire Holocene sequence of both reef framework and terrigenous sediment matrix. Results from detailed core analyses indicate variable sedimentation patterns throughout the period of reef development. Furthermore, reef ecological condition and variability through the mid-late Holocene is described using palaeoecological analyses. We explore the impacts of sedimentation variability on reef growth and ecology, and compare reef ecological condition pre- and post-European colonisation.",

            "abstract": "Reconnection at the magnetopause of Earth plays an important role in magnetospheric dynamics. Previous theoretical work suggests that ion exhaust velocities are equal to the Alfvén speed for no guide field and exhaust velocities decrease with increasing guide field. These theoretical predictions are tested at the Earth’s magnetopause using observations from the Cluster spacecraft. Cluster magnetopause crossings, from 2002 – 2009, cover the dayside reconnection region (9 – 15 LT with |MLAT| < 60°) for a wide range of IMF clock angles (90° – 270°) and magnetic shear angles (88° – 180°). The difference between the incident and reflected ion velocities (vsep) in the magnetosheath boundary layer (MSBL) ion populations is used to determine the exhaust velocity. The ratio of vsep over twice the Alfvén speed (vsep/2vA) is predicted to approach one for reconnection with shear angles near 180° (no guide field), but is observed to reach a maximum value of approximately 0.8 for the magnetopause crossings analyzed. This value is consistent with previous observations of ion velocities from reconnection at the magnetopause investigated with the Walén relation. While magnetic shear angle can contribute to the disagreement between observations and the Walén relation, it does not play a large role, given the reduced ratio for the events near 180° in this study.",

            "abstract": "The intensities of seismic waves observed at the dense seismic array of the Tokyo Metropolitan Seismic Observation network (MeSO-net) inside the Kanto basin, display unusual distribution patterns. In several occasions, the highest intensities are not observed in the area above an earthquakes hypocenter but appear sifted more than 20 km away. In order to understand the source of this unusual intensity distribution pattern, it is crucial to understand how the waves attenuate before they reach the surface. The attenuation of seismic waves along their path is represented by the t∗ attenuation operator that can be obtained by fitting the observed seismic wave spectrum to a theoretical spectrum using an ω2 model. In order to create a high quality dataset, only 1449 earthquakes that are recorded with intensity greater than 0 in the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) intensity scale are selected from the JMA unified earthquake list from April 1st 2008 to October 2nd 2013. A grid search method is applied to determine the t∗ values by matching the observed and theoretical spectra. The t∗ data where then inverted to estimate a 3D Q structure with grid points set at a 10 km spacing. We implemented the 3D velocity model estimated by Nakagawa et al., 2012 and in addition we set the initial Q values at 100 for the 0 km grids and to 400 for the grids below them. The obtained model suggests average Q values of 50˜100 inside the Kanto basin. Furthermore, a low Q zone is observed in the area where the Philippine Sea plate meets the upper part of the Pacific sea plate. This area is located at approximately 40 km depth, beneath the north-east Tokyo and west Chiba prefectures and is represented by Q values < 300. Earthquakes occurring on the Pacific plate pass through this low Q area inside the Philippine sea plate and are attenuated significantly. The estimated attenuation distribution at the MeSO-net station for these earthquakes implementing our 3D Q model greatly coincides with the observed seismic wave intensity distribution. Stations where our model predicts high attenuation display low intensity values whereas stations where our model predicts low attenuation display high intensities. The implementation of our findings could help towards a better understanding of the damage area of future earthquakes and mitigate the disaster of the affected areas.",

            "abstract": "Among all the rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean, the three great Siberian rivers; Lena, Yenisei and Ob, are the three largest in terms of water discharge (R), and they are a large source of freshwater. While linear trends of the Rs have been examined in many previous studies, causes of the R variations are still unclear. As pointed out in Fukutomi et al. (2003), during the 1980s to mid-1990s, the observed R of the Lena was negatively correlated with that of the Ob. The precipitation (P) and net precipitation (P-E) also showed negative correlation. These variations were affected by the east-west seesaw pattern of atmospheric circulation and associated moisture transport over Siberia. Our analysis, including records from recent years, revealed that the correlation of the R becomes weak after the mid-1990s, and it was positive during the mid-1950s to 1960s. These results indicated that the relationship between the observed Rs of the Lena and Ob was different in each epoch during the past seven decades. Reconstructed Rs based on the tree-ring during the past two centuries also showed positive and negative correlations in each of the epochs. Interestingly, the correlations were distributed on the negative side. This implies that the east-west seesaw pattern frequently appeared over Siberia. In addition, control simulation with an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) suggested that the east-west seesaw pattern appears as an atmospheric internal variability over Siberia. In conclusion, the atmospheric circulation which affects the P variations over Siberia was different in each epoch during the past two centuries, and as a result the relationship between the Rs of the Lena and Ob Rivers were changed in each of the epochs.",

            "abstract": "During its ancient past, Mars exhibited dynamic conditions that facilitated water-rock reactions, bringing unequilibrated chemical constituents into contact with each other. Such interactions have prompted speculation regarding the energetic output of redox reactions. The sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is one redox reaction that has not been carefully investigated in an ancient martian context, and yet, with recent reports of methane and sulfate-bearing minerals on Mars, it may be one of the more observationally constrained options for a putative metabolism.\nIn this work, we evaluate the Gibbs energies of the AOM metabolism under a range of atmospheric compositions using seven putative martian groundwater compositions. In all scenarios, AOM is exergonic, ranging from -31 to -135 kJ/mol CH4. A reaction transport model was developed to incorporate the advection and diffusion of nutrients, reaction rates, and the feedback between growing organisms’ nutrient consumption and downstream concentrations. The extent of crustal volume under exergonic conditions is set primarily by localized reactant concentration, while relative changes within the exergonic zone are driven primarily by product accumulation.\nIn order for AOM to have been an energetically viable metabolism on ancient Mars, co-located reactants would have been necessary. At NE Syrtis Major, serpentinization of the olivine-bearing unit may have produced hydrogen, which could generate methane in the abiotic reduction of CO2. In the overlying jarosite-bearing layer, sulfate and incoming methane provide the reactants for AOM. An alternative scenario for martian AOM involves methane production by subsurface hydrothermal alteration of basaltic crust, and acid sulfate conditions are produced from fluids derived near the surface. Sulfate-bearing waters are formed by aerosol deposition and subsequent dissolution of oxidized sulfur species by water.\nFinally, continuing work on constraining martian reaction transport models from a microbiological perspective will be discussed. Understanding which parameters can be refined based on orbital or rover observations will aid in producing site-specific models that will help inform the search for signs of past or present life beneath the martian surface.",

            "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence from NASA’s Dawn mission suggest transient volatile presence at the surface of asteroid Vesta. Radar remote sensing is a useful technique for the investigation of volatile content at the surface and shallow subsurface, but requires the use of accurate dielectric and topographic models in order to deconvolve the effect of surface roughness from the total observed radar backscatter.\nToward this end, we construct a dielectric model for the dry, volatile-poor case of Vesta’s surface to represent average surface conditions, and to assess the expected average range of dielectric properties due to known variations in mineralogy, temperature, and density as inferred from Dawn VIR data. We employ dielectric studies of lunar samples to serve as a suitable analog to the Vestan regolith, and in the case of 10-wavelength penetration depth of X-band frequency radar observations, our model yields ε' from 2.5 to 2.6 from the night to dayside of Vesta, and tan δ from 0.011 to 0.014. Our estimation of ε' corresponds to specular surface reflectivity of ~0.05.\nIn addition to modeling, we have also conducted an opportunistic bistatic radar (BSR) experiment at Vesta using the communications antennas aboard Dawn and on Earth. In this configuration, Dawn transmits a continuous radar signal toward the Earth while orbiting Vesta. As the Dawn spacecraft passes behind Vesta (entering an occultation), the line of sight between Dawn and Earth intersects Vesta’s surface, resulting in a reflection of radar waves from the surface and shallow subsurface, which are then received on Earth for analysis.\nThe geometry of the Dawn BSR experiment results in high incidence angles on Vesta’s surface, and leads to a differential Doppler shift of only a few 10s of Hz between the direct signal and the surface echo. As a consequence, this introduces ambiguity in the measurement of bandwidth and peak power of each surface echo. We report our interpretations of each surface echo in the context of relative surface roughness and relative surface reflectivity, and present suggestions for conducting future BSR experiments at small bodies.",

The sediment cores from site 5017-1 (water depth of ~300 m) recorded the paleoenvironmental and paleohydrological changes in the Dead Sea and the Levant during the last two glacial-interglacial cycles (Neugebauer et al., QSR in press). To provide precise timing of sedimentological - limnological events in the lake and its watershed, and more critically the relative timing of these events, radiocarbon dating of >70 well-preserved terrestrial plants and some carbonate deposits from the upper 150 m long section of the sediment core were performed. Based on the high-resolution radiocarbon dating, a statistical age-depth model was constructed with assumptions on the deposition condition and the radiocarbon age offset of carbonate samples. We discuss the practicality and the limitation of the age-depth model toward interpreting the high-resolution records of environmental, climatic and tectonic events recorded in the long sediment cores from site 5017-1.",

            "abstract": "Using a revised statistical model built on past seismic probability models, the probability of different magnitude earthquakes occurring within variable timespans can be estimated. The revised model is based on Poisson distribution and includes the use of best-estimate values of the probability distribution of different magnitude earthquakes recurring from a fault from literature sources. Our study aims to apply this model to the Taipei metropolitan area with a population of 7 million, which lies in the Taipei Basin and is bounded by two normal faults: the Sanchaio and Taipei faults. The Sanchaio fault is suggested to be responsible for previous large magnitude earthquakes, such as the 1694 magnitude 7 earthquake in northwestern Taipei (Cheng et. al., 2010). Based on a magnitude 7 earthquake return period of 543 years, the model predicts the occurrence of a magnitude 7 earthquake within 20 years at 1.81%, within 79 years at 6.77% and within 300 years at 21.22%. These estimates increase significantly when considering a magnitude 6 earthquake; the chance of one occurring within the next 20 years is estimated to be 3.61%, 79 years at 13.54% and 300 years at 42.45%. The 79 year period represents the average lifespan of the Taiwan population. In contrast, based on data from 2013, the probability of Taiwan residents experiencing heart disease or malignant neoplasm is 11.5% and 29%. The inference of this study is that the calculated risk that the Taipei population is at from a potentially damaging magnitude 6 or greater earthquake occurring within their lifetime is just as great as of suffering from a heart attack or other health ailments.",

            "abstract": "The Community Land Model (CLM) is an advanced process-based land surface model that simulates the complicated carbon, water vapor and energy exchanges between the terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere at various spatial-temporal scales. We for the first time use eddy-covariance observations of CO2 and water vapor exchange and soil respiration measurements at five representative Chinese Terrestrial Ecosystem Flux Observational Network (ChinaFLUX) tower sites to systematically evaluate the latest versions of CLM, the CLM4.0 and CLM4.5, and comprehensively examine the similarities and differences between the observational and simulated results. The CLM4.5 underestimates annual carbon sink at three forest sites and one alpine grassland site but overestimates the carbon sink at a semi-arid grassland site. The underestimation in annual carbon sink at a deciduous dominated forest site is resulted from underestimated daytime carbon sequestration in summer and overestimated nighttime carbon emission in spring and autumn. Compared with the CLM4.0, the bias of annual Gross Primary Production (GPP) is reduced by 24% and 28% in CLM4.5 at two subtropical forest sites. However, CLM4.5 still has a large positive bias in annual GPP. The improvement in NEE is limited, although the bias of soil respiration decreases by 16%-43% at three forest sites. The CLM4.5 has lower soil water content in dry season than this simulated by the CLM4.0 at two grassland sites. These lead to the significant drop in leaf area index and GPP, and the increase in respiration for the CLM4.5. The new fire parameterization in CLM4.5 causes incorrect fire estimation at Changbaishan forest site, which results in unexpected underestimation of NEE, vegetation carbon, and soil organic carbon by 46%, 95%, and 87%, respectively. Our study with the ChinaFLUX sites indicates a significant improvement of the CLM4.5 than the CLM4, and suggests further developments on the parameterization of seasonal GPP and respiration, which depend tightly on the better representation of seasonal water condition and the partitioning of net radiation between sensible and heat fluxes.",

            "abstract": "This presentation will provide a report on the petrographical features of the tephras NLPa-1 (depth 3.14 to 3.16 meters, approximately 2,490 BP by sedimental ratio) and NLPa-2 (depth 2.88 to 3.1 meters, 2,385 14CcalBP), which were discovered in the boring core (excavation depth of 10 meters) as reported by Tashiro et al. (2014). Both tephras have fine grained, white glassy lithofacies with no stratification, and they have been identified as ash fall deposits because there is no sedimentary structure and no internally encapsulated units. Mineralogical analyses, particle size composition analyses, chemical composition analyses of the main components, and gradient index analyses of the volcanic glass and minerals were performed. The results described above led us to believe that both tephras are potentially composed of ash fall from a caldera eruption. Furthermore, both tephras can be thought of as sedimentations from multiple eruptions whereby the same volcano was the supply source of the sediments since the time intervals are confirmed for both tephras and there is a high degree of similarity in their petrographical features. A comparison of the main component composition of volcanic glass from tephras of NLPa-1 and NLPa-2, as well as those that have been described both within and outside the Philippines, was conducted next to investigate the supply source of the sediments. The findings point to a high degree of similarity of these tephras with the Iro and Ins series originating in the Irosin Caldera (Mirabueno et al., 2011, etc.). A direct comparison, however, was considered impossible since the sedimentation era of the Iro and Ins series is about 41ka and is therefore significantly different from that of these tephras. While the results of this research did not allow us to compare NLPa-1 and NLPa-2 because of the reasons described above, it is hoped that what is described here will contribute toward the building of the tephrochronology in the Philippines.",

Here, we show that Baiu-rainband activity, which is part of the East Asian summer monsoon, plays an important role in recent intensification in the WPSH along the Baiu rainband. In contrast with the WPSH, the summer Okhotsk high, which is located to the north of the Baiu rainband, has weakened during the past three decades. The north-south contrasting changes between the two highs reflect a response to northward-moved and enhanced Baiu heating, which intensifies the upper-tropospheric ridge, resulting in the baroclinic intensification of the WPSH. Regional climate model experiments also support the observational analysis. The results here suggest that the mechanism intensifying the summer North Pacific subtropical high clearly differs between the western and eastern Pacific.",

However, the existing modes of Longmen Shan near surface structure could not explain the surface structural deformation and the deep structure data well. We use finite-difference method to image the Longmen Shan near surface structure. Zhang and Chen(2006,2012) proposed the MacCormack high order non-staggered finite difference method based on curved grids to precisely solve irregular surface problem. We use the method to simulate seismic wave propagation in the presence of surface topography.

Then we demonstrate the advantage of our method by comparing with handpicking seismic phase. The results confirm the time-window selection method can deal with large amounts of data effectively.",

We simulate the distribution of passive tracers released from the 18 different continental shelf regions of the extra-tropical southern hemisphere oceans using an offline, eddy-permitting transport model. The circulation fields are taken from the Southern Ocean State Estimate, and we only simulate the transport of inert tracers focusing on the physical transport pathways. The resulting tracer fields are then compared with the remotely sensed ocean color data, revealing a remarkable resemblance between the distributions of shelf-source tracers and the climatological surface chlorophyll-a concentrations. We further analyze the spatial pattern of simulated tracer fields in relation to satellite ocean color data. Dynamic ocean features such as the Southern Ocean fronts and coastal waters are reflected in both the tracer model and the observed biological productivity. Our results support the overall importance of continental shelves as a potential source region for dissolved iron. The relative importance of different shelf regions is found to vary significantly depending on the relevant circulation features.",

            "abstract": "From 2000 till present, most endorheic lakes in Tibetan plateau experienced quick increasing. Several largest lakes, gathered several meters depth water during one decade. Such massive mass increasing will lead to elastic and visco-elastic deformation of the ground. Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is one the most active tectonic places in the world; monitoring its ground deformation is essential, when loading effect is a nuisance item. Due to the sparse distribution of GPS sites and most are roving sites, it is hard to distinguish tectonic component from mass loading effect. In this research we took Selin Co Lake located at Nujiang-Bangoin suture zone and evaluated long time ground deformation at hundred kilometers scale by multi-temporal SAR interferometry and simulate the ground deformation by loading history evaluated by multi mission satellite altimetry and optical images observation. At Nujiang-Bangoin suture zone, where GPS presented the maximum ground subsidence in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of 3.6mm/a which was found at the shore of Selin Co Lake from 1999 to 2011, when it experienced water level increasing of 0.7m/a. A model of elastic plate lying over Newtonian viscous half-space matches well with the results of multi-temporal SAR interferometry and GPS observations. We concluded that near Selin Co Lake area, ground deformation is composed by both tectonic and hydrological loading part. As SAR image coverage is much smaller than tectonic scale, we contribute the deformation detected by InSAR to loading effect. After evaluating and removing the hydrological loading effect, we founds that Nujiang-Bangoin suture zone did not experience quick subsidence, but only limited to 0.5mm/a. Selin Co Lake’s quick volume increasing caused 3mm/a subsidence rate to the nearest GPS site. The Second nearest site showed the 1.4mm/a subsidence totally, which were composed by 1.05mm/a hydrological loading effect and the rest was tectonic. We also found that Young's Modulus is the most essential parameter for loading effect simulation, and our simulation gave the similar Young’s Modulus as the previous seismic tomographic INDEPTH III program did. Therefore with accurate seismic tomographic results and loading history detected by remote sensing could accurately simulate ground deformation caused by hydrological loading.",

            "abstract": "Numerous seafloor depressions, ranging in size from 20 to 700 m in diameter, have been identified off the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island. Depressions or pockmarks are a commonly observed seafloor expression of focused fluid flow or gas venting. The positions of these structures correlate well with the expected gas hydrate stability zone in the region; however, limited geophysical or geochemical evidence exists to support the hypothesis that gas hydrate dissociation is the primary mechanism responsible for their formation. The purpose of this project is to investigate these depressions, focusing on their geomorphology and underlying shallow subsurface structures, in order to determine the most probable mechanism of formation.\nIn addition to recently acquired data from the CHatham RIse Mega Pockmarks (CHRIMP) project, existing data sets from research and industry sources have been used in this study. One of the aims of the project is the use of multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data to characterise the lithology of the seafloor in the vicinity of these seafloor depressions. This work has been done by correlating automated supervised segmentation of backscatter data to sediment samples, underwater images, and subsurface profiles from seismic and parasound data.\nThe morphometric variability of these structures indicates that multiple processes were involved in their formation over a period of time. Shallow gas release and gas hydrate dissociation may have been a factor in the initial formation of some of the larger structures on the Chatham Rise; however, they subsequently have been modified and maintained by the action of strong current systems in the region, e.g. the northeasterly flowing Subtropical Front in the region. Along the Canterbury Shelf, the interaction of current systems and complex seafloor canyon systems has strongly influenced the geomorphology of the seafloor. ",

Generalized Ohm's Law describes how particles move under ideal and non-ideal conditions; however, it is insufficient for describing how the magnetic field itself changes. Initial studies have shown that a curl of a parallel electric field is necessary for reconnection to occur. These analytic studies have demonstrated that perpendicular gradients in the parallel electric field drive a counter-twisting of the magnetic field on either side of the localized parallel electric field. This results in the slippage of magnetic flux tubes and a break down of the 'frozen-in' condition. In this presentation, we analyze results from self-consistent implicit kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. The strongest gradients of parallel electric fields in the simulations are along the separator and not at the X-point. We will present where in the simulation domain the 'frozen-in' condition breaks down and compare it with the location of these gradients, and discuss the implications.",

Since the density of the core is smaller than that of pure Fe under the core conditions, the core has been considered to contain light elements. Si is one of the most important light elements in the core. Although the phase relations and compression behaviors of Fe-Si alloys have been studied at high pressure and temperature in order to investigate properties of the inner core, magnetic properties of the alloys have not been studied well. In order to clarify the relationship between the magnetic and structural transitions in the Fe-Si alloys, we made simultaneous measurements of X-ray diffraction and synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy of the Fe-Si alloys up to 40 GPa at room temperature. The Fe-Si alloys used for the measurements have compositions with Fe0.95Si0.05 and Fe0.88Si0.12 enriched in 57Fe. The starting material was synthesized by melting of the mixture of 57Fe and Fe-Si alloys under the Ar-H2 atmosphere by laser heating. Mössbauer spectra and XRD patterns were obtained at the beamlines, BL10XU and BL11XU of SPring-8. Our Mössbauar data together with X-ray diffraction data revealed that the transition from magnetic to non-magnetic phase occurs at 18 GPa simultaneously with the transition from bcc to hcp phase in Fe0.95Si0.05. Moreover, the transition pressure increases with increasing the Si content in the alloys. The present results imply that the changes in physical properties such as sound velocity and compression are caused not only by the structural change from bcc to hcp but also by the magnetic transition from magnetic to nonmagnetic.",

            "abstract": "Ambient noise correlation is an increasingly popular seismological technique that uses the ambient seismic noise recorded at two stations to construct an empirical Green's function. Applications of this technique include determining shear velocity structure and attenuation. An advantage of ambient noise is that it does not rely on external sources of seismic energy such as local or teleseismic earthquakes. This method has been used in the geothermal industry to determine the depths at which magmatic processes occur, to distinguish between production and non-production areas, and to observe seismic velocity perturbations associated with fluid extraction. We will present a velocity model for the Rotokawa geothermal field near Taupo, New Zealand, produced from ambient noise cross correlations. Production at Rotokawa is based on the \"Rotokawa A\" combined cycle power station established in 1997 and the \"Nga Awa Purua\" triple flash power plant established in 2010. Rotokawa Joint Venture, a partnership between Mighty River Power and Tauhara North No. 2 Trust currently operates 174 MW of generation at Rotokawa. An array of short period seismometers was installed in 2008 and occupies an area of roughly 5 square kilometers around the site. Although both cultural and natural noise sources are recorded at the stations, the instrument separation distance provides a unique challenge for analyzing cross correlations produced by both signal types. The inter-station spacing is on the order of a few kilometers, so waves from cultural sources generally are not coherent from one station to the other, while the wavelength produced by natural noise is greater than the station separation. Velocity models produced from these two source types will be compared to known geological models of the site. Depending on the amount of data needed to adequately construct cross-correlations, a time-dependent model of velocity will be established and compared with geothermal production processes.",

            "abstract": "We use high-quality data obtained by the High Resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) to examine bright dots (BDs) in a sunspot's penumbra. The sizes of these BDs are on the order of 1 arcsecond (1\") and are therefore hard to identify using the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly's (AIA) 0.6\" pixel-1 resolution. These BDs become readily apparent with Hi-C's 0.1\" pixel-1 resolution. Tian et al. (2014) found penumbral BDs in the transition region (TR) by using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). However, only a few of their dots could be associated with any enhanced brightness in AIA channels. In this work, we examine the characteristics of the penumbral BDs observed by Hi-C in a sunspot penumbra, including their sizes, lifetimes, speeds, and intensity. We also attempt to relate these BDs to the IRIS BDs. There are fewer Hi-C BDs in the penumbra than seen by IRIS, though different sunspots were studied. We use 193Å Hi-C data from July 11, 2012 which observed from ~18:52:00 UT--18:56:00 UT and supplement it with data from AIA's 193Å passband to see the complete lifetime of the dots that were born before and/or lasted longer than Hi-C's 5-minute observation period. We use additional AIA passbands and compare the light curves of the BDs at different temperatures to test whether the Hi-C BDs are TR BDs. We find that most Hi-C BDs show clear movement, and of those that do, they move in a radial direction, toward or away from the sunspot umbra. Single BDs interact with other BDs, combining to fade away or brighten. The BDs that do not interact with other BDs tend to move less. Our BDs are similar to the exceptional IRIS BDs: they move slower on average and their sizes and lifetimes are on the high end of the distribution of IRIS BDs. We infer that our penumbral BDs are some of the larger BDs observed by IRIS, those that are bright enough in TR emission to be seen in the 193Å band of Hi-C.",

Yet, programs often lack a systematic framework to select indicators that are both important to stakeholders and relevant to hypothesized program impact. To fill this gap, we developed a participatory indicator selection methodology and piloted it in Fondo Agua por La Vida y la Sostenibilidad in the East Cauca Valley Colombia. We started by linking program activities to anticipated ecological and socio-economic impacts through stakeholder developed results chains. Using results chains as the framework, we constructed fuzzy cognitive models to explore the relative impact of program activities on social and ecological attributes. To prioritize indicators to monitor, we combined our fuzzy modelling results with an assessment of the perceived importance of different attributes for stakeholders in the water fund. We used the selected indicators to design a monitoring program that will allow the water fund to track and communicate its impact over the long-term.",

            "abstract": "The Rungwe Volcanic Province is the southernmost expression of volcanism in the East African Rift System. Rungwe magmatism is focused in a transfer zone between two weakly extended rift segments, unlike more developed rifts where magmatism occurs along segment axes (e.g. mid-ocean ridges). Rungwe was selected as the site of the multinational SEGMeNT project, an integrated geophysical, geochronological and geochemical study to determine the role of magmatism during early stage continental rifting. Argon geochronology is underway for an extensive collection of Rungwe volcanic rocks to date the eruptive sequence with emphasis on the oldest events. The age and location of the earliest events remains contested, but is critical to evaluating the relationship between magmatism and extension. Dated samples are further analyzed to model the geochemistry and isotopic signature of each melt’s source and define it as lithospheric, asthenospheric, or plume.\nGiven the goals, the geochronology focuses on mafic lavas most likely to preserve the geochemical signature of the mantle source. Groundmass was prepared and analyzed at the LDEO AGES lab. Twelve preliminary dates yield ages from 8.5 to 5.7Ma, consistent with prior results, supporting an eruptive episode concurrent with tectonic activity on the Malawi and Rukwa border faults (Ebinger et al., JGR 1989; 1993). Three additional samples yield ages from 18.51 to 17.6 Ma, consistent with the 18.6 ±1.0 Ma age obtained by Rasskazov et al. (Russ. Geology & Geophys. 2003). This eruptive episode is spatially limited to phonolite domes in the Usangu Basin and a mafic lava flow on the uplifted Mbeya Block. These eruptions predate the current tectonic extensional structure, suggesting magmatism predates extension, or that the two are not highly interdependent. No Rungwe samples dated yet can be the source of the of 26Ma carbonatitic tuffs in the nearby Songwe River Basin sequence (Roberts et al., Nature Geoscience 2012). Isochron ages from mica separates of two carbonatite complexes upstream in the drainage basin were dated and yield Jurassic ages of 165.7 ±1.3 Ma for Panda Hill and 154.2 ±0.9 Ma for Mbalizi, older than prior age estimates (Bowden, Nature 1962; Pentel’kov & Voronovskly, Doklady Akad Nauk 1977). These results leave the source of tuffs in the Songwe River Basin unresolved.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic testing is a fundamental strategy for characterizing the properties of an aquifer (permeability and storage coefficients) that exert major control over flow and transport in the subsurface. In common practice, hydraulic testing takes place through either an instantaneous change in head – a.k.a. a slug test – or through a continuous injection or extraction of water – a.k.a. a constant rate pumping test. Both of these strategies are easily implemented and time-tested in the field. The meanings of the aquifer parameters obtained through such testing have been shown to be quite different, however. In the former case, slug testing is known to have a small “sensed” volume, and is thus very sensitive to near-well properties, which can present issues if wellbore skin is present. In the latter case, constant-rate pumping tests have been shown to produce parameter estimates that are more representative of the geometric mean over a large averaging volume.\nThough less commonly practiced, oscillating flow tests represent another hydraulic testing strategy that provides information about aquifer flow properties. One key advantage of using this strategy is that the chosen frequency of the oscillating flow represents a way to control the volume sensed. Thus, the use of oscillating flow tests at multiple frequencies holds the promise of connecting disparate scales of “effective” aquifer hydraulic properties. Additionally, oscillating flow tests can often be represented using fast-running \"steady periodic\" numerical models (see abstract image). In this presentation, I review recent research on both the science and the practice of oscillatory flow testing. In particular, I discuss: 1) different implementation strategies for oscillatory testing in the field, along with their particular benefits and drawbacks for interpretation; and 2) the interpretation of these tests in difficult environments such as unconfined aquifers and fractured rock aquifers.",

            "abstract": "A foreland (Ganges) and a suture (Brahmaputra) river, which both drain the Himalaya, have coalesced to form Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta (GBD), the world’s largest. The GBD progrades along the continental margin, coupled with an advancing subduction to collision transition, deforming the delta as it grows. A better understanding of this time-transgressive system is urgent now that humans are increasing their forcing of the system and exposure to environmental hazards. Among these, earthquake risk is rapidly growing as people move from rural settings into expanding cities, creating unprecedented exposure. The megathrust 1950 M8.7 earthquake in Assam occurred during the monsoon and released 10x the annual sediment load, causing progradation at the coast and a pulse of river widening that propagated downstream. The 1762 M8.8(?) along the Arakan coast extended into the shelf of the delta where coastal tsunami deposits have been identified recently. These events bracket a segment with no credible historic megathrust earthquakes, but could affect far more people. Geodetic and geologic data along this 300 km boundary facing the GBD show oblique contraction. The subaerial accretionary prism (Burma Ranges) is up to 250 km wide with a blind thrust front that reaches ½ way across the delta. The GPS convergence rate of 14 mm/y is consistent with large displacements and long interseismic times, which can account for lack of historic ruptures, but also the potential for catastrophic events. Active folds and shallow thrust earthquakes point to an additional threat from upper-plate seismicity. Much of the current seismicity is in the lower-plate and reaches as far west as Dhaka; it may pose an immediate threat. The folds, and the uplift and subsidence patterns also influence the courses of the rivers. North of the delta, the Shillong plateau is a huge basement cored anticline bounded by the north-dipping Dauki thrust fault. 7 mm/y of N-S shortening and 5 km of structural relief here are consistent with a Pleistocene age for the structure. Subsidence of its foreland has created the seasonal inland sea in Sylhet and influences avulsions of the Brahmaputra. The 1897 M8.0 earthquake caused maximum intensities on the western part of the Shillong massif, suggesting a rupture of the western Dauki fault, leaving the eastern portion as a possible gap.",

            "abstract": "Soil’s potential as a carbon sink for atmospheric CO2 has been widely discussed. Studies of soil organic carbon (SOC) controls, and the subsequent models derived from their findings, have focussed mainly on North American and European regions, and more recently, in regions such as China. In Australia, agricultural practices have led to losses in SOC. This implies that Australian soils have a large potential for increases in SOC. Building on previous work, here we examine the spatial and temporal variation in soil organic carbon (SOC) and its controlling factors controls across a large catchment of approximately 600 km2 in the Upper Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Australia, using data collected from two sampling campaigns, (April 2006 and June-July 2014). Remote sensing using Landsat (30m) and MODIS (250m) NDVI was used to determine if catchment SOC could be predicted using both low and high resolution remote sensing . Relationships between SOC and elevation, aboveground biomass (as represented by NDVI), topographic wetness index (TWI), and incident solar radiation as a surrogate for soil temperature were compared. Initial results demonstrate that higher spatio-temporal resolution may not be necessary for predicting SOC at larger scales. The relationship between SOC and the environmental tracer 137-Cesium as a surrogate for the loss of SOC by erosion also suggests that sediment transport and deposition influences the distribution of SOC. A model developed for the site suggests that simple linear relationships between vegetation, climate and sediment transport could improve SOC predictions.",

            "abstract": "In many science or engineering problems one needs to estimate parameters in a model on the basis of noisy data. In a Bayesian approach, prior information and the likelihood of the model and data are combined to yield a posterior that describes the parameters. The posterior can be represented by Monte Carlo sampling, which requires repeated evaluation of the posterior, which in turn requires repeated evaluation of the model. This is expensive if the model is complex or if the dimension of the parameters is high.\nPolynomial chaos expansions (PCE) have been used to reduce the computational cost by providing an approximate representation of the model based on the prior and, hence, creating a surrogate posterior. This surrogate posterior can be evaluated inexpensively and without solving the model.\nHere we investigate the accuracy of the surrogate posterior and PCE-based samplers. We show, by analysis of the small noise setting, that the surrogate posterior can be very different from the posterior when the data contains significant information beyond what is assumed in the prior. In this case, the PCE-based parameter estimates are inaccurate. The accuracy can be improved by adaptively increasing the order of the PCE, but the cost may increase too fast for this to be efficient.\nWe illustrate the theory with an example from subsurface hydrodynamics in which we estimate the permeability on the basis of noisy pressure measurements. Our numerical results confirm what we found in theory and indicate that an advanced MC sampler which uses data to generate effective samples can be be more efficient than a PCE-based sampler.",

            "abstract": "The smectite to illite (S-I) reaction has been recognized as a diagenetic process, which typically occurs at relatively high temperature deep sediments over 60°C, impacting on in-situ physical and geochemical conditions. Recent experimental studies showed that anaerobic microbial respiration possibly contributes to promote the S-I reaction at low temperatures by reduction of Fe (III) in smectite (Kim et al. 2004). Nevertheless, the occurrence of low temperature S-I reaction has not been observed in natural marine sediments. We present here an implication for the occurrence of low temperature S-I reaction (<40°C) in the Bering Sea slope sediments, which is based on pore water chemistry and clay mineralogy in sediments drilled down to ~800 m below seafloor (mbsf) at Sites U1343, and U1344 (Bering Sea slope), and U1341 (Bowers Ridge) during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 323. Chemical analyses of pore water from the slope sediments showed that chloride concentrations were slightly decreased from 560 mM near the seafloor to 500 mM at 700 mbsf. Dissolved potassium concentrations decreased from 10 mM to 6 mM. δ18O and δD of pore water increased from 0‰ to 1.5‰ and decreased from –2‰ to –10‰ with increasing depth, respectively. These trends can be attributed to the addition of dehydrated water and the potassium uptake by the S-I reaction. Such trends were not observed from the Bowers Ridge. Illite/smectite mixed layers indicating the intermediate stage of the S-I reaction, were identified only from the slope sediments based on XRD analyses. Concentration ratios of potassium and magnesium in the clay-sized fraction from the slope sediments increased with increasing depth below 300 mbsf, suggesting the potassium uptake into illite by the S-I reaction in-situ. The thermal gradient at Sites U1343 and U1344 was 49.0°C/km and 53.3°C/km, respectively, indicating that the temperature range in the cored sediments is generally lower than 40°C. Based on these evidences, we infer that the low temperature S-I reaction occurs in the Bering Sea slope sediments. A possible explanation for this phenomenon might be that the organic rich continental margin sediments harbors phylogenetically diverse anaerobic microbial communities possibly utilizing Fe(III) and mediating the S-I reaction.",

            "abstract": "SS precursor observations are a powerful tool to study the topography and character of transition zone discontinuities, especially in regions, such as ocean basins, where few seismic stations exist, precluding other high resolution approaches. Still, the available coverage is limited by the distribution of sources and stations, but also by the level of noise and by the fact that, in some distance ranges, interfering seismic phases (e.g. the postcursors to S or Sdiff, and the precursors to ScSScS) mask the weak signal from the SS precursors.\nWe introduce an array data processing tool, the Local Slant-Stack Filter (LSSF), to address the two last issues, and clean up the otherwise noisy SS precursor record sections. We show that these filters are a powerful tool for extracting the weak yet coherent SS precursor signals while removing interfering seismic phases as well as random noise, yielding robust precursor travel time measurements with spatial resolution higher than what can be achieved by the conventional common midpoint stacking method. The effectiveness of the filters are demonstrated by application to synthetic and real data. We systematically apply this filtering method to an SS precursor dataset recorded by the US Transportable Array, which consists of 47 high-quality events with magnitudes ranging from Mw 6.2 to 7.8 and samples a vast region of the Pacific Ocean and its northwest margin, and present maps of 410 and 660 discontinuity topography.

            "abstract": "Land surface model is considered to be a powerful tool to estimate continuous soil water content and surface fluxes. However, simulation error tends to accumulate in the process of model simulation due to the inevitable uncertainties of forcing data and intrinsic model errors. Data assimilation technique considered the uncertainty of the model, update model states during the simulation period, and therefore improve the accuracy of soil water content and surface fluxes estimation. In this study, an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) technique was coupled to a Hydrologically-Enhanced Land Process (HELP) model to update model states including soil water content and surface temperature. The remotely sensed latent heat flux (LE) estimated by Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) was used as the observation value in the data assimilation system to update the model states such as soil water contents and surface temperatures, etc.The model was validated by the observation data in 2006 at Shandong Weishan eco-hydrological station, where the open-loop estimation without state updating was treated as the benchmark run. Results showed that the root mean square error (rmse) of soil water content reduced by 30%-50% compared to the benchmark run, while the surface fluxes also had significant improvement to different extents, among which the rmse of LE estimation from wheat season and maize season reduced by 33% and 44%, respectively. These results demonstrated that the application of data assimilation technique can substantially improve estimation of land surface energy fluxes and soil water states. It is suggested that data assimilation system had great potential to be used in land surface models in agriculture and water management.",

            "abstract": "Lignin is the second most abundant compound, after cellulose, synthesized by plants. Numerous studies have demonstrated that initial lignin concentration is negatively correlated with litter decomposition rate under both laboratory and field conditions. Thus lignin is commonly considered to be a “recalcitrant” compound during litter decomposition. However, lignin can also serve as a radiation-absorbing compound during photodegradation, the process through which solar radiation breaks down organic matter. Here, we synthesize recent studies concerning lignin degradation during litter photodegradation and report results from our study on how photodegradation changes lignin chemistry at a molecular scale. Recent field studies have found that litter with high initial lignin concentration does not necessarily exhibit high mass loss during photodegradation. A meta-analysis (King et al. 2012) even found a weak negative correlation between initial lignin concentration and photodegradation rate. Contradicting results have been reported with regard to the change in lignin concentration during photodegradation. Some studies have found significant loss of lignin during photodegradation, while others have not. In most studies, loss of lignin only accounts for a small proportion of the overall mass loss. Using NMR spectroscopy, we found significant loss of lignin structural units containing beta-aryl ether linkages during photodegradation of a common grass litter, Bromus diandrus, even though conventional forage fiber analysis did not reveal changes in lignin concentration. Both our NMR and fiber analyses supported the idea that photodegradation induced loss of hemicellulose, which was mainly responsible for the litter mass loss during photodegradation. Our results suggest that photodegradation induces degradation, but not necessarily complete breakdown, of lignin structures and consequently exposes hemicellulose and cellulose to microbial decomposition. We conclude that lignin concentration is a poor predictor and poor indicator of photodegradation rate, whereas lignin degradation during photodegradation likely plays a key role in \"priming\" litter for microbial decomposition.",

The reconstructed precipitation is validated by comparing with Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) monthly precipitation over the American River watershed (ARW) in Northern California. The correlation coefficient and the Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient were 0.925 and 0.793, respectively. Then, the basin-average precipitation over ARW is analyzed. The analysis shows that the annual basin-average precipitation increased during the reconstructed period. The mean monthly precipitation of the late period (wy1872-1940) is higher for every month than that of the early period (wy1940-2008). Moreover, frequency analyses of 6-, 12-, 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-hour accumulated basin-average precipitation were conducted.

            "abstract": "The South China Sea could be separated into several sub-basins. Among all, the eastern subbasin of the South China Sea occupies the largest portion. The importance of this basin is that the eastern basin holds the main key of understanding the tectonic evolution of the South China Sea. Besides, its subduction southeastward beneath the Philippine islands along the Manila Trench may generate big earthquakes and/or tsunamis affecting the coastal countries surrounding the South China Sea. To better understand the tectonics of the eastern South China Sea basin and the Manila Trench, we have conducted a marine geophysical survey from June 23 to July 13, 2014. Our results show that the extinct mid-ocean-ridges of the basin are displayed en echelon. The ridge subduction beneath the Luzon Island probably does not occur or is just in the early beginning. For the seafloor spreading of the eastern South China Sea, there was probably no ridge jump in magnetic lineation 7 as suggested by Taylor and Hayes or Briais et al. Based on the analysis of our new reflection seismic profiles, bathymetric and magnetic data, the tectonic evolution of the eastern South China Sea basin could be described in three stages. Before magnetic lineation 7, the oceanic crust spread in N-S direction. Between magnetic lineations 7 (~25Ma) and 6c (~20 Ma), the seafloor spreading was in NW-SE direction. However, the supply of the upwelling magma along the mid-ocean-ridges was increasing during this second stage, especially in the eastern side. The abnormal supply of magma thus caused the fan-shaped seafloor spreading fabrics of the eastern South China Sea. Even after the cessation of the seafloor spreading, a supply of the upwelling magma had continued between 20 and 16 Ma, which caused the disturbed sedimentary layers, mainly in the middle area of the basin.",

HadGEM2-ES temperature simulation compares well with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis over the 1979–2004 periods, except for a summer overestimation in Central Africa, and a winter underestimation in tropical West Africa. The precipitation simulation compared well with the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) data from 1979 to 2004 over the entire Africa, except in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), where the model fails to capture adequately the transition phase of the monsoon circulation. The dry regimes over Northern Africa as well as the wetter regime occurring over Central Africa, which is mainly regulated by the ITCZ displacement, and during the austral summer of Southern Africa, are also fairly reproduced by the HadGEM2-ES model. The model projects for the end of the 21st century a rainy South Africa, a change of the flood/drought cycle in the Tropics and a warming over the whole continent, varying from 3 to 7 ∘ C. HadGEM2-ES performance for Nigeria shows good reproduction of precipitation seasonal cycles for some locations, outside the ITCZ. However, the comparison with in situ measurement in Ilorin and Lagos shows the model is not being able to reproduce the precipitation annual cycle. Future projections for Nigeria exhibit warming everywhere and an enhancement of precipitation, especially in the northern part of the country.",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of naturally reduced zones is quite common in alluvial aquifers in the western U.S.A. due to the burial of woody debris in flood plains. The naturally reduced zones are heterogeneously dispersed in such aquifers and are characterized by high concentrations of organic carbon and reduced phases, including iron sulfides and reduced forms of metals, including uranium(IV). The persistence of high concentrations of dissolved uranium(VI) at uranium-contaminated aquifers on the Colorado Plateau has been attributed to slow oxidation of insoluble uranium(IV) mineral phases that are found in association with these natural reducing zones, although there is little understanding of the relative importance of various potential oxidants. Three field experiments were conducted within an alluvial aquifer adjacent to the Colorado River near Rifle, CO wherein groundwater associated with naturally reduced zones was pumped into a gas-impermeable tank, mixed with a conservative tracer (Br-), bubbled with a gas phase composed of 97% O2 and 3% CO2, and then returned to the subsurface in the same well from which it was withdrawn. Within minutes of re-injection of the oxygenated groundwater, dissolved uranium(VI) concentrations increased from less than 1 µM to greater than 2.5 µM, demonstrating that oxygen can be an important oxidant for uranium in these field systems if supplied to the naturally reduced zones. Small concentrations of nitrate were also observed in the previously nitrate-free groundwater, and Fe(II) decreased to the detection limit. These results contrast with other laboratory and field results in which oxygen was introduced to systems containing high concentrations of mackinawite (FeS) rather than the more crystalline iron sulfides found in aged, naturally reduced zones. The flux of oxygen to the naturally reduced zones in the alluvial aquifers occurs mainly through interactions between groundwater and gas phases at the water table, and seasonal variations of the water table at the Rifle, CO site may play an important role in introducing oxygen into the system. Although oxygen was introduced directly to the naturally reduced zones in these experiments, delivery of oxidants to the system may normally be controlled by other oxidative pathways in which oxygen plays an indirect role.",

            "abstract": "The electron radiation belts undergo drastic changes on a variety of timescales ranging from minutes to decades. Here we concentrate on the rapid evolution of outer electron radiation belt on a timescale of hours observed by RBSP and THEMIS satellites on 26 May 2013. The outer boundary of the electron radiation belt moved from L=5.5 to L>6.07 during about 6 hours. Near the outer boundary (L=6.0), the 30keV-5MeV electron fluxes increased by up to four orders of magnitude. We propose a two-step scenario involving substorm injection and the subsequent chorus-driven acceleration to explain this rapid extension event. The substorm injection alone can cause 100% and 20% of the total subrelativistic (<0.2MeV) and relativistic (2-5MeV) electron flux enhancements within a few minutes. Such injection process was sequentially recorded by the two radially displaced RBSP satellites. The subsequent stochastic acceleration by chorus waves can yield 60%-80% of the total energetic (0.2-5.0MeV) electron flux enhancement within about 6 hours. The strong chorus waves were simultaneously detected by the RBSP and THEMIS satellites, and such local acceleration process is supported by the data-driven STEERB simulations. The current results clearly illustrate the respective importance of substorm injection and chorus waves for the evolution of radiation belt electrons at different energies on a relatively short timescale.",

However, non-linear EPL's, peff=pc-αs(pf, pc)pf, where the secant coefficient αs(pf, pc) is a function of pc and pf, should be expected in non-linear elastic rocks [Robin, 1978] and have been previously reported for permeability in low-permeability sandstones [Li et al, 2009, 2014]. A new method for experimentally determining non-linear EPL's for permeability was tested on low-permeability sandstones from reservoirs in China. The permeability of these low-permeability sandstones was measured while simultaneously cycling pf and pc (with 0 ≤ pf < pc). Based on the analysis of the experimental data using the Response Surface Method [Box and Draper, 1987], a contour map of permeability was drawn in the plane [pf, pc], from which the secant coefficient αs(pf, pc) and the effective pressure peff(pf, pc) were calculated. We found that αs(pf, pc) varied in the entire theoretically allowed range, φ ≤ αs(pf, pc) ≤ 1, where φ is the porosity. It is most interesting that αs(pf, pc) could be approximately described as a decreasing function αs(pc-pf) of Terzaghi’s differential pressure. Moreover, the non-linear EPL determined using the new method allowed a better estimation of the pressure dependence of permeability, k(peff), than classic Terzaghi' law, k(pc-pf).",

Extreme\nand moderate active peaks are obtained based on the amplitude of 7-25-day filtered\nrainfall series. By detecting the LPSs that formed over the Indian monsoon region, it\nwas found that about 59% (62%) of extreme (moderate) active peaks of rainfall are\nrelated to LPSs. These LPSs have horizontal scale of about 600 km and vertical scale\nof about 9 km. For the extreme active peak, the locations of the LPS centers are\nclustered significantly over and around Bangladesh, accompanied by the maximum\nconvergence in the southeast sector of the LPSs. After their formation, they tend to\nremain almost stationary over and around Bangladesh. In contrast, for the moderate\nactive peak, the LPS centers are located over the Ganges Plain around 85°E, and the\nmaximum convergence of the LPSs occurs around their centers. This difference in the\nconvergence fields is associated closely with the geographical features to the north\nand east of Bangladesh and the horizontal scale of the LPSs. These features suggest\nthat the amplitude of the active peaks in the submonthly scale ISO is modulated by\nsmall differences in the locations of the LPS centers. These findings suggest that\nimproved predictions of both genesis location and the tracks of the LPSs are crucial to\nforecasting seasonal rainfall over Bangladesh.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of global climate during the past 34 million years is characterized by a transition from warm conditions with unipolar continental glaciation, to the bipolar ice sheets of the present. Much of our knowledge about the chronology of cryosphere development is based upon deep-sea benthic foraminiferal δ18O compilations that integrate global ice volume and regional deep ocean temperature. To deconvolve these mixed signals, the reconstruction of global ice volume typically requires the application of temperature proxy methods and/or global climate/ice-sheet models. These approaches have proven powerful, yet contribute their own uncertainty, particularly when the ice-volume signal is small. In this study we consider a novel means to constrain Cenozoic glaciation history through an assessment of the stochastic component of climate, using a new composite benthic d18O record, noise parameter estimation, and quantitative sedimentation models. We demonstrate that the relatively long climate response time diagnostic of continental ice sheets is imparted on observed stochastic benthic foraminiferal d18O variability, and is quantifiable using “noise response time” (NRT). Evaluation of changes in NRT using the new d18O composite identifies the proposed Cenozoic glaciation (“Oi” and “Mi”) events - as well as some new events - and provides new evidence for their magnitudes. Overall, assessment of the d18O composite in the context of stochastic variability provides unique insights into climate system history, complementing the evaluation of astronomical forcing/pacing, and yielding new quantitative constraints on previously ambiguous aspects of cryosphere development during the Cenozoic.",

            "abstract": "Past ecosystem responses to fire and climate change have been well studied in many parts of the Pacific Northwest, but forest history of the southern Cascades is poorly understood. Pollen and charcoal records from Hobart Lake (42.099°N, 122.482°W, 1458m) in southwestern Oregon were analyzed to reconstruct past changes in vegetation and fire activity. The watershed today supports mixed conifer forest of Abies, Pseudotsuga, Cupressaceae, and Pinus. From 8000 to 3500 cal yr BP, the forest had more xerophytic species, such as Pinus and Cupressaceae, and higher frequency of fires than at present, suggesting a climate that was warmer and drier than current conditions. The last 3500 cal years was characterized by increasing mesophytic taxa, such as Abies and Pseudotsuga, and decreasing fire activity; these trends are consistent with the establishment of cooler wetter conditions in the late Holocene. Changes in the abundance of Abies and Pseudotsuga pollen were compared at multiple sites to better understand their history in relation to long-term variations in climate and local disturbance. The pollen record suggests that Abies (i.e., Abies concolor, A. magnifica, A. amabilis or A. grandis) was abundant during the late-glacial period in a widespread subalpine forest that was present at all elevations. The genus declined in abundance during the early Holocene when it was best represented at higher elevations. Abies species gradually became more widespread and abundant during the mid- and late Holocene consistent with cooler conditions and expansion of closed mesic forest. Pseudotsuga was most abundant at low-elevation sites in the Coast and Cascade ranges during the early Holocene and then most abundant in more southern, mid-elevation sites in the Klamath and southern Cascade ranges in the late Holocene. Thus, the regional conifer history was strongly governed by variations in the summer insolation as they relate to changes in summer effective moisture.",

OMI NO2, SO2 and Aerosol Index (AI) observations from 2005 to 2013 were analyzed, and successfully characterize emissions from major flaring sources in the Persian Gulf region. The SO2/NO2 ratio can distinguish flaring regions with relatively high SO2 component, from urban and industrial areas, where domestic heating, internal combustion of motor vehicles and power generation with a relatively high NO2 component dominate. Concentrations of these gases over facilities for production and export of oil reflect the economic recession of 2008/9 and reduced oil exports due to sanctions imposed in 2012.

            "abstract": "Elevated salinity of the lower Rio Grande River deteriorates water quality and limits domestic and agricultural water use. Both natural and anthropogenic processes contribute salts in the Rio Grande. Previous studies have focused on natural salt contributions with less emphasis on anthropogenic sources of salinity in the Rio Grande. Using (234U/238U) activity ratios (UAR), 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios, and major element concentrations, we aim to trace and quantify the salt loads in the Lower Rio Grande watershed which is greatly impacted by agricultural activities. Between 2009 and 2010, we sampled the Rio Grande stretch and irrigation return flows between the Elephant Butte Reservoir, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. Furthermore, we monitored in monthly intervals the temporal changes of chemical and isotopic compositions of the Rio Grande at Canutillo, Tx.\nOur results show higher U and Sr fluxes in the Rio Grande during the irrigation season as compared to the non-irrigation season. The UAR (1.62 to 2.13) and 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.7099 to 0.7138) were higher in the non-irrigation season compared to the irrigation season (UAR: 1.69 to 1.77; 87Sr/86Sr: 0.7100 to 0.7106). These variations of UAR and 87Sr/86Sr ratios imply multiple sources of U and Sr in the Rio Grande. In contrast, the agricultural return flows show a narrow range of UAR (1.31 to 1.37) and 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.7091 to 0.7099) in the studied seasons. This is consistent with salinity contributions from agricultural sources. Rio Grande at Canutillo shows low UAR (1.62 to 1.77) and 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.7104 to 0.7105) during the irrigation season as compared to the non-irrigation season (UAR: 2.04 to 2.24; 87Sr/86Sr: 0.7105 to 0.7109). The low U and Sr signature at Canutillo during the irrigation season is close to that of the agricultural return flows, indicative of agricultural salinity sources. These results provide useful elemental and isotopic constraints for future mass balance calculations of salinity inputs in the Rio Grande River.",

We investigate mechanisms by which biogenic and biomass burning aerosols originating from the Northwest United States are transported to the marine atmosphere. We present data showing the spatial extent to which these particles impact the free troposphere above marine stratocumulus and highlight their influence on cloud water composition and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN).

The zonal electric fields, within ±30 degrees in magnetic latitude, are compared at periods one and two days before the storm onset and the time during the storm, which precisely shows the perturbed electric fields at different local times and different magnetic latitudes.

            "abstract": "Early diagenetic carbonate cements (authigenic carbonate) have been hypothesized to form significant sinks for carbon during intervals of widespread oceanic anoxia. We examined rocks of the Eagle Ford Group in core (McMullen County, south Texas) and outcrop (Lozier Canyon and Antonio Creek, Terrell County, west Texas) to determine controls on authigenic carbonate formation. Rocks in both locations were deposited in shallow platform settings above storm wave base, with western samples showing evidence of greater current activity and occasional bioturbation under oxic conditions, particularly during the Turonian. Rocks from the south Texas core were deposited under almost uniformly anoxic conditions.\nIn outcrop, carbonate-rich lithologies occur as distinct beds interbedded with organic-rich shale, and as nodules or partially compacted nodular beds. Microscopically, carbonate occurs as foraminifer tests, inoceramid fragments, coarse void filling cements, disseminated silt-sized grains, and lenticular masses, with cements comprising 5-80% of rocks by volume. Foraminifer cavity fill defines a paragenetic sequence of early calcite followed by ±kaolinite, pyrite, and late calcite. This sequence is consistent with diagenesis under metal reducing to sulfate reducing conditions, occasionally in the presence of volcanic ash. Cements thus formed under a variety of pore fluid conditions likely controlled by anaerobic microbial metabolisms partially constrained by the redox state of the overlying water column.\nBulk carbonate carbon isotopic compositions record three negative excursions of up to 5‰ indicating early diagenetic incorporation of oxidized organic matter. Associated diagenetic Ba-rich celestine, SrSO4, together with hydraulic lags of detrital celestine, indicate pervasive early dissolution of high-Sr carbonates in or around the sulfate reducing zone of the sediment column. Co-occurrence of negative isotopic excursions, celestine deposits, multiple ash beds, and apatite clast conglomerates and sandstones indicate episodes of overall sediment starvation. Authigenic carbonate burial was thus controlled primarily by anaerobic microbial processes, and constrained by the redox state of the water column and the duration of exchange with pore fluids.",

            "abstract": "The movement of glaciers and ice sheets through sliding over bedrock depends on the configuration of the subglacial hydrological system. Over time, the glacier erodes the bedrock, which in turn changes water drainage pathways, the overall interaction with the ice, and potentially sliding rates. Drainage can take many forms. At the largest scale, subglacial lakes tens of kilometers in length store water, but the individual pathways are often on the order of meters or smaller. Studies at such a fine scale are only possible by looking at deglaciated beds to infer water drainage. 3D mapping can resolve centimeter scale features and inform studies of the processes that created them. In this survey, Agisoft Photoscan’s structure from motion algorithm is used to create a map of Umpire Rock in New York’s Central Park from digital photographs. Over 3300 photographs are taken at a separation of roughly half a meter to cover the 1000 square meter survey area. The surface is imaged in separate sections and the resulting point clouds are each aligned with a central section using Photoscan’s Align Chunks tool. This process allows additional areas to easily be added to the 3D map. The scale of the final model is accurate to 1mm across the survey area and 3D meshes with a surface resolution of up to 5mm can be created. The distribution of striation directions and sizes on surfaces across the outcrop gives the overall flow direction of the ice and, more locally, illustrates how ice deforms around bedrock features. In addition to striations, we identify cavities and subtle drainage features that are oblique to ice flow. This study demonstrates the relative ease of 3D mapping bedrock outcrops from digital photographs, and indicates the utility of applying this process to more recently deglaciated areas.",

            "abstract": "Drought is of global concern for society but it originates as a local problem. It has a significant impact on water quantity and quality and influences food, water, and energy security. The consequences of drought vary in space and time, from the local scale (e.g. county level) to regional scale (e.g. state or country level) to global scale. This study addresses a local-scale agricultural drought anatomy in Story County in Iowa, USA. This complex problem was evaluated using assimilated AMSR-E soil moisture and MODIS-LAI data into a crop model to generate surface and sub-surface drought indices to explore the anatomy of an agricultural drought. It was found that both surface and subsurface droughts have an impact on crop yields, albeit with different magnitudes, however, the total water available in the soil profile seemed to have a greater impact on the yield. We envisaged that the results of this study will enhance our understanding of agricultural droughts in different parts of the world.",

            "abstract": "Deep geological disposal is currently considered as the most appropriate method to isolate high level radioactive wastes (HLRWs) from the ecosystem. If groundwater seeps into underground disposal facilities, water molecules can be dissociated to radicals or peroxides, which can oxidize metal canisters and HLRWs. The oxidized radionuclides with a high solubility can be dissolved in the groundwater. Some dissolved radionuclides can act as oxidants. The continuous radiolysis of water molecules, which results from continuous seepage of groundwater, can enable the continuous production of the radioactive oxidants, resulting in an increase in concentration of oxidants. In this study, the effect of oxidant concentration on iron oxidation in the presence of salt was evaluated. Zero valent iron (ZVI) particles were reacted with Cr(VI) solutions with initial Cr(VI) concentrations ranged from 50 to 300 mg/L in reactors. The initial pH and NaCl concentration were fixed at 3 and 0.5 M, respectively. An increase in the initial Cr(VI) concentration caused an increase in the rate and extend of H2 gas production. The decrement of Cr(VI) was increased as the initial Cr(VI) concentration was increased. The penetration of H+ ions in the presence Cl- ions through the passive film on the ZVI particles caused the reaction between H+ ions and ZVI particles, producing H2 gas and Fe2+ ions. The passive film was damaged during the reaction due to the eruption of H2 gas or peptization by Cl- ions. The Fe2+ ions were reacted with Cr(VI) ions in the solution, producing Fe(III)-Cr(III) (oxy)hydroxides on the passive film of ZVI particles or in the solution as colloidal particles. The Fe(III)-Cr(III) (oxy)hydroxides tends to be precipitated as colloidal particles at a high Cr(VI) concentration and precipitated on the passive film at a low Cr(VI) concentration. The passive film was repaired or thickened by additional formation of Fe(III)-Cr(III) (oxy)hydroxides at a lower Cr(VI) concentration.",

            "abstract": "The degradation of ice-rich permafrost in lowland ecosystems may have particularly strong ecological impacts due to the potential for thaw settlement and subsequent water impoundment. We examined the effects of fire disturbance on permafrost across a chronosequence of fire scars (1930-2010) in the forested areas of collapse-scar bog complexes in the Tanana Flats of Interior Alaska, and utilized a thermal permafrost model (GIPL) to assess the roles of soil physical properties and historic climate. Field-based calculations of potential thaw settlement following the loss of ice-rich permafrost ranged from 0.4 m to 0.9 m. This subsidence would cause the surface elevations of current day forests to drop, on average, to 0.1 m below the surface water level of adjacent collapse-scar bogs, likely resulting in water impoundment. However, the vulnerability of permafrost to deep thawing and talik formation was variable among fire scars due to heterogeneity in organic layer thickness, soil texture, moisture, and associated thermal properties. Simulated reductions in organic layer thickness predicted talik formation in peat and silt loam-dominated soils, but not in sandy loams. The vulnerability of permafrost to talik formation increased under the climatic conditions since 1970, which were characterized by higher air temperatures. Pronounced permafrost thawing occurred during periods of high snow accumulation, whereas periods of low snow accumulation appeared to facilitate permafrost recovery. Simulations of the complete removal of the organic layer (high severity fire) in silt loam-dominated sites suggested the long-term loss of permafrost under the climate of the last century. Overall, the influence of fire on permafrost in these lowland ecosystems appears to be dependent on soil physical properties, fire severity, and climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "When CO2 is injected into a deep saline aquifer, the combination of fluid displacement and chemical interaction with groundwater and minerals results in changes to the electrical properties of the storage formation. Geophysical methods that are sensitive to the electrical resistivity and chargeability of the rocks and fluids are used to monitor a modeled CO2 plume. The arrival of supercritical CO2 appears as a resistive pulse as the CO2 displaces water while rising buoyantly. Groundwater becomes carbonated and undergoes a rapid drop in pH. Formation conductivity increases as acidic fluid mobilizes ions in the surrounding rock. A surge of increased conductivity is seen at the plume front as easily-mobilized ions enter the fluid. As the injection proceeds and groundwater flows, this high-conductivity plume front migrates, leaving behind an aquifer largely depleted of highly-mobile ions, with only slightly elevated conductivity. Meanwhile, the dissolution of minerals reduces surface area along the fluid-mineral interface. This causes pore throat widening and reduction of sites where electric charge can build up, thereby reducing the polarizability in the parts of the formation that have encountered the plume. This study looks at monitoring methods that are sensitive to all of these changes in electrical properties at various depths within the earth. These methods include magnetotellurics (MT) and combined DC resistivity and induced polarization (IP). MT is useful for showing large-scale structure using an array that is moveable to cover an arbitrarily large area as the plume expands far beyond initial monitoring locations. MT also allows for phase tensor analysis to clearly show deep resistivity gradients and changes in dimensionality. The active-source nature of DC and IP makes them effective at clearly showing the plume's extent in the region within a few km of the injection well. All methods are modeled in 3D using the planned Kevin Dome carbon storage site in northern Montana as the geologic setting. This site’s location on open prairie affords the use of a novel electrode array that simplifies the field logistics for efficient collection of 3D MT and DC/IP data.",

            "abstract": "Southern Californian urban shrublands are exposed to large amounts of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition, which is altering the carbon (C) and N cycling. It is possible that N inputs are exceeding biotic demand and increasing N losses from leaching and gaseous efflux. Nitrogen input increases microbial processes such as nitrification, which can increase soil nitric oxide (NO) efflux; however, experimentation is needed to understand the environmental controls on NO flux. Thus, a fully factorial laboratory incubation experiment was executed to see how NO efflux of chaparral soil varied as function of N addition, soil temperature, and moisture conditions. We hypothesized that the NO efflux would i) increase as a function of N addition, ii) present an optimum response as a function of soil moisture, and iii) increase as an exponential function of temperature. NO efflux increased with N addition, supporting the hypothesis that an increase in N availability will increase NO efflux. NO efflux also increased as a function of soil temperature and was well-described using the Arrhenius model, and the NO efflux followed an optimum response as a function of soil moisture. In general, the greatest NO efflux was observed from soil exposed to 5 gN/m2, 25% water-filled pore space (WFPS), and a temperature of 34.4°C. There was high sensitivity to temperature changes, especially in soil moisture < 25% WFPS. These conditions are comparable to the normal environmental conditions in chaparral soil (low soil moisture and high temperature), suggesting that chaparral soils may have optimal environmental conditions for nitrification and are important sources of atmospheric NO. We applied our experimental findings to a modified version of the Dual Arrhenius and Michaelis–Menten (DAMM) model (Davidson et al. 2012; Global Change Biology 18, 371–384) and estimated an annual NO efflux of 1.1-2.5 kgN ha-1 y-1 depending on N deposition exposure, which is comparable to what is reported for other chaparral shrublands of southern California.",

            "abstract": "The 2014 flurry of moderate earthquakes in the Los Angeles region raised the concern if some of this or past seismicity was of anthropogenic origin as opposed to being caused by ongoing transpressional tectonics. The Mw5.1 La Habra sequence is located near several major oil fields but the Mw4.4 Encino sequence was located away from oil fields, within the Santa Monica Mountains. The last century of seismicity in the Los Angeles area consists of numerous small and large earthquakes. Most of these earthquakes occur beneath the basin sediments and are associated with transpressional tectonics, related to the big bend in the San Andreas fault, but some could be associated with large oil fields. In particular, both the 1933 Mw6.4 Long Beach and the 1987 Mw5.9 Whittier Narrows earthquakes were spatially associated with two major oil fields, the Huntington Beach and Montebello fields. Numerous large oil fields have been in production for more than 125 years. The geographical locations of the oil fields follow major tectonic trends such as the Newport-Inglewood fault, the Whittier fault, and the thrust belt located at the north edge of the Los Angeles basin. More than 60 fields have oil wells and some of these have both disposal and fracking wells. Before fluid injection became common, Kovach (1974) documented six damaging events induced by fluid extraction from 1947 to 1961 in the Wilmington oil field. Since 1981 the waveform-relocated earthquake catalog for the Los Angeles basin is complete on the average above M2.0. We compare the spatial distribution of these events and the proximity of nearby active oil fields. We will also analyze the seismicity in the context of available monthly fluid extraction and injection volumes and search for temporal correlations. The La Habra sequence apparently correlates with temporal changes in extraction and injection volumes in the Santa Fe Springs oil field but not with activities in other oil fields within closer spatial proximity.",

            "abstract": "Increasingly, research programs including GEM, CEDAR, GEMSIS, GO Canada, and others are focusing on how geospace works as a system. Coupling sits at the heart of system level dynamics. In all cases, coupling is accomplished via fundamental processes such as reconnection and plasma waves, and can be between regions, energy ranges, species, scales, and energy reservoirs. Three views of geospace are required to attack system level questions. First, we must observe the fundamental processes that accomplish the coupling. This “observatory view” requires in situ measurements by satellite-borne instruments or remote sensing from powerful well-instrumented ground-based observatories organized around, for example, Incoherent Scatter Radars. Second, we need to see how this coupling is controlled and what it accomplishes. This demands quantitative observations of the system elements that are being coupled. This “multi-scale view” is accomplished by networks of ground-based instruments, and by global imaging from space. Third, if we take geospace as a whole, the system is too complicated, so at the top level we need time series of simple quantities such as indices that capture important aspects of the system level dynamics. This requires a “key parameter view” that is typically provided through indices such as AE and DsT. With the launch of MMS, and ongoing missions such as THEMIS, Cluster, Swarm, RBSP, and ePOP, we are entering a-once-in-a-lifetime epoch with a remarkable fleet of satellites probing processes at key regions throughout geospace, so the observatory view is secure. With a few exceptions, our key parameter view provides what we need. The multi-scale view, however, is compromised by space/time scales that are important but under-sampled, combined extent of coverage and resolution that falls short of what we need, and inadequate conjugate observations. In this talk, I present an overview of what we need for taking system level research to its next level, and how high latitude ground based observations can address these challenges.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the evolution of oceanic asthenosphere during subduction by exploring various scenarios including plate kinematics and plausible values of asthenosphere viscosity and density. We find that the oceanic asthenosphere will always subduct with the down-going slab as long as its average viscosity value is no smaller than 1×1018 Pa s. In order to allow slabs to subduct into the deep upper mantle, a maximum oceanic asthenosphere density reduction relative to the underlying mantle should be no larger than 0.7%, assuming a 200-km-thick asthenosphere channel. We find that a significant portion of the asthenosphere buoyancy should result from its excess temperature from the long-term thermal evolution of mantle convection. Our results are in contrast to an earlier suggestion that negligible amount (<30 km thick) of asthenosphere could get subducted, which is likely due to over-simplicity of subduction geometry and model boundary conditions.\nThe recycling of a weak and hot asthenosphere provides a novel mechanism for the formation of slow seismic anomalies within the deep mantle. This, in turn, questions the commonly believed deep mantle plume origin of intra-plate volcanism, with a typical example being the Yellowstone volcanic system. Our current results suggest that a buoyant asthenosphere can be dragged down into the lower mantle and then moves upward due to its buoyancy when the overlying slab barrier is removed. To further test our hypothesis, we construct a 4D subduction model for western North America during the Cenozoic. We use data assimilation techniques to incorporate plate kinematics and sea floor ages as boundary conditions, and seismic anomalies converted density structure as internal buoyancy source. The subduction history is calibrated through a hybrid of forward and adjoint simulations satisfying multiple observational constraints. Some preliminary results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The reactivation potential of pre-existing basement structures affects the geometry of subsequent deformation structures. A conceptual model depicting the results of these interactions can be applied to multiple fold-thrust systems and lead to valuable deformation predictions. These predictions include the potential for hydrocarbon traps or seismic risk in an actively deforming area. The Sawtooth Range, Montana, has been used as a study area. A model for the development of structures close to the Augusta Syncline in the Sawtooth Range is being developed using: 1) an ArcGIS map of the basement structures of the belt based on analysis of geophysical data indicating gravity anomalies and aeromagnetic lineations, seismic data indicating deformation structures, and well logs for establishing lithologies, previously collected by others and 2) an ArcGIS map of the surface deformation structures of the belt based on interpretation of remote sensing images and verification through the collection of surface field data indicating stress directions and age relationships, resulting in a conceptual model based on the understanding of the interaction of the two previous maps including statistical correlations of data and development of balanced cross-sections using Midland Valley's 2D/3D Move software. An analysis of the model will then indicate viable deformation paths where prominent basement structures influenced subsequently developed deformation structures and reactivated faults. Preliminary results indicate that the change in orientation of thrust faults observed in the Sawtooth Range, from a NNW-SSE orientation near the Gibson Reservoir to a WNW-ESE trend near Haystack Butte correlates with pre-existing deformation structures lying within the Great Falls Tectonic Zone. The Scapegoat-Bannatyne trend appears to be responsible for this orientation change and rather than being a single feature, may be composed of up to 4 NE-SW oriented basement strike-slip faults. This indicates that the pre-existing basement features have a profound effect on the geometry of the later deformation. This conceptual model can also be applied to other deformed belts to provide a prediction for the potential hydrocarbon trap locations of the belt as well as their seismic risk.",

            "abstract": "Mega tsunamis are the strongest tsunamigenic events of tectonic origin that are characterized by run-up heights up to 40-50 m measured along a considerable part of the coastline (up to 1000 km). One of the most important features of mega-tsunamis is their ability to cross the entire oceanic basin and to cause an essential damage to its opposite coast. Another important feature is their ability to penetrate into the marginal seas (like the Sea of Okhotsk, the Bering Sea) and cause dangerous water level oscillations along the parts of the coast, which are largely protected by island arcs against the impact of the strongest regional tsunamis. Among all known historical tsunamis (nearly 2250 events during the last 4000 years) they represent only a small fraction (less than 1%) however they are responsible for more than half the total tsunami fatalities and a considerable part of the overall tsunami damage. The source of all known mega tsunamis is subduction submarine earthquakes with magnitude 9.0 or higher having a return period from 200-300 years to 1000-1200 years. The paper presents a list of 15 mega tsunami events identified so far in historical catalogs with their basic source parameters, near-field and far-field impact effects and their generation and propagation features. The far-field impact of mega tsunamis is largely controlled by location and orientation of their earthquake source as well as by deep ocean bathymetry features. We also discuss the problem of the long-term tsunami hazard assessment when the occurrence of mega tsunamis is taken into account.",

The timing of the last marine sedimentary rocks thus places a constraint on this first-order tectonic event. Although several sedimentary successions have been reported from southern Tibet their documentation is commonly incomplete or important questions remain regarding stratigraphic continuity and/or the reliability of fossil identifications.\nWe critically assess existing data in order to correlate and compare between sections in three zones: one to the north of the suture on the Asian margin and two to the south on the northern margin of India. We examine the planktonic foraminiferal and nannofossil biostratatigraphy of the youngest sections, which occur in the Tibetan Himalayan succession and lie around 100 km south of the suture. This also includes a previously unreported section 70 km east of Gamba. We also consider the ages of radiolarians from cherts in mélange zones immediately south of the suture zone in Ladakh, NW India and Tibet. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding the timing of continent-continent collision. In doing this we take into account the effects of crustal loading, eustatic sea level variation, orogenesis associated with the on-going convergence between India and Asia together with the likely migration rate of any fore-deep in front of a colliding continental mass.\nOur results demonstrate that a marine seaway remained in existence south of the Yarlung Tsangpo suture zone until at least Priabonian (38-33 Ma) time. Importantly, as all sections are truncated by erosion or faulting we note that this remains a maximum age estimate for the last marine sedimentation in this area.",

The\nplasma bubble was observed in 630-nm airglow images from 1530 UT (0030 LT) to\n1800 UT (0300 LT) and disappeared equatorward at 1800-1900 UT (0300-0400 LT) in\nthe field of view.

At Darwin, the F-layer virtual\nheight suddenly increased from ~200 km to ~260 km at the time of bubble\ndisappearance. However a similar F-layer height increase was not observed over\nthe conjugate point at Yamagawa, indicating that this F-layer rise was caused\nnot by an eastward electric field but by enhancement of the equatorward\nthermospheric wind over Darwin. We think that this enhancement of the\nequatorward neutral wind was caused by an equatorward-propagating large-scale\ntraveling ionospheric disturbance, which was identified in the north-south\nkeogram of 630-nm airglow images. We suggest that either F-region dynamo\nor polarization electric field associated with this equatorward neutral wind\ndrive plasma drift across the magnetic field line to cause the observed bubble\ndisappearance.

Although the X-band InSAR data have relatively lower coherence in vegetation covering areas than the C-band and L-band data, they have the potential to capture finer deformation signals in cities with less influence from ionosphere disturbance. In this study, we utilize X-band TarraSAR data to investigate the accumulated surface deformation from 2008 to 2012 in Beijing and the surrounding regions including Cangzhou and part of Tianjin. Our preliminary result shows that in our research area, the nontectonic deformation signals, such as deformation caused by groundwater withdrawal and viaduct and subway constructions are considerably larger than that of tectonic deformation caused by active faults located in the Zhangjiakou-Bohai seismic zone. The main deformation signals discovered so far are from surface subsidence distributed in the east and north downtown area of Beijing, conforming our previous discoveries using the L-band SAR data. Our result also shows the phenomenon that spatial extents of some subsidence areas are aligned with local faults, this indicating that the groundwater flow may be manifested by physical barriers of faults. Our result will help assessing hazard potentials associated with land subsidence in Beijing and surrounding areas.",

Especially, the Ma River shear zone plays an important role in understanding the mechanism and revolution of the escape process between the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate. In order to have better understanding the seismotectonic structures around the fault zone, this study has carried out a project to deploy 12 temporary broadband seismic stations around/near the Ma River area to record high quality waveform data. In this study, we adopt damping least-square inversion method to investigate the Vp structures and Vp/Vs ratios of the crust and upper mantle beneath the Ma River fault zone, northern Vietnam. From many studies, the velocity structure can be used as an indicator to identify the geometry of fault and precise the earthquake location. Therefore, the goal of this research is to analyze the degree of correlation between the velocity structure and the characteristics of the seismicity, and its tectonic implications. Finally the distribution of Vp/Vs ratio and its association with fault activities is also investigated. Our results indicate that the variation of velocity structure beneath the Ma River fault zone is caused by local geological structures, and the earthquake clusters are located between the Ma River fault and the Song-La fault in the northern Vietnam. Besides, the obtained focal mechanisms from the tomography inversion also exhibit that the orientations are northeast-southwest trending with normal faulting nearby the Ma river fault and should be highly correlation with local geological structures. Based on the analysis of focal mechanism solutions, this area is in extension status which is consistent with the geological survey. Finally, we find a dense cluster occurred in the bending segment of the Ma River fault, and according to the distribution of seismic events, there may exist a south-dipping fault in the southern part of Ma River fault. However, this argument needs to be investigated more in future study.",

            "abstract": "Dispersion mechanisms have been examined in-depth in natural catchments in previous studies. However, these dispersion mechanisms have been studied little in urban catchments, where artificial transport elements and morphological arrangements are expected to modify travel times and mobilize excess rainfall from spatially distributed impervious sites. Thus, these features can modify the variance of the catchment’s travel times and hence the total dispersion. This work quantifies the dispersion mechanisms in an urban catchment using the theory of transport by travel times as represented by the Urban Morpho-climatic Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (U-McIUH) model. This model computes travel times based on kinematic wave theory and accounts explicitly for the path heterogeneities and altered connectivity patterns characteristic of an urban drainage network. The analysis is illustrated using the Aubinière urban catchment (France) as a case study. We found that kinematic dispersion is dominant for small rainfall intensities, whereas geomorphologic dispersion becomes more dominant for larger intensities. The total dispersion scales with the drainage area in a power law fashion. The kinematic dispersion is dominant across spatial scales up to a threshold of approximately 2-3 km2, after which the geomorphologic dispersion becomes more dominant. Overall, overland flow is responsible for most of the dispersion, while conduits tend to counteract the increase of the geomorphologic dispersion with a negative kinematic dispersion. Further studies with other catchments are needed to assess whether the latter is a general feature of urban drainage networks.",

ST includes surface air temperature (SAT), surface skin temperature (Ts), and subsurface water or soil temperature at a given depth [T(z)]. In this presentation, we will review our recent work on land and ocean ST.\nOver land, we have developed the first global 0.5 deg hourly SAT datasets from 1948-2009 by merging in situ CRU data with reanalysis data. Using these datasets, over high latitudes in winter the monthly averaged diurnal temperature range is found to be much larger than the range of monthly averaged hourly temperature diurnal cycle. The former primarily reflects the movement of synoptic weather systems, while the latter is primarily affected by the diurnal radiative forcing. We have also compared Ts from satellite remote sensing (MODIS) and land modeling (CLM) with in situ measurements. For instance, we have identified five factors contributing to the Ts differences between the model and MODIS.\nOver ocean, we have developed a prognostic Ts parameterization for modeling and data analysis. For instance, the inclusion of the Ts diurnal cycle affects atmospheric processes at diurnal, intraseasonal, and longer time scales. Furthermore, our parameterization provides the relationship between water temperature T(z) at different depths and Ts, and hence helps to merge temperature data from satellite infrared and microwave sensors and in situ buoy and ship measurements.",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal alteration processes can change crustal magnetization by destruction and creation of magnetic minerals. In the Yokoniwa hydrothermal vent field (YHVF), located at the NTO-massif in the Central Indian Ridge, a high magnetization zone (with ~12 A/m in ~200 m-scale) was discovered by previous deepsea AUV survey. Basalts and ultramafic rocks were found around the YHVF, however the origin of magnetic high and its relationship with hydrothermal activity are remains to be investigated. Therefore, we conducted additional magnetic field measurement, rock sampling, and geological observation using submersible Shinkai 6500 during the YK09-13 and YK13-03 cruises.\nVector geomagnetic field were obtained along the dive tracks at an altitude of ~ 10 m. The crustal absolute magnetization is estimated using the 2D and 3D forward modeling technique. The values of magnetization show ~10 A/m just around the YHVF. This value is consistent with that of equivalent magnetization deduced from AUV data.\nRock magnetic characters were measured for 8 basalts, 4 dolerites, 5 sulfides, and 30 serpentinized peridotites (SPs). The measurements of NRM, magnetic susceptibility, magnetic hysteresis, low (6–300K) and high (50–700°C) temperature magnetization curves were performed. The estimated magnetization values are 0.1–6 A/m in basalts, 0.2–0.6 A/m in dolerites, and <0.1 A/m in sulfides. The SPs show strong magnetization of 0.4–11 A/m. The magnetic grain sizes ranges over single domain to pseudo-single domain. The temperature–magnetization curves clearly show the Verway transition and Currie temperature of 580 °C, therefore magnetic carrier of SPs is supposed as pure magnetite, which is created during serpentinization process.\nSerpentinization degree (Sd) was also estimated by grain density measurement based on empirical formula from Oufi et al., 2002. Amount of magnetite was also estimated from saturation magnetization. The results show that the values of Sd vary in a range from 17 to 100 % and the highly serpentinized samples (>85%) have high magnetization (> 6 A/m).\nConsequently, we proposed the presence of highly SP bodies at the YHVF as the origin of the high magnetizaion zone. It was formed by locally alteration of upper mantle section due to the hydrothermal activity.",

In recent years an increasing number of gas seeps or springs, with dominantly abiotic CH4, have been discovered in land-based serpentinized peridotites worldwide. We report the discovery of a new site in the Dun Mountain Ophiolite (DMO), New Zealand. This is the second gas-bearing peridotite discovered so far in NZ, after Poison Bay which was documented in the 1990s. The DMO area is characterized by active and present-day low temperature serpentinization driven by meteoric water, a common process in ophiolites. A localised area of hyperalkaline (pH >11.6) and reduced (-243.4 mV) waters contain relatively high concentrations of dissolved calcium (43.2 ppm) aiding in carbonate precipitation. Directly above these waters flux measurements by closed chamber methods reveal CH4 emission rates exceeding 2800 mg m-2day-1. The δ13C values of CH4 suggest the presence of a dominant abiotic gas component (e.g. -32.7 ‰ VPDB). Additionally, an unusual clear to black gel is released from less alkaline springs elsewhere in the DMO. The origin and nature of this gel-like material is currently unknown.",

To further assess the VIIRS AOD in China which is a heavy polluted region in the world,we made a comparison between VIIRS AOD and CE-318 radiometerobservation at the following three sites overNorth China Plain (NCP): metropolis-Beijing (AERONET), suburbs-XiangHe (AERONET) and regional background site- Xinglong (CARSNET).The results showed the VIIRS AOD at 550 nm has a positive mean bias error (MBE) of 0.14-0.15 and root mean square error (RMBE) 0.20. Among three sites, Beijing is mainly a source of bias with MBE 0.17-0.18 and RMBE 0.23-0.24, and this bias is larger than some recent global statics recently published in the literature. Further analysis shows that this large bias in VIIRS AOD overNCP may be partly caused by the aerosol model selection in VIIRS aerosol inversion. According to the retrieval of sky radiance from CE-318 at three sites, aerosols in NCP have high mean real part of refractive indices (1.52-1.53), large volume mean radius (0.17-0.18) and low concentration (0.04-0.09) of fine aerosol, and small mean radius (2.86-2.92) and high concentration (0.06-0.16) of coarse mode aerosol. These observation-based aerosol single scattering properties and size of fine and coarse aerosols differ fromthe aerosol properties used in VIIRSoperational algorithm.The dominant aerosol models used in VIIRS algorithm for these three sites are less polluted urban aerosol in Beijing and low-absorption smoke in other two sites, all of which don’t agree with the high imaginary part of refractive indices from CE-318 retrieval. Therefore, the aerosol models in VIIRS algorithm are likely to be refined in NCP region.",

            "abstract": "Ice-sheets in the Arctic region are retreating rapidly since late 1990s. Typical ice loss rates are 0.5 - 1 m/yr at the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, ~ 1 m/yr at the Icelandic ice sheets, and several meters per year at the edge of Greenland ice sheet. Such load decreasing causes measurable (several millimeter per year) deformation of the Earth’s crust from Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR). Using small baseline time-series analysis, this signal is retrieved after noises such as orbit error, atmospheric delay and DEM error being removed.\nWe present results from Vatnajokull ice cap, Petermann glacier and Barnes ice cap using ERS, Envisat and TerraSAR-X data. Up to 2 cm/yr relative radar line-of-sight displacement is detected. The pattern of deformation matches the shape of ice sheet very well. The result in Iceland was used to develop a new model for the ice mass balance estimation from 1995 to 2010. Other applications of this kind of technique include validation of ICESat or GRACE based ice sheet model, Earth’s rheology (Young’s modulus, viscosity and so on). Moreover, we find a narrow (~ 1km) uplift zone close to the periglacial area of Petermann glacier which may due to a special rheology under the ice stream.",

            "abstract": "To assess time-dependent probabilistic seismic hazard for Taiwan, we develop a new approach and implement the state-of-the-art parameters of seismogenic sources obtained by Taiwan Earthquake Model (TEM). Based on the information on tectonic setting, geology, geomorphology, and earthquake catalog, four categories of seismogenic source were identified. Those are: (a) regional source, (b) crustal fault source, (c) subduction interface source, and (d) subduction intraslab source. For the treatment of time-dependency, both long-term and short-term impacts are considered. In order to evaluate seismic probability evolution during a long-term period, several recurrence interval models for crustal fault sources were introduced. We examined their feasibility through comparison with observed return periods acquired from excavation data. By implementing occurrence time of last event obtained by instrumental and historical catalogs, long-term evolutions of the occurrence probabilities for crustal fault sources were obtained. The results show lower occurrence probabilities for the faults, which just ruptured at a recent time. For evaluation of short-term rate change, earthquake interaction between different sources in form of stress change was investigated. An increased stress state promoted occurrence of consequent events, while stress decrease inhibits future seismic activity. Through considering ground motion prediction equations for different types of sources and site conditions, time-dependent probabilistic seismic hazard was assessed. Obtained high hazards can mainly be attributed to the crustal active faults with short recurrence intervals or/and long elapsed time of the last events. Thus, higher hazards were evaluated near the active faults in the Coastal Plain in western Taiwan and along the Longitudinal Valley to the East. In northern Taiwan, by contrast, a low hazard level is obtained. It corresponds to inactive tectonics and faults in this region as well as its vicinity. Generally, since there is no significant large events took place recently in Taiwan, the short-term impact in current version is trivial. The time-dependent hazard map can be updated when a significant event take place in the future.",

            "abstract": "The strongly time-averaged nature of molluscan and other biogenic carbonate skeletons in seabeds is an under-appreciated uncertainty in paleoenvironmental inference using geochemical proxies. An extensive shell-dating program on the southern California shelf using AMS-calibrated amino-acid racemization corroborates the strongly right-skewed “L-shape” of shell-age frequency distributions (AFDs) found elsewhere. In California, the median age of aragonitic bivalve shells (2-7 mm, no size effect detected) is generally <100 y (5 of 8 assemblages have medians <50 y), and maximum measured ages are ~2550 to ~11,900 y. Modeling reveals that shells undergo an initial high disintegration rate λ1 (~decadal half-lives) but shift abruptly, within the first ~500 y postmortem, to a 100-fold lower disintegration rate λ2 (~ millennial half-lives) at sequestration rate τ (burial and/or diagenetic stabilization). This drop permits accrual of a long tail of very old shells even when sequestration is very slow, allowing only a minority (<1%) of shells to survive the first phase (Tomasovych et al. 2014 Geology). We suspect that permanent diagenetic stabilization may be necessary to ensure that shells do not revert to λ1 after temporary sequestration in favorable pockets within the mixed layer. Preliminary SEM shows significant coarsening of inner shell-layer crystallites, consistent with Ostwald ripening. New cores from 50-m water depth document such L-shaped AFDs in each 2-cm increment within the upper ~25 cm of the seabed, the local penetration depth of callianassid shrimp, indicating both upward and downward advection of shells. AFDs from deeper core increments, cut off from the input of new shells, have flat (uniform) shapes with millennial-scale median ages; shells at these depths represent the 1% that survive λ1 and are then almost impervious to further destruction. The importance of sequestration (stabilization) to the prolonged persistence of shells and the likely remodeling of shell microstructure, all within the mixed layer, and the coarser temporal resolution of permanently buried shell assemblages, underscore the need to acquire a suite of replicate measurements per increment and to assume that some porewater equilibration of original shell has likely occurred.",

            "abstract": "Ground-based observations of the spatio-temporal evolution of the aurora and related processes have played a critical role in the dramatic advances in substorm research that have unfolded over the THEMIS era. For example, with its unique combination of extent of coverage, and time and space resolution, THEMIS-ASI has shown dynamics unfolding rapidly across surprisingly large distances. Its image sequences show the substorm as part of a system-level dynamic that connects the inner magnetosphere to the distant tail, and perhaps even the dayside. Together with simultaneous observations by the THEMIS spacecraft, the auroral images have also transformed our understanding of magnetic mapping during the growth phase. In this talk I will review some true science highlights that have been enabled by ground-based observations since the launch of THEMIS. I will also highlight how these ground-based observations fall short of capturing key aspects of the dynamics around expansion phase onset. This creates difficulties, for example, in understanding why, how and where dispersionless injections begin. I finish with a discussion of how ground-based observations targeting the substorm have impacted geospace research in general.",

            "abstract": "Although there is a limited understanding of the chemolithoautotrophic activity of aquifer microorganisms, such subsurface microbial activity could greatly influence the cycling of elements such as C, S, N, and Fe. Here, we present transcriptional (RNA-Seq) evidence of the emergence of such chemolithoautotrophic activities in groundwater filter samples from a 2-month experiment in which up to 1.5 mM nitrate (a native electron acceptor) was injected into a perennially suboxic/anoxic aquifer (Rifle, CO) containing a large reservoir of reduced Fe- and S-containing compounds. Illumina sequence data from rRNA-subtracted cDNA libraries was assembled and mapped to phylogenetically binned Rifle metagenome data.\nIndicative of the activity of Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria, many high-abundance transcripts mapped to the Gallionellaceae family, whose known members are chemolithoautotrophic bacteria that catalyze Fe(II) oxidation. For example, included among the most abundant transcripts were a cold-shock protein and an acyl carrier protein with 96-98% protein sequence identity to Gallionella capsiferriformans and a nitrite reductase (nirS) gene likely belonging to a Sideroxydans relative. The apparent activity of Gallionellaceae members is consistent with 16S rRNA iTag analyses of these samples, which indicated that Gallionella-related taxa accounted for up to ~50% of these communities. Evidence of sulfide oxidation also was apparent in these samples. For example, highly expressed subunits of APS reductase were very similar to those of the obligately chemolithoautotrophic S- and Fe(II)-oxidizing Thiobacillus denitrificans in terms of sequence identity (98-99%) and synteny of the mapped scaffold. Also highly expressed were a ß-Proteobacterial Form II RubisCO gene and a hydrazine oxidoreductase gene (93% identity to the planctomycete KSU-1), the latter strongly indicative of anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) activity, which has seldom been reported in aquifer environments. Such gene-level data on CO2 fixation and Fe(II), sulfide, and ammonium oxidation in the Rifle subsurface will contribute to genome-enabled modeling efforts aimed at developing a predictive understanding of biogeochemical processes at the site as part of LBNL's Sustainable Systems Scientific Focus Area (SFA) 2.0.",

            "abstract": "A 14.4 m thick sedimentary sequence was recovered in multiple cores from Lago Lungo in the Rieti Basin, an intrapenninic extensional basin ~80 km north of Rome, Italy. This sequence provides a high-resolution record of environmental change related to climatic influence and anthropogenic landscape alteration. Pollen analyses, corroborated with historical records of land-use change, define the major shifts in forest composition and their historical context. An age model of the sequence was built using ties to regional cultigen datums and archaeomagnetic reference curves. Here we focus on sedimentologic and geochemical data (scanning XRF) from the Roman Period through the Little Ice Age (LIA). The base of the sequence (ca. 680 BCE- 1 CE) is marked by a steady increase in fine-grained detrital elements Ti, Rb, and K, and corresponding decrease in Ca, representing a transition from the unaltered system after the Romans constructed a channel that the basin. The Medieval Period (MP; 900-1350 CE) is lithologically distinct, composed of varicolored bands of alternating silt, clay, and calcareous concretions. Low counts of Ca, high detrital elements and frequent abrupt peaks in levels of the redox elements Fe and Mn indicate episodic clastic influx. Pollen data indicate that the greatest degree of deforestation and erosion occurred during the MP, supported by mean sedimentation rates of ca. 1cm/year, over twice the rate of the underlying interval. The Medieval climate was warmer and more stable, population increased, and elevations >1000 m were exploited for agriculture. The influence of the Velino River on the lake appears to increase during the MP through channel migration, increased flooding, or increased overland flow. The next transition (1350 CE) marks the start of the LIA and is coincident with the Black Plague. Historical records document a large earthquake in 1349 that severely struck Central Italy, with possible effects on the lake’s depositional and hydrochemical regime. Clastic input abruptly ceases at the start of the LIA, and peaks in Sr, Ca, and S may be attributed to changes in lake inflow. Core analyses results, corroborated with historical documentation, provide new insights into the basin history and the underlying causes of environmental change.",

            "abstract": "Kilauea’s ongoing summit eruption began in March 2008 and has been characterized by a lava lake deep within an enlarging pit in Halema‘uma‘u Crater. The level of lava in the lake has exhibited cyclic rise and fall behavior, accompanied by episodic seismic and infrasonic tremor. From 2010 on, this episodic behavior has involved the lake abruptly switching between “spattering” and “non-spattering” regimes. Spattering phases consist of spattering and passive outgassing from the lake, as well as elevated tremor and a vigorous gas plume. Non-spattering phases are associated only with passive outgassing from the lake, with unusually low tremor and a weak gas plume. Non-spattering phases usually last several hours and often correspond with the lava lake level abruptly rising, in some cases up to 20 m. We consider these episodic lava level fluctuations a type of “gas pistoning”, and focus on events in 2010 and 2013-2014.\nWe interpret the gas pistoning to be driven by shallow gas accumulation near the top of the lava lake, based on long-term multidisciplinary monitoring including seismicity, infrasound, gas emission and geochemistry, lake level and surface motion, and robust visual and time-lapse camera observations which comprise a comprehensive characterization of gas pistoning at Kilauea. Competing models for gas pistoning, such as deeply sourced gas slugs, or dynamic pressure balances, are not consistent with the gas geochemistry or other observations at Halema‘uma‘u. The observed spattering regime represents significant decoupling of gas bubbles in the lake, while the non-spattering regime represents gas bubbles largely coupled, and downwelling, with the circulating lava. Gas pistons reflect a slight imbalance in gas influx/outflux at the lake surface during the non-spattering phases, associated with gas accumulating beneath the lake surface. These data illustrate the complex and episodic nature of gas emission from a lava lake. Unlike other lava lakes which have cyclic behavior that is thought to be controlled by deeply sourced processes external to the lake itself, the lake at Halema`uma`u Crater provides an example of lava lake fluctuations driven by cycles of activity that are shallowly rooted.",

            "abstract": "Splitting of P-to-S converted phases at the core-mantle boundary (XKS, including SKS, PKS, and SKKS) is a very effective tool to measure seismic anisotropy, which is mostly caused by deformational processes in the Earth’s lithosphere and asthenosphere. Consequently, patterns of seismic anisotropy revealed by shear-wave splitting (SWS) measurements are widely used in constraining the strength and direction of mantle flow. However, the currently available SWS measurements were obtained by a large number of research groups using different methods, resulting in a heterogeneous database. Specifically, different data selection and ranking criteria were employed, which led to many controversial results. In addition, splitting parameters obtained by the majority of the previous studies were presented as station-averages, which prevent the identification of complex anisotropy. This presentation reports preliminary results from an ongoing study using all the broadband XKS data available at the IRIS Data Management Center recorded in Africa and Arabia. More than 360 stations located in the region were used to produce a uniform SWS database. A robust process to reliably assess and objectively rank XKS splitting parameters is used to produce these results [Liu and Gao, 2013, Making reliable shear-wave splitting measurements, BSSA, 2680-2693]. Manual screening is applied to ensure that no high quality events are ignored and no low quality results are selected. The result is a homogeneous database of individual rather than station-averaged splitting parameters that can be used by a variety of geoscientists for the understanding of the structure and dynamics of the Earth’s deep interior beneath the Africa and Arabia. The effort is still in progress and so far about 4455 high-quality measurements, including 2878 from SKS, 708 from PKS, and 869 from SKKS have been made. The ultimate goal is to establish a searchable and growing database for public access for Africa and Arabia.",

            "abstract": "One persistent mode of outgassing from Kīlauea’s summit lava lake, which has been active since 2008, is characterized by dome-shaped upwellings of incandescent lava several meters across on the lake surface. These phenomena usually occur a few times per minute during the lava lake’s typical north-to-south circulation regime, dampen and disappear within seconds, and produce few pyroclasts. Up until now, it has not been possible to determine if these upwellings were caused by the bursting of discrete bubbles or by rafts of smaller bubbles, though their slow speed and relative lack of pyroclasts suggested the latter.\nHowever, observations of these phenomena during 2013–14 using high-speed (200–500 Hz) cameras found a surprising result. Each dome-shaped upwelling was, instead, the aftermath of the bursting of a discrete bubble, which broke through the surface crust a few tenths of a second before the related upwelling and was roughly one-quarter to one-half its size. Thus, these upwellings appear to be the rebound of the lava lake surface into the void created by relatively minor, meter-scale bubble bursts. In some instances, the rebound even develops into a liquid jet.\nRebound of the lava lake surface following wall rock collapses has been shown to be important for triggering transient explosive activity at Kīlauea since 2008. The dome-shaped upwellings described here are another example of lake-rebound dynamics at Kīlauea, though on a smaller scale. In light of the prevalence of these phenomena at Kīlauea, rebound of the magma column following disturbances at the magma free-surface could play a role in other volcanic systems as well.",

Simultaneously with AggieAir flights, intensive ground sampling was conducted at precisely determined locations for plant and soil nitrogen among other parameters. This study investigated the spectral signature of oats and formulated a machine learning regression model of reflectance response between the multi-spectral bands available from AggieAir (red, green, blue, near infrared, and thermal), plant nitrogen and soil nitrogen. A multivariate relevance vector machine (MVRVM) was used to develop the linkages between the remotely sensed data and plant and soil nitrogen at approximately 15-cm resolution.

            "abstract": "Pyllosilicate minerals have higher reactivity than other silicate minerals and can control the mobility and distribution of nuclear element in both natural environments and nuclear waste sites. Radioactive 137Cs is one of the important components of nuclear waste and, therefore, it is very important to obtain informations on the reation of 137Cs with phyllosilicate minerals to estimate its fate in near-surface geochemical environments. We artificially weathered biotite with solutions containing different cations. 0.2 g of ground biotite samples were mixed with 50 ml of 1 M solutions of K, Ca, Na, Mg, Rb, and Cs. Our study shows that the cations in the solution have different effects on the Si release caused by the dissolution of plate of biotite and K release which is more affected by the ion exchange. Among cations, Na and Mg show the most significant effect on the weathering, which was verified by Si release, XRD, and SEM. Those two ions increase the weathering of biotite by the formation of expandable layers. However, the cations have different effects on the ion exchange. Generally, Na, Rb, and Cs have significant effects on the replacement of K from the interlayers. Those ions have the same charge as K and similar radius to that. The results of the sortion experiments of Cs on the weathered biotite imply that both plate weathering and cation exchange have different effects on the sorpion of Cs. The weathered biotite reacted with Na and Mg solutions which contain expandable layers, have the highest amount of Cs sorbed on biotite. However, the samples reacted with Cs, Rb, and K, which probably fit into the frayed edge sites, block additional sorption on the frayed edge site, show the lower amount of Cs sorbed on biotite.",

            "abstract": "The swash zone is a complex flow environment involving wave breaking, wave-generated turbulence, bed-generated turbulence and interactions of successive waves. The high rates of sediment transport in the swash zone make it an important region for study. Amongst the flow properties that are of interest, the bed shear stress is perhaps the most important to measure since it has an influence on the run-up height, sediment transport and wave damping. However, the study of the swash zone in the laboratory remains challenging due to its transient nature, shallow depths and entrained air. The current study is conducted using a large-scale wave flume in which solitary waves are used as a convenient way to generate swash events on a plane concrete slope of steepness 1:12. Both single waves and successive waves are used to study a single swash event and the influence of one swash event on the next. The bed shear stress, near-bed flow velocity, bed pressure and local water depth are measured at nine locations in the cross-shore direction. The bed shear stress is measured directly using a custom-built shear plate sensor (Pujara & Liu, 2014). It is found that while the magnitudes of the bed shear stress are greatly increased by wave breaking, non-breaking waves also exhibit much larger magnitudes of onshore-directed bed shear stress in the region that is initially dry. Furthermore, the swash of a single solitary wave is found to be a gravity-dominated flow apart from the tip region near the moving shoreline during uprush and near the receding shoreline during downrush. In these regions, the bed shear stress, non-hydrostatic flow conditions and streamwise pressure gradients are also important. In the case of successive swash events, it is found that when the waves are separated by one wave period in the offshore region, the downrush of the first swash event is met by the uprush of second swash event creating a separation point.",

Daily maximum and minimum surface air temperature and precipitation data recorded by Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Government of Nepal were used for this analysis. Temperature data from 5 stations and precipitation data from 20 stations were used based on quality and long term availability of data. Twenty-seven core extreme indices recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection, Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDMI) were calculated using computer software RClimDex. General increasing trend has been observed in the temperature extremes. Most stations show increase in percentage of warm days and nights whereas the cool nights and cool days are found to be decreasing. The trend is of relatively higher magnitude in mountainous region. Changes in indices of precipitation showed mixed pattern and do not show substantial, spatially coherent trends, unlike the situation for temperature means and extremes. The trends of very wet and extremely wet days have been found to be increasing in majority of stations with decreasing in rainy days. Results also show that, all the stations have positive trend of Consecutive Dry Days (CDD) and 60% of the stations show negative trend of Consecutive Wet Days (CWD). Since increase in extreme weather and climate events have greater negative impacts on human society and natural environments than changes in climate means, this study may be useful for policy makers for the development of climate resilient societies.",

            "abstract": "Glacier surface velocity is a combination of the internal deformation of ice and basal slip (including till deformation overlying bedrock) (Cuffey and Paterson, 2010). Short-term velocity changes can be attributed to basal slip associated with water pressure changes because of both the seasonal meltwater input and the evolution of the englacial and subglacial hydrological system. Thus, examining the velocity changes with high spatial and temporal resolution is helpful to understand how subglacial conditions evolve and control the surface velocities.\nWe examined spatial and temporal velocity changes at quiescent surge-type glaciers near the border of Alaska/Yukon by SAR offset tracking and found significant acceleration from fall to winter regardless of surge events. Moreover, whereas the upstream propagating summer speed-up was observed, the winter speed-up propagated from upstream to downstream. Lingle and Fatland (2003) proposed the englacial water storages as the fundamental driver of temperate-glacier surge. Although our observations were performed at the quiescent and rather poly-thermal than temperate surge-type glaciers, our observations also support the englacial water storage hypothesis. Namely, the englacial water storages that do not directly connect to the surface can promote basal sliding through increased water pressure as winter approaches.\nGlacier surge often initiates in winter (Raymond, 1987), which has been explained by creep closure of efficient drainage system in fall and subsequent higher water pressure in winter. Mini-surges are also known in this area, and have been interpreted in a similar mechanism. However, in order to maintain the higher water pressure for some time period in winter, there should be such sources that can keep supplying the water to the bed. It has been uncertain, however, if, how and where the water can be stored in winter. Also, we should keep in mind that many of the previously known mini-surges were actually occurring in spring and summer (Kamb and Engelhardt, 1987; Harrison and Post, 2003). There are, to our knowledge, few comprehensive velocity observations in terms of both spatial and temporal coverages.\nHere we review some previous observations, place our observations in context of the glacier surge dynamics, and propose the winter speed-up mechanism.",

            "abstract": "GRASS GIS is a leading open source GIS for geospatial analysis and modeling. In addition to being utilized as a desktop GIS it also serves as a processing engine for high performance geospatial computing for applications in diverse disciplines. The newly released GRASS GIS 7 supports big data analysis including temporal framework, image segmentation, watershed analysis, synchronized 2D/3D animations and many others. This presentation will focus on new GRASS GIS 7-powered tools for geoprocessing giga-size earth observation (EO) data using spatial pattern analysis. Pattern-based analysis connects to human visual perception of space as well as makes geoprocessing of giga-size EO data possible in an efficient and robust manner. GeoPAT is a collection of GRASS GIS 7 modules that fully integrates procedures for pattern representation of EO data and patterns similarity calculations with standard GIS tasks of mapping, maps overlay, segmentation, classification(Fig 1a), change detections etc. GeoPAT works very well on a desktop but it also underpins several GeoWeb applications (\nhttp://sil.uc.edu/\n) which allow users to do analysis on selected EO datasets without the need to download them. The GRASS GIS 7 temporal framework and high resolution visualizations will be illustrated using time series of giga-size, lidar-based digital elevation models representing the dynamics of North Carolina barrier islands over the past 15 years. The temporal framework supports efficient raster and vector data series analysis and simplifies data input for visual analysis of dynamic landscapes (Fig. 1b) allowing users to rapidly identify vulnerable locations, changes in built environment and eroding coastlines. Numerous improvements in GRASS GIS 7 were implemented to support terabyte size data processing for reconstruction of MODIS land surface temperature (LST) at 250m resolution using multiple regressions and PCA (Fig. 1c) . The new MODIS LST series (\nhttp://gis.cri.fmach.it/eurolst/\n) includes 4 maps per day since year 2000, provide improved data for the epidemiological predictions, viticulture, assessment of urban heat islands and numerous other applications. The presentation will conclude with outline of future development for big data interfaces to further enhance the web-based GRASS GIS data analysis.",

            "abstract": "Phenological measures offer important opportunities to improve understanding of ecosystem processes. However, it is typically quite difficult to combine detailed visual ground observations, which provide necessary information on species timing differences, and satellite-derived remote sensing data, which facilitate needed spatial integration and large area coverage. A new resource to address this scaling issue is near-surface remote sensing data collected from fixed position cameras. This paper presents initial findings from a two-year comparison of the spring and autumn seasonal transitions in Downer Woods, a small urban woodlot on the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee campus dominated by white ash and basswood trees. The study area is under observation from a visible/near-infrared camera installed in March 2013 that is part of the Phenocam network, and also has detailed ground-based species-specific visual phenological observations collected in both spring and autumn, as well as air/soil temperatures and light sensor data measured under the canopy. The results show that at this location, the Phenocam visible/near-infrared band data series can be successfully compared to aggregated species visual phenological observations. Further, both of these changes can be in turn simulated by process models based on seasonal temperature changes. Thus, the concurrent collection of these data suggest a coherent process whereby more robust ground-based species-aggregated “pixel” data can be produced which will be scalable to large areas, and potentially be applicable to more complex environments and ecosystems. Such an approach could potentially improve phenology-based spatial estimates of carbon and energy flux.",

            "abstract": "A never before recorded pattern of periodic, chaotic, and doubled, earthquake recurrence intervals was detected in the sequence of deep tectonic tremors of the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas Fault (Shelly, 2010). These observations may be the most puzzling seismological observations of the last decade: The pattern was regularly oscillating with a period doubling of 3 and 6 days from mid-2003 until it was disrupted by the 2004 Mw 6.0 Parkfield earthquake. But by the end of 2007, the previous pattern resumed.\nHere, we assume that the complex dynamics of the tremors is caused by slip on a single asperity on the San Andreas Fault with homogeneous friction properties. We developed a three-dimensional model based on the rate-and-state friction law with a single patch and simulated fault slip during all stages of the earthquake cycle using the boundary integral method of Lapusta & Liu (2009).\nWe find that homogeneous penny-shaped asperities cannot induce the observed period doubling, and that the geometry itself of the velocity-weakening asperity is critical in enabling the characteristic behavior of the Parkfield tremors. We also find that the system is sensitive to perturbations in pore pressure, such that the ones induced by the 2004 Parkfield earthquake are sufficient to dramatically alter the dynamics of the tremors for two years, as observed by Shelly (2010).\nAn important finding is that tremor magnitude is amplified more by macroscopic slip duration on the source asperity than by slip amplitude, indicative of a time-dependent process for the breakage of micro-asperities that leads to seismic emissions. Our simulated event duration is in the range of 25 to 150 seconds, closely comparable to the event duration of a typical Parkfield tectonic tremor.\nOur simulations reproduce the unique observations of the Parkfield tremor activity. This study vividly illustrates the critical role of geometry in shaping the dynamics of fault slip evolution on a seismogenic fault.",

            "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the first major oxidation of the atmosphere–ocean system occurred during the Paleoproterozoic. However, the course of this redox transition remains elusive. A number of large Mn deposits are distributed in Paleoproterozoic sedimentary successions. As Mn is a redox-sensitive element characterized by high redox potential, knowledge of the Mn cycle in Paleoproterozoic seawater may provide insight into redox evolution during this period.\nHere, we investigate the Mn cycle in Paleoproterozoic seawater based on the Re–Os and Mo isotope compositions, and the abundance of major and trace elements, in Mn-rich sedimentary rocks from the Nsuta deposit of the Birimian Supergroup, Ghana. The Mn ore is composed mainly of rhodochrosite and is distributed at the boundaries between sedimentary rocks and tholeiitic volcanic rocks. The Re–Os isochron age (2217 ± 100 Ma) we obtained was consistent with U–Pb zircon ages of the volcanic rocks. The manganophile elements, except for Mo, show no enrichment, which is similar to modern hydrothermal Mn oxides. The PAAS-normalized REE compositions show positive Ce anomaly, indicative of Ce enrichment due to the oxidation of Ce(III) by Mn(IV). These findings suggest that Mn ore formed from primary precipitation of Mn oxides from hydrothermal fluids as they were mixed with bottom seawater at ~2.2 Ga. Thus, the bottom seawater would have been sufficiently oxygenated for the precipitation of Mn oxides at ~2.2 Ga.\n The Nsuta ore samples exhibit slight Mo enrichment, but Mo/Mn ratios are orders of magnitude lower than those in modern hydrothermal Mn oxides. We also found that the Mo isotopes in the Nsuta ore are ~0.7‰ heavier than those in modern hydrothermal and hydrogenous Mn oxides. As Mo in hydrothermal Mn oxides is sourced primarily from seawater (Goto et al., in prep), these results may reflect smaller oceanic Mo inventory and heavier seawater Mo isotope composition at 2.2 Ga than those of present-day. Our calculation using a simple mass balance model suggests that substantial removal of light Mo by Mn oxides may have caused such oceanic conditions.\nOur findings are consistent with the recently proposed ‘oxygen overshoot’ model (Bekker and Holland, 2012) and low Mo contents in ~2.2-Ga black shales and sedimentary pyrites (e.g., Scott et al., 2008).",

            "abstract": "Accessing scientific data through an online portal can be a frustrating task. The concept of making web interfaces easy to use known as “usability” has been thoroughly researched in the field of e-commerce but has not been explicitly addressed in the atmospheric sciences. As more observation stations are installed, satellite missions flown, models run, and field campaigns performed, large amounts of data are produced. Portals on the Internet have become the favored mechanisms to share this information and are ever increasing in number. Portals are often created without being tested for usability with the target audience though the expenses of testing are low and the returns high. To remain competitive and relevant in the provision of atmospheric data, it is imperative that developers understand design elements of a successful portal to make their product stand out among others. This presentation informs the audience of the benefits and basic principles of usability for web pages presenting atmospheric data. We will also share some of the best practices and recommendations we have formulated from the results of usability testing performed on two data provision web sites hosted by the Western Regional Climate Center.",

            "abstract": "The use of wet chemistry and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to determine the oxidation state of Fe in submarine glasses and olivine-hosted melt inclusions has provided important new insights into the global systematics of Fe3+/∑Fe in mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) [1, 2]. Because MORB are aggregates of near-fractional partial melts formed by decompression melting of variably depleted peridotite, it is difficult to judge the extent to which they directly reflect the oxidation state of the oceanic upper mantle. To provide a theoretical framework within which to interpret Fe3+/∑Fe in MORB, I have developed a model that describes the behavior of Fe3+/∑Fe during spinel lherzolite partial melting in a system closed to oxygen.\nModeling is carried out by calculating the Fe3+/∑Fe of olivine using the point defect model of [3], and determining Fe3+/∑Fe of the bulk peridotite from mineral-mineral partitioning. The inter-mineral Fe3+/Fe2+ exchange coefficients are derived from Mössbauer data on natural spinel peridotites, and are parameterized in terms of oxygen fugacity, temperature, and the Fe content of the olivine. The Fe3+/∑Fe of the melt is determined by combining mass-balance with an equation relating the Fe3+/∑Fe of the melt to the fugacity of oxygen [4]. Spinel lherzolite partial melting is modeled after [5].\nModeling results indicate that oxygen fugacity does not follow the fayalite-magnetite-quartz (FMQ) buffer during partial melting. For isobaric partial melting, the system becomes reduced relative to FMQ with increasing extent of melting. This results from an increase in the FMQ buffer with increasing temperature, whereas oxygen fugacity in the peridotite remains nearly constant. Conversely, during polybaric partial melting the oxidation state of the residual peridotite increases relative to FMQ. The effective partition coefficient for Fe3+is larger than previously thought, so that a redox couple with S is not required to explain its compatibility during partial melting.\n[1] Bézos and Humler (2005) Geochim Cosmochim Acta 69:711-725; [2] Cottrell and Kelley (2011) Earth Planet Sci Lett 305:270-282; [3] Dohmen and Chakraborty (2007) Phys Chem Min 34:409-430; [4] Kress and Carmichael (1991) Contrib Min Pet 108:82-92; [5] Kinzler (1997) J Geophys Res 102:853-874",

            "abstract": "How the Tibetan Plateau is extended is one of the key problems to understand the earth crust evolution in the frame of plate tectonics. A newly uplifting area, the Dahe region, locating between the Yumu Shan Mountain and the Qilian Shan Mountain, in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, would supply us a fresh sight on the process that how the plateau is extended to a new region. The Dahe region was a relatively depressing or stable area before late Pleistocene, and received thick fluvial sediment derived from the Qilian Shan in the south. In late Pleistocene, the old depositing surface Sp (alluvial fan surface) was deeply cut by the Dahe River. Below the old depositing surface, four staircases of strath terraces (strath is the old fluvial deposition) are formed by the Dahe River, and each terrace surfaces are buried by aeolian loess. By the OSL dating on overlying loess on the terraces and correlating to climate records, we obtain formation ages (terrace surface abandoning time) of the four terraces (from high to low): 128.2 ±9.8 ka, 109.6±20.8 ka, 96.3 ±9.0 ka, and 15.9 ±2.5 ka. We obtain the extrapolated Sp age of 160 ±25 ka, which represents the time when the fan depositing was end and river cutting and eroding was started in the Dahe region. By the uplifted terrace staircases and warped long profiles of terraces, we can find that the region is not only experiencing regional uplifting but also folding deformation. Through analyzing the geometry of the deforming terrace surfaces, we propose that a new blind thrust fault was derived from the main decollement in the upper crust, and thus the growing fault deduced the uplift of the Dahe region and the folding near the fault tip. The growth of the Dahe region, which is sandwiched by the Yumu Shan and the Qilian Shan, both uplifted millions years ago, suggests that northeastern extending of the plateau is in the form of new fault-fold system growing in mountain front and back.",

            "abstract": "The contribution of average warming to increases in high temperature extremes and decreases in low temperature extremes is well established, but the role of changes in other aspects of the temperature distribution is unclear. By inferring separate slopes for each quantile of the distribution, quantile regression allows trends in the center of the temperature distribution to be disentangled from trends in other aaspects of the distribution. In particular, as a change in the properties of one tail of the distribution -- such as the hottest 10% of temperatures becoming hotter-- does not affect the 50th percentile, quantile regression can be useful in diagnosing changes in temperature extremes that are not attributable to changes in the center.\n\nApplying quantile regression to explore linear trends in daily summertime and wintertime maximum and minimum temperature observations from North American weather stations, we find spatially coherent patterns of change that vary across quantiles of the distribution, indicative of changes in second or higher moments of the distribution. We repeat the analysis on both the NCEP-DOE Reanalysis II and the ERA Interim Reanalysis, and spatially smooth and interpolate all results to a common grid to facilitate comparisons. The reanalysis products do not reproduce key patterns seen in the observations, and feature higher magnitude trends of both signs, particularly for the lower quantiles of maximum temperatures. ",

            "abstract": "The observed spectra of nearshore infragravity waves are typically mixed, with a discrete component (edge waves, trapped waves, propagating parallel to the coast) and a continuous one (leaky waves, that propagate from, and radiate back into, the deep ocean. See e.g., Oltman-Shay and Guza, 1987). The evolution of infragravity spectrum is driven by three general processes: 1) edge-leaky interactions, that transfer energy to the system from shorter waves; 2) energy redistribution through edge-edge and edge-leaky interactions; 3) and energy dissipation due to processes such as bottom friction.\nPrevious studies treated either the edge and leaky system, in isolation from the other one, and focused on phase-resolving dynamical equation. Following Whitham (1976), who derived the nonlinear edge-wave solutions for the shallow water equations, theoretical work on the nonlinear edge-edge interaction resulted in many significant extensions (e.g., Kirby et. al. 1998, Pelinovsky et. al. 2010). The interaction between standing edge waves and a normally incident wave has been investigated both within the framework of the shallow-water equation (Guza and Davis 1974) and full water wave theory (Minzoni and Whitham, 1977).\nHere, we derive a general dynamical equation for the full mixed edge-leaky spectrum over a laterally uniform beach based on Zakharov's (1968, 1999) Hamiltonian formalism. The introduction of canonical variables in this formalism significantly simplifies the complicated derivation of the nonlinear interaction coefficient in the previous work (Kirby et. al. 1998, Pelinovsky et. al. 2010). The subharmonic resonance mechanism for edge-wave excitation (Guza and Davis, 1974) is retrieved from the model equation as a special case. The effects of dissipation induced by bottom friction are included using a perturbation approach. A kinetic equation for Zakharov's (1999) canonical variables can be derived, that reduces to the stochastic nonlinear mild-slope model of Agnon and Sheremet (1997) for the leaky spectrum. Ongoing work focuses on the investigation of the dynamical properties of the edge wave spectrum and the development of numerical implementation and validation of the model.",

            "abstract": "Relationships between environmental change and armed conflict have long been studied. Sometimes referred to as ‘warfare’ or ‘conflict’ ecology, much of this scholarship has come in response to local-level perceptions of landscape or livelihood changes that result from regional armed conflict. However, such studies have, first, typically focused on spatiotemporally acute and readily detectable environmental change, like deforestation, to the exclusion of protracted and more subtle environmental changes, like agricultural degradation; second, been limited to situational conflicts or circumstances, thereby inhibiting broader theoretical development; and, third, often only considered the environmental consequences rather than the environmental or climatic circumstances that may contribute to conflict. As a result, there is little opportunity for methodological or theoretical cohesion between studies. In this presentation, I synthesize findings from three case studies examining the interrelationships between agricultural change and armed conflict in the semi-arid landscapes of northwest Pakistan, Palestine, and southern Syria. Using coarse through very high resolution remotely sensed imagery, socio-economic and demographic data, conflict databases, open-source programming, and building on theoretical underpinnings of political ecology and conflict studies, I present methods and modeling approaches that aid in overcoming data scarcity and disparity between scales of analysis and integrate environmental and conflict data in spatiotemporally explicit ways. Results from these case studies illuminate the interrelationships between both protracted and acute agricultural change and armed conflict, and have broad relevance for understanding the means by which environment, conflict, and livelihoods are linked, a nexus that will only become tighter with the advance of global climate change.",

Droughts during the monsoon season hamper crop growth and food production. During the last few decades, rainfall in the monsoon season has been erratic leading to some of the most wide spread droughts in the region. Severity, areal extents, and frequency of droughts are analyzed using the observed data for the period of 1951-2007. Results indicate that frequency of severe drought increased in the Southeast Asia during the recent decades (1980-2007). To assess the variability of hydrologic and agricultural drought in the region, runoff and soil moisture were simulated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. The model simulated drought variability was compared with drought simulated by the CMIP5 models during the historic period (1951-2005). Most of the CMIP5 models show increased frequency of severe agricultural droughts in the region under the projected future climate. Increased agricultural droughts in the Southeast Asia may put enormous pressure on the efforts towards achieving food security in the region.",

Sagehen is located at the headwaters of Sagehen Creek and contributes to the Truckee River, which is the main water supply for Reno, Nevada. Sagehen is a snow-dominated basin that receives an average annual rainfall of 892 mm and streamflow of 392 mm. A standardized precipitation index (SPI) indicates eight wet years and three dry years occurred since 1978. The Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) is utilized to run scenarios of fuel treatments and to analyze corresponding water budget changes in Sagehen. PRMS is calibrated to observed streamflow using the systematic multi-objective, step-wise calibration software Let Us Calibrate (LUCA). The basin is divided into 128 hydrologic response units (HRUs) based on similar hydrologic and physical characteristics. Fuel management will include multiple thinning and burning treatments based on topography and ecosystem characteristics and coincides with approximately 41 percent of the defined HRUs. Three treatment scenarios were run for relevant HRUs for water years 1981-2000. Scenarios reflect a 25, 50, and 75 percent vegetation reduction by altering sensitive parameters such as summer and winter cover density, summer and winter rain-interception storage capacity, and snow-interception storage capacity. Preliminary analysis shows changes in the water budget exemplified by simulated streamflow compared to baseline simulations. Ongoing work includes investigating PRMS outputs such as evapotranspiration, snow, and recharge to fully understand the scope of proposed fuel management in Sagehen. Individual assessment of impacted HRUs will also provide insight on specific treatment types and ultimately provide insight for future regional treatments in the Sierra Nevada.",

            "abstract": "The Koa‘e fault system is a prominent but poorly understood structural element of Kilauea Volcano, Hawai‘i. The ~E-W-trending normal faults that make up the Koa‘e system are located about 5 km south of the summit caldera and extend between the East and Southwest Rift Zones, providing a means of accommodating both magma transport between the rifts and extension due to seaward motion of the volcano’s south flank. On 5 June 2012, a sequence of shallow earthquakes with magnitudes up to M3.6 occurred within the central part of the Koa‘e fault system. InSAR data from multiple satellites spanning the time of the earthquakes indicates a maximum of about 10 cm of down-to-the-north displacement on a known Koa‘e fault. Field visits to the fault after the earthquakes found abundant ground cracking. Here, we combine the InSAR data acquired by the\nCOSMO-SkyMed\n, TSX and RSAT2 systems and seismic data recorded by the Hawaiian Volcanology Observatory to analyze the characteristics of fault rupture. High-precision earthquake locations of the 2012 sequence together with the background seismicity that extends back to 1986 are obtained by applying three-dimensional ray-tracing, similar-event cluster analysis, and waveform cross-correlation methods. The integrated analysis is helpful to better constrain the geometry of the fault, its depth extent, and its role in the structural evolution of Kilauea.",

The impacts of variations in meteorological parameters and emissions are imposed separately and together by numerical experiments. With variations in both meteorological parameters and anthropogenic emissions, simulated annual outflow of PM2.5 (sum of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, and organic carbon) from East Asia increased by 6.0 Tg (or 53%) over years 1986–2006, in which the outflow fluxes of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium aerosols had the largest contributions with decadal trends of +1.2, +0.8, and +0.7 Tg decade−1, respectively. Simulated outflow fluxes of aerosols also exhibited large interannual variations; the absolute percent departure from the mean (APDM) values of the annual outflow fluxes of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, organic carbon, and PM2.5 were 5.9%, 7.9%, 5.4%, 5.8%, 4.2%, and 5.2%, respectively, as variations in both meteorological parameters and anthropogenic emissions were considered. Model sensitivity studies show that, for outflow fluxes of aerosols from East Asia, the decadal trends were driven by variations in anthropogenic emissions whereas the interannual variations were dominated by variations in meteorological parameters. The increases in anthropogenic emissions alone explained about 86% of the decadal trend in outflow of PM2.5. Although variations in meteorological parameters can influence the interannual variations in aerosol outflow by changing both aerosol concentrations over East Asia and zonal winds, the latter is identified to be the key factor because of the high positive correlation coefficient between the annual outflow flux of PM2.5 and zonal wind at 700 hPa (the altitude with the maximum outflow fluxes) for years 1986–2006.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale tsunamis in the shallow sea and on land are characterized by greater flow depth and speed than other natural open-channel flows. In-situ instrumental observation of tsunami sediment transport is practically impossible. Our understandings on the dynamics of tsunami sedimentation is mainly founded on the analysis of pre- and post-tsunami geomorphological data, field observation and laboratory analysis of tsunami deposits and modeling of tsunami sediment transport by means of hydraulic, mathematical and numerical approaches.\nBased on massive dataset of the 2011 Tohoku tsunami deposits, Goto et al. (in press) identified a possible upper threshold of tsunami sedimentation. They found that sediment concentration, which is defined as a ratio of deposit thickness to the local flow depth, can be approximated by a constant value of 2% over the coastal plain of the Sendai Bay, northeast Japan.\nEnergy balance is an important physics to explain the upper threshold of tsunami sediment transport. The concept of energy constraint was described by Parker et al. (1986) for turbidity current. It declares the turbulent kinetic energy should be consumed to pick-up sediments from the bed and keep them in suspension. The loss of the turbulent energy results in decreased capacity of suspended load. Naruse et al. (2014) introduced the energy concept to tsunami sediment transport, and predicted the limiting sediment concentration of ~2% for a flow depth of 10 m and a flow speed of 10 m/s, which are typical for Sendai Plain.\nThe role of energy constraint for tsunami sedimentation was also investigated using a numerical approach. The saturation concentration for wash load (Bagnold, 1962; van Rijn, 2007), which also accounts the energy balance, was implemented to a numerical model of tsunami sediment transport, and the model was applied to the case study of the 2011 Tohoku tsunami. The modeling result showed that the observed limiting concentration of 2% may be caused from flow hysteresis. In addition, the concept of energy balance is important to explain both characteristic patterns of erosion and deposition, as well as spatial variability of sandy deposits.",

The model is written in C++ with emphasis on good software development practices and code readability without sacrificing serial or parallel performance. As such the model could be especially useful for education, for learning both (magneto)hydrodynamics (MHD) and computational model development. By using latest features of the C++ standard (2011) it has been possible to develop a very modular program which improves not only the readability of code but also the testability of the model and decreases the effort required to make changes to various parts of the program. Major parts of the model, functionality not directly related to (M)HD, have been outsourced to other freely available libraries which has reduced the development time of the model significantly. I will present an overview of the code architecture as well as details of different parts of the model and will show examples of using the model including preparing input files and plotting results. A multitude of 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional test cases are included in the software distribution and the results of, for example, Kelvin–Helmholtz, bow shock, blast wave and reconnection tests, will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Advances in sensor technology and wireless networking are making environmental data available at unprecedented sampling frequency and with unprecedented spatial coverage. These measurements are allowing us to observe phenomena and process interactions that were previously invisible. This talk will present examples of promising developments spurred by the sensor revolution in hydrological sciences.\nCaution is needed, however, in interpreting these high-frequency observations. Typical environmental time series have reddened spectra, implying that as measurements are made at finer temporal or spatial intervals, the measured values will be closer together as well. Above some sampling frequency, successive real-world values will differ by less than the measurement uncertainties themselves, with the result that the measured time series will be dominated by measurement noise rather than real-world dynamics.\nEnvironmental sensors, like all measurement devices, will be characterized by noise spectra, and environmental signals will only be observable in frequency ranges where they are much stronger than the measurement noise. Thus it is important to know the noise spectra of environmental sensors, through long-term time series measurements on standards and blanks. To date, however, measurement noise spectra have rarely been measured or reported.\nThe reddened spectra of environmental fluctuations imply that measurements at sufficiently high frequencies will mostly \"connect the dots\" between nearby data points. In other words, measurements at higher and higher sampling frequencies will be more and more strongly autocorrelated, with the result that the number of effective degrees of freedom in the time series will be far smaller than the number of measurements. Statistical analyses of such time series will greatly exaggerate significance levels, and greatly underestimate confidence bounds, unless this loss of degrees of freedom is taken into account. Illustrative examples of these pitfalls will be presented.",

Both daytime and nighttime electron density (Ne), electron temperature (Te), ion density (Ni) and ion temperature (Ti) are investigated. A statistical analysis of the box-and-whisker method is utilized to see if the four DEMETER datasets 1-6 days before and after the earthquake are significantly different. The analysis is employed to investigate the epicenter and three reference areas along the same magnetic latitude and to discriminate the earthquake-related anomalies from global effects. Results show that the nighttime Ne and Ni over the epicenter significantly decrease 1–6 days before the earthquake. The ionospheric total electron content (TEC) of global ionosphere map (GIM) over the epicenter is further inspected to find the sensitive local time for detecting the PEIAs of the M7.9 Wenchuan earthquake.",

The\nproof of concept\nin\nGoogle Earth Engine\nAPI with initial testing on case studies in New York and Utterakhand India demonstrates the potential of highly parallelized cloud computing to model socio-ecological disaster vulnerability at high spatial and temporal resolution and in near real time. Cloud computing facilitates statistical modeling with variables derived from large public social and ecological data sets, including census data, nighttime lights (NTL), and World Pop to derive social parameters together with elevation, satellite imagery, rainfall, and observed flood data from Dartmouth Flood Observatory to derive biophysical parameters. While more traditional, physically based hydrological models that rely on flow algorithms and numerical methods are currently unavailable in parallelized computing platforms like Google Earth Engine, there is high potential to explore “data driven” modeling that trades physics for statistics in a parallelized environment. A data driven approach to flood modeling with geographically weighted logistic regression has been initially tested on Hurricane Irene in southeastern New York. Comparison of model results with observed flood data reveals a 97% accuracy of the model to predict flooded pixels. Testing on multiple storms is required to further validate this initial promising approach.\n A statistical social-ecological flood model that could produce rapid vulnerability assessments to predict who might require immediate evacuation and where could serve as an early warning. This type of early warning system would be especially relevant in data poor places lacking the computing power, high resolution data such as LiDar and stream gauges, or hydrologic expertise to run physically based models in real time. As the data-driven model presented relies on globally available data, the only real time data input required would be typical data from a weather service, e.g. precipitation or coarse resolution flood prediction. However, model uncertainty will vary locally depending upon the resolution and frequency of observed flood and socio-economic damage impact data.",

The spatial distribution of these surface streams is poorly understood and their temporal variability is (to our knowledge) unknown. One of the reasons for the lack of knowledge on the temporal variability of such streams is related to the historical unavailability of satellite data that could spatially resolve the presence and associated properties of the streams. In recent years, however, multi-spectral commercial satellite data in the visible and infra-red bands have been made available to the scientific community. These newly accessible data sets are provided at spatial resolutions of the order of 1-2 meters, therefore, allowing to perform accurate spatial and temporal analysis of surface streams (and small lakes and ponds that cannot be resolved with sensors such as MODIS or LANDSAT).\nIn this study, we report results concerning the seasonal and intra-seasonal variability of surface streams over a selected area on the west Greenland ice sheet. Using a combination of ENVI® and ArcGIS® software packages applied to multispectral high resolution imagery from World View 2 and Quickbird satellites, surface streams are identified through multiple approaches (either based on unsupervised classifications, band combinations, band ratio thresholds, or digitization) and vector maps of the surface hydrology network were created. Stream networks created during one melting season (at three different stages of the season) were compared and discussed as well as the networks mapped between two consecutive years for proximate dates.",

            "abstract": "Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) has been making observations continuously for more than five years since its launch on 23 January 2009. Thermal and Near-infrared Sensor for Carbon Observation Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) on board the GOSAT simultaneously observes column abundances and profiles of CO2 and CH4 in the same field of view, from the shortwave infrared (SWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) bands, respectively. We have just released the latest TIR CO2 and CH4 products, V01.00, to registered researchers. To validate the data quality of the V01.00 TIR CO2 product, we compared the TIR data with CO2 data obtained by Continuous CO2 Measuring Equipment (CME) on board JAL aircraft in Comprehensive Observation Network for Trace gases by Airliner (CONTRAIL) project. The aircraft CO2 data obtained during the level flights were compared with the V01.00 TIR upper tropospheric CO2 data. The CONTRAIL CO2 “profile” data obtained during the ascending and descending flights over several airports were compared with the TIR CO2 profiles. In the profile comparisons, we applied the TIR averaging kernel functions to the coincident CONTRAIL CO2 profiles. The V01.00 upper atmospheric CO2 data agreed to the CONTRAIL level flight CO2 data on average within 0.5-1%. Some TIR CO2 data showed relatively large differences from the nearest aircraft data, which suggests the existence of several problems such as L1B spectral calibration and nighttime cloud detection issues. The TIR V01.00 CO2 profile data from 9 to 13 km showed better agreement to CONTRAIL CO2 data than the a priori. However, the TIR CO2 data at around and below 5 km had low bias of 1-1.5%. The TIR V01.00 CH4 data generally showed reasonable latitudinal distributions as the previous version. In the Antarctic, unexpected high amounts of CH4 were seen in upper troposphere and lower stratosphere in autumn. This is probably because of the problem of simultaneously retrieved ozone concentration.",

            "abstract": "EMIC waves, one of the responsible mechanisms for precipitation of MeV electrons, frequently occur with high wave power near the plasmapause. We estimated the pitch angle diffusion rates related to the He band EMIC waves and the corresponding lifetimes at L=4 and L=6 for the cases of an intense storm and a quiet time, respectively, using the Tsyganenko 04 (T04) magnetic field model. The result shows enhanced pitch angle diffusion rates compared to those, by an order of magnitude, based on the dipole model. The corresponding lifetime is estimated to be less than a few sec for the case of an intense storm and less than ~10 sec for a quiet time. The reduction of the magnetic field strength is the main cause of the enhanced diffusion rates when estimations are made with the more realistic T04 model. We also calculated the diffusion rates for the H band EMIC waves and found the diffusion rates are much smaller than those associated with the He band EMIC waves. Hence, the He band is the dominant mode of the EMIC waves that are related to the precipitation of the relativistic electrons.",

            "abstract": "The various types of rainfall-dependent coupled socioecological systems that conspicuously characterize mountain-environments across Africa, such as the Chagga homegardens, an intensive agroforestry system, constitute a major economic backbone to the local inhabitants. Similarly, agropastoralism that characterizes the adjoining rangelands of such mountain-environments, such as that practiced by the Maasai people of Kenya, in the northern plains that adjoins Mount Kilimanjaro, is major contributor to local food security. Both Chagga agroforestry and Maasai agropastoralism also contribute greatly to broader-scale economic sectors and respectively to sustainable utilization of rangeland and mountain-environment resources. Like similar coupled socioecological systems across Africa, the Chagga agroforestry and Maasai agropastoralism are being, and will continue to be affected by the changing climate. This study uses an integrated approach to explore the sustainability of Chagga homegardens, an intensive agroforestry system, in the southern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Concurrently, the sustainability of the Maasai agropastoralism (a livelihood-diversification type) in the northern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the adjoining plains in Kenya is explored. This explication is followed by conceptualization of the potential future of Chagga agroforestry and Maasai agropastoralism systems under diverse scenarios of climate change—and alongside simultaneous effects of cross-scale social and biophysical factors, processes, and their interactions—in an integrated model. The premise of this study is that coupled socioecological systems, such as Chagga agroforestry and Maasai agropastoralism, linked to and/or dependent on mountain environments and microclimates, are natural-laboratories. Apropos this last point, the two systems offer timely insight into how similar systems in different geographical locations are likely to be influenced by the continuously changing climate amidst simultaneously heightened permeation of global socioeconomic and sociopolitical change. This insight become important as climate-influenced agriculture and pastoralism and their various derivatives continues to dominant livelihood systems across Africa.",

            "abstract": "The intraseasonal SST characteristics within the Indonesian Seas and their responses to the Madden-Julian Oscillations [MJO] are examined through analyses of observed and reanalysis datasets. Intraseasonal variation accounts for about 30% of SST variability, with the strongest signature is observed in Banda and Timor seas. The MJO signature in SST is evident in the form of energy peak at 35-45 days, amplification during the Northwest Monsoon (boreal winter), and eastward propagation. SST responds to sea-air heat flux associated with MJO with net heat flux into the ocean (atmosphere) characterizing the suppressed (active) phase of MJO.\nThe influence of MJO on Banda Sea SST is greatest during La Niña periods, which are favorable for deeper thermocline conditions, which diminish the role of ocean processes driving vertical heat transfer between subsurface and surface layers. Diminished influence of ocean processes results in dominance of surface heat fluxes associated with MJO in governing intraseasonal SST variability. During El Niño, the role of ocean processes is favorable to mediate heat transfer between lower and upper layer of the ocean surface as thermocline is shallower. The ocean component heat fluxes then compete with MJO forced heat fluxes in governing SST variability as indicated by less pronounced eastward propagation.",

            "abstract": "Coal seam gas (also called coal bed methane) is a form of natural gas that occurs in some coal seams. In the coal seam gas industry, hydraulic fracturing is performed to enhance the extraction of the gas from the coal seam. This paper presents flow simulation results for a fractured coal seam and its associate production well, and an investigation of the well piezometric head drawdown curves resulting from hydraulic pumping tests. The aim is to infer the hydraulic and fracture properties of the coal and associated well, such as length, width, conductivity of fractures, and the proportion of the water and gas contained in the coal seam. For this purpose the TOUGH2/EOS7C numerical simulator is applied. It is capable of modelling multiphase flow in fractured and porous system. The EOS7C is an “equation of state” module for TOUGH2 that is used to model the methane dissolved and free gas multiphase component. The Wingridder grid generator has been used to generate the 2D, 3D and MINCE (multiple interacting continua) grids for TOUGH2. The simulation results provide some constraints on hydraulic and fracture properties. However, there is still have significant uncertainty. In order to assess the uncertainty and increase our knowledge of the hydraulic properties, uncertainty analysis using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE), which is a Monte-Carlo methodology, is applied. We will discuss how the Monte-Carlo uncertainty analyses is used to infer the properties of a hydraulically fractured well from pump test data. One major outcome of this work will be the development of a fast and routine method for assessing the post-development performance and safety of a production gas well, and to provide reassurance that the fracking that has actually occurred in the field is within design parameters.",

            "abstract": "Increasing the capacity of society to make informed climate decisions based on scientific evidence is imperative. While a wide range of education programs and communication efforts to improve understanding and facilitate responsible effective decision-making have been developed in recent years, these efforts have been largely disconnected. The interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary nature of the problems and potential responses to climate change requires a broad range of expertise and a strategy that overcomes the inherent limitations of isolated programs and efforts.\nTo extend the reach and impact of climate change education and engagement efforts, it is necessary to have a coordination that results in greater collective impact. The Collective Impact model, as described by Kania & Kramer (2011), requires five elements: 1) a common agenda; 2) shared measurement systems; 3) mutually reinforcing activities; 4) continuous communication; and 5) a well-funded backbone support organization.\nThe CLEAN Network has facilitated a series of discussions at six professional meetings from late 2012 through spring 2014 to begin to develop and define the elements of collective impact on climate change education and engagement. These discussions have focused on getting input from the community on a common agenda and what a backbone support organization could do to help extend their reach and impact and enable a longer-term sustainability. These discussions will continue at future meetings, with the focus shifting to developing a common agenda and shared metrics.\nIn this presentation we will summarize the outcomes of these discussions thus far, especially with respect to what activities a backbone support organization might provide to help increase the collective impact of climate change education effort and invite others to join the development of public-private partnership to improve the nations climate literacy.\nThe cumulative input into this evolving discussion on collective impact on climate literacy can be viewed at http://tinyurl.com/mgwndtr.",

            "abstract": "Long time-series computations of seasonal and flood event inundation volumes from archived forecast rainfall events for the Lower Zambezi basin (Mozambique), using a coupled hydrology-hydrodynamic model, are correlated and regressed with satellite soil moisture observations and NWP rainfall forecasts as predictors for inundation volumes. This dynamic library of volume predictions can then be re-projected onto the topography to generate the corresponding floodplain and wetland inundation dynamics, including periods of flood and low flows. Especially for data-poor regions, the application potential of such a library of data is invaluable as the modeling chain is greatly simplified and readily available. The library is flexible, portable and transitional. Furthermore, deriving environmental indicators from this dynamic look-up catalogue would be relatively straightforward. Application fields are various and here we present conceptually a few that we plan to research in more detail and on some of which we already collaborate with other scientists and international institutions, though at the moment largely on an unfunded basis. The primary application is to implement an early warning system for flood inundation relief operations and flood inundation mitigation and resilience. Having this flood inundation warning system set up adequately would also allow looking into long-term predictions of crop productivity and consequently food security. Another potentially high-impact application is to relate flood inundation dynamics to disease modeling for public health monitoring and prediction, in particular focusing on Malaria. Last but not least, the dynamic inundation library we are building can be validated and complemented with advanced airborne radar imagery of flooding and inundated wetlands to study changes in wetland ecology and biodiversity with unprecedented detail in data-poor regions, in this case in particular the important wetlands of the Zambezi Delta.",

            "abstract": "Walker Lake, Nevada, contains locally abundant Pleistocene and Holocene carbonate structures, including tufas, stromatolites, and lithified carbonate hardgrounds. Hardgrounds are classically interpreted as forming via geobiological processes in shallow sediments. To better understand the origins of ancient hardgrounds, we investigated modern firmgrounds which we hypothesized to be incipient hardgrounds. The studied firmgrounds were brown, 1-2 cm thick with a mm-scale white or brown crust, cohesive enough to retain sharp erosional features, and were located on the western shoreline where alluvial fans enter the lake. We analyzed the elemental composition of the lakewater and porewaters in order to model mineral saturation states under lake conditions. In addition, we analyzed 16S rRNA gene diversity of the firmgrounds, porewater of adjacent sediments, and lakewater to investigate potential biological involvement. This, combined with SEM imaging, XRD analyses, and EDS analyses indicate that the firmgrounds are likely dominated by clays and granitic minerals rather than carbonate like the ancient hardgrounds. We suggest that Walker Lake firmgrounds are formed by weathering of unstable granitic minerals with no clear biological influence, likely resulting from physio-chemical processes related to groundwater-lake water mixing. Such firmgrounds may undergo subsequent replacement by calcium carbonate to form hardgrounds, resulting in carbonates with δ13C and δ18O compositions that do not reflect the lake water in which they formed. Given the apparent influence of groundwater on their formation, our work suggests that caution should be used when interpreting lacustrine hardground isotopic records as indicators of lakewater chemistry and climate.",

However, causal relationships between such retreat and the atmospheric circulation anomalies remains uncertain. Using a reanalysis dataset, we found that poleward shift of a sea surface temperature front over the Gulf Stream likely induces warm southerly advection and consequent sea-ice decline over the Barents Sea sector, and a cold anomaly over Eurasia via planetary waves triggered over the Gulf Stream region (figure a). The above mechanism is supported by the steady atmospheric response to the diabatic heating anomalies over the Gulf Stream region obtained with a linear baroclinic model. The remote atmospheric response from the Gulf Stream would be amplifi ed over the Barents Sea region via interacting with sea-ice anomaly, promoting the warm Arctic and cold Eurasian pattern (figure b).",

In Central America and the Caribbean region, we found that TEC depletions that occur during magnetically active conditions (Kp > 5o), persist for very long periods and sometimes remain even during afternoon hours. During quiet magnetic conditions, TEC depletions occur around the June solstice in Central America and during the December solstice in the Southern part of South America. We have also studied possible links between mid-latitude depletions and the formation of plasma bubbles at low latitudes. In addition, TEC measurements from North America have been utilized to determine the poleward extension of the mid-latitude depletions. These depletions do not appear to be related to auroral plasma processes or to storm enhanced densities (SED).

            "abstract": "The distribution, concentration, and transport of nutrients in agricultural landscapes are of significant societal concern. Our interests in reactive nitrogen and the nitrogen cycle have shifted from increasing the efficiency of nitrogen delivery to target crop species to decreasing environmental damage caused by intensive agricultural practices. Enhancing the reactive nitrogen use efficiency to increase food production to meet future demand inevitably contributes to an increase in the reactive nitrogen load in the ecosystem, and damaging the environment. However, due to the complexity of the nitrogen cycle, the dynamics of nitrogen in soils and its interactions with ecohydrological processes at the watershed and regional scales are not well understood to enable adequate remedial measures. To unravel the complexity of this dynamics we have developed a model for characterizing the nitrogen age (elapsed time) distribution. The goal of our study is to develop and analyze the dynamics of nitrogen in the context of age and transit times resulting from advection, mixing, and production/destruction processes; evaluate the effects of micro-topographic variability on the nitrogen age distributions; and investigate how the temporal dynamics of the nitrogen age distribution are affected by changes in the variability of climate drivers. Our study is performed for the Upper Sangamon River Basin in the Critical Zone Observatory for Intensively Managed Landscapes (IML-CZO).",

We incorporate the highly heterogeneous surficial topography of both regions by implementing a Virtual Topography scheme into Hercules, the octree-based finite-element earthquake simulator developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon University. We used ∼80×80×40 km3 volumes to perform fmax = 5 Hz simulations subjected to rupture sources representative of large earthquakes. Each region was simulated using three different models: (i) realistic 3D velocity structure with realistic topography (CMP model); (ii) realistic 3D velocity structure without topography (SQD model); and (iii) homogeneous half space with realistic topography (HMG) model. Our results illustrate how realistic topography greatly modifies the ground response. In particular, they highlight the importance of the combined interaction between source-effects, source-directivity, focusing, soft-soil conditions, and the 3D topography. We provide quantitative evidence of this interaction by the inclusion of maps of topographic amplification factors between the CMP and the SQD models.",

            "abstract": "Recent paleomagnetic studies of the CV carbonaceous chondrites Allende and Kaba and numerical modeling studies have suggested that the CV chondrite parent body may have been partially differentiated, with a molten metallic core, dynamo magnetic field, and an unmelted chondritic lid. To further evaluate this hypothesis, here we present new paleomagnetic analyses of two previously unstudied CV3 chondrites: the unshocked, Allende-type oxidized chondrite ALH 84028 and the weakly shocked, Bali-type oxidized chondrite ALH 85006. We preformed alternating field (AF) and thermal demagnetization experiments, AF-based paleointensity experiments, and rock magnetic experiments on mutually oriented subsamples of each meteorite. Both meteorites pass fusion crust baked contact tests, indicating that their interiors retain a magnetization predating atmospheric entry. In the interior of ALH 84028, we identified a unidirectional medium temperature (blocked to 300°C), high coercivity (blocked to >420 mT) component. In the interior of ALH 85006, we identified MT components blocked up to 400-475°C. The unblocking temperatures and unidirectional nature of the MT components in both meteorites indicates their origin as a partial thermoremanence or thermochemical remanence acquired during metamorphism following accretion of the CV chondrite parent body. Our paleointensity experiments indicate paleofield intensities of 32-73 μT for ALH 84028 and 14-45 μT for ALH 85006 . When combined with similar recent results for Allende and Kaba, there is now consistent evidence for dynamo fields from four CV chondrites with collectively diverse lithologies and shock states. Therefore, the magnetic field on the CV parent body was not a localized event like that expected for a field generated by meteoroid impact plasmas and instead likely had a wide spatial extent. Further, given the younger I-Xe ages for Kaba compared to Allende (9-10 Ma and 2-3 Ma after Stillwater respectively), CV parent body magnetic fields existed over an extended period of time. Together, these data present compelling evidence for the presence of a core-generated dynamo on the CV chondrite parent body, persistent for at least 8 Ma.",

            "abstract": "This project investigates the mercury content in summertime Pacific coastal fog in California and whether fog could be an important vector for ocean emissions of mercury to be deposited via fog drip to upland coastal ecosystems. Efforts began in early 2014 with the building of 7 active-strand fog collectors based on the Colorado State University Caltech CASCC design. The new UCSC CASCC includes doors sealing the collector which open under microcomputer control based on environmental sensing (relative humidity). Seven sites spanning from Trinidad in the north to Marina in the south have collected samples June-August 2014 under a project called FogNet. Fog conditions were favorable for collecting large water volumes (> 250 mL) at many sites. Fog samplers were cleaned with soap and deionized water daily and field blanks taken immediately following cleaning. Fog water samples were collected overnight, split into an aliquot for anion and DOC/DIC analysis and the remaining sample was acidified. Monomethyl mercury (MMHg) concentrations in samples and field blanks for 3 sites in FogNet are shown in the accompanying figure. The range of MMHg concentrations from 10 fog water samples > 100 mL in volume was 0.9-9.3 ng/L (4.5-46.4 pM). Elevated MMHg concentrations (> 5 ng/L, 25 pM) were observed at 2 sites: UC Santa Cruz and Bodega Bay. The field blanks produced MMHg concentrations of 0.08-0.4 ng/L (0.4-2.0 pM), which was on average < 10% of the sample concentration and suggests the artifact due to sampling was small. The observed MMHg concentrations in fog water observed is this study are 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than MMHg concentrations seen previously in rain water samples from the California coast suggesting an additional source of MMHg to fog. Shipboard measurements of dimethyl mercury (DMHg) in coastal California seawater during the time period of FogNet operations (summer 2014) reveal surface waters that were supersaturated in DMHg which represents a potential source of organic mercury to the overlying fog bank.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that the passage of seismic waves from large earthquakes are able to trigger small earthquakes and tremor at regional distances. These small events may be detected by applying a high-pass filter to seismograms to remove the much larger ground motion amplitudes from the large distant earthquake. Our interests are in examining the local triggering of earthquakes and tremor throughout the West Coast of North America from the magnitude 7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah 2010 earthquake and the magnitude 6.8 Northern California, March 10, 2014 earthquake, just north of the Mendocino Triple Junction. We will present the results of the analysis of waveform data from hundreds of seismometers throughout Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington, as well as some stations bordering these states. Our preliminary results suggest that triggering of local earthquakes and tremor occurred for both earthquakes. In the case of the records of the Southern California stations for the El Mayor Cucapah 2010 earthquake, 27 stations showed triggering near the seismic station. 13 of these stations are located in or near known geothermal areas, while others were located along active faults and one offshore. While conducting this study, we detected an instrumental noise signal present in 63 of the Southern California seismograms for the El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake. Initially, the signal looked like a typical triggered event, yet with further investigation we found its likely cause to be instrumental noise. We plan to relate our observations of triggered seismicity and tremor to the tectonic environment to test the hypothesis that triggering and tremor most commonly occurs in volcanic and geothermal areas.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic inversions for slip versus depth for several major (Mw > 7) strike-slip earthquakes (e.g. 1992 Landers, 1999 Hector Mine, 2010 El_Mayor-Cucapah) show a 10% to 40% reduction in slip near surface (depth < 2 km) compared to the slip at deeper depths (5 to 8 km). This has been called the shallow slip deficit (SSD). The large magnitude of this deficit has been an enigma since it cannot be explained by shallow creep during the interseismic period or by triggered slip from nearby earthquakes. One potential explanation for the SSD is that the previous geodetic inversions used incomplete data that do not go close to fault so the shallow portions of the slip models were poorly resolved and generally underestimated. In this study we improve the geodetic inversion, especially at shallow depth by: 1) refining the InSAR processing with non-boxcar phase filtering, model-dependent range corrections, more complete phase unwrapping by SNAPHU using a correlation mask and allowing a phase discontinuity along the rupture; 2) including near-fault offset data from optical imagery and SAR azimuth offsets; 3) using more detailed fault geometry; 4) and using additional campaign GPS data. With these improved observations, the slip inversion has significantly increased resolution at shallow depth. For the Landers rupture the SSD is reduced from 45% to 16%. Similarly for the Hector Mine rupture the SSD is reduced from 15% to 5%. We are assembling all the relevant co-seismic data for the El Major-Cucapah earthquake and will report the inversion result with its SSD at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) leakage into the shallow aquifer is one of the main concerns at a CO2 sequestration site. Various hydrogeochemical parameters have been suggested to determine the leakage (i.e., pH, EC, Alkalinity, Ca and δ13C). For the practical point of view, direct and continuous measurement of the dissolved CO2 concentration at the proper location can be the most useful strategy for the CO2 leakage detection in a shallow aquifer. In order to enhance possibility of identifying leaked CO2, monitoring location should be determined with regard to the shallow aquifer heterogeneity. In this study, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of heterogeneity on the dissolved CO2 concentrations. A 2-D sand tank of homogeneous medium sands including a single heterogeneity layer was designed. Two NDIR CO2 sensors, modified for continuous measuring in aquatic system, were installed above and below the single heterogeneous layer (clay, fine and medium sand lenses). Also, temperature and water contents were measured continuously at a same position. Bromocresol purple which is one of the acid-base indicator was used to visualize CO2 migration. During the gas phase CO2 injection at the bottom of the sand tank, dissolved CO2 in the water is continuously measured. In the results, significant differences of concentrations were observed due to the presence of heterogeneity layer, even the locations were close. These results suggested that monitoring location should be determined considering vertical heterogeneity of shallow aquifer at a CO2 leakage site.",

The geographic distribution and vertical profiles of simulated dust and smoke aerosols were evaluated with MODIS true color images and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar data with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIPSO) total attenuated backscatter, aerosol extinction coefficient and depolarization data. We found that simulated aerosol vertical concentration profiles are consistent with the above CALIPSO data. Surface albedo and columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) sensitivity to smoke and dust simulations are performed with WRF-Chem. The simulated surface albedo and AOD were compared with MODIS albedo product (MODIS43) and AOD measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET).

            "abstract": "An explosive volcanic eruption can inject a large amount of SO2 into the stratosphere, which is oxidized to form sulfate aerosol. Such aerosol has an impact on the Earth’s radiative budget by enhancing back-scattering of the solar radiation. Changes in the size distribution of the aerosol were observed after large volcanic eruptions. Representing the changes in size distribution is important for climate simulation, because the changes affect climate responses to large volcanic eruptions. This study newly developed an aerosol microphysics module and investigated changes in stratospheric sulfate aerosol after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in the framework of a chemistry-aerosol coupled climate model MIROC-CHASER/SPRINTARS. The module represents aerosol size distribution with three lognormal modes (nucleation, Aitken, and accumulation modes) and includes nucleation, condensation growth/evaporation, and coagulation processes. As a model evaluation, we tested reproducibility of the impacts of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. We carried out a simulation, in which 20 Mt of SO2 and 100 Mt of volcanic ash were injected respectively into 25 km and 16—22 km altitudes over Mt. Pinatubo (120.4°E, 15.1°N) on June 15th 1991. We compared the model results with space-borne and balloon-borne observations. Although our model overestimated a near-global mean (60°N—60°S) of stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) observed by SAGE II instrument until one year after the eruption, it reproduced the observed SAOD in the subsequent period. The model well captured the observed increase of effective radius at 20 km altitude in the northern midlatitudes. In addition, we analyzed the pathway of volcanic sulfur from SO2 to sulfate aerosol. The most amount of the volcanic sulfur was converted from SO2 to accumulation mode aerosol by 100 days after the eruption. The conversion into the accumulation mode aerosol is attributable to coagulation until the first 14 days and to condensation growth after that.",

            "abstract": "While cities are generally major sources of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, recent research has shown that parts of urban areas may also act as CO2 sinks due to CO2 uptake by vegetation. However, currently available results are related to a large degree of uncertainty due to the limitations of the applied methods and the limited number of studies available from urban areas, particularly from the southern hemisphere. In this study, we explore the potential of eddy covariance and tracer measurements (13C and 14C isotopes of CO2) to quantify and partition CO2 fluxes and concentrations in a residential urban area in Auckland, New Zealand.\nBased on preliminary results from autumn and winter (March to July 2014) the residential area is a small source of CO2 (0.11 mol CO2 m-2 day-1). CO2 fluxes and concentrations follow a distinct diurnal cycle with a morning peak between 7:00 and 9:00 (max: 0.25 mol CO2 m-2 day-1/412 ppm) and midday low with negative CO2 fluxes (min: -0.17 mol CO2 m-2 day-1/392 ppm) between 10:00 and 15:00 local time, likely due to photosynthetic CO2 uptake by local vegetation. Soil CO2 efflux may explain that CO2 concentrations increase and remain high (401 ppm) throughout the night. Mean diurnal winter δ13C values are in anti-phase with CO2 concentrations and vary between -9.0 - -9.7‰. The depletion of δ13C compared to clean atmospheric air (-8.2‰) is likely a result of local CO2 sources dominated by gasoline combustion (appr. 60%) during daytime. A sector analysis (based on prevailing wind) of CO2 fluxes and concentrations indicates lower CO2 fluxes and concentrations from the vegetation-dominated sector, further demonstrating the influence of vegetation on local CO2 concentrations.\nThese results provide an insight into the temporal and spatial variability CO2 fluxes/concentrations and potential CO2 sinks and sources from a city in the southern hemisphere and add valuable information to the global database of urban CO2 fluxes.",

In this study, we adopted a neural network technique to prediction the electron flux in a geosynchronous orbit. Solar wind data and geomagnetic indices are used for input parameter of neural network. As a result, we present combinations of solar wind and geomagnetic indices that show highest prediction efficiency.

            "abstract": "Carbonate rocks have very heterogeneous structures due to their complex depositional and diagenetic processes. We performed two-phase lattice-Boltzmann flow simulation on high-resolution pore microstructures of two carbonate rocks with different porosity-types: inter-particle and fracture. From the simulations, we obtained detailed distribution of oil and water in the pore space. The distributions of oil-phase showed noticeable difference between drainage and imbibition stages even at the same oil saturation. Fingering effect was well observed in the rock with inter-particle porosity. On the other hand, there was no significant flow near fractures in the sample with fractures. The visualization was very helpful to understand underlying characteristics of oil and water movement in carbonate rocks. We also calculated P-wave velocity and electrical conductivity at different saturations during the two-phase flow simulations. The P-wave velocity and electrical conductivity showed high sensitivity to saturation changes in the sample with fractures, which implies that they can be used to predict the saturation. However, we found very little sensitivity in the sample with inter-particle porosity due to the high frame stiffness. We think that these numerical experiments with digital rocks would be a good complementary tool to understand the characteristics of carbonate reservoir rocks more quantitatively.\nAcknowledgements: This research was supported by the Basic Research Project of the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy of Korea (GP2012-029), and “Energy Efficiency & Resources of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) grant” funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry & energy (No. 20132010201760).",

Hot days carry difficulties and losses for Mongolian economy and daily life, such as people and livestock fell unfavorable (ill affected), agriculture losses, drying small rivers and lakes, causing steppe fires and etc.\n The hot day is one of the severe weather extreme in Mongolia, and their frequency and intensity have been increasing and becoming more severe. Intensive and longer-lasted hot days break out a heat wave event. Therefore, a monitoring of hot day and heat wave’s occurrence and its long-term change are in nationwide scale.\nLonger prolonged heat wave may one of the causes for drought initiation while occurrence of drought has noticeably increased since last decade, which it is consistent with the heat wave occurrence. We analyzed maximum air temperature and precipitation data at 12 stations obtained from National Agency for Meteorology and Environment Monitoring (NAMEM) of Mongolia. Definition of the hot day is calculated by each station from reference period (1971-2000) and the heat wave is defined by when the daily maximum air temperature is 5K higher than the daily climatology of the reference period and lasted more than 4 consecutive days.\nSpatial distribution of long-term mean heat wave occurrence suggests that two areas, in Siberia and Mongolia, show high frequency. Those two areas are separated each other. Time series analysis indicates that the frequency kept similar level in 1970s and 1980s. In last two decade, however, heat wave was increased in central Mongolia in 1990s and northern half of Mongolia in 2000s as well as Western and Eastern Siberia.",

            "abstract": "Forest fuel treatments (FFT) are often employed in Sierra Nevada forest (located in California, US) to enhance forest health, regulate stand density, and reduce wildfire risk. However, there have been concerns that FFTs may have negative impacts on certain protected wildlife species. Due to the constraints and protection of resources (e.g., perennial streams, cultural resources, wildlife habitat, etc.), the actual FFT extents are usually different from planned extents. Identifying the actual extent of treated areas is of primary importance to understand the environmental influence of FFTs. Light detection and ranging (Lidar) is a powerful remote sensing technique that can provide accurate forest structure measurements, which provides great potential to monitor forest changes. This study used canopy height model (CHM) and canopy cover (CC) products derived from multi-temporal airborne Lidar data to detect FFTs by an approach combining a pixel-wise thresholding method and a object-of-interest segmentation method. We also investigated forest change following the implementation of landscape-scale FFT projects through the use of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and standardized principle component analysis (PCA) from multi-temporal high resolution aerial imagery. The same FFT detection routine was applied on the Lidar data and aerial imagery for the purpose of comparing the capability of Lidar data and aerial imagery on FFT detection. Our results demonstrated that the FFT detection using Lidar derived CC products produced both the highest total accuracy and kappa coefficient, and was more robust at identifying areas with light FFTs. The accuracy using Lidar derived CHM products was significantly lower than that of the result using Lidar derived CC, but was still slightly higher than using aerial imagery. FFT detection results using NDVI and standardized PCA using multi-temporal aerial imagery produced almost identical total accuracy and kappa coefficient. Both methods showed relatively limited capacity to detect light FFT areas, and had higher false detection rate (recognized untreated areas as treated areas) compared to the methods using Lidar derived parameters.",

            "abstract": "A micromechanical model is developed to simulate the hydraulic fracturing process. The model comprises two key components. Firstly, the solid matrix, assumed as a rock mass with pre-fabricated cracks, is represented by an array of bonded particles simulated by the Discrete Element Model (DEM)[1]. The interaction is ruled by the spheropolyhedra method, which was introduced by the authors previously and has been shown to realistically represent many of the features found in fracturing and communition processes.\nThe second component is the fluid, which is modelled by the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). It was recently coupled with the spheropolyhedra by the authors and validated. An advantage of this coupled LBM-DEM model is the control of many of the parameters of the fracturing fluid, such as its viscosity and the injection rate. To the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first application of such a coupled scheme for studying hydraulic fracturing[2]. In this first implementation, results are presented for a two-dimensional situation. Fig. 1 shows one snapshot of the LBM-DEM coupled simulation for the hydraulic fracturing where the elements with broken bonds can be identified and the fracture geometry quantified.\nThe simulation involves a variation of the underground stress, particularly the difference between the two principal components of the stress tensor, to explore the effect on the fracture path. A second study focuses on the fluid viscosity to examine the effect of the time scales of different injection plans on the fracture geometry. The developed tool and the presented results have important implications for future studies of the hydraulic fracturing process and technology.\nreferences\n1.

Accurate modeling of HR and its impact on vegetation growth and ecosystem carbon dynamics is important for accurate simulation of regional and global carbon cycles. However, how HR influences plant, soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics remains poorly understood. In this study, we incorporate a simple HR scheme into the Community Land Model Version 4.5 (CLM4.5) including the biogeochemical model BGC. We use the modified CLM4.5-BGC model to investigate the impact of HR on the terrestrial carbon cycle at eight AmeriFlux sites where HR was detected from soil moisture measurements: a Douglas-fir site (US-Wrc) in Washington State with a Mediterranean climate, a savanna site (US-SRM) in Arizona with a semi-arid climate, and six sites along the Southern California Climate Gradient with a Mediterranean climate, with coverage of coastal sage (US-SCs), grassland (US-SCg), oak/pine forest (US-SCf), pinyon and juniper woodland (US-SCw), desert chaparral (US-SCc), and desert perennials and annuals (US-SCd). Monitored net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) at the US-Wrc, US-SRM, and US-SCf sites, is used in model calibration and HR sensitivity analysis. Preliminary results from the model indicate that HR tends to increase net primary production (NPP) during dry periods and increase leaf area index (LAI) throughout the year at the US-Wrc site, while HR increased NPP and LAI during growing season and reduced NPP and LAI during dry periods at the US-SCs and US-SCg sites, with corresponding modifications to carbon storage in soil layers and in plant leaf, stem, and root carbon pools. The biogeochemical processes leading to these effects will be analyzed and presented.",

Our study area, 1-7°N and 92-97°E, covers the entire forearc from northwest of Aceh to west of Simeulue Island. Five 2D MCS seismic profiles transecting the prism from the Sunda Trench to the Aceh Basin, along with multibeam data, have been used to investigate wedge morphology and structure. Analysis of fold vergence along the profiles and areal classification of the predominant vergence reveal three structural zones: 1) predominantly landward-vergent folds near the Sunda Trench, 2) predominantly seaward-vergent folds near the Aceh Basin, and 3) mixed vergent folds between those two zones. Extensive landward vergence is uncommon in accretionary prisms worldwide. One explanation is the existence of a backstop with a seaward dipping edge, such that overlying younger sediments accreted to the prism form landward-vergent folds. We propose a backstop geometry that extends from under the Aceh Basin to under the mixed vergence zone, based on the observed structural zones and published velocity models of this margin. The backstop may consist either of older accreted sediment or the granitic Sunda Block. With the existence of a strong inner wedge acting as a backstop, together with suspected indurated sediments forming the landward vergence zone, rupture during major subduction zone earthquakes nucleating under the forearc basin or central plateau high can propagate farther seaward toward the Sunda Trench and displace greater volumes of water than a more landward rupture, yielding more hazardous tsunami. Using bathymetric data of before and after the 2004 earthquake, we are now testing the hypothesis that maximum slip occurs near the trench. These results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The open-loop geothermal system directly uses a relatively stable temperature of groundwater for cooling and heating in buildings and thus has been known as an eco-friendly, energy-saving, and cost-efficient technique. The facility for this system was installed at a site located near Paldang-dam in Han-river, Korea. Because of the well-developed alluvium, the site might be appropriate to application of this system requiring extraction and injection of a large amount of groundwater. A simple numerical experiment assuming various hydrogeologic conditions demonstrated that regional groundwater flow direction was the most important factor for efficient operation of facility in this site having a highly permeable layer. However, a comparison of river stage data and groundwater level measurements showed that the daily and seasonal controls of water level at Paldang-dam have had a critical influence on the regional groundwater flow in the site. Moreover, nitrate concentrations measured in the monitoring wells gave indication of the effect of agricultural activities around the facility on the groundwater quality. The facility operation, such as extraction and injection of groundwater, will obviously affect transport of the agricultural contaminant and, maybe, it will even cause serious problems in the normal operation. Particularly, the high-permeable layer in this aquifer must be a preferential path for quick spreadings of thermal and contaminant plumes. The objective of this study was to find an efficient, safe and stable operation plan of the open-loop geothermal system installed in this site having the complicated conditions of highly permeable layer, variable regional groundwater flow, and agricultural contamination. Numerical simulations for groundwater flow, heat and solute transport were carried out to analyze all the changes in groundwater level and flow, temperature, and quality according to the operation, respectively. Results showed that an operation plan for only the thermal efficiency of system cannot be the best in aspect of safe and stable operation related to groundwater quality. All these results concluded that it is essential to understand various and site-specific conditions of the site in a more integrated approach for the successful application of the open-loop geothermal system.",

            "abstract": "Water is thought to play an essential role in dynamical processes in the Earth’s interior. Even several tens wt. ppm of water may enhance the creep rates in olivine by orders of magnitude based on deformation experiments [1, 2]. High temperature creep in olivine is believed to be controlled by self-diffusion of the slowest species, which is silicon in olivine. However, silicon self-diffusion experiments suggest that the role of water on olivine rheology is overestimated in previous deformation studies because of the experimental difficulties [3].\nOn the other hand, oxygen is the second slowest species with similar diffusion rate as silicon. It may also play an essential role in olivine creep. By comparing the oxygen self-diffusion coefficient (DO) in olivine at ambient pressure and dry conditions [4] with those at 2 GPa and hydrous conditions, it is found that even 30-50 wt. ppm of water could enhance DO by one order of magnitude [5]. However, comparison of experimental results obtained at different pressures could lead to misinterpretations because different experimental setups have different error sources [6].\nIn this study, we systematically measured DO in an iron-free olivine, namely, forsterite, at 8 GPa and 1600-1800 K over a wide range of water content (CH2O) from <1 up to 800 wt. ppm. Our results show that DO∝(CH2O)0.05±0.06≈(CH2O)0. Thus, water has no significant effect on oxygen self-diffusion rate in forsterite. Since the water content dependence of silicon self-diffusion rate is also very small [3], the role of water on olivine rheology is not as significant as previously thought by assuming the diffusion controlled creep mechanism. \n[1] Karato &Jung (2003), Philosophical Mag. 83, 401-414.\n[2] Hirth & Kohlstedt (2003) Geophys.

            "abstract": "Seasonal glacier velocity changes are attributed to subglacial slip associated with water pressure changes that occur because of the seasonal variability of meltwater input. Abe and Furuya (2014) reported winter speed-up signals and their downglacier propagation at a number of glaciers near the border of Alaska and Yukon, based on ALOS/PALSAR radar image analyses. Here we perform the similar analyses at the Chugach mountain range of South Central Alaska, and report the spatial-temporal evolution of the Matanuska Glacier. Matanuska Glacier is the largest accessible glacier in Alaska with its nearly 40 km length and 5 km width near the terminus. Comparing the winter velocity images in 2007, 2008 and 2010, those in 2010 were about 1.5-2 times faster than those during the previous two years. In addition, comparing the fall and winter velocities, winter velocities were apparently faster at every 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2010-2011 season. These data indicate winter speed-up or mini-surge signals even at a temperate and non-surgetype Matanuska Glacier. We also examine the spatial-temporal elevation changes, using data from the LiDAR altimeter in the Icebridge mission, and found significant elevation increase near the terminus. Winter speed-up may not be uncommon at Alaskan/Yukon glaciers. Lingle and Fatland (2003) detected faster speed in winter than in fall at non-surging Seward Glacier in the St. Elias Mountains; this is the only published and unambiguous report of winter speed-up, to our knowledge. Combined with earlier glacier hydrological studies, Lingle and Fatland proposed englacial water storage and gravity-driven water flow toward the bed in winter regardless of whether a given glacier is surge-type or not, and considered that the capacity of englacial water storage would control if a given glacier was surge-type or not. We consider that our measurements are complementary to Lingle and Fatland’s observations and lend further support for their hypothesis. Basal crevasse observed at Bench Glacier, Alaska, by Harper et al (2010) could be a possible form of englacial water storage. Because it has no direct route to the surface but can store significant volume of water near the bed, basal crevasse may generate high water pressure when they become constricted due to creep closure in winter.",

            "abstract": "An important source of groundwater recharge to sedimentary basin aquifers is from mountain block recharge and in many instances the rate and direction of groundwater flow is controlled by regional scale fault systems. Vertical faults may act as either barriers to horizontal groundwater flow perpendicular to the fault, conduits to horizontal flow along the fault or a combination of both. Faults can also provide conduits for vertical flow. There are very few evaluations of the impact of fault zones on groundwater flow. This study investigated groundwater flow characteristics across a fault zone between a fractured rock and sedimentary aquifer system. Hydrogeological and hydrogeophysical techniques were used to design a drilling program whereby multi-level observation wells were constructed at 3 field sites either side of the Willunga fault in the Willunga Basin, South Australia, up to 300 metres below ground level. The observed hydraulic gradients across the fault zone were very significant (2.5), with a head difference of 80 metres over a horizontal distance of less than 30 metres. Despite the high hydraulic gradient, calculating the groundwater flux across the fault was more complicated. A 3D numerical model was developed to determine the relative proportion of groundwater flow across the fault and flow parallel to the fault. This model was also used to assess the impact of the fault zone permeability on the hydraulic gradients across the fault and evaluate the mechanisms and behaviour of these conduit-barrier systems to groundwater flow. Groundwater age dating and hydrochemical analyses were conducted to examine and constrain the contributing end members of the different aquifer systems and trace groundwater movement and residence time across the fault zone.",

            "abstract": "Noah-MP (Niu et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011) is the next generation land surface model for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) meteorological model and the Climate Forecast Systems in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. While Noah-MP does not currently contain a dynamic nitrogen cycle, this can readily be updated with the interactive vegetation canopy option. In this study, Noah-MP is coupled with the Fixation & Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN) model (Fisher et al., 2010) for the above ground processes and the soil nitrogen model from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the below ground processes. This combines FUN’s state-of-the-art concept of the carbon cost theory and SWAT’s strength in representing the anthropogenic effects on the nitrogen cycle. The processes employed from FUN are the nitrogen uptake and fixation of plants, both of which are directly linked to the plant productivity. If passive nitrogen uptake cannot meet the nitrogen demand, plants have to spend part of the photosynthesized carbon production on nitrogen acquisition. The processes employed from SWAT are nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, immobilization, volatilization, atmospheric deposition, and leaching. In addition, the modified universal soil loss equation is used to more accurately account for the nitrogen removal in sediment caused by surface runoff. Because human input of nitrogen greatly changes the nitrogen cycle, a simple nitrogen fertilization approach is also applied to crops. Preliminary results show that Noah-MP is capable of simulating the dynamics of the major nitrogen pools. Further comprehensive evaluation of the new model will be conducted at one or more experimental sites.",

            "abstract": "Recent progress on receiver function (RF) analysis has provided us with new insight about the subsurface structure. The method is now gradually being more applied to records of ocean-bottom seismometers (OBSs). In the present study, we conducted RF analysis using OBS records at 32 observation sites around the Kii Peninsula, southwestern Japan, from 2003 to 2007 (Mochizuki et al., 2010, GRL). We addressed problems concerning water reverberations.\nWe first checked the effects of water reverberations on the OBS vertical component records by calculating vertical P-wave RFs (Langston and Hammer, 2001, BSSA), where the OBS vertical component records were deconvolved by stacked traces of on-land records as source functions. The resultant RFs showed strong peaks corresponding to the water reverberations. Referring to these RFs, we constructed inverse filters to remove the effects of water reverberations from the vertical component records, which were assumed to be represented by two parameters, a two-way travel time within the water layer, and a reflection coefficient at the seafloor. We then calculated radial RFs using the filtered, reverberation-free, vertical component records of OBS data as source functions. The resultant RFs showed that some phases at later times became clearer than those obtained by an ordinary method.\nFrom the comparison with a previous tomography model (Akuhara et al., 2013, GRL), we identified phases originating from the oceanic Moho, which delineates the relationship between the depth of earthquakes and the oceanic Moho: seaward intraslab seismicity is high within the oceanic crust while the landward seismicity is high within the oceanic mantle. This character may be relevant to the dehydration process.",

The location, failure surface elevation, and date of each are: 1) Mt Steller-S [60.5o N, ~3100 m, 09-14-2005]; 2) Mt Steller-N [60.5o N, ~2975 m, late 2005-early 2006]; 3) Waxell Ridge [61.6o N, ~2620 m, late 2005-early 2006]; 4) Mt. Steele [61.6o N; 4640 m, 07-24-2007]; 5) Mt. Lituya [58.8o N, 2260 m, 06-11-2012]; and 6) Mt. LaPerouse [58.5o N, ~2750 m, 02-16-2014]).\nAll display: a) evidence of failed near-summit hanging glaciers and/or perennial ice and snow; b) exposed hydrological features such as moulins, conduits, and collapsed englacial stream channels in failed ice and snow margins; and c) fresh concave bedrock failure surfaces exposed following hanging glacier/ice/snow failure. At the three visited sites, the rock fragment component of the slide debris was dominated by smaller cobble sized-particles, with a general absence of large angular blocks. At two sites, visual evidence of liquid water exiting conduits or collapsed englacial stream channels persisted for months. None of the failures is correlated with a seismic event. Although all six failures originated at latitude/elevation locations where mean annual temperatures are below freezing, the physical evidence strongly supports the presence and involvement of liquid water/meltwater in triggering each event.\nWe propose the following explanation for the origin of these events. Abnormally warm summer temperatures or extreme winter rainfall events produced unusual volumes of water which saturated summit snow and ice and/or filled summit glacier channels and conduits with liquid water. Liquid water reached the frozen water/bedrock interface, destabilizing the contact. The fresh concave bedrock failure surfaces suggest that glacier beds were adhering to steep bedrock surfaces composed of a mélange of freeze/thaw shattered rock fragments held together by interstitial ice. When the mass of saturated glacier ice failed, the bedrock mélange also failed, resulting in the typically fine grained debris and fresh bedrock scarp depressions.",

            "abstract": "The surface uplift history of the Altiplano plateau is widely debated. Two end-member models favor: a slow and gradual surface uplift from ~45Ma by distributed shortening; and pulsed rapid surface uplift between 16–9 Ma and 10–6 Ma in the southern and central plateau respectively by lower lithospheric removal. To better elucidate the along strike nature of the surface uplift, we extended the elevation and deformation history to the early to late Cenozoic basins in the northernmost part of the Central Andean plateau, inferred to have formed in the foreland, wedgetop, and hinterland settings of the Andean fold-thrust belt in southern Peru.\nIncreasing deformation related to propagation of the foreland basin system is shown by early Paleocene backbulge Quilque to the late Eocene wedgetop Soncco formations. The lowest elevation (sea level) is recorded by marginal marine deposits of Quilque. The ð18O of meteoric water (ð18Omw) reconstructed from sedimentary carbonates show similar average values with -6.7 ±1.9‰ in late Paleocene Chilca to -8.1 ±2.6‰ in middle Miocene Paruro formations, suggesting a middle Miocene paleoelevation of 1.1 ±1.0 km (2σ) in first order approximation.\nIn members A, B and C of Miocene–Pliocene Descanso Yauri basin, A and B are deformed and C is relatively undeformed and flat lying. A, B and the lower C deposits are fluvial and middle–upper C deposits are lacustrine. The ð18Omw from B and C carbonates show averages of -8.4 ±1.1‰ and -9.7 ±3.1‰; the large range in C (-5.5‰ to -14.7‰) is tentatively interpreted as a result of high altitude precipitation, modified by evaporative enrichment within the lake system. Reconstructed MAAT from Δ47 of carbonates and ðD of plant waxes show similar results in B (29.1±5.0°C, -146.6±10.9‰) and ~9Ma lower C (23.1 ±1.9°C, -149.6±9.7‰), and a large shift in ðD to -206.7±13.0‰ in upper diatomaceous non-calcareous C (minimum U-Pb zircon age constraint of 4.3 ±0.3 Ma, 2σ). Therefore, we infer that the northernmost part of the plateau experienced a pulse of rapid surface uplift between ~9–4 Ma, possibly as a result of the lower lithosphere removal and south to north lower crustal flow. The timing is consistent with the north-central Altiplano, although possibly slightly later, and suggests that a regional-scale phenomenon resulted in surface uplift.",

One important issue in a cloud modeling is the parameterization of the microphysical processes of hydrometeors.

We investigate how the results are evaluated using more realistic size distributions of microphysics.\nIn this study, the cloud microphysics of deep convective systems is evaluated over the tropical open ocean simulated by a cloud system resolving model using a satellite simulator. We evaluate the horizontal distribution of cloud sizes, the joint probability distributions of cloud-top temperature, precipitation-top height, and CFADs of radar reflectivities for each category in cloud-system-resolving simulations using a TRMM precipitation radar (PR) and infrared scanner following the approach proposed by Masunaga and Kummerow (2006) and Matsui et al. (2009). The control experiment shows biases related to underestimation of stratiform precipitation and a higher frequency of precipitating deep clouds whose top height is higher than 12 km compared with the TRMM data, although it shows good agreement for the horizontal distribution and statistical cloud size distributions of deep convective systems. The biases in the joint histogram are improved by changing the cloud microphysics parameters in the framework of a single-moment bulk microphysics scheme. In particular, the effects of the size distribution of precipitating hydrometeors are examined. Global cloud system resolving simulations with a 3.5 km horizontal resolution are done and analyzed using TRMM and CloudSat. The T3EF structure is similar to the regional cloud system resolving results. The modified microphysics improves the joint histogram structures. The OLR of the modified simulation is lower than the control run with a wide range of anvil clouds. The bias of upper troposphere is improved and precipitation system is well organized in the modified simulation. The regional differences of T3EF are examined.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate reservoirs are highly complicated and heterogeneous than typical sandstone reservoirs, because of their depositional and diagenetic complexity. Therefore estimating the prospectiveness in an early stage of reservoir development is not an easy task. Typically we use an empirical equation, which calculates recovery factor (RF) for this assessment. Since the equation was created with reservoir parameters (porosity, water saturation, permeability, viscosity, pressure, etc.) from sandstone reservoirs, the applicability to carbonate reservoirs is questionable. We compiled 97 carbonate reservoirs and created a database with reservoir properties, geological information, and production data. First, we applied the existing empirical equation to our data and the results were disappointing: the predicted RF’s was far off from actual values and correlation was also poor. We then modified the equation by adding geological parameters, such as play type, reservoir age, reservoir type, porosity type, trap information. The new equation was modelled by determining the coefficient of each parameter using least-square minimizing scheme. The modified equation estimated the recovery factor much better and more reliably. We think that the additional geological information is essential for accurate assessment of carbonate reservoirs in early stage of development, since the carbonate reservoirs show high variability and complexity by depositional and diagenetic changes.

            "abstract": "Magma-water interaction (MWI) influences both eruption style and resulting pyroclast grain size (and transport properties). We explore both the mechanisms and consequences of MWI by examining tephra deposits from the 2500BC Hverfjall Fires within the Krafla fissure system, northern Iceland. Here, contemporaneous fissure vents spanned sub-aerial to shallow lacustrine environments, causing both dry magmatic and variably wet phreatomagmatic activity. As all vents shared the same initial magma composition, the range of pyroclastic (ash fall, wet surge, dry surge and scoria) deposits provides an excellent sample suite to explore fragmentation mechanisms under different near-surface conditions. Sample analysis of the opening phreatomagmatic phase shows that ash components of individual size fractions exhibit a linear increase [from 8% (1φ) to 77% (>4φ)] in the proportion of dense blocky fragments with decreasing size (Figure). The proportion of vesicular particles decreases concurrently, but shards comprise an increasing proportion of the vesicular size fraction [from 6% (1φ) to 70% (>4φ)]. Free crystals, lithic and microcrystalline grains are ~10% of all size classes. We compare these morphological data to (1) bubble size distributions (BSDs) and (2) the spatial distribution of preserved volatiles in matrix glass, which record the degassing history and pressure/rate of quenching, respectively. Measured BSDs for quenched Pele’s tears within the opening phreatomagmatic ash deposit show a modal bubble diameter of 20–30 µm (by number) or 150–200 µm (by volume), comparable to those from Kilauea Iki fire fountains in Hawaii. Elevated dissolved sulphur concentrations (≤ 550 ppm) in phreatomagmatic ash compared to magmatic scoria (~180 ppm), however, suggests either faster quench rates and/or greater fragmentation depths. To discriminate between these alternatives, we analyse BSDs in ash from the magmatic phase, which requires determining the optimal particle size for BSD analysis: small particles do not preserve the volumetrically important large bubbles, while large particles experience post-fragmentation expansion. Finally, comparing BSDs to grain size distributions demonstrates the importance of bubbles in localizing thermal stresses during phreatomagmatic fragmentation.",

            "abstract": "Stream temperature plays an important role in closing the energy balance at local, regional and global scales, and exerts significant impacts on aquatic biodiversity, power plant operation and energy production. It is therefore a critical component for representing the energy-water nexus in earth system models. The stream temperature particularly in large river systems is very often regulated by human activities such as reservoir and power plant operations. This study is a first attempt to develop a physically based stream temperature model within the Community Earth System Model (CESM) framework. The Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART) has been developed to represent riverine water dynamics and incorporated into CESM by coupling with the Community Land Model (CLM). Here we build upon CLM-MOSART to represent the riverine transport of heat along with water flux and the energy exchanges between river water and the atmosphere. More importantly, the impacts of reservoir and power plant operations are also explicitly parameterized within this new stream temperature model. This new stream temperature model will first be driven by historical forcing and validated against the observed stream temperature at a number of USGS gauges across the US. Then, driven by dynamically downscaled climate change scenarios, the relative contributions of climate change and reservoir and power-plant operation on the projected spatiotemporal changes in stream temperature will be systematically analyzed. Lastly the current limitations and future directions will be discussed.",

Using HR-ICPMS (elements) and MC-ICPMS (isotopes), we measured a suite of trace elements, 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd isotopic ratios from silicate (Si) and carbonate (CO32-) fractions of 37 bottom sediment samples during 3 seasons along a transect from the estuary upstream in Narmada (ND) and Netravati (NT), the two large rivers along the west coast of India, discharge into the Arabian Sea.\nStrontium isotopic values ranged from 0.70910 to 0.71778 (NR CO32-), 0.71014 to 0.72427 (NT CO32-) and 0.71085 to 0.72825 (NR Si), and 0.71025 to 0.73349 (NT Si). The εNd(0) values ranged from -22.1 to -0.8 (NR CO32-), and -32.2 to -24.3 (NT, CO32-), and -23.7 to -6.2 (NR Si) and -37.4 to -21.2 (NT Si). Variable extents of seasonal and spatial variations on the isotopic compositions of Sr and Nd (both in CO32- and Si fractions), were observed in both rivers.\nA comparison of the ‘model age’ of the sediments calculated from the time-depleted-mantle (TDM) model using the concentrations of Nd and Sm and isotopic composition of Nd indicate the following: i) For NT, the TDM–based ‘model age’, 2.8 to 3.3 Ga, agrees with the age of Peninsular Gneiss, an older gneissic complex (3.2-3.4 Ga) found in this watershed; ii) For NR, there is discordance between the TDM–based ‘model age’ (1.3-2.4 Ga) and the age of the rocks in this watershed (Deccan basalt, ~65 Ma). We attribute this discordance to mixing of older material from the Precambrian rocks derived by weathering at the head waters of NR. From the observed differences in the Sr isotopes in the main stream and tributaries, we estimate that ~90% of the sediments are derived from main stream and ~10% is derived from tributaries using binary mixing equation in NT and additional sediment source(s) in NR. The Sr isotopic signatures of carbonate fractions in both rivers are close to the global average modern seawater (0.7092) and river water (0.7160) values, suggesting dominant authigenic origin representing the isotopic signatures of the dissolved phase of these rivers. Among the two rivers studied, the NR seems to be dominated by carbonate weathering and whereas silicate weathering dominates the NT. The contrasting differences between these two river systems serve as model for other large and small Indian rivers.",

In support of these goals, our distributed team at BYU and NSIDC faces project coordination challenges to produce a high-quality data set that our user community will accept as a replacement for the currently available historical versions of these data. We work closely with our DAAC liaison on format specifications, data and metadata plans, and project progress.

Early Adopter feedback will be critical input to our final data content and format decisions. For algorithm transparency and accountability, we have released an Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) and detailed supporting technical documentation, with rationale for all algorithm implementation decisions. For distributed team management, we are using collaborative tools for software revision control and issue tracking.

            "abstract": "Rapid advances in remote sensing are narrowing the gap between the data available for characterizing physical and biological processes in rivers and the information needed to guide river management decisions. The availability and quality of hyperspectral imagery have increased drastically over the past 20 years and hyperspectral data is now used in a number of different capacities that range from classifying riverine environments to measuring river bathymetry. A fundamental challenge in relating the spectral data from images to biophysical processes is the difficulty of isolating individual contributions to the at-sensor radiance, each associated with a different component of the fluvial environment. In this presentation we describe a method for isolating the contribution of light reflected from the water surface, or sun glint, from a hyperspectral image of a shallow gravel-bed river. We show that isolation and removal of sun glint can improve the accuracy of spectrally-based depth retrieval in cases where sun glint dominates the at-sensor radiance. Observed-vs.-predicted R2 values for depth retrieval improved from 0.56 to 0.68 following sun glint removal. In addition to clarifying the signal associated with the water column and bed, isolating sun glint could unlock important hydraulic information contained within the topography of the water surface. We present data from flume and field experiments suggesting that the intensity of sun glint is a function of water surface roughness. In rivers, water surface roughness depends on local flow hydraulics: depth, velocity, and bed material grain size. To explore this relationship, we coupled maps of image-derived sun glint with hydraulic measurements collected with a kayak-borne acoustic Doppler current profiler along 2 km of the Snake River in Grand Teton National Park. Spatial patterns of sun glint are spatially correlated with field observations of near-surface velocity and depth, suggesting that reach scale hydraulics could be mapped from hyperspectral images. These findings also suggest that aquatic habitats, which are often associated with specific hydraulic conditions and manifested as distinct surface textures, could be mapped quantitatively over large areas using hyperspectral imagery.",

            "abstract": "Reliable future projection by the climate or Earth system model is crucial for the issue on future climate change. For the reliable future projection, uncertainty of the aerosol effect on the climate change should be reduced, because the uncertainty has been large. Therefore, it is essential to understand the effect of anthropogenic aerosol forcing on climate change in the 20th century. In this study, we have assessed the effect by a comparison between the 20th century historical simulations (20C and piAero) with the aerosol forcing fluctuated realistically over time and fixed in the pre-industrial condition by MIROC-ESM. We focus on the climate change in the North Pacific Ocean (NPO) due to anthropogenic aerosol emitted from China in the late 20th century.\nIn the comparison between the two simulations, there has been little difference in the global mean surface temperature (SAT) from 1851 to 1900. Then the difference appears and reaches to about 0.2 deg. C in 1950’s. After 1960, the difference in SAT between the two experiments become large.\nFor SST change in the NPO, small positive trend is found after 1900 in the piAero, but not found in the 20C. Thus, the SST difference in the NPO between the two experiments is significant after 1900. While the positive SST trend in the NPO has been large in the piAero after 1960, SST in the Central NPO shows the negative trend in the 20C. These enlarge SST difference between the two experiments.\nThe negative SST trend in the Central NPO in the 20C is likely to be attributable to an increase of aerosol emission from China. The aerosol increase, which is also found in the NPO, makes solar insolation into the surface decrease mainly through the aerosol indirect effect. This effect decreases SST. Also, the effect is seen in the boreal spring and summer. However, the effect is not found in the piAero.\nThe Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which is the principal natural variability in the NPO, has been investigated. Linear trend of SST change after 1960 in the NPO enhances (weaken) SST anomaly features in the PDO positive (negative) phase. Response of the atmosphere to the PDO variability also has been varied since 1960. However, we cannot conclude that periodicity of the PDO is affected by the increase of aerosol.",

            "abstract": "The Japan Trench axis area has been intensively investigated since the 2011 Tohoku earthquake because the large slip reached to the vicinity of the trench axis. We have conducted three high resolution seismic cruises in the northern part of the Japan Trench axis region. The trench area between 38 – 40 N was covered by 81 E-W seismic lines with 2 – 4 km line interval. A 1200 m-long, 192 channel streamer cable and a cluster gun array with volume of 320 – 380 inch3 were used for these surveys. Post-stack time migrated sections provide detailed image of sediments above the subducting Pacific plate and its deformation by the bending-related normal faults on the outer trench slope, thrust faults and possible slope failures in the trench axis and inner trench slope. The deformation style of the sediments in the trench axis shows variation along the trench strike. To the south of the survey area in 38 – 39 N, the trench axis shows imbricate thrust-and-fold packages, which could be related to the interaction between the frontal prism toe and horst-graben structure. To the north around 40 N, the trench axis is located on a horst, and frontal thrust and imbricate structure are clearly observed on the seismic profiles. Around 39.5 N, the trench inner slope is very steep. It is suggested that slope failures as rotational slumps have occurred in this area. The trench axis is filled by slump deposits and debris with chaotic acoustic characteristics, which is similar with that in the seaward portion of the frontal prism. Seismic profiles on the outer trench slope show the variation on the thickness of the incoming sediments along the trench strike. It is thick, ~ 500 ms, in the northern part of the survey area around 40 N, and it is ~ 250 ms in the southern part around 38 N. The thickness is varied in the area between 38.5 – 39.5 N, and is very thin at 39.5 N. Sediments on the trench outer slope basically conformably cover the igneous basement of the Pacific plate and they were deformed by the bending-related normal faults, however graben fill sediments which onlap the original incoming sediments are also clearly observed on the seismic profiles in the outer trench slope. These graben fill sediments have been deposited in several isolated basins on the outer trench slope. Similar onlap fill sediments are also observed in a few places in the trench axis.",

McGarity, JWRPM, 2012, 111-24) to explicitly model and optimize these uncertainties in an adaptive management framework. A two-stage model represents the immediate commitment of resources (“here & now”) followed by later investment and adaptation decisions (“wait & see”). A case study is presented for Philadelphia, which intends to extensively deploy GI over the next two decades (PWD, “Green City, Clean Water – Implementation and Adaptive Management Plan,” 2011).\nAfter first-stage decisions are made, the model updates the stochastic objective and constraints (learning). We model two types of “learning” about GI cost and performance. One assumes that learning occurs over time, is automatic, and does not depend on what has been done in stage one (basic model). The other considers learning resulting from active experimentation and learning-by-doing (advanced model). Both require expert probability elicitations, and learning from research and monitoring is modelled by Bayesian updating (as in S. Jacobi et al., JWRPM, 2013, 534-43).\nThe model allocates limited financial resources to GI investments over time to achieve multiple objectives with a given reliability. Objectives include minimizing construction and O&M costs; achieving nutrient, sediment, and runoff volume targets; and community concerns, such as aesthetics, CO2 emissions, heat islands, and recreational values. CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) and chance constraints are placed on the objectives to achieve desired confidence levels. By varying the budgets, reliability constraints, and priorities among other objectives, we generate a range of GI deployment strategies that represent tradeoffs among objectives as well as the confidence in achieving them.",

            "abstract": "The core observatory satellite of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission was launched on February 27th 2014. The Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) on the GPM core observatory is the succession of the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR). The DPR consists of a Ku-band precipitation radar and a Ka-band precipitation radar. The DPR is expected to be more sensitive than the PR especially in the measurement of light rainfall and snowfall in high latitude regions.\nBecause of the difference of spatial and temporal resolutions, Space Radar (SR) and conventional type of Ground Radar (GR) are hard to compare.The SR observes each point of earth in short time, for example one footprint is an observation in some microseconds. Rain-gauge measurements have accurate rainfall rate, but rain-gage observes small area and accumulated rainfall in some minutes. The conventional GR can cover a wide area, however, a volume scan requires several minutes.\nThe Phased Array weather Radar (PAR) is developed by Osaka University, Toshiba, and NICT. The PAR is a weather-radar on X-band within 100m range sampling. High spatial and temporal resolution is achieved by the PAR with pulse compression and the digital beam-forming technique. The PAR transmits a wide beam and receives narrow beams by using digital beam forming. Then, the PAR observes many elevation angles from a single pulse. The time of each volume scan is 10-30 seconds in operation, typically 30 seconds. The study shows comparisons between the DPR and the PAR by more similar spatial and temporal resolution.\nThe rainfall region of DPR is similar to the one of PAR. Correlation coefficient of both radar reflectivity suggests more than 0.8 in the 20km range of PAR. As a result, it is considered that DPR can observe with high accuracy. We present the case study which DPR overpassed the PAR observation region in detail.",

We combined two new annual-resolution proxies of Atlantic storm activity to extend the observational TC record back to the 16th Century. A tree-growth suppression chronology (1707–2010 CE) from the Florida Keys, U.S.A. captures 91% of observed North Atlantic TCs (1850–2010 CE) and shares significant peak events with a documentary time series of Spanish shipwrecks in the Caribbean (1495–1820). Decadal-scale shipwreck rates were lowest during the Maunder Minimum (ca. 1645–1715), indicating that cooler Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during this period reduced Caribbean TC activity. Our results support global-scale climate proxy data and suggest that cooler tropical Atlantic SSTs and a generally negative mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation during the Little Ice Age reduced TC frequency.",

            "abstract": "The strength of large scale atmospheric feedbacks (in particular those due to water vapour, clouds, lapse rate and surface albedo) determine the climate ‘sensitivity’ – the magnitude of the global response to greenhouse gas forcing. Understanding and evaluating climate change feedbacks remain critical tasks for quantifying projection uncertainty, assessing confidence in models and ultimately narrowing the range of future projections.\nRecent research suggests that global scale radiative feedbacks operate across a very broad range of timescales. For example seasonally, feedbacks act to amplify the annual cycle of temperature, as suggested by both models and observations. What can the strength and structure of feedbacks at ‘shorter’ timescales tell us about climate change feedbacks?\nThis study addresses this issue by examining the strength and structure of water vapour, lapse rate, surface albedo cloud and temperature feedbacks operating at seasonal, interannual and longer timescales in CMIP3 and CMIP5 models, and comparing them with climate change feedbacks. Implications for both the understanding and evaluation of climate change feedbacks from shorter timescale variability and response will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Stratospheric signals, such as oxygen anomaly in CO2, are distinct from those originated from the Earth’s surface. The stratospheric anomaly in CO2 was explained as a result of the exchange reaction between CO2 and O3 via the excited state oxygen atom O(1D), produced by the UV photolysis of O3. The subsequent large scale circulation (Brewer-Dobson circulation) and synoptic eddy mixing bring the anomalous CO2 to the surface, providing another opportunity for studying biogeochemical cycles involving CO2. Here, we show that the oxygen anomaly in CO2 increases during the course of our sampling period (September 2013-February 2014), concordant with the strengthening of winter monsoon and subtropical jet system. The interaction between winter monsoon and jet system could efficiently enhance the vertical mixing between upper troposphere/lower stratosphere and the lower troposphere. Moreover, an attempt to the mid-troposphere CO2 anomaly is also made. We report for the first time the triple oxygen isotope composition of CO2 in the middle troposphere collected by the CARRIBIC phase one mission. A clear correlation of D17O in CO2 with N2O mixing ratios is observed which confirms the incursion of stratospheric air to the mid-tropospheric region. This is also supported by the compact correlation with O3 mixing ratios.",

Urban areas are fast responding catchments due to significant impervious surface. Stormwater designs based on daily rainfall data provide inadequate information. We, therefore, develop intensity-duration-frequency curves using sub-daily (1 hour to 12 hour) rainfall data for 57 major urban areas in India. While rain gage stations data from urban areas are most suitable, but stations are unevenly distributed and their data have gaps and inconsistencies. Therefore, we used hourly rainfall data from the Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), which provides a long term data (1979 onwards). Since reanalysis products have uncertainty associated with them we need to enhance their accuracy before their application. We compared daily rain gage station data obtained from Global Surface Summary of Day Data (GSOD) available for 65 stations for the period of 2000-2010 with gridded daily rainfall data provided by Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). 3-hourly data from NOAA/Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) were aggregated to daily for comparison with GSOD station data . TMPA is found to be best correlated with GSOD data. We used TMPA data to correct MERRA’s hourly precipitation, which were applied to develop IDF curves. We compared results with IDF curves from empirical methods and found substantial disparities in the existing stormwater designs in India.",

We analyzed during the dust and sand storm (DSS) event in the May 2008, March 2009, October 2009 and December 2009 cases. We modified our inverse model system to set a constant dust emission flux at a grid-point where there is not enough dust emission flux from MASINGAR. We used the high-temporal-resolution (three hours) dust-emission estimating system using the Bayesian synthesis inversion, PM observation data and MASINGAR. Our research shows that we could modify MASINGAR’s Aeolian dust concentration to match the observation data with an increase or decrease in MASINGAR’s Aeolian dust flux. The estimated total dust emissions are from 1 to 9 Tg in the four cases. The estimated dust fluxes are increased in December 2009 case and decreased in other cases. This study suggests that there was a greater Aeolian dust flux than that estimated by MASINGAR in the middle part of the Gobi desert on winter case and smaller Aeolian dust flux on other seasons. This may come from the imperfectness of soil treatment of the model especially soil water and ice. We also find that new dust source area at northern eastern part of China in some cases. The results are sensitive to the observational network, the prior flux uncertainty and the observational error as previous study. In addition, the time resolution and data uncertainty of the observation data are also important for precise analysis. To obtain a precise estimation of the Aeolian dust-emission flux, it is critically important to share quality-controlled observation data among neighboring countries. We consider that inverse technique will become a powerful tool for estimating dust aerosol flux more precisely.",

Consumptive water-use is mainly based on actual evapotranspiration (ET) estimates for the different agricultural areas. Recent advances in remote sensing have showed its ability to provide spatially distributed estimates of ET at different temporal and spatial scales. Considering that there are presently many different remote sensing of ET models, the U.S. Geological Survey has commissioned a study to investigate some of these models in an effort to develop guidelines and specification for their use by water managers in the Western US. For such this analysis provides results of an inter-comparison of multiple remote sensing of ET models. The models being compared include the Remote Sensing of Evapotranspiration (ReSET), Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS), Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop), and the Disaggregated Atmosphere-Land Exchange Invers (DisALEXI) models.\nThese models were tested over irrigated agricultural fields at the Palo Verde Irrigation District (PVID), California, covering a total area of about 500 km2 . Multiple Landsat 5 scenes were used during the summer of 2008 to estimate daily and seasonal actual ET. Estimates of daily actual ET were compared with ground-based Bowen ratio measurements during the Landsat overpass dates. Analysis of water balance is also carried out to highlight the performance of the different models in providing seasonal consumptive water-use.",

An unmagnetized object cannot stand-off the solar wind unless it possess a substantial atmosphere which can be ionized by solar radiation creating a conductive ionosphere. Currents can then be induced in the ionosphere; these currents act to cancel out the external solar wind magnetic field preventing it from reaching the surface. Here we present simple analytical calculations of such induced currents in the ionosphere of Mars. We consider currents in the ionospheric dynamo region which can be driven by thermospheric winds as well as currents driven by electric fields (i.e., plasma motion through the neutrals). We include in these estimates the effects of \"equatorial-type\" electrojets due to vertical conductivity gradients in the presence of horizontal magnetic fields. The direction of the external driver is important. Vertical neutral winds (or plasma motion) give rise to electrojets whereas horizontal winds (or plasma motion) lead to no net current. These results can give us insights into how external magnetic fields are effectively screened out by induced currents and how these induced currents can influence ionospheric dynamics around unmagnetized objects.",

            "abstract": "H2O is believed to be one of the most abundant compounds in ice giants including Neptune and Uranus1. Therefore, equation of state (EOS) for H2O is critical for understanding the formation and evolution of these planets. Various EOS models have been suggested for modeling the interior structure of the ice giants2-4. The recent shock experiments reported that their P - ρ data of H2O are in agreement with those of the QMD based EOS model5, indicating that this model is most suitable for modeling H2O in the ice giants.\nWhether H2O is in the solid or liquid state in the planetary interior has a great importance to understand their internal structures6. While the QMD model predicted that the solid H2O is present in deep interior of their planets above ~100 GPa4, the recent measurements revealed that H2O remains in the liquid state even at the deep interior conditions7. This discrepancy between experimental and theoretical studies suggests that the QMD based EOS model is disputable for modeling the planetary interior. Indeed, the comparison between data obtained from the shock experiments and the QMD based EOS did not cover the temperature5.\nWe have obtained P - ρ - T data for H2O up to 260 GPa by using laser-driven shock compression technique. The diamond cell applied for the laser shock experiments was used as the sample container in order to achieve temperature conditions lower than the principal Hugoniot states. This shock technique combined with the cell can be used for an assessment the EOS models because it is possible to compare the states under the conditions that the contrast between the models clearly appears. Our data covering P – ρ - T on both the principal and the off Hugoniot curves agree with those of the QMD model, indicating this model to be adopted as the standard for modeling the interior structures of Neptune, Uranus, and exoplanets.\n",

During the 2013 SEAC4RS (Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys) mission, fast-response, in-situ measurements of temperature (T), three-dimensional wind (u,v,w), and Formaldehyde (CH2­O) were collected on board the NASA DC-8. In the boundary layer above dense oak forests of the southeastern United States, strong updrafts detected by the Meteorological Measurement System (MMS) correlated with peak concentrations of CH2O in regions of active vertical mixing. However, flux calculations of chemical constituents critically depend on dynamic mixing scales, which can depend on altitude and be driven by diurnal variability. Within regions of enhanced Isoprene and/or CH­2O concentrations, sensible heat and momentum flux calculations based on 20 Hz MMS winds and temperatures will be used to define eddy scales responsible for upward transport of trace gases. Defining spatial scales of active turbulence at different levels within the mixed layer will assist those computing eddy fluxes of a broad spectrum of reactive trace gases, including Isoprene and its oxidation products.",

            "abstract": "The 2.4–2.2 Ga collision-related magmatism had once been considered to be weak or lacking, and were interpreted to represent the stagnation and deceleration of plate subduction. However, large-scale intermediate to acid intrusions at 2.4–2.2 Ga are widely reported in the Trans-North China Orogen and Tarim Craton, NW China. Here we presented geochronological and geochemical and Nd-Hf isotopic studies of the Hudesheng and Delingha granitoids in the Quanji Massif, which could shed new light on the NW China and global tectonics in the Paleoproterozoic.\nThe two granitoids are exposed in the eastern and central parts of the Quanji Massif, showing similar rock types and including mainly the syenogranitic, monzogranitic and adamellitic gneisses, with ~2.41 Ga low P/T-type amphibolite enclaves. They were formed at 2.37–2.39 Ga and underwent medium P/T-type amphibolite-facies metamorphism at ~1.95–1.90 Ga. Both granitoids have relatively high Si, K contents and FeO*/Mg, 104Ga/Al ratios, and are characterized by a relative enrichment in LILEs and LREEs, but depletion in Ba, Sr, Eu and Nb. These signatures are similar to those of the high-K calc-alkaline I-type granites, and with some geochemical features of A-type granites as well, suggesting that their formation might be related to a post-collisional setting with transition from compression to extension regimes at ~2.4 Ga. The whole-rock Nd and zircon Hf isotopes suggest important crustal growth occurred at ~2.5–2.8 Ga, and the precursor magmas of both granitoids were derived from partial melting of the Neo-Archean juvenile and ancient crustal components.\nCollectively, the ~2.37–2.39 Ga magmatic activities in the Quanji Massif took place right after arc-related metamorphism and arc-continent collision, thus probably making up part of the arc-related ~2.4–2.2 Ga magmatic activities, including those in the Trans-North China Orogen and Tarim Craton, NW China. This implies that a prolonged strong subduction-accretion-collision process occurred in the North China, consistent with those magmatic events having been discovered recently worldwide.\nThis study is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 40972042, 41172069 and 41372075)",

            "abstract": "Despite a plethora of field studies and modeling efforts, there remains substantial debate concerning the relative roles of Tibetan Plateau uplift and of global climate change in pacing the Cenozoic evolution of climate in Asia. Distinguishing between these two mechanisms requires knowledge of both moisture transport pathways and topography in Asia through time. Here, we reconstruct the long-term spatial distribution of oxygen isotopes in precipitation in Asia since the early Eocene to examine the relative influence of changing topography and of global climate. We use both new paleosol δ18O data from Mongolia and a compilation of δ18O data from 2,650 paleosol and lacustrine carbonate samples and compare these data with modern precipitation/river δ18O. Across Asia, the spatial distribution of paleo-precipitation δ18O remains remarkably similar through time, with low δ18O in the lee of the Himalaya in southern Tibet, intermediate values in central Tibet, and constant, high δ18O in Central Asia. The long-term consistency in the spatial distribution of δ18O strongly suggests that the same atmospheric processes that today govern Asian climate have been operating since the early Eocene; in contrast, uplift of the Plateau over the Cenozoic has had little impact on moisture delivery to Asia. It thus seems that only a high, southern topographic barrier is necessary to both block southerly moisture and drive monsoonal circulation, supporting recent, modern GCM studies. We combine these results with an isotope-enabled reactive transport model to show that the mid-latitude westerlies have maintained extensive recycling of the cross-Eurasian moisture flux through evapotranspiration, which has kept Central Asia arid to semi-arid for more than 50 Ma. Further, any topographic δ18O signal due to uplift of the northern Plateau has been overprinted by this westerly evapotranspirative recycling flux. We conclude that the climatic impact of the India-Asia collision was set by the early Eocene with subsequent Plateau uplift having little effect on monsoonal circulation or Central Asian aridity. Instead, it is the mid-latitude westerlies that have translated the effects of global climatic changes into Central Asia and driven the evolution of Central Asian aridity.",

The troctolites are divided into three groups based on textural diversity; “skeletal olivine-bearing”, “fine-grained” and “coarse-grained” troctolites.\nFor major- and trace-element compositions of olivine and plagioclase, the skeletal olivine-bearing and fine-grained troctolites are more evolved (olivine Fo and NiO contents, 83 to 86 and 0.08 to 0.2 wt.%, respectively, and plagioclase An content, 77 to 84) than coarse-grained ones (olivine Fo and NiO contents, 87to 89 and 0.2 to 0.3 wt.%, respectively, and plagioclase An content, 85 to 90). Clinopyroxenes show scattered chemical compositions in the skeletal olivine-bearing and fine-grained troctolites, down to the scale of a single thin section. Clinopyroxenes, some of which show no Eu anomaly, are clearly zoned in the coarse-grained troctolites: the rims are chemically more evolved than the cores.\nThe skeletal olivine-bearing and fine-grained troctolites record signs of melt invasion, which caused the chemical heterogeneity of the clinopyroxenes. In contrast, the coarse-grained troctolites show no such sign, and contain the zoned clinopyroxenes, which were co-precipitated with plagioclases. MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) melts experience multi-stage evolution, including fractional crystallization and melt/troctolite interaction during migration. Such various melt migration processes in the lower oceanic crust possibly cause regional diversity of MORB chemistry.",

            "abstract": "Geologic CO2 sequestration (CCS) is considered as one of the feasible options to reduce CO2 emissions in recent years. Due to the uncertainties in modeling the CCS process, surveillance operations are needed to collect data for history-matching. However, different operation scheme may have different type of data, number of observation wells, and observation frequency, which can lead to different history-matching results. Hence, it is necessary to determine the optimal surveillance operation. Traditional methods try to combine data-worth analysis with history-matching method to solve the problem. However, it is computational demanding when the Monte Carlo based history matching methods are used which require a large number of realizations to maintain converge.\nIn this study, we propose an approach to selecting an appropriate surveillance operation in a CCS system, through efficient data-worth analysis with the probabilistic collocation based Kalman Filter (PCKF). A surrogate model with polynomial chaos expansion is constructed by performing a small number of flow simulations, based on which history matching is implemented with the observations from the surveillance operations. In our study, we first demonstrate the PCKF can be used to capture the formation properties precisely by comparing with the traditional history-matching method. Then, the integrated approach combining data-worth analysis and the PCKF is applied to compare seven different surveillance operation schemes in a CCS system. The proposed approach is demonstrated numerically for selecting a surveillance operation and assessing the reduction of uncertainties in predicting CO2 leakage from abandoned wells. Our results reveal that the proposed approach of data-worth analysis can be utilized to select an appropriate surveillance operation in a geologic CO2 system, with a small computational effort.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of overall melt content beneath mid-ocean ridges inferred from magnetotelluric tomography (MT) studies vary widely between 1 and 10 vol. %. Much of this variation may arise from a lack of understanding about how melt geometry influences the bulk electrical conductivity of partially molten mantle rock, especially at low melt fraction. We present results from experiments in which we numerically calculate the electrical conductivity and permeability using high-resolution, three-dimensional melt geometries of olivine-basalt systems obtained via synchrotron X-ray microtomography (SXμT).\nStarting materials consist of San Carlos olivine and Fo90 basalt mixed in various proportions to achieve nominal melt fraction of 0.02 to 0.20 when melted. Samples were prepared by isostatically pressing samples at 1.5GPa and 1350°C for a minimum of 1 week (Zhu et al., 2011; Science) and then quenched, turning the melt to basaltic glass. Samples were imaged using SXμT at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Labs to obtain three-dimensional, 700 nm-per-pixel digital reconstructions. Grayscale data was segmented using Avizo® software (Miller et al., 2014; EPSL), and binary images were used as computational domains in numerical experiments to determine bulk electrical conductivity and permeability.\nNumerical experiments were carried out on several statistically representative subvolumes per sample using finite difference techniques. Olivine and melt are treated as conductive and insulative phases, respectively. To calculate conductivity, Laplace’s equation is solved for the electric potential, assuming zero electric flux across phase boundaries. Ohm’s Law yields the bulk conductivity of the sample. To calculate permeability, Stokes’ equations are solved using the artificial compressibility method on a staggered grid. Darcy’s law then gives the permeability of the subvolume.\nWe fit permeability and electrical conductivity values to power laws in order to establish empirical relationships with melt fraction. We compare with experimental studies. By linking permeability and electrical conductivity to melt content, we are able to better guide interpretations of geophysical data and constrain melt connectivity and transport at mid-ocean ridges.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall interception plays an important role in the water cycle in natural ecosystems. Interception by the forest canopies have been widely observed or estimated over various ecosystems, such as tropical rainforest, evergreen forest and deciduous forest. However interception by the short canopies, e.g. shrubby plant, grassland and crop, has been rarely observed since it has been difficult to obtain reliable precipitation measurements under the canopy. In this study, we estimated monthly and annual rainfall interception in grassland using evapotranspiration data of eddy flux measurements. Experiments were conducted in grassland (Italian ryegrass) from 2010 to 2012 growing season in Kumamoto, Japan. Evapotranspiration (latent heat flux) were observed throughout the year based on the eddy covariance technique. A three dimensional sonic anemometer and an open path CO2/H2O analyzer were used to calculate 30 min flux. Other meteorological factors, such as air temperature, humidity and solar radiation, were also observed. Rainfall interception was estimated as follows. 1) Using evapotranspiration data during dry period, environmental response of surface conductance (gc) was inversely calculated based on the big-leaf model. 2) Evapotranspiration without interception during precipitation period was estimated using above model and environmental response of gc. 3) Assuming that evaporation of intercepted rainfall is equal to the difference in evapotranspiration between above estimation and actual measurements, rainfall interception was estimated over experimental period. The account of rainfall interception in grassland using this technique will be presented at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Most seismological models for the interior of Mars lack an upper mantle low velocity zone. However, there is expected to be a large thermal gradient across the stagnant conductive lid (lithosphere) of Mars. This gradient should tend to decrease elastic wave velocities with increasing depth, with this effect dominating the opposing tendency caused by increasing pressure with depth because Mars has low gravity. An upper mantle lithosphere with a low velocity zone (LVZ) beneath a thin high velocity “seismic lid” is thus predicted. The upcoming NASA InSight mission includes a three-component seismometer, which should provide the first opportunity to directly detect any lithospheric LVZ in Mars. Seismic wavefields expected for Mars mantle velocity structures with or without a strong LVZ are very distinct and may be distinguished by observing a modest number of seismic sources at different epicentral ranges. The LVZ models predict shadow zones for high-frequency seismic body wave phases such as P, S, PP and SS, etc. The most diagnostic waves that can be used to evaluate presence of a lithospheric LVZ given a single seismometer are intermediate period surface waves, which travel along the great circle from a seismic source to the seismometer along both minor- and (if the source is large enough) major-arc directions. An LVZ produces distinctive dispersion, with a Rayleigh wave Airy phase around 100 s period and very different surface wave seismograms compared to a model with no LVZ. Even a single observation of long-period surface waves from a known range can be diagnostic of the lithospheric structure. Establishing the existence of an LVZ has major implications for thermal evolution, volatile content and internal dynamics of the planet.",

            "abstract": "International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 349 drilled five sites in the central South China Sea Basin. Three sites (U1431 in the East Subbasin, and U1433 and U1434 in the Southwest Subbasin) reached basalt interpreted\nto be igneous basement of the oceanic crust. Site U1435 on the northern continent-ocean boundary recovered pre-Oligocene sedimentary rocks deposited prior to the opening of the South China Sea. Furthermore, a full suite of geophysical logging was also carried out at Sites U1431 and U1433. These coring and logging data and physical property measurements are integrated with, and correlated to, regional reflection seismic data to map regional sequence stratigraphic boundaries and seismic facies of the central basin and the continent-ocean transition zone. With our carefully selected seismic profiles, stratigraphic correlation is possible even between the continent-ocean transition zone and the central basin, circumventing preexisting basement highs near the continent-ocean boundary that often prevent direct correlation. We interpret four sequence boundaries, which are Oligocene/Miocene, middle Miocene/late Miocene, Miocene/Pliocene, and Pliocene/Pleistocene boundaries. Seismic facies between sequence boundaries are often characteristic and distinctive, allowing relatively straightforward regional correlation. For example, massive Miocene carbonate deposits, if well consolidated, are readily distinguishable by strong seismic reflectivities, caused by their relatively higher density and velocity in contrast to those of interbedded turbidite clastic sediments. However, we found abrupt seismic facies changes both temporally and spatially. In particular, the fossil spreading ridge and the Zhongnan ridge between the East and Southwest Subbasins acted as major sedimentary barriers, across which seismic facies changes sharply and cannot be easily correlated. The well-constrained seismic sequence boundaries also allow us to estimate the timing of post-spreading volcanism, faulting and vertical movement in the central basin.",

            "abstract": "We performed rock physical analysis for the characterization of the CO2 storage site in Ulleung basin, Korea. We obtained the characteristics of target formation from the previous work, which contains comprehensive analyses on key horizons and stratigraphy. After verifying the previous work with well-log data, we performed rock physics modeling to obtain the interrelations between reservoir properties and seismic property for key units, such as shale volume-impedance and porosity-impedance relations. We applied the relations to inverted acoustic impedance from 3D seismic data, and obtained 3D distribution maps for shale volume and porosity. We found around 10-meter-thick cap rock unit (Unit 2-3) and two reservoir units (Unit 3-1 & 3-2) with thickness of a few hundred meters. Unit 2-3 has consistently high shale volume throughout the study area, which implies that it can be a good cap rock. Unit 3-1 and 3-2 seem to be good reservoir layers and their average sand thicknesses are 60 m and 150 m, respectively. From this preliminary analysis, the pore volume of the sand intervals of two reservoirs units is estimated to be 20 billion cubic meters. If we assume that one percent of sand pore volume can be replaced by injected CO2, the injectable amount of CO2 would be 136 million metric tonne.\nAcknowledgements: This work was supported by “Development of Technology for CO2 Marine Geological Storage” funded by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, Korea (No. 20052004), and “Energy Efficiency & Resources of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) grant” funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry & energy (No. 20132010201760).",

Recently, a theory was proposed that explains the origin of super-halo distribution. It was assumed that the super-halo distribution forms as a result of wave-particle interaction between the super-halo electron and steady-state Langmuir fluctuation known as the quasi-thermal noise. In the present paper, we discuss a theory of solar wind halo electron distribution. It is assumed that the solar wind electrons whose energy is intermediate to the Gaussian cold core and super-halo components can interact efficiently with the whistler turbulence, which is pervasively detected in the solar wind near 1 AU. By making use of Fokker-Planck particle kinetic equations for the electrons and the wave kinetic equation for the whistler waves, it is shown that the solar wind halo distribution emerges as an asymptotic steady-state solution. The figure shown below summarizes the theoretical reconstruction of the total solar wind electron velocity distribution.",

            "abstract": "Future freshwater availability is a pressing issue in Texas due to frequent drought events and fast population growth. Even though the science community has well investigated future temperature trends, it is still unclear whether precipitation will increase or decrease in this region. Furthermore, there is a lack of understanding on how the changing climate will affect water resources across different spatial-temporal scales. This study aims to quantify the impacts of climate change on surface hydrology at the basin scale under different future emission scenarios. The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, forced by an ensemble of statistically downscaled climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models, is employed to predict the future hydrology. The VIC model parameters are adopted from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) at a spatial resolution of 1/8°. The CMIP5 projections contain four different scenarios in terms of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) (i.e. 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 w/m2). The analysis is carried out in three steps. First, the observed streamflows are used to evaluate the performance of VIC simulations forced by CMIP5 models during historical period. Second, VIC outputs under multiple CMIP5 model scenarios from 1950 to 2099 are analyzed to identify how soil moisture, evapotranspiration, runoff, and routed streamflows change in time and space. Third, the spatial patterns of seasonal temperature, seasonal precipitation, and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)—over four 20-year periods (1980-1999, 2010-2029, 2040-2059 and 2080-2099)—are used to pinpoint the regions that will be most affected by climate change (among the 13 Texan river basins). Furthermore, the role of groundwater in meeting the increasing needs for water supply is discussed. The results are expected to contribute to various future water resources management decisions in Texas.",

            "abstract": "One of International Monitoring System (IMS)'s primary seismic stations, PS31, called Korea Seismic Research Station (KSRS), was installed around Wonju, Korea in 1970s. It has been operated by US Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) for more than 40 years. KSRS is composed of 26 seismic sensors including 19 short period, 6 long period and 1 broad band seismometers. The 19 short period sensors were used to build an array with a 10-km aperture while the 6 long period sensors were used for a relatively long period array with a 40-km aperture. After KSRS was certified as an IMS station in 2006 by Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) which is the Korea National Data Center started to take over responsibilities on the operation and maintenance of KSRS from AFTAC. In April of 2014, KIGAM installed an infrasound array, KSIAR, on the existing four short period seismic stations of KSRS, the sites KS05, KS06, KS07 and KS16. The collocated KSIAR changed KSRS from a seismic array into a seismo-acoustic array. The aperture of KSIAR is 3.3 km. KSIAR also has a 100-m small aperture infrasound array at KS07. The infrasound data from KSIAR except that from the site KS06 is being transmitted in real time to KIGAM with VPN and internet line. An initial analysis on seismo-acoustic signals originated from local and regional distance ranges has been performed since May 2014. The analysis with the utilization of an array process called Progressive Multi-Channel Correlation (PMCC) detected seismo-acoustic signals caused by various sources including small explosions in relation to constructing local tunnels and roads. Some of them were not found in the list of automatic bulletin of KIGAM. The seismo-acoustic signals recorded by KSIAR are supplying a useful information for discriminating local and regional man-made events from natural events.",

            "abstract": "Natural gas hydrates are crystalline clathrate compounds trapping light hydrocarbons, and have been expected as new natural gas resources. Natural gas hydrates are stable under high pressure and low temperature conditions such as deep marine environments. Hydrate-bound natural gas compositions are related to a thermodynamically stable condition, or origin of natural gas hydrates, which are important to characterize natural gas hydrate reservoirs.\nThe hydrate-bearing sediments were recovered from the eastern Nankai Trough area during the 2012 JOGMEC/JAPEX Pressure coring operation, aboard the RV CHIKYU. In this study, the molecular and isotopic compositions of the gases released from the hydrate-bearing sediments were analyzed.\nThe primary hydrocarbon component is methane for all gas samples collected from the hydrate-bearing sediments. The hydrate-bound gas contained small amounts of ethane and heavier hydrocarbons (less than 400 ppm). The concentrations of the minor hydrocarbon components tended to decrease at upper levels of the sediment core recovered, implying a compositional fractionation of natural gas during the migration of fluid from deeper level. The carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) of hydrate-bearing hydrocarbons were around -63‰ (vs. VPDB). No significant variation of the δ13C values against depth was observed. The molecular and isotopic compositions suggest that the hydrate-bound hydrocarbons are of a microbial origin.\nThis work was supported by funding from the Research Consortium for Methane Hydrate Resources in Japan (MH21 Research Consortium) planned by METI.",

            "abstract": "Ice-ocean interaction is thought to be a responsible process on long-term Antarctic ice sheet variations, such as retreat of West Antarctic Ice Sheet during Eemian interglacial. Numerical simulation of Antarctic ice sheet require melt rate at ice shelf base as a boundary condition, but the relation between climate and melt rate is unclear. We calculate Antarctic ocean and basal melting of Antarctic ice shelves under Last Glacial Maximum(LGM) and doubled CO2(2xCO2) climate at equilibrium as well as present-day(CTL). We use circumpolar ice shelf-ocean general circulation model(OGCM, based on COCO) and outputs of climate model(MIROC). For the CTL case, we drive OGCM with surface atmospheric climatology based on reanalysis(OMIP) and present-day ocean temperature and salinity for restoration at northern boundary, placed at around latitude of 40S. The surface boundary conditions for LGM(or 2xCO2) is computed from the outputs from climate model simulations. Annual mean marine 2m air temperature anomaly averaged for south of 60S is -7.3℃ for LGM and +6.0℃ for 2xCO2. LGM (or 2xCO2) anomalies of surface atmospheric variables are superimposed to OMIP to make LGM (or 2xCO2) atmospheric boundary conditions. We modify the ocean temperature and salinity column for restoration at northern boundary by superimposing anomaly to present-day ocean climatology. Present-day geometry of ice sheet and ice shelf is used in all experiments to test the sensitivity to climate. We show that melting amount of Antarctic ice shelves show 23% reduction for the LGM and 3.5 times increase for the 2xCO2 compared to the CTL case. We perform a series of additional sensitivity experiments to investigate the role of surface change in sea surface atmospheric variables (temperature, wind) and ocean structures in the Southern Ocean on melt rate of ice shelves. Water mass, ocean circulation and sea ice production on continental shelf are analyzed.",

In the present study, continuous distributed hydrological model named Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used for streamflow estimation at five gauging stations within Mahanadi river basin, Orissa, India. Further streamflow response to climate change has been examined. For this, the SWAT model has been first calibrated and validated for the period of 1951-2007. Then, with the aim of evaluating the impact of climate change on the basin hydrology for the period of 2010-2099, downscaled and bias corrected data from the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) models (i.e. bcc-csm1-1, inmcm4, mpi-esm-Ir, mri-cgcm3 and noresm1-m) under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios were used to derive the SWAT model. We find that streamflow variations are more sensitive to changing climate in the monsoon (JJAS) and pre-monsoon (FMAM) seasons than that of the post-monsoon season. Moreover, simulated runoff for the projected period (2010-2099) was found to be changing in a range of -17 to 59% in the monsoon, -18 to 65% in the post-monsoon, -76 to 451% in pre-monsoon under the RCP 4.5 scenario and for the RCP 8.5 streamflow changes have been assessed between -5 to 107% in monsoon, -0.45 to 105% in post-monsoon, -61 to 202% in pre-monsoon period.\nKeywords: SWAT; Climate Change; CMIP; RCP; Mahanadi",

Genomic DNA (16S rDNA) were extracted from two heavy oil samples from Canadian oil sand and six light oil samples from the Salin fore-arc basin in Myanmar, and amplified using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The microbes were identified by cloning the PCR products and pyrosequencing. Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were common in both Canadian and Myanmar samples. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus belonging to the Firmicutes phylum are abundant in oil sands, while Propionibacteria belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum and Coprothermobacter, Streptococcus, and Clostridia belonging to the Frimicutes phylum are contained in Myanmar samples. Streptococcus is known to use crude oil as nutrient, and produce organic acid, bio-gas and polysaccharide that could reduce oil viscosity, improve permeability by dissolving carbonate cement from pores throat, and reduce interfacial tension between oil and rock/water surface. Clostridia produce acids and gases by methanogenesis that could improve oil recovery.",

            "abstract": "This poster summarizes geochemical, biological, hydrological, and watershed data that characterize Manzanita Lake, a small sub-alpine catchment in Lassen Volcanic National Park, CA. The future objective is to use characteristics of this system to interpret variations in diatom and sediment composition dating back to the 1914 Mt. Lassen eruption from a recently recovered lake core. Manzanita Lake is a small (0.18 km2) lake with a ~30 km2 watershed area situated on the northwest flank of Mt. Lassen, one of the most active Cascade volcanoes, and is a valuable recreational spot for anglers and visitors. Hydraulic residence time is short; roughly 119 days, and is derived from lake volume (1.0 X 106m3) and estimates of stream inflow (~6 ft3/sec) and outflow (~3 ft3/sec) that were made from May 2014 sampling data. Limnological sampling in 2012-2014 suggests that Manzanita Lake exhibits stable thermal stratification in the summer months, which is unusual given the shallow depth (~10m), but possibly supported by the morphometry of the lake basin and inputs of cold snowmelt from the flank of Lassen Peak. The lake is a moderately conductive (100-114 μS), mesotrophic system with secchi depths ranging from 8m to the bottom (~10m). Total phosphorus (TP) ranges from 15-25 ppb and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from 2-15 ppb, with ammonium in the epilimnion being the largest contributor. A high concentration of silica (Si) in surface water inputs (34 mg/L) to Manzanita Lake likely reflects the rhyodacitic bedrock geology and large drainage ratio (164) of the watershed. Variations in Si concentration in the lake seem to be coupled with diatom production. During the sampling period Manzanita Lake is has been dominated by diatom blooms throughout the summer and fall months. There is a seasonal succession in the diatom species present, with abundant Asterionella formosa in the spring, transitioning to abundant Fragilaria crotonensis in the summer months, to a mixed dominance of Fragilaria crotonensis and Aulacoseira species in the fall. Persistence of diatom species with moderate to high Si requirements throughout the summer is atypical and may be related to high Si (11-29 mg/L in lake), TP, and DIN. These data provide a modern baseline with which to interpret down-core changes in diatom composition and diversity over the last century.",

Until now, ESG-BNU node has published 17 experiments of 10,595 GB dataset for CMIP5 and 4 experiments of 1174 GB dataset for GeoMIP generated by the Earth System Model of Beijing Normal University (BNU-ESM) It has provided over 43.0TB data with an average 700 KB/s download speed to scientists all over the world. Especially in China, data users can download the datasets more than 1MB/s. In BNU the speed can reach to over 10MB/s.(Fig.1) As an ESGF Portal node we try to make replicas of other model centers so that data users in China can get the datasets much faster . By analyzing the download information extracted from the thredds log files we found that over 95% data requests were from China, U.S. and Japan.(Fig.2) About 75% downloads came from historical, rcp45 and rcp85 experiments.(Fig.3) And over 79% downloads came from the monthly datasets. So making replicas for those datasets with most interested can meet the needs of most model users and will save over 50% disk space of the data nodes. In our plan, the data volume of the ESG-BNU node will reach to 200TB in the next year. As for the coming CMIP6, data volume may reach to over 3.5EB. Making replica of all experiments maybe too expensive and not necessary for many ESGF nodes. We hope such download statistical analysis can be helpful for ESGF data nodes to decide which experiments should be replicated or be replicated with priority.",

However, translating these findings to field applications remains challenging, and significant improvements in spectral electrical impedance tomography (EIT) are still required to obtain images of the complex electrical conductivity with sufficient accuracy in the field. The aim of this study is to present recent improvements in the inversion and processing of broadband field EIT measurements, and to evaluate the accuracy and spectral consistency of the obtained images of the real and imaginary part of the electrical conductivity. In a first case study, time-lapse surface EIT measurements were performed during an infiltration experiment to investigate the spectral complex electrical conductivity as a function of water content. State-of-the-art data processing and inversion approaches were used to obtain images of the complex electrical conductivity in a frequency range of 100 mHz to 1 kHz, and integral parameters were obtained using Debye decomposition. Results showed consistent spectral and spatial variation of the phase of the complex electrical conductivity in a broad frequency range, and a complex dependence on water saturation that was reasonably consistent with laboratory EIT measurements. In a second case study, borehole EIT measurements were made in a well-characterized aquifer. These measurements were inverted to obtain broadband images of the complex conductivity after correction for inductive and capacitive coupling using recently developed procedures. The results showed good correspondence with reference laboratory SIP measurements in a broad frequency bandwidth up to 1 kHz only after application of the correction procedures.",

Above all, water exchange between groundwater and river water has a significant impact on the water quality and hydrological zones. The natural radiogenic tracers such as Radon-222 can be used as good indicator for measuring the interaction between groundwater and river water even though the conventional methods of analysis are direct measurements of water flux, heat tracer methods, mass balance approaches and methods based on Darcy's law. The object of this study is to know the change of water environment and to do water resource management effectively by studying the interaction between groundwater and river water in Yangsu-ri of Korea. This paper used methods using temperature profiles, EC values, DO values and radon tracer.\n In this study, diurnal and seasonal variation of radon value was measured with other values. The result values proved that the more the region was influenced by river water, the closer to the values of river water the result values are. The radon value indicated a similar pattern with other values. The analysis also applied river water stage change by dam discharge. In addition, the mixing modeling of groundwater and river water was conducted to confirm the difference between the calculated value and the measured value. It turned out that radon tracer can be used as environmental tracer for analysis of the interaction between groundwater and river water.",

            "abstract": "California’s Sierra Madre Mountains lie at the junction of the Coast and Transverse Ranges, where they form an arcuate range crest with peak elevations of nearly 1,800 m. Near the range crest, a gently sloping paleovalley in the Southern Sierra Madre is being consumed by the headward migration of a prominent knickpoint, with an ~250-m-high headwall abutting below the gently sloped paleovalley. This paleovalley at 1400 m elevation and other low-relief, high-elevation remnants in the Sierra Madres at elevations from 800-1400 m show that the range is young enough to have regions not yet in equilibrium with the modern base level and uplift rate. Toward the western end of the Sierra Madre, the Cuyama River cuts a bedrock canyon through the range. The canyon planform describes a meandering river that has now incised ~400 m into the range. The combination of (i) high-altitude, low-relief surfaces in the Sierra Madre including the paleovalley with (ii) a meandering planform that has been incised into bedrock by a transverse river suggests (1) a low-altitude meandering proto-Cuyama river preceded significant rock uplift, and (2) the river’s incision records the rock uplift of the range. Using cosmogenic nuclides to measure both the bedrock-lowering rate of the high-elevation paleovalley and the erosion rate of the steep catchment eroding into it, we can place some limits on the timing and magnitude of rock uplift in the range. By dating bedrock straths along the river canyon’s walls, we can directly quantify the pace of channel incision. Together these new estimates will yield an improved reconstruction of the timing, magnitude, and rate of rock uplift of the Sierra Madre.",

            "abstract": "During the last 30 years, study of Paleosecular Variation (PSV) has been analyzed within specific timescales (e.g. 0-5 Ma; 5-22.5 Ma; etc.), considering the main criteria variation in directions of paleomagnetic data due to displacement of tectonic plates, and the scarcity of spatial and temporal distribution of rock outcrops, we propose using the previous geological and geophysical studies comprising the tectonic displacement of Baja California for the last 12 Ma, a method (working in space and time) to precise the PSV of our paleomagnetic sites (assuming a thermoremanent magnetization).\nWe completed two paleomagnetic rock field sampling works: Loreto-Santa Rosalia-Punta Abreojos (between 26° and 27.4° N), with 156 cores from 16 sites; and San Borja and Jaraguay volcanic fields (between 28° and 30° N), with 230 cores from 27 sites. These sites are mainly volcanic rocks (andesite-basalt) with radiometric ages previously reported. We selected those younger than 12 Ma age without effect of rotation or flattening within the peninsula. Rock magnetic experiments were done to characterize the magnetic carrier of the remanence, such as susceptibility vs. low and high temperature, hysteresis, FORC, Koenigsberger ratio determination and directional analysis. Our results suggest that in most of the cases (80%) we have a contribution of TM0 to TM20, and magnetic domain of PSD + SP.\nIn addition to our data, we gathered all paleomagnetic works in volcanic rocks younger than 12 Ma along Baja California. For the PSV, we calculated the angular standard deviation (SB) of the VGPs with respect to its mean average and also to the geographic axis. Both results were compared with the calculation of the SB once the correction of paleomagnetic sites based on the tectonic displacement was applied. Finally, all results (with and without correction) were compared with Model G and TK03.GAD, finding that data of the SB with tectonic correction are the best fit models, suggesting a reduction in uncertainty of the analysis of the PSV with a larger timescale: 0-12 Ma. This is a wider range than previously proposed, allowing the increase the sites number for the study of PSV in time and space, at least for the Baja California rocks.",

            "abstract": "Chemistry climate models (CCMs) currently used to project changes in Antarctic ozone are extremely computationally demanding. CCM projections are uncertain due to lack of knowledge of future emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and ozone depleting substances (ODSs), as well as parameterizations within the CCMs that have weakly constrained tuning parameters. While projections should be based on an ensemble of simulations, this is not currently possible due to the complexity of the CCMs. An inexpensive but realistic approach to simulate changes in stratospheric ozone, and its coupling to the climate system, is needed as a complement to CCMs.\nA simple climate model (SCM) can be used as a fast emulator of complex atmospheric-ocean climate models. If such an SCM includes a representation of stratospheric ozone, the evolution of the global ozone layer can be simulated for a wide range of GHG and ODS emissions scenarios. MAGICC is an SCM used in previous IPCC reports. In the current version of the MAGICC SCM, stratospheric ozone changes depend only on equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC). In this work, MAGICC is extended to include an interactive stratospheric ozone layer using a semi-empirical model of ozone responses to CO2and EESC, with changes in ozone affecting the radiative forcing in the SCM.\nTo demonstrate the ability of our new, extended SCM to generate projections of global changes in ozone, tuning parameters from 19 coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) and 10 carbon cycle models (to create an ensemble of 190 simulations) have been used to generate probability density functions of the dates of return of stratospheric column ozone to 1960 and 1980 levels for different latitudes.\n ",

A paleoseismological study of faults and fault-related folds comprising the Mount Narryer fault zone (MNfz) in the southern WASZ reveals a late Quaternary history of repeated morphogenic earthquake occurrence that has profoundly influenced the planform and course of the Murchison, Roderick, and Sanford Rivers. Folding in the near surface sediments is the predominant style of surface expression of reactivated basement faults which is consistent with other neotectonic structures throughout the Western Australia shear zone. CRN and OSL estimates of exposure and burial ages of fault-related folds and fold derived colluvium provide constraint on Late Quaternary slip rates on the underlying faults of ~0.05 - 0.1 mm/a. In the case of the Roderick River fault scarp, 2-3m high tectonic risers separating inset terraces where the Murchison River crosses the scarp are consistent with multiple late Quaternary seismic events on the order of magnitude Mw 7.1-7.3. Mid-Pleistocene ages of tectonically deformed strata in the MNfz are consistent with the timing of collision between the Australian extended margin and Savu-Rote ridge 0.2-1.8 Ma.",

            "abstract": "After the 2008 Ms8 Wenchuan Earthquake (WE) occurred on Longmenshan thrust fault in the western Sichuan region in China, a long-time debate has arisen on whether there are some correlations between this huge earthquake and a large water reservoir, the Zipingpu Reservoir (ZR), which locates only about 10 km away from this event. Many geophysicists have studied the ZR issue but got different conclusions. So it is worth our attention to make more thorough investigation to figure out the possible effect of ZR impoundment on 2008 WE.\nWe investigate this issue by applying Matched Filter Technique (MFT) in the region around ZR, to better understand the local seismicity in this area.\nMFT is originally used to detect duplicated events, thus is not able to find new events with different locations. So we make some improvement on this method. Firstly we adopt the idea proposed by David Shelly et al. (Nature, 2007) to conduct a strong detection and a weak detection simultaneously, which enables us to find more micro-events. Then, we relocate the detected events, which provides us with more accurate spatial distribution of new events as well as the geometry of related faults, comparing with traditional MFT. In the meeting, we will introduce the temporal variation of spatial distribution of earthquakes around ZR from the initial impoundment of the reservoir in August, 2004 to the WE in May, 2008, and tell how the ZR might be involved with the destructive event.",

            "abstract": "Most recent methods in ionospheric tomography are based on the inversion of the Total Electron Content (TEC) measured by ground-based GPS receivers. As a consequence of the high frequency of the GPS signal and the absence of horizontal ray paths, the electron density structure is mainly reconstructed in the F2 region (300 km), where the ionosphere reaches the maximum of ionization, and is not sensitive to the lower ionospheric structure. We propose here a new tomographic method of the lower ionosphere, based on the full inversion of over-the-horizon (OTH) radar data. Previous studies using OTH radar for ionospheric tomography inverted only the leading edge echo curve of backscatter ionograms. The major advantage of our methodology is taking into account, numerically and jointly, the effect that the electron density perturbations induce not only in the speed of electromagnetic waves, but also on the ray-path geometry. This last point is extremely critical for OTH radar inversions as the emitted signal propagates through the ionosphere between a fixed starting-point (the radar) and an unknown end-point on the Earth surface where the signal is backscattered. We detail our ionospheric tomography method with the aid of benchmark tests. Having proved the necessity to take into account both effects simultaneously, we apply our method to real data. This is the first time that the effect of the ray-path deflection has been quantified and that the ionospheric plasma density has been estimated over the entirety of Europe with an OTH radar.",

Satellite data are employed as constraints for this study. \nThe optimum temperature for photosynthesis, leaf drop threshold temperatures, and competition coefficients in the Lotka-Volterra equation have major impact on the vegetation spatial distribution and reach to equilibrium status in SSiB4/TRIFFID.  The phenomenon that vegetation competition coefficients affect equilibrium suggests the importance of including biotic effects in dynamical vegetation modeling. SSiB4/TRIFFID can reproduce the features of NA distributions of dominant vegetation types, the vegetation fraction, and LAI, including its seasonal, interannual, and decadal variability, well compared with satellite-derived products. The NA LAI shows an increasing trend after the 1970s in responding to warming. Meanwhile, both simulation and satellite observations reveal LAI increased in the southeastern U.S. starting from the 1980s. The effects of the severe drought during 1987-1992 and the last decade in the southwestern U.S.on vegetation are also evident from the simulated and satellite-derived LAIs.\nBoth simulated and satellite-derived LAIs have the strongest correlations with air temperature at northern middle to high latitudes in spring through their effect on photosynthesis and phenological processes. During the summer, the areas with positive correlations retreat northward. Meanwhile, in southwestern dry lands, the negative correlations appear due to the heat stress there during the summer. Furthermore, there are also positive correlations between soil wetness and LAI, which increases from spring to summer.",

Worldwide it is used as an effective tool to monitor spatiotemporal variations in land use practices and vegetation vigor. The forecast of NDVI can be effectively utilized as an early warning system for the better planning and management, especially in agricultural sector. Here, in this study, we evaluated the spatiotemporal variability of NDVI over Indian region and how it is affected by various factors such as rain fall, temperature, sea surface temperature (SST) and soil moisture. First, we evaluated the seasonal (Pre monsoon, Monsoon, Post Monsoon, Kharif and Rabi) NDVI trend from 1982-2013 and it is found that there is a significant increase in NDVI over the Indian region in land use land cover (LULC) classes. Further the correlation analysis of NDVI with above mention parameters were performed at various lags to evaluate better predictor of NDVI and it is observed that all the parameters exhibit significantly high correlations at various lags. It is well known that over the Indian region vegetation growth/crop growth is largely dependent on climate parameters especially rainfall, and Indian region rainfall is highly correlated with El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Thus the relationship of NDVI with SST one of the proxies of ENSO can be utilized to predict vegetation health over Indian region. To evaluate that we performed Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) of SST departure field and NDVI time series and found that there exists a decline in vegetation health or NDVI if the equatorial eastern pacific SST is anomalously high.",

            "abstract": "The accelerated exploration for and development of unconventional gas plays around the world has raised public concern about potential risks to human health and the environment. In this study, a risk assessment framework specific to shale gas development is proposed. The framework aims to quantify and/or qualify both risk and resilience within a water-energy nexus context, using a comprehensive approach that considers environment, health and policy. The risk assessment framework is intended to be flexible so that it can be used in different regions, but will be tested in North East British Columbia, Canada where shale gas development is rapidly expanding. The main components of risk include hazards, susceptibility and potential consequences, which will be evaluated in space and time using ArcGIS software. The hazards are associated with all phases of shale gas development and include: water, air, and soil contamination; water use (surface and groundwater), and land use disturbance, and their assessment will take into account where they may occur, their frequency, duration and magnitude. Hazard-specific susceptibility maps will be generated based on the physical characteristics of the environment (e.g. soil, geology, hydrology, topography) as well as water source information (e.g. well locations), community footprints, etc. When combined with an evaluation of potential consequences, the resulting set of spatial risk maps can then be used for water resource management, land use planning, and industry permitting. Resilience, which buffers risk, here considers the existing regulatory framework and whether or not existing regulations can mitigate risk by reducing the hazard potential or consequences. The study considers how regulations may fully, partially, or inadequately mitigate the consequences of a given hazard. If development is to continue at its current pace in North East BC, it is imperative that decision-makers recognize the changing risk and resilience profiles and respond with appropriate policy. A critical component of the study comprises a gap analysis of current regulation and a possible path forward.",

            "abstract": "Oasification and desertification are the two main land surface processes contrarily correlated with each other in arid regions. It is useful for environmental indication research to clarify the relationship between plants and environment under the oasification and desertification processes in arid regions. In the Heihe River basin, the most representative areas of oasification and desertification in China, we carried out a study to test whether or not we can use plant and soil stable isotope signature as an indicator of changes in key land surface process. Stable carbon (δ13C) of plant leaves, hydrogen (δD) and oxygen (δ18O) isotopes of plant stem water and potential water sources were analyzed to investigate the water use efficiency (WUE) and water sources of different plant species in three typical habitats (oasis, oasis-desert transitional zone, desert). The results suggest that plants in the desert habitat tended to use water from deeper soil layer (>160 cm). In the oasis-desert transitional zone, Artimisia arenaria and Calligonum mongolicum were likely used water mainly from the soil layer about 20-40 cm in depth, Haloxylon ammodendron utilized water primarily from 60-80 cm in depth, Hedysarum scoparium may use water from soil layer about 100 cm in depth and Tamarix ramosissima obtained its water from deeper soil layer(>120 cm). Plants in the oasis habitat used soil water mainly from 0 to 100 cm soil layers. Calamagrostis pseudophragmites used water about 20 cm in depth, Zea mays extracted soil water from the depth of 20-40 cm, and Tamarix ramosissima and Populus simonii obtained soil water about 60 cm in depth. The δ13C values of C3 plants in each habitat differed significantly. In the oasis zone, WUE of shrubs were more positive than this of grass, which were similar to the conclusions of the previous studies. Among the three habitats, plants in oasis-desert transitional zone had the most positive δ13C values whereas plants in oasis area had the most negative values. This pattern may have resulted from soil texture, soil water content and plant water sources differences among the habitats. Overall, the results of our study illustrated that plant and soil isotope composition are useful for the indication of the processes of oasification and desertification in arid regions.",

            "abstract": "The western US and Mexico are deforming at several spatial scales that can be measured by ground and satellite observations like GPS and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). Many GPS stations have been installed throughout this area to monitor ground deformation caused by large scale tectonic processes; however, several studies have noted that the data recorded at a GPS station can be contaminated by local, non-tectonic ground deformation. In this study, we use InSAR to examine deformation from various sources in the western US and Mexico. We chose this method due to the spatially large study area and the availability and temporal coverage of SAR imagery. We use SAR images acquired by the satellites Envisat, ERS-1 and ERS-2 over a time period from 1992-2010 to create several time series. Data from the ALOS satellite between 2006-2011 are also used in some areas. We use these time series analysis along with previously published results to observe and catalogue various sources of surface deformation in the western US and Mexico – from groundwater pumping, geothermal activity, mining, hydrocarbon production, and other sources. We then use these results to identify GPS stations that have potentially been contaminated by non-tectonic deformation signals. We document more than 150 distinct regions of non-tectonic and likely anthropogenic deformation. We have located 82 GPS stations within 20km of the center of at least one of the non-tectonic deformation signals we have identified. It is likely that the data from these 82 GPS stations have been contaminated by local anthropogenic deformation. Some examples of previously unpublished non-tectonic deformation we have seen in this study include but are not limited to, subsidence due to groundwater extraction in Jesus Garcia, Mexico, both uplift and subsidence due to natural gas extraction at Jonah Field in Sublette County, WY, and uplift due to a water recharge project in Tonopah, AZ.",

One is an update of the method based on a piecewise linear-like approximation and the other is an algorithm for implementing the widely used scheme that is the third order accurate under uniform flows for the icosahedral grids. Both methods are based on the reconstruction of transported variables using quadratic profiles about hexatonal/pentagonal cells. The latter method can also be applicable for triangular cells. Several standardized tests have been performed and results are better than those of the schemes used in Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmosphere Model (NICAM) currently. It is expected that implementing these schemes for NICAM will improve simulations of atmospheric phenomena such as mid-latitude cyclones and tropical cyclones, in which transports of thermodynamic energy and moisture are essential.",

            "abstract": "Air quality problems have become a serious global issue as it causes over 3 million deaths per year all over the world. With generations of massive air pollutants in China, the effects of trans-boundary transports of air pollutants on human health have become a serious international concern in East Asia. However, only a limited number of studies are available for providing scientific evidences for quantifying the sources and transports of air pollutants over major countries in East Asia. Here, it is shown that particulate matters originated from China played major role in the occurrence of multi-day (≥ 4 days) severe air pollution episodes in Seoul, Korea, in which the concentration of particulate matter of diameters ≤ 10 μm exceeds 100 μg m-3. Observations show that these multi-day severe air quality episodes occur when a strong high-pressure system resides over the eastern China - Korea region. Such a weather condition confines air pollutants within the atmospheric boundary layer and spread them by slow westerlies within the boundary layer from China into the neighboring countries. Understanding such dynamical processes is a key for advancing the predictability of trans-boundary air pollutants and their health impacts in East Asia as well as developing international measures to improve air quality for the region.",

            "abstract": "Using the mARM1D pedogenesis model (which simulated armouring and weathering processes on a hillslope) previous work by Cohen found a strong log-log linear relationship between the size distribution of the soil (e.g. d50), the contributing area and the local slope. However, Cohen performed his simulations using only one set of grading data, one climate, one geology and did his simulations over a relatively limited range of area and slope combinations. A model based on mARM, called SSSPAM, that generalises the modelled processes has been developed, and calibrated to mARM. This calibration was used as the starting point for a parametric study of the robustness to changes in environmental conditions and weathering conditions of the area-slope and d50 relationship, different initial soil gradings and weathering conditions, different geology, and a broader range of area and slope combinations. This parametric study assessed the influence of changes in the model parameters on the soil evolution results. These simulations confirmed the robustness of the area-slope and d50 relationship discovered by Cohen using mARM. We also demonstrated that the area-slope-diameter relationship is not only true for d50 but for the entire grading range (e.g. d10, d90). The results strengthen our confidence in the generality of the log-log linear scaling relationship between area, slope and soil grading. The paper will present the results of our parametric study and will highlight the potential uses of the relationship for digital soil mapping and better characterization of soils in environmental models.",

            "abstract": "Radiocarbon (14C) is produced by incoming cosmic rays to the Earth. The produced 14C becomes 14CO2 and is absorbed by trees by photosynthesis. If a large Solar Proton Event (SPE) had occurred in the past, tree-rings would record such an event as a sudden 14C increase within 1-year.\nRecently we found two signatures of large SPEs in AD 774-775 and AD 993-994 by the measurement of the 14C content in tree-rings. Some studies have estimated a scale of the AD 775 event as ten to dozens of times larger than the largest SPE on record. There is the possibility that a lot of such events are hidden in the periods when the 14C content has not been measured with a 1-year resolution. If we detect such events, we are able to discuss a detailed occurrence rate of the large SPE which is very important factor to prepare for future large SPEs.\nWe are planning to search for the past large SPEs by the measurements of 14C content in Japanese trees for this 5000 years.

            "abstract": "A subducting crust contains a large amount of water as a form of hydrous minerals (e.g., Hacker et al., 2003), and the crust plays important roles for water transportation and seismogenesis in subduction zones at intermediate depths (e.g., Kirby et al., 1996; Iwamori, 2007). Therefore, the investigation of seismic structure in the crust is important to understand ongoing physical processes with subduction of oceanic lithosphere.\nA guided wave which propagates in the subducting crust is recorded in seismograms at Hokkaido, northern Japan (Shiina et al., 2014). Here, we estimated P- and S-wave velocity in the crust with guided waves, and obtained P-wave velocity of 6.6-7.3 km/s and S-wave velocity of 3.6-4.2 km/s at depths of 50-90 km. Moreover, Vp/Vs ratio in the crust is calculated to be 1.80-1.85 in that depth range.\nThe obtained P-wave velocity about 6.6km/s at depths of 50-70 km is consistent with those estimated in Tohoku, northeast Japan (Shiina et al., 2013), and this the P-wave velocity is lower than those expected from models of subducting crustal compositions, such as metamorphosed MORB model (Hacker et al., 2003). In contrast, at greater depths (>80 km), the P-wave velocity marks higher velocity than the case of NE Japan and the velocity is roughly comparable to those of the MORB model. The obtained S-wave velocity distribution also shows characteristics similar to P waves.\nThis regional variation may be caused by a small variation in thermal regime of the Pacific slab beneath the two regions as a result of the normal subduction in Tohoku and oblique subduction in Hokkaido. In addition, the effect of seismic anisotropy in the subducting crust would not be ruled out because rays used in the analysis in Hokkaido propagate mostly in the trench-parallel direction, while those in Tohoku are sufficiently criss-crossed.",

            "abstract": "The paleomagnetism of achondritic meteorites provides evidence for advecting metallic core dynamos and large-scale differentiation on their parent planetesimals. The small sizes of these bodies (~102 km) enable a new opportunity to understand the physics of dynamo generation in a size regime with distinct thermal evolution parameters that are more accessible to model than planets.\nOne key unknown about planetesimal dynamos is their onset time. Theoretical studies have suggested that it might occur instantaneously after large-scale melting (Weiss et al. 2008, Elkins-Tanton et al. 2011) while others have argued that a dynamo could be delayed by ~6 My (Sterenborg and Crowley 2013) or longer. Here we present the first paleomagnetic study that has constrained the onset time of a planetesimal dynamo, which has key implications for the physics of core formation, planetary thermal evolution and dynamo generation mechanisms.\nOur study focused on angrites, a group of ancient basaltic achondrites from near the surface of an early differentiated planetesimal. With unshocked, unbrecciated textures and Pb/Pb ages ranging from only ~3-10 My younger than the formation of calcium aluminum inclusions (CAIs), they are among the oldest known and best preserved planetary igneous rocks.\nWe used a new CO2 + H2 gas mixture system (Suavet et al. 2014) for controlled oxygen fugacity thermal paleointensity experiments on two of the oldest angrites (D’Orbigny and SAH 99555; 4564.4 Ma) and a younger angrite (Angra dos Reis; 4557.7 Ma). For D’Orbigny and SAH 99555, we found that the natural remanence (NRM) demagnetizes at much lower temperatures than lab-applied thermoremanence (TRM), indicating that their NRMs are dominantly overprints from the Earth’s field and hand magnets. In contrast, the NRM of Angra dos Reis behaves similarly to a TRM, confirming its thermal origin. We estimate the paleointensities to be < 0.2 µT for D’Orbigny and SAH 99555 and ~10 µT for Angra dos Reis. This indicates that the angrite parent body dynamo originated between 3 and 10 My after CAI formation. Our results are consistent with planetesimal evolution models calling for dynamos delayed by mantle heating due to radiogenic 26Al. Furthermore, these data suggest that external nebular fields in the angrite parent body region had declined to < 0.2 µT at 3 My after CAI formation.",

We choose 135 events and 10950 strong ground accelerograms recorded by the 696 strong ground accelerographs. Both the free-surface and the borehole data are used to calculate τc and Pd, respectively. The results show that τc*Pd has a good correlation with PGV and is a robust parameter for assessing the potential of damaging earthquake.

            "abstract": "Modern earthquake catalogs are often analyzed using spatial-temporal point process models such as the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) models of Ogata (1998). My work introduces software to implement two of ETAS models described in Ogata (1998). To find the Maximum-Likelihood Estimates (MLEs), my software provides estimates of the homogeneous background rate parameter and the temporal and spatial parameters that govern triggering effects by applying the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm introduced in Veen and Schoenberg (2008). Despite other computer programs exist for similar data modeling purpose, using EM-algorithm has the benefits of stability and robustness (Veen and Schoenberg, 2008). Spatial shapes that are very long and narrow cause difficulties in optimization convergence and problems with flat or multi-modal log-likelihood functions encounter similar issues. My program uses a robust method to preset a parameter to overcome the non-convergence computational issue. In addition to model fitting, the software is equipped with useful tools for examining modeling fitting results, for example, visualization of estimated conditional intensity, and estimation of expected number of triggered aftershocks. A simulation generator is also given with flexible spatial shapes that may be defined by the user. This open-source software has a very simple user interface. The user may execute it on a local computer, and the program also has potential to be hosted online. Java language is used for the software's core computing part and an optional interface to the statistical package R is provided.",

It is funded by the ministry of science and technology of the people’s republic of China and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. TanSat will monitor carbon dioxide in Sun-Synchronous orbit by a hyper resolution grating spectrometer – Carbon Dioxide Sensor. A wide field of view moderate resolution imaging spectrometer - Cloud and Aerosol Polarization Imager (CAPI) will measure the aerosol and cloud properties synchronously.\nTanSat project turned to Critical Design Phase after Preliminary Design Review on June 2013, and it plan to finish Critical Design Review on December 2014 and launch on July 2016.\nA multi-bands retrieval algorithm has been developed to approach XCO2 with applying O2A band observation to reduce aerosol and cirrus cloud influence. The state vector list has been modified from previous two-bands algorithm by adding aerosol model parameters, cirrus cloud model parameters and linear correction on O2A bands. Application of TanSat XCO2 retrieval Algorithm on GOSAT Observation (ATANGO) has been developed from multi-bands TanSat algorithm. GOSAT observation has been used in retrieval experiment of ATANGO. A preliminary inter comparison test has been carried out with the XCO2 product of University of Leicester (UoL) full physics algorithm. The bias of 1.2 hPa (~0.1%) and 2.4ppm (~0.6%) of surface pressure and XCO2 between ATANGO and UoL were indicated, and the standard deviation of 2.8hPa (~0.28%) and 1.23ppm (~0.3%) of surface pressure and XCO2 between ATANGO and UoL were found.\nThe Ground-based observation network of XCO2 in China was developed, which include three Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (IFS-125) over Xinglong, Beijing, Shenzhen, and three Optical Spectrum Analyzers (OSA) over Shangdong, Hainan Island, and Dunhuang, with different latitude and background. The measurement spectrum has been investigated with a full physics optimal estimation algorithm and a DOAS like algorithm. The aerosol and cloud observation network measurement provided information on aerosol and cloud optical properties distribution in China, and it will be helpful to develop a more reliable priori data in future XCO2 algorithm study.",

            "abstract": "Finite-fault rupture models for the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake reveal considerable variability among the published solutions of kinematic source parameters. One potential source of this variability arises from the non-unique choice of crustal structure. This earthquake occurred in an area of complex geology, including a small sedimentary basin and pronounced topography. Therefore, the use of a one-dimensional crustal structure may be insufficient to accurately infer the earthquake rupture process.\nIn this study, we examine the effects of crustal structure variability on the inversion for the rupture process of the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. We particularly assess the rupture model uncertainty related to one- and three-dimensional Earth models that are used to compute Green’s functions. In doing so, we evaluate the role of using more realistic crustal structure in resolving the rupture model parameters.\nWe apply Bayesian inference to quantitatively assess the characteristics of the space-time rupture evolution (peak slip-rate, rupture time, and rise time) in terms of posterior density functions. We find that the use of realistic 3D crustal structure, including topography and crustal heterogeneity improves the earthquake source imaging. We also investigate the sensitivity of rupture parameters with respect to the variations in crustal structure.",

            "abstract": "The large-scale surface deformation, uplifting and faulting occurring at the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau are generally believed to be caused by the continuous collision between the India and Eurasia since ~50 millions years ago. However, the style and amount of the subsurface deformation induced by the collision, especially those inside the lower crust and upper mantle, are still debated. We analyzed a large amount of receiver function data recorded by 204 broadband stations in the area between 08/2007 and 10/2013 to estimate the crustal velocity and anisotropy structure beneath the margin and its surrounding areas. Moho depth and average crustal Vp/Vs ratio were measured at each station using the H-κ stacking method, while seismic anisotropy parameterized by fast polarization direction and splitting time was computed by a joint analysis of radial and transverse receiver function data. The crust beneath the margin is around~50-70 km thick with a relatively low Vp/Vs ratio. Meanwhile, we found significant seismic anisotropy with a splitting time of 0.5-1.1s inside the crust beneath the margin. The fast polarization directions align well with surface structure, and follow the directions of the maximum horizontal tensile stress. The lower Vp/Vs ratio together with fast polarization direction suggests that whole crustal shortening might be the dominant mechanism for producing the thick crust beneath NE Tibet. We also compared the measured seismic anisotropy with those measured from SKS (PKS, SKKS), and found that crustal deformation plays a primarily role in explaining the observed SKS splitting data. Meanwhile, depth variation of seismic anisotropy may exist in some parts of the study area.",

            "abstract": "Due to the enhanced warming in the Arctic Regions owing to the sea-ice decrease and others processes, as a part of the global warming, other snow and ice such as glaciers are also decreasing (SWIPA, 2011) and melting region of Greenland are said to have increased in 2012. It is very important to know the present actual condition and the speed of the changes. Research group in Japan and Russia, started to look into the present state of the glaciers of the North-East Siberia which is one of the blank area in the Arctic Region. The glaciated area in the Sunta-Khayata Mountain Range, which exist at northest Siberia, between the てぇcities of Magadan in the Pacific Coast and Oimyakon. The glaciated area is said to be 156 km2 in 1945 and decreased to 162 km2 in 2002/2003 (SWIPA, 2011). This change should be accelerated during the recent ten years, due to the strong warming occurring in the 2000s. In-situ research in this region has been made in IGY period (1957～1959) by Russian Groups、and after that, in year 2000 and 2004～2005 by joint Russian and Japanese Groups. Since old information exists in this region, this is a good area for studying cryospheric changes due to the recent strong warming. A project started in 2011 to obtain glacier basic information and study their changes, and will look into the future variability applying glacier models. Also, mountain environment such as permafrost condition, geomorphology were surveyed. Reconnaissance started in 2011, and field surveys were done in three summers (2012 to 2014). Glacier mass, mass balance changes, glacier-climate relation and past glacier variability is discussed based on glacier measurement, surface mass balance measurement, in-situ climate observation and moraine dating. This is a project between Cold Region Program of JAMSTEC (Yokosuka, Japan), GRENE Project of NIPR (Tokyo, Japan) and Melinikov Permafrost Institute (Yakutsk, Russia).",

            "abstract": "As a by-product of our recent work to build a candidate model over the oceans for the World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map (WDMAM) version 2, we derived global distributions of the equivalent magnetization in oceanic domains.\nIn a first step, we use classic point source forward modeling on a spherical Earth to build a forward model of the marine magnetic anomalies at sea-surface. We estimate magnetization vectors using the age map of the ocean floor, the relative plate motions, the apparent polar wander path for Africa, and a geomagnetic reversal time scale. As magnetized source geometry, we assume 1 km-thick layer bearing a 10 A/m magnetization following the topography of the oceanic basement as defined by the bathymetry and sedimentary thickness. Adding a present-day geomagnetic field model allows the computation of our initial magnetic anomaly model.\nIn a second step, we adjust this model to the existing marine magnetic anomaly data, in order to make it consistent with these data. To do so, we extract synthetic magnetic along the ship tracks for which real data are available and we compare quantitatively the measured and computed anomalies on 100, 200 or 400 km-long sliding windows (depending the spreading rate). Among the possible comparison criteria, we discard the maximal range - too dependent on local values - and the correlation and coherency - the geographical adjustment between model and data being not accurate enough - to favor the standard deviation around the mean value. The ratio between the standard deviations of data and model on each sliding window represent an estimate of the magnetization ratio causing the anomalies, which we interpolate to adjust the initial magnetic anomaly model to the data and therefore compute a final model to be included in our WDMAM candidate over the oceanic regions lacking data. The above ratio, after division by the magnetization of 10 A/m used in the model, represents an estimate of the equivalent magnetization under the considered magnetized source geometry.\nThe resulting distributions of equivalent magnetization are discussed in terms of mid-ocean ridges, presence of hotspots and oceanic plateaus, and the age of the oceanic lithosphere. Global marine magnetic data sets and models represent a useful tool to assess first order magnetic properties of the oceanic lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Earth’s background microseism noise spectrum, observed widely across the Earth is commonly dominated between ~1-30 seconds period by oceanic wave activity that arises when ocean swell is converted to (predominately) Rayleigh waves. Peak power levels in the microseism band at high-latitude stations typically coincide with large-scale extratropical cyclonic winter storm activity. However, due to the seasonal formation of sea ice around the continental shelves of polar regions, oceanic waves are impeded from efficiently exciting seismic energy, and annual peak microseism power thus occurs prior to the midwinter storm peak. We analyze recently collected Polar Earth Observatory (POLENET/A-NET) and Antarctica’s Gamburtsev Province (GAMSEIS) seismic data to characterize the Antarctic microseism signal and its unique seasonality and annual variations in each of three distinct bands: the high-frequency secondary microseism (1-5 s), the secondary microseism (5-10 s) and the primary microseism band (10-20 s). Power in these bands is found to be strongly anti-correlated with sea ice extent. with the shorter period signals being exceptionally sensitive to local conditions. We quantitatively show that the formation of sea ice may be capable of attenuating on-shore microseism power by as much as 90%. Additionally, we note a significant increase in primary microseism power attributable to near coastal Antarctic Peninsula sources during the last twenty years. This increase correlates with regional sea ice loss driven by large-scale wind changes associated with the strengthening of the Southern Annular Mode. Investigation of microseism seasonality, power, and decadal-scale trends in the Antarctic shows promise as a spatially integrated tool for monitoring and interpreting such sea ice strength and extent, metrics through time.",

            "abstract": "Lassen Volcanic Center is the southernmost volcanic region in the Cascade volcanic arc formed by the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Lassen Peak last erupted in 1915 in an arc related event producing a black dacite material containing xenocrystic olivine grains with apparent orthopyroxene reaction rims. The reaction rims on these olivine grains are believed to have formed by reactions that ensued from a mixing/mingling event that occurred prior to eruption between the admixed mafic andesitic magma and a silicic dacite host material. Natural samples of the 1915 black dacite from Lassen Peak, CA were prepared into 15 polished thin sections and carbon coated for analysis using a FEI Quanta 250 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to identify and measure mineral textures and disequilibrium reaction rims. Observed mineralogical textures related to magma mixing include biotite and amphibole grains with apparent dehydration/breakdown rims, pyroxene-rimmed quartz grains, high concentration of microlites in glass matrix, and pyroxene/amphibole reaction rims on olivine grains. Olivine dissolution is evidenced as increased iron concentration toward convolute edges of olivine grains as observed by Backscatter Electron (BSE) imagery and elemental mapping using NSS spectral imaging software. In an attempt to quantify the area of reaction rim growth on olivine grains within these samples, high-resolution BSE images of 30 different olivine grains were collected along with Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) of different phases. Olivine cores and rims were extracted from BSE images using Photoshop and saved as separate image files. ImageJ software was used to calculate the area (µm2) of the core and rim of these grains. Average pyroxene reaction rim width for 30 grains was determined to be 11.68+/-1.65 µm. Rim widths of all 30 grains were averaged together to produce an overall average rim width for the Lassen Peak black dacite. By quantifying the reaction rims on olivine grains in the natural samples of Lassen Peak dacite as well as the bulk chemistry of the rock, this provides insight into the storage conditions of the magma chamber and the timing necessary for reactions to form these specific volcanic textures which in turn can be used as a basis for better understanding future experimental reconstruction of this magmatic system.",

            "abstract": "In the past decades, the climate in the Baltic Sea Basin has undergone a change with a magnitude that is beyond the estimated range of natural variability. We test the hypothesis that this change may be understood as a manifestation of global warming due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Our approach is based on verifying whether observed trends in climate parameters over the Baltic Sea region during the last decades are consistent with regional climate model simulation in response to GHG forcing. For research we use several datasets: 1) multi-decadal trends derived from different observational data sets, 2) an estimate of natural (internal + external) variability provided by a 2,000-year paleoclimatic model simulation, and 3) GHG-signals derived from downscaled A1B and RCP4.5 scenarios (from ENSEMBLES and CORDEX).\nWe find that changes in temperature support our hypothesis that the effect of GHG is needed to reconstruct the observed warming. However, those changes in precipitation and surface solar radiation are partially inconsistent with the hypothesis. We conclude that beyond the regional manifestation of global warming; more human-made drivers are present. Regional emission of industrial aerosols has been reduced strongly in this region, and we suggest that this reduction may constitute the missing driver.",

            "abstract": "General Circulation Models (GCMs) have shown difficulties to correctly simulate some atmospheric patterns, especially the precipitation over South America (SA), which is often attributed to the low resolution of these models. The increased horizontal resolution of climate models aims to improve the simulations accuracy and to understand the non-linear processes during interactions between different spatial scales within the climate system. Up to this moment, these interactions did not have a good representation on low horizontal resolution GCMs. The purpose of this study was to understand the impact of the horizontal resolution in high resolution coupled and atmospheric global models of HiGEM project in simulating atmospheric patterns and processes of interaction between spatial scales. The simulations were validated using different reanalysis data and compared with observations in order to understand the impact of horizontal resolution on the precipitation systems over SA. Three different horizontal resolutions for HiGEM family models were compared ≈ 60, 90 and 135 km. Precipitation estimations from CMAP, CPC and GPCP are used for validation. Both coupled and uncoupled simulations consistently represent the observed spatial patterns related to seasonal march of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the formation and location of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) and the subtropical high pressure systems in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. However, they overestimate the precipitation rate, especially in the ITCZ and western border regions of higher elevation, as in southern Chile. The fine horizontal resolution contributed to the large similarity between the seasonal patterns of global models and observations, with coupled models representing better these patterns than the atmospheric models in many regions of SA. The simulated annual cycles are in phase with estimations of rainfall for most of the six regions considered. An important result is that these models eliminate a common problem of coarse resolution CGCMs, which is the simulation of a semiannual cycle of precipitation due to the semiannual solar forcing. These results show, although still with some problems, that the increased resolution improves the representation of the annual precipitation cycle in South America.",

For this, flow characteristics were analyzed first in street canyons with different aspect ratios and flow regimes were classified according to the building height. For each flow regime, dispersion characteristics were investigated in views of reactive pollutant concentration and VOCs‒NOX ratio. Finally, the relations between pollutant concentration and aspect ratio in urban street canyons were investigated. In the case of H/S = 1.0 (H is building height and S is street width), one clockwise‒rotating vortex appeared vertically and the reverse and outward flows were dominant near the street bottom. In the case of H/S = 2.0, two counter‒rotating vortices appeared vertically in the street canyon. The primary (secondary) vortex rotating clockwise (counterclockwise) was formed in upper (lower) layer. The flow patterns affected the reactive pollutant concentration in street canyons. As building height increased, mean concentration of NO decreased when one vortex was generated in street canyons and increased when two vortexes appeared in street canyons. O3 concentration showed almost contrasted tendency with those of NO because O3 was depleted by the NO titration.",

This processing allows for the detection of unique seismic events, including events triggered by the passage of seismic waves created by large, distant earthquakes. We develop an automated approach to identify small, locally recorded earthquakes on a single station within continuous seismic data. We apply a time domain short-term average (STA) to long-term-average (LTA) ratio algorithm to create a catalog of “detections” (a signal above the noise level, which may, or may not be an earthquake) at each station recorded on three components, and then remove any spurious detections by requiring that a detection is real only if recorded on a minimum of two channels. To calibrate the algorithm, we use a set of ~900 small earthquakes in the December 2008 Yellowstone Swarm. Of the four STA/LTA algorithms we tested (e.g., 1 s/10 s; 4 s/40 s; 8 s/80 s; 16 s/160s), the 4/40s method is the most effective at identifying the majority of events in the swarm. We apply this preferred method to data from 165 M≥7 earthquakes (±5-hours of data centered on the mainshock origin times) recorded at >400 seismic stations in EarthScope’s USArray Transportable Array (TA) and regional seismic networks within the continental United States. Our algorithm nets, on average, hundreds of detections for each mainshock, and we find we can detect small events within the network. The 4/40s method is successful at identifying local earthquakes within the TA and regional networks. We find STA/LTA algorithms can successfully identify small local earthquakes within large datasets.",

The RMSE was lowest in the case of Sct = 0.35 and the apparent dispersion pattern was most similar to the wind‒tunnel data in the case of Sct = 0.35.

Interactions are divided into local and nonlocal. If all the energy released from the mean flow through eddy-mean flow interaction is used to support eddy growth in the same region, or if all the energy released from eddies through eddy-mean flow interaction is used to feed back to the mean flow in the same region, eddy-mean flow interaction is local; otherwise, it is nonlocal. Different regions have different characters: in the subtropical region studied in detail, interactions are dominantly local. In the Southern Ocean and Kuroshio and Gulf Stream Extension regions, they are mainly nonlocal. Geographical variability of dominant eddy-eddy, and eddy-mean flow processes is a dominant factor in understanding ocean energetics. This work points out the prevalence of eddy energy nonlocality and indicates the need of using nonlocal eddy parameterization schemes.",

            "abstract": "In the Czech and Austrian parts of the Bohemian Massif, garnet and spinel pyroxenites and eclogites form layers and lenses in mantle–derived peridotites that are enclosed by migmatitic gneiss and granulite. We have analyzed major and trace elements, Sr and Nd isotopes for a suite of pyroxenites, which vary in composition and origin, from nine localities in the Gföhl Unit and Kutná Hora Complex of the Moldanubian Zone. Based on conventional thermobarometry, the pyroxenites fall into three P–T regimes: (1) HP–HT at c. 3.3 GPa and 950 °C; (2) MP–HT at 1.5–2.5 GPa and 875–975°C; and (3) HP–MT at 3.5–3.7 GPa and c. 810 °C.\nThe pyroxenite suite exhibits large variations in elemental and isotopic compositions, reflecting their complex origin and evolution. Based on REE compositions of clinopyroxene (cpx), four different types (Type I-IV) of pyroxenites can be distinguished: (Type I) LREE–depleted; (Type II) convex–upward REE pattern, combined with significant enrichment in La; (Type III) variable, LREE–enriched patterns, and (Type IV) convex–upward REE pattern. Such different REE patterns in cpx reflect derivation from different compositions of mantle source melts, ranging from primitive (Type I) to enriched (Types II, III, and IV). For the pyroxenite suite as a whole, a positive correlation between Sr/Nd and Eu/Eu* argues for the presence of a crustal component (oceanic crust), which underwent significant plagioclase fractionation before incorporation in the parental pyroxenite melts. Variations in compatible elements (Ni, Sc, and Co) indicate that parental melts underwent combined fractional crystallization and assimilation of host peridotite at some localities.",

In Japan, since its topography is complicated, precision monitoring and investigation has a limit. So, utilization of the remote sensing is expected as a precise and effective investigation method. Previous research in Japan, Sekiya et al. (2010) estimated the soil carbon stock from soil surface down to 100 cm depth in Hokkaido. However, the estimated values may not reflect current situation, because in this research relatively old soil survey data from the 1960’s to the 1970’s were used to estimate the soil carbon stock.\nUnder this background, we developed an estimation method using satellite data to evaluate the soil carbon stocks in the agricultural field covering wide area to be used as the fundamental data.\nResult of our study suggests that there is a significant correlation between the amount of soil carbon and the reflectance value from visible to near-infrared wavelength region. This is the reason that the color of the soil becomes dark and electromagnetic wave absorbency from visible to near-infrared wavelength increases corresponding with increment of the soil carbon content. Especially, a high negative correlation is found between the reflectance value of red wavelength and the soil carbon stock in the SPOT satellite data of 2013.",

Therefore, it is useful to examine the relationship between atmospheric variability and SLCPs. Particularly, the concentration of Particle Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is significant in east Asia, which is mostly due to a rapid industrialization. It is known that both the atmospheric circulation and cloud variability is closely associated with the variations of PM2.5 in east Asia are associated with major atmospheric variables for 1986-2010 using the GEOS-Chem model and the observational datasets. The composite analysis reveals that the high and low concentration year of PM2.5 in east Asia is differently associated with the spatial pattern of atmospheric anomalies over the North Pacific. In addition, the changes in the PM2.5 concentration in east Asia may lead the changes in the amount of high and low cloud in the downstream region of the North Pacific. This indicates that the PM2.5 variations in east Asia may significantly influence the weather and climate variability in the North Pacific by modulating the cloud amount and atmospheric circulation, which is largely consistent with some previous studies.",

Although deep unsaturated zone transport of gases is commonly treated as dominated by Fickian diffusion, previous observations at the Amargosa Desert Research Site have shown that the transport rates of various gas phase contaminants are faster than expected from standard models of diffusive transport. In this study, we use a multi-model approach to analyze results of a gas-tracer (SF6) test to clarify factors affecting gas transport in a deep unsaturated zone. Thirteen separate models with distinct diffusivity structures were calibrated to the tracer-test data. Models were compared on the basis of Akaike Information Criteria estimates of posterior model probability. The greatest posterior probability occurred for a model with significant anisotropy of diffusivity in addition to varying apparent diffusivity among vertically distributed sampling locations. Some horizontal diffusivities were greater than expected for purely diffusive transport, with values approaching free-air diffusivity (tortuosity ≈ 0.6 to 1). The magnitudes of the high apparent diffusivities were consistent with advective oscillations propagating through unsaturated-zone strata based on an analysis of barometric and unsaturated-zone air pressure time series. These results indicate that point source gases in layered unsaturated zones can spread laterally more quickly, and produce higher peak concentrations, than predicted by isotropic Fickian diffusion models.",

Some cloud parcel modeling studies show that Ni is insensitive to Na (Kärcher and Lohmann, 2002; Kay and Wood, 2008), while others show moderate sensitivity of Ni to Na (Liu and Penner, 2005; Barahona and Nenes, 2008). The poorly understood cirrus cloud processes lead to large uncertainties in ice nucleation parameterizations in global climate models, with implications for climate change studies.\nIn this study, we examine the sensitivity of Ni from homogeneous freezing to Na with a cloud parcel model running at different input aerosol and cloud conditions and under different model assumptions. By these sensitivity tests, we are able to reconcile the contrasting results from previous studies on the sensitivity of Ni to Na. Furthermore, the implications of these results on aerosol indirect forcing through ice clouds are quantified by comparing three ice nucleation parameterizations (Liu and Penner, 2005; Barahona and Nenes, 2008; Kärcher and Lohmann, 2002) implemented in the Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5). The global and annual mean longwave aerosol indirect forcing through cirrus clouds ranges from -0.03 (Kärcher and Lohmann, 2002) to ~0.3 W m-2 (Liu and Penner, 2005; Barahona and Nenes, 2008). Future studies should quantify the occurrence frequency of homogeneous nucleation in the upper troposphere and the relative contribution between homogeneous versus heterogeneous freezing to Ni in cirrus clouds to further narrow down the aerosol indirect forcing through cirrus clouds.",

            "abstract": "Currently, fluid circulation patterns and the evolution of rock/fluid compositions as circulation occurs in subseafloor hydrothermal systems are poorly constrained. Sedimented spreading centers provide a unique opportunity to study subsurface flow because sediment acts as an insulating blanket that traps heat from the cooling magma body and limits: (a) potential flow paths for seawater to recharge the aquifer in permeable upper basaltic basement and (b) points of altered fluid egress. This also allows for a range of thermal and geochemical gradients to exist near the sediment-water interface. Models of fluid circulation patterns in this type of hydrologic setting have been generated (eg. Stein and Fisher, 2001); however fluid chemistry datasets have not previously been used to test the model’s viability. We address this issue by integrating the existing circulation model with fluid compositional data collected from sediment pore waters and high temperature hydrothermal vents located in Middle Valley on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Middle Valley hosts a variety of hydrologic regimes: including areas of fluid recharge (Site 855), active venting (Site 858/1036; Dead Dog vent field), recent venting (Site 856/1035; Bent Hill Massive Sulfide deposit) and a section of heavily sedimented basement located between recharge and discharge sites (Site 857). We will present new results based on thermal and geochemical data from the area of active venting (Sites 858 and 1036), that was collected during Ocean Drilling Program Legs 139 and 169 and a subsequent heat flow/gravity coring effort. These results illuminate fine scale controls on secondary recharge and fluid flow within the sediment section at Site 858/1036. The current status of high temperature vents in this area (based on observations made in July, 2014) will also be outlined.",

            "abstract": "Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and their impact on carbon cycling in permafrost habitats is poorly understood. Arctic C cycling is particularly important to interpret due to the rapid climate change occurring and the large amount of C stockpiled there (~1/3 of global soil C is stored in permafrost). Viruses of microbes (i.e. phages) play central roles in C cycling in the oceans, through cellular lysis (phage drive the largest ocean C flux about 150 Gt yr-1, dwarfing all others by >5-fold), production of associated DOC, as well as transport and expression during infection (1029 transduction events day-1). C cycling in thawing permafrost systems is critical in understanding the climate trajectory and phages may be as important for C cycling here as they are in the ocean. The thawed C may become a food source for microbes, producing CO2 and potentially CH4, both potent greenhouse gases. To address the potential role of phage in C cycling in these dynamic systems, we are examining phage from an arctic permafrost thaw gradient in northern Sweden. We have developed a protocol for successfully extracting phage from peat soils and are quantifying phage in 15 peat and 2 lake sediment cores, with the goal of sequencing viromes. Preliminary data suggest that phage are present at 109 g-1 across the permafrost thaw gradient (compared to the typical marine count ~105 ml-1), implying a potentially robust phage-host interaction web in these changing environments. We are examining phage from 11 depth intervals (covering the active and permafrost layer) in the cores to assess phage-host community dynamics. Phage morphology and abundance for each layer and environment are being determined using qTEM and EFM. Understanding the phage that infect bacteria and archaea in these rapidly changing habitats will provide insight into the controls on current and future CH4 and CO2 emissions in permafrost habitats.",

Time-depth relationships are estimated from P-wave velocity data at Sites U1431, U1432, U1433 and U1435. We find that this relationship in the East Sub-basin is similar to that in the Southwest Sub-basin, but quite different from that obtained at the northern continent-ocean boundary (COB). Regional and local tectonic subsidence is analyzed based on selected seismic profiles and coring/logging data from Site U1431.We first establish a function of thermal subsidence caused by lithosphere cooling by backstripping along a regional seismic profile extending from the COB to the relict spreading ridge in the East Sub-basin. By comparing the observed with theoretical thermal subsidence, we find an anomalous upwelling near the relict ridge but anomalous subsidence near the northern COB. Tectonic subsidence rate at Site U1431 peaked from 17 to 13 Ma, and then slowed down with time. By subtracting the thermal subsidence estimated from the regional seismic profile out of the tectonic subsidence at Site U1431, we estimate the local subsidence caused by local tectonic events. The largest rate of local subsidence occurred from 9 to 12.5 Ma, coeval with the seamount volcanism nearby that was active from 8 to 13 Ma at the relict spreading center and which may have triggered local tectonic subsidence.",

            "abstract": "Viscous relaxation of large impact basins provides a potential method for investigating the thermal evolution of terrestrial planets and of icy satellites of giant planets. Pluto, an icy dwarf planet, is likely to possess large impact basins. In this study, we use a viscoelastic code [1] to investigate relaxation of impact basins on Pluto for a variety of thermal evolution scenarios [2] encompassing both convective and conductive ice shells. We found that impact basins smaller than 200 km in diameter do not relax appreciably, while the relaxation fraction can be up to ~60% for large impact basins. The main control on basin relaxation is the amount of radiogenic heat produced in the rocky core; our results are insensitive to the formation time of the basin, the ice reference viscosity adopted, and the presence/absence of a subsurface ocean. Relaxation causes extensional stresses interior to the basin; the orientation of the resulting tectonic features is controlled by the effective elastic thickness beneath the basin. We also found that the relaxation fraction of impact basins on Charon, the largest satellite of Pluto, should be less than 10% as long as tidal heating is small. Future observations of the relaxation states and tectonics of impact basins by New Horizons are therefore likely to provide a key constraint on Pluto's thermal history and on the evolution of the Plutonian system.\n[1] Kamata et al.

This is one of the foremost agricultural regions of India with irrigation predominantly provided by groundwater extraction. However, satellite-based methods of groundwater-loss estimation are highly spatially averaged, and do not provide high-resolution spatial patterns of groundwater depletion. This limits the development of comprehensive groundwater management plans at micro levels. Here we resolve the spatial structure of groundwater loss in Punjab and Haryana states (NW India) through analysis of historical groundwater level data. We compiled state groundwater level observations from 2915 wells (1974-2010) together with Central Groundwater Board data from an additional 997 wells (2002- 2011) in the states of Punjab and Haryana. Parts of southern Haryana and southwest Punjab show dramatic decline in groundwater level by 12-18 meters during this period. The initial trend between 1974 and 1998 is much gentler compared to a steep decline between 1998 and 2010 as observed on time series plots. A few parts in western Haryana and southwest Punjab show rise in groundwater level varying from 10-18 meters during this period. The greatest decline in groundwater levels are observed within the Ghaggar basin, with a smaller area of extreme loss in southern Haryana. We estimate groundwater volume loss during 1974-2011 and compare this with variations in rainfall and groundwater abstraction during the period of 1974 to 2010.",

Rain evaporation is the main source of convective organization, and the functions of organization within a plume ensemble include 1) plume radius enhancement (entrainment rate reduction) 2) the plume coverage (area or mass) that reaches the Level of Free Convection, and 3) the probabilities of overlap, and thus interactions, between plume ensemble members.

A useful starting point is to consider the sensitivity kernel for an infinite half-space of constant resistivity. In the past, the peak and median have been considered as estimates of the region of sensitivity. However, there does not exist a simple formula for either the peak or the median. In this contribution it will be shown that there does exist a simple mathematical formula for the mean of the sensitivity kernel. It will also be shown that when the mean of the sensitivity kernel is used as the pseudodepth, that depth soundings are significantly smoother and easier to interpret than when using a fixed ratio of the total array length. A formula for the horizontal mean of arrays is also derived which gives the appropriate horizontal pseudoposition for asymmetric arrays like pole-dipole arrays.",

The 2,2-DMSA and 2,3-DMSA are structural isomers with the same oxidation state (OSC = -0.33) and carbon number (NC = 6), but different branching characteristics (2,2-DMSA has one secondary carbon and 2,3-DMSA has two tertiary carbons). The difference in molecular distribution of oxidation products observed in these two structural isomers would allow one to assess the sensitivity of kinetics and chemistry to the position of branched methyl group in the DMSA upon oxidation.\nWe observe that the reactivity of 2,3-DMSA toward OH radicals is about 2 times faster than that of 2,2-DMSA. This difference in OH reactivity may attribute to the stability of the carbon-centered radical generated after hydrogen abstraction because an alkyl radical formed from the hydrogen abstraction on a tertiary carbon in 2,3-DMSA is more stable than on a secondary carbon in 2,2-DMSA. For both 2,2-DMSA and 2,3-DMSA, the molecular distribution and evolution of oxidation products is characterized by a predominance of functionalization products at the early oxidation stages. When the oxidation further proceeds, the fragmentation becomes more favorable and the oxidation mainly leads to the reduction of the carbon chain length through the carbon-carbon bond cleavage. We provide molecular information to access how the position of the branched methyl groups plays a role in determining the kinetic and chemistry and to support the recent hypothesis that the relationship between average aerosol elemental composition (e.g., OSC) and oxidation pathways is not always unique.",

            "abstract": "The geothermal heat flux is a critical thermal boundary condition that influences the melting, flow and mass balance of outlet glaciers and ice sheets. We measured directly the geothermal heat flux below the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), under Subglacial Lake Whillans (SLW), as part of the Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling (WISSARD) project. The one-dimensional, conductive heat flux is the product of thermal gradient and thermal conductivity. We developed and fielded a tool to determine the thermal gradient in lake sediments, after penetrating ~800 m of ice using a hot water drilling system. We used the needle-probe method to measure the thermal conductivity of sediments recovered from the bottom of the lake with a gravity-driven multi-corer. The thermal gradient was determined during two separate deployments of the geothermal tool, which penetrated ~1.1 m into the till below SLW, yielding essentially identical results: 0.21±0.07 °C/m. Fifteen sediment thermal conductivity measurements yield an average value of 1.36±0.12 W/m-K. The heat flux determined from these measurements is 285±85 W/m2. This value is somewhat higher than that estimated from the WAIS-Divide ice core site, 230 mW/m2, ~800 km away, and much higher than regional estimates based on magnetics and a global seismic model, generally ≤100 mW/m2. Elevated heat flux in this area could result from thermal perturbations associated with rifting, crustal thinning, or volcanic activity. Heat flux of this magnitude is likely to cause basal melt rate of a few cm/year. If this value is representative of conditions below this part of the WAIS, it might help to explain the occurrence of active subglacial lakes and fast-moving ice streams and the ice dynamics of WAIS more broadly.",

Data was obtained from the Magnetic Data Acquisition System (MAGDAS) installed and managed by the International Centre for Space Weather Science and Education (ICSWSE), Japan. The diurnal and seasonal distribution of the occurrence of CEJ at Ilorin (West Africa) and Addis Ababa (East Africa) were examined. It was observed that the occurrence of morning CEJ is much prevalent along the East African longitude (90%) than the West African longitude (80.9%), while the evening CEJ is dominant along the West African longitude (82.9%) than the East African longitude (50%). The longitudinal variability in the occurrence of CEJ along these longitudes is attributed to the differences in meridional currents, variation in the local electric field in the ionosphere, and the gravity wave associated vertical winds. The simultaneity and asymmetry in the occurrence of CEJ were also investigated. The morning simultaneity is maximum (100%) is maximum than the evening simultaneity. The occurrence of Asym-2 is much prevalent at both longitudes (41.3%) than asym-1 (4.9%).",

Oomurodashi has a large (~20km diameter) flat-topped summit located at 100 – 150 metres below sea level (mbsl), with a small central crater, Oomuro Hole, located at ~200 mbsl. Surveys conducted during cruise NT12-19 of R/V Natsushima in 2012 using the remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) Hyper-Dolphin revealed that Oomuro Hole contains numerous active hydrothermal vents and that the summit of Oomurodashi is covered by extensive fresh rhyolitic lava and pumice clasts with little biogenetic or manganese cover, suggesting recent eruption(s) from Oomuro Hole. Given the shallow depth of the volcano summit, such eruptions are likely to have generated subaerial eruption columns. A ~10ka pumiceous subaerial tephra layer on the neighbouring island of Izu-Oshima has a similar chemical composition to the submarine Oomurodashi rocks collected during the NT12-19 cruise and is thought to have originated from Oomurodashi. Here we present FTIR measurements of the H2O contents of rhyolitic pumice from both the submarine deposits sampled during ROV dives and the subaerial tephra deposit on Izu-Oshima, in order to assess magma degassing and eruption processes occurring during shallow submarine eruptions.",

            "abstract": "The partitioning of iron between Mg-perovskite (Mg-Pv) and ferropericlase (Fp) is largely related to the phase relation and dynamics of the lower mantle. It has long been treated by the KD value, (Fe/Mg)Pv/(Fe/Mg)Fp. However, this treatment is not correct for lower mantle Mg-Pv because iron in Mg-Pv in the lower mantle (assumed as pyrolite composition) involves both Fe2+ and Fe3+, and the partitioning of iron is largely affected by the amount of Al and the spin transition of iron with pressure. Here, we propose a new thermodynamic treatment of the partitioning of iron with different valence and spin states between Mg-Pv and Fp in the lower mantle. Experimental reports of the pyrolite composition indicate that Mg-Pv contains nearly equal amounts of Fe and Al, and Fe3+ is more dominant than Fe2+ and coupling with Al. Also, while Fe2+ remains as high spin (HS) at the A site, Fe3+ changes from HS to low spin (LS) and shifts from the A site to the B site with pressure in Al-bearing Mg-Pv. Therefore, Mg-Pv in the lower mantle can be modeled as the solid solution of 5 end-members, MgSiO3, HSFe2+SiO3, HSFe3+AlO3, AlLSFe3+O3, and Al2O3, where the first and second cations indicate the A site and B site cations, respectively. Likewise, Fp can be modeled as the solid solution of 3 end-members, MgO, HSFe2+O, and LSFe2+O. In addition, Fe metal exists as an isolated phase. Using this model of coexisting Mg-Pv, Fp, and Fe-metal, the four partition coefficients of iron, involving HSFe2+, HSFe3+, and LSFe3+ in Pv, and HSFe2+ and LSFe2+ in Fp, are derived. It is now required to experimentally determine these four partition coefficients of iron at the various pressure-temperature conditions.",

            "abstract": "In this study, a highly idealized model is developed to discuss the interplay of diurnal heating/cooling induced buoyancy and wind stress on thermally driven flow over a vegetated slope. Since the model is linear, the horizontal velocity components can be broken into buoyancy-driven and surface wind-driven parts. Due to the presence of rooted emergent vegetation, the circulation strength even under the surface wind condition is still significantly reduced, and the transient (adjustment) stage for the initial conditions is shorter than that without vegetation. The flow in shallows is dominated by a viscosity/buoyancy balance as the case without wind, while the effect of wind stress is limited to the upper layer in deep water. In the lower layer of deep regions, vegetative drag is prevailing except the near bottom regions, where viscosity dominates. Under the unidirectional wind condition, a critical dimensionless shear stress to stop the induced flow can be found and is a function of horizontal location . For the periodic wind condition, if the two forcing mechanisms work in concert, the circulation magnitude can be increased. For the case where buoyancy and wind shear stress act against each other, the circulation strength is reduced and its structure becomes more complex. However, the flow magnitudes near the bottom for and are comparable because surface wind almost has no influence.",

Despite its significance, the timing and pattern of Laramide deformation remains poorly constrained in Montana. Thermochronological data from Wyoming indicate exhumation of Laramide ranges during the late Cretaceous and Paleogene. Whereas a few data exist for the Bearthooth Range in Montana; the exhumation history of most of the Montana ranges remains unexplored preventing testing of current tectonic models. We report apatite fission track thermochronologic (AFT) data from modern river sands derived from Laramide ranges, bedrock basement samples, and synorogenic conglomerate clasts to determine the regional exhumation history of the Beartooth, Gravelly, Tobacco Root, Ruby, the Highland Mountains, and the Wind River Range. AFT permits reconstruction of thermal histories and rates of erosion of the upper few kilometers of the crust. In particular detrital AFT of river sands provides information on regional exhumation of the drainage area.\nAFT detrital ages derived from the southern end of the Beartooth Range are dominated by a 60-80 Ma signal, consistent with ages reported for bedrock basement samples in the Beartooth Range. A Cenozoic synorogenic conglomerate clast was obtained from the Highland Mountains, AFT results show a 69.56 +/- 5.45 Ma cooling age. In the Wind River Range, Wyoming AFT data from a Cenozoic synorogenic conglomerate clast from the Wind River Formation indicates a 59.32 +/- 4.83 Ma cooling age. This age is consistent with AFT ages from Gannett Peak indicating rapid cooling at ~60 Ma and ~50 Ma (Fan and Carrapa, 2014). Overall, samples from the easternmost ranges, the Beartooth and Bighorn, clearly preserve a Cretaceous signal; samples from Wind River Range and the rest of southwest Montana mainly record a Cenozoic signal. This suggests deeper and younger exhumation to the west than to the east. These results combined with thermal modeling provide additional constraints on the tectono-thermal history of Laramide ranges. In addition, these results allow for a temporal-spatial comparison between cooling and exhumation in the Montana and Wyoming Laramide regions and help test current models of the Laramide Orogeny.",

We have extensively analyzed both the laboratory and flight calibration measurements for the Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument to produce a data set of solar wind observations at times when the New Horizons spacecraft is spinning. This full data set spans from 10 to 30 AU, and the improved coverage portion spans from 20- 30 AU. Coincidently, in 2012 and 2013 the ACE, STEREO A, and STEREO B were well separated in longitude. We compare the New Horizons speeds with propagated 1 AU speed measurements, and find many of the largest scale structures persist beyond 20 AU. The New Horizons solar wind coverage between 20 and 30 AU is now extensive enough to examine the temperature-speed relationship and compare that to the relationship found in the inner heliosphere and to that in the Voyager 2 observations.

Our model constitutes two coupled diffusion equations, where coupling occurs only in the time-derivative terms with symmetric coefficients. As simplifying to water-saturated soils, these equations exactly reduce to those in the classic Biot (1941) model of consolidation. Closed-form analytical solutions describing the excess pore air and water pressures along with the total settlement in response to external loading are obtained for both permeable and semi-permeable boundary drainage conditions by the application of the Laplace transform.\nNumerical calculations are then implemented for unsaturated sand, loam, silt, and clay with respect to three initial water saturations (0.7, 0.8, and 0.9) as representative examples. Our results reveal that the excess pore water pressure and total settlement are significantly sensitive to both soil texture and initial water saturation. For a given initial water saturation, the rate of dissipation of excess pore water pressure is smallest in clay, with the highest total settlement being induced, followed by silt, loam, and sand. In the early stage of consolidation, unsaturated soils bear smaller excess pore water pressure, but its dissipation is completed faster in saturated soils. Two important parameters for characterizing consolidation processes are quantitatively examined. The coefficient of consolidation for water is shown to increase with an increase in initial water saturation, taking a value in saturated soils approximately four to five orders of magnitude greater than that in unsaturated ones. The loading efficiency for water exhibits a concave upward relationship with initial water saturation in clay, whereas a positively-correlated relationship between the efficiency and initial water saturation is observed in silt, loam, and sand.",

During the past 100 years, mean SAT increased about 3 ºC in Tokyo, and 2 ºC in Nagoya and Osaka, while world mean SAT increased only 0.66 ºC. Major reason of difference in the warming is effect of the urban heat island (UHI), whose intensity also increased during the period and often the most during winter. This study investigates change in UHI intensity (UHII) of major metropolitan areas (Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka) in Japan by effects of the global climate change. A series of climate simulations performed. Present climate simulations with and without urban process are conducted using a high-resolution numerical climate model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Future climate projections with and without urban process are also conducted. The future projections are performed using the pseudo global warming method, assuming lateral and bottom boundary conditions in the 2050s estimated by a GCM under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Simulation results indicated that UHII would be enhanced more than 30% in Tokyo during the night due to the global climate change.",

            "abstract": "Simulating the distribution of rainfall on daily and sub-daily time-scales has been a daunting task faced by both global and regional climate models. Over the maritime continent this problem becomes all the more challenging due to the complex topography and local processes playing a major role in shaping the climate over the region. Using a 24-year (1981-2005) timeseries of hourly in-situ rainfall over Singapore, an island over the western maritime continent with a very dense network of rain-gauges, we first characterize the observed rainfall distribution and compare it with retrievals from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. We find remarkably good agreement between in-situ observations and TRMM retrievals in the entire range of rainfall intensities sampled, as seen from the cumulative distribution diagrams. From TRMM retrievals we also find that on daily timescales the rainfall distribution over the Singapore island is very similar to that over the adjoining oceans. Next, we validate the fidelity of the Met Office regional model RegUM in reproducing the observed rainfall statistics using dynamically downscaled model outputs at 12 km horizontal grid spacing for the same time period, and find a good agreement between the model and satellite retrievals over the neighbouring oceans, however over land the model fails to simulate the rainfall distribution with an over-estimation of low-intensity drizzle and significant underestimation of the higher intensities. Finally, we compare the rainfall statistics produced by the regional model with those from the driving global model (HadGEM2-ES), and find that although in general the regional model follows the driving model on larger spatial and temporal scales, at finer scales the rainfall distribution from the two models can be quite different. We find that on daily timescales, over both land and ocean points the regional model produces the most intense rainfall events on days when the driving global model produces very little rainfall.",

            "abstract": "Emissions due to combustion of fossil fuel and biomass are two major sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The trace gases emitted by biomass burning have a significant influence on the atmosphere which currently accounts for ~25% of the annual anthropogenic emission of CO2into the atmosphere. Also some of the world's most carbon-dense ecosystems like South America and Africa are increasingly susceptible to fire.\nThough observing atmospheric greenhouse gas dry air mole fractions from space is an approach in practice, the problem of delineating the contribution from the flux arising from different sources has always been a matter of interest. Here we demonstrate the capability of a space-borne CO2 observational platform (Greenhouse gas Observing SATellite, GOSAT) to detect emissions of CO2 due to biomass burning. We made an attempt to detect fire emission signal of CO2 in GOSAT observed total column dry air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) for a period June 2009 through December 2012. We performed Lagrangian time inverted simulation (trajectory between 2-3 days) of CO2 transport using FLEXPART for GOSAT observation locations using high resolution (0.1 degree) biomass burning (GFAS V1.1) fluxes. The resulting total column mixing ratios of CO2 (ΔXCO2,model) were grouped into 0.2 ppm bins over spatial regions of 10x10 degree. The result was compared to anomalies of GOSAT XCO2, calculated as ΔXCO2,obs=XCO2,obs-local background (omitting influence from other regimes of emission), collectively for the analysis period and for large continental regions where these detected signals predominate. GOSAT data showed good agreement with modeled ΔXCO2 till about 0.9 ppm (for example regression slope of 0.989 for African continent up to 0.7 ppm) , beyond this, the number of observations with higher ΔXCO2drops and hence poor correspondence to model values.\nOur analysis points towards the potential of dedicated greenhouse gas observing satellites providing larger number observations like the OCO-2 which can better observe narrow plumes downwind of CO2 emission hotspots, resulting in larger number of high concentration observations.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor compliance measures the elastic response of the ocean bottom to water pressure fluctuation, and is a function of the elasticity of the sediment/crust. We have measured seafloor compliance from OBS data at two sites on the Okinawa trough (OT), which results from continental rifting, and one site on the Ryukyu arc (RA), a crustal block separated by the OT from the Eurasian plate, in the vicinity of Taiwan. Because the water depth is known and the sediment thickness can be estimated from seismic studies, this study offers a comparison in crustal properties between rifting and non-rifting environment. We performed both grid search and minimum-structure inversion for Vs. The models that best explain the compliance data indicate that the shear velocity of the upper crust of the RA is higher than that in the OT. This implies that the extension of the OT may cause significant faulting/fracturing of the brittle part of the crust and lower its shear modulus. Between the 2 OT sites, the Vs is lower for the OBS more distant from Taiwan. This observation is consistent with the scenario in which the crust is faulted and weakened more as rifting process intensifies from the edge of the Okinawa trough.",

            "abstract": "Carbonates are important carriers for carbon exchange between the surface and interior of the Earth and therefore their melting behavior bears directly on the deep carbon cycle. Previous studies showed that the solidus temperature of carbonated silicate spans a wide range of temperature due to composition variations in the starting materials. In order to provide fundamental data for thermodynamic calculations, the melting curve of pure CaCO3 was measured up to 22 GPa using an in-situ electrical method in this study. The measurement was realized by monitoring abrupt changes in electrical conductivity upon melting. The results showed that the melting temperature of CaCO3 increases rapidly from 2 to 8 GPa, consistent with the existing data (Irving and Wyllie, 1975; Suito et al., 2001). Our new data at high pressures reveal that the CaCO3 melting curve flattens around 8GPa, starts to decrease until 15 GPa, and then increases again from 15 to 22 GPa. The changes in the melting slope reflect the evolution of the melt compressibility with pressure and the sub-solidus structural phase transformations. The inferred CaCO3 melt density from melting curve slope is slightly smaller than basaltic melt at same pressureand temperature. The unusual negative slope melting curve between 8 and 15 GPa likely indicates the presence of melt around 400-500 Km depth, which may explain some of observed low-velocity zones in the transition zone (Vinnik & Farra, 2006).\n",

            "abstract": "Isoprene-derived SOA formation has been studied extensively in the laboratory. However, it is still unclear to what extent isoprene contributes to the overall SOA burden over the southeastern US, an area with both strong isoprene emissions as well as large discrepancies between modeled and observed aerosol optical depth. For the low-NO isoprene oxidation pathway, the key gas-phase intermediate is believed to be isoprene epoxide (IEPOX), which can be incorporated into the aerosol phase by either sulfate ester formation (IEPOX sulfate) or direct hydrolysis. As first suggested by Robinson et al, the SOA formed by this mechanism (IEPOX-SOA) has a characteristic fragmentation pattern when analyzed by an Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) with enhanced relative abundances of the C5H6O+ ion (fC5H6O). Based on data from previous ground campaigns and chamber studies, we have developed a empirical method to quantify IEPOX-SOA and have applied it to the data from the DC3 and SEAC4RS aircraft campaigns that sampled the SE US during the Spring of 2012 and the Summer of 2013. We used Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to extract IEPOX-SOA factors that show good correlation with inside or downwind of high isoprene emitting areas and in general agree well with the IEPOX-SOA mass predicted by the empirical expression. According to this analysis, the empirical method performs well regardless of (at times very strong) BBOA or urban OA influences. On average 17% of SOA in the SE US boundary layer was IEPOX-SOA.\nOverall, the highest concentrations of IEPOX-SOA were typically found around 1-2 km AGL, several hours downwind of the isoprene source areas with high gas-phase IEPOX present. IEPOX-SOA was also detected up to altitudes of 6 km, with a clear trend towards more aged aerosol at altitude, likely a combination of chemical aging and physical airmass mixing. The unique instrument package aboard the NASA-DC8 allows us to examine the influence of multiple factors (aerosol acidity, aerosol water content, sulfate mass fraction, isoprene and terpene source strength) to the relative and absolute contribution of IEPOX-SOA to the total OA burden. In particular, the IEPOX-sulfate measurement from the PALMS instrument was used to estimate the relative contribution of the organosulfate channel to the IEPOX-SOA formation.",

            "abstract": "Two dune types associated with vegetation are known: Parabolic and Vegetated Linear Dunes (VLDs), the latters are the dominant dune type in the world deserts. Parabolic dunes are formed in humid, sub-humid and semi-arid environments (rather than arid) where vegetation is nearby.  VLDs are known today in semiarid and arid lands where the average yearly rainfall is ≥100 mm, enough to support sparse cover of vegetation. These two dune types are formed by unidirectional winds although they demonstrate a different form and have a distinct dynamics. Conceptual and mathematical models of dunes mobility and stability, based on three control parameters: wind power (DP), average annual precipitation (p), and the human impact parameter (µ) show that where human impact is negligible the effect of wind power (DP) on vegetative cover is substantial. The average yearly rainfall of 60-80 mm is the threshold of annual average rainfall for vegetation growth on dune sand. The model is shown to follow a hysteresis path, which explains the bistability of active and stabilized dunes under the same climatic conditions with respect to wind power. We have discerned formation of parabolic dunes from barchans and transverse dunes in the coastal plain of Israel where a decrease in human activity during the second half of the 20th century caused establishment of vegetation on the crest of the dunes, a process that changed the dynamics of these barchans and transverse dunes and led to a change in the shape of the windward slope from convex to concave. These dunes gradually became parabolic. It seems that VLDs in Australia or the Kalahari have always been vegetated to some degree, though the shrubs were sparser in colder periods when the aeolian erosion was sizeable. Those ancient conditions are characterized by higher wind power and lower rainfall that can reduce, but not completely destroy, the vegetation cover, leading to the formation of lee (shadow) dunes behind each shrub. Formation of such VLDs can occur today in some coasts where the wind is quite strong and the rain can support some shrubs.",

            "abstract": "Kamchatka peninsular is known for its very strong volcanic activity. At any given moment in time, at least one of Kamchatka volcanoes is erupting. Some of these eruptions are producing strong seismic tremors that may be recorded at large distances. We analyze daily cross-correlation computed from continuous records by permanent stations operating on the Kamchatka peninsular. Seismic waves generated by volcanic tremors are clearly seen on the cross-correlations between some pairs of stations as strong signals at frequencies between 0.2 and 2 Hz and with travel times typically shorter than those corresponding to inter-station propagation. We use a two-dimensional source-scanning algorithm based on summation of the envelops of cross-correlations to determine locations from with the strong seismic energy is continuously emitted. In an alternative approach, we explore the distinctive character of the cross-correlation waveforms corresponding to tremors emitted by different volcanoes and develop a matched-filter method for detecting volcanic tremors. Application of these methods allows us to detect tremors generated by Klyuchevskoy, Tolbatchik, and Gorely volcanoes and to monitor evolution of their intensity in time.",

            "abstract": "Inverting seismic waveforms for the finite fault source parameters of earthquakes is important for reconstruction of faulting processes including both the properties of the fault and transient stress field. It is also significant to image seismogenic structures in urban areas. Here we analyze the finite-source process and test for the causative fault plane using the accelerograms recorded by the Taiwan Strong-Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) stations. The point source parameters for more than 100 Mw>4 earthquakes were first obtained by complete waveform moment tensor inversions. Then we use part of this catalog to study the 22 October 1999 (Mw 5.6) earthquake sequence near the city of Chiayi, Taiwan, where a damaging earthquake occurred a century ago. We have derived the change in the duration of the apparent source time functions (ASTFs) using a new Empirical Green Function Deconvolution method to estimate the mainshock rupture propagation processes. Preliminary results show the mainshock ruptured on the NNE-SSW trending right-lateral strike-slip fault and propagated toward SSW direction. To further characterize the faulting, we are using a finite fault inversion code developed by Dreger and Kaverina (2000) to derive a slip distribution model of this mainshock. The procedure developed from this study can be applied to other strong motion events to better understand their kinematic source parameters.",

            "abstract": "This work reports that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which has been known to directly affect winter weather conditions in Western Europe and the eastern United States, is also linked with the surface air temperature over the southwestern United States (SWUS) in the early warm season. In this study, monthly time scale correlation and composite analyses were performed using three independent multi-decadal temperature datasets (i.e., NCEP/NCAR reanalysis (60 years), CRU (60 years), and NARR (30 years)) between 1950 and 2009. Results reveal that NAO-related upstream circulation not only positively affects the means, but also the extremes of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures in SWUS. This effect is primarily linked with the positioning of upper-tropospheric anticyclones over western US that is associated with the development of the positive NAO phase, through changes in low-tropospheric wind directions as well as suppression of precipitation and enhanced shortwave radiation at surface. This effect is observed in SWUS only during the March-June period because the monthly migration of anticyclones over the western US follows the migration of the NAO center over the subtropical Atlantic Ocean. This linkage of SWUS temperature with NAO has been strengthened in the last 30-year period (1980-2009) compared to the earlier 30-year period (1950-1979). Our results imply different spatial NAO patterns with different timescales from months to several decades.",

            "abstract": "High-quality broadband magnetotelluric (MT) data (0.01-1000 s period) were acquired at four stations in Borrego Canyon within the Santo Domingo Basin of the Rio Grande Rift, New Mexico, during the 2014 Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience (SAGE) field program. MT response functions along the 10-km long NW trending profile are nearly identical with all stations showing a distinct mode split at 10 s period, suggesting a significant conductivity contrast is located roughly 10-20 km away from the profile based on skin depth estimates. Audiomagnetotelluric, polar diagrams, impedance skew, induction vectors and phase tensor analysis all indicate one-dimensional (1-D) structure at periods <10 sec, a predominantly two-dimensional (2-D) structure at intermediate depths (10-100 s) with a 60° geoelectric strike, and three-dimensional (3-D) structure at the longest periods.\n Inverse modeling of the data from 0.01–10 s reveals a three-layer electrical structure: a moderately resistive sediments from the surface to ~750 m depth, a conductive layer (weathered volcanoclastics) to 4 km depth, and below 4 km a highly resistive basement of Mesozoic and Precambrian rocks. A 2-D inverse model converged, but resulted in physically unrealistic structure. Hence a 3-D forward model study was performed using the 2014 data together with three additional MT stations acquired further to the east during SAGE 2010. Models that include a NE-trending conductive structure to the north of the profile show broad consistency between the measured and synthetic phase tensors and impedances. We infer our MT data to be on the conductive side of this contact, with the resistive material to the NW attributed to a heavily intruded crust beneath the Jemez lineament, and possibly the edge of the thick lithosphere beneath the Colorado Plateau. 3-D inversion of this sparse data set is being carried out to determine whether this conceptual model is consistent with the full impedance tensor and tipper data.",

            "abstract": "River systems are often perturbed by human impacts that can be difficult to quantify. In the middle Ganga, Lav Kush barrage at Kanpur was constructed in 2004 for augmenting drinking water supply for Kanpur city. Following this perturbation, the main flow of the river was diverted to the right bank downstream of this barrage. The left bank of the river is now almost dry in the pre-monsoon period. This complex change of flow pattern is difficult to quantify and characterize. However, the resulting changes in flow pathways do broadly fall under the concepts of connectivity. Here we start with a quantitative framework of connectivity based on the Graph Theory. In order to develop a new index of dynamic connectivity in a river network, we examine the channel structure in the vicinity of Lav Kush barrage over a period of 24 years (1990-2014). Based on the graph theory nodes and links, the idea was to extract the channel network from Landsat imagery, and then to construct the nodal structure with connecting links. The results were then used to compute the Hararry index, characteristic path length and the effective path length. Finally, the connectivity indices were analyzed in a multi-scalar framework by using hyperscale graphs which display connectivity indices as a function of both scale and position in the reach (Figure 1). Fig-1a shows undisturbed connectivity with a more heterogeneous nodal structure in the pre-barrage era. Fig-1b indicates a significant loss in connectivity after Lav Kush barrage construction. In the upstream reaches, the channel is almost uniform showing very less nodal density. This lesser nodal density signifies a uniform channel belt thatleads to a homogeneous geomorphic condition. This type of analysis was repeated at seasonal intervals in order to track changes in graph theoretic properties in an attempt to infer changes to the dynamic connectivity structure and their potential relevance to the geomorphic evolution of this river reach.",

Whereas, the RMSE of UM shows slowly increasing pattern during the whole forecast period so that the difference of RMSE between two models is decreased gradually from 4-day fp. The spatial and meridional patterns of zonally averaged RMSE in Z500 and T850 show that it is increased rapidly and largely in middle latitude from 1-day fp in GloSea5. And the RMSE differences of two models begin to decrease from 4-day fp, appear the minimum in most regions at 12-day fp. Areas with larger RMSE of UM are also existed regionally as forecast period is increased.\nIn climatic aspect, the predictability of Indian monsoon index which is calculated by difference of wind speed at low and middle latitude is verified. The result of RMSE analysis appears that its pattern from initial time to 12-day fp is similar to that result of Z500 and T850. Relative variation of daily forecast value shows that UM is smaller than GloSea5 during 6 months. The correlation of Indian monsoon index to be predicted by GloSea5 with analysis values of ECMWF is less than 0.5 after 3-day fp but one by UM is more than 0.5 from 1 to 12-day fp in average. In Tropics, for the prediction of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), RMSE and Anomaly Correlation (AC) of forecasted SST in NINO3.4 region are investigated. Despite of only use of SST in UM background field, its SST value is more similar with analysis value of ECMWF than one of GloSea5 during short range forecast period (1~5 day). After 6-day forecast period, RMSE of GloSea5 is smaller than one of UM. That is also verified by mean distribution of AC with larger value of one in GloSea5 from 5 to 12-day fp.",

            "abstract": "We have developed highly spatial resolution isotope analysis with cycling magnetic fields on NanoSIMS 50 (Cameca, Gennevilliers, France) housed at Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, Japan. This technique requires two unmovable EM detectors (EM1 and EM2) and three magnetic fields (B1, B2, and B3). For Cl measurements, the following configuration was applied: (B1-EM1) 35Cl-; (B2-EM1) 37Cl-; (B2-EM2) 35Cl-; (B3-EM2) 37Cl-, in the form of “(B and EM configurations) target ions” (Table 1). When magnetic fields are in a cycling mode and moving next to next, we can obtain three isotopic ratios from the same spot: 37ClEM1/35ClEM1, 37ClEM2/35ClEM2, and 37ClEM1/35ClEM2 where subscripts show corresponding detectors. Considering the average of 37ClEM1/35ClEM1 and 37ClEM2/35ClEM2, reproducibility gets higher because total counts increase and analytical artifacts due to difference between detectors’ sensitivity are offset. 10-μm spots were used for analyses. Reproducibility of 37Cl/35Cl in an apatite crystal from Imilchil/Errachidia region in Morroco was 1.1‰ (1σ; N=10), and that in RY380-R03b (EPR basalt: 17.4S, 113.2W) was 1.3‰ (1σ; N=8). These values may be small enough to evaluate aqueous alteration on mantle-derived materials because it causes 6‰ variation in reaction related reservoirs such as sediments and pore fluids[1]. There were no apparent correlations between Cl contents and 37Cl/35Cl in RY380-R03b, supporting that strong correlations between them found in MORB by a pyrohydrolysis method[2] may be analytical artifacts[1]. We also measured S isotope ratios based on the same method as Cl. 5-μm spots were used for analyses. Reproducibility of 34S/32S in a pyrite crystal from Udo mine in Japan[3] was 1.8‰ (1σ; N=6), and that in CH98 DR12 (MAR basalt: 30.1N, 41.9W) was 1.7‰ (1σ; N=5). These values are small enough to evaluate S fractionation or mixing in the basalt-seawater system which have 20‰ difference in δ34S. This technique will enable us to study magma compositions through the geological time by inclusion analyses which cannot be achieved by bulk measurements such as combustion and pyrolysis methods.\n[1] Sharp et al.

            "abstract": "Steve Schneider was a strong proponent of considering the entire range of possible climate-change outcomes. He wrote and spoke frequently about the importance of low probability/high consequence outcomes as well as most likely outcomes. He worked tirelessly on communicating the risks from overlapping stressors. Technical and conceptual issues have made it difficult for Steve’s vision to reach maturity in mainstream climate-change research, but the picture is changing rapidly. The concept of climate-change risk, considering both probability and consequence, is central to the recently completed IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, and the concept frames much of the discussion about future research agendas.\nFraming climate change as a challenge in managing risks is important for five core reasons. First, conceptualizing the issue as being about probabilities builds a bridge between current climate variability and future climate change. Second, a formulation based on risks highlights the fact that climate impacts occur primarily in extremes. For historical variability and future impacts, the real concern is the conditions under which things break and systems fail, namely, in the extremes. Third, framing the challenge as one of managing risks puts a strong emphasis on exploring the full range of possible outcomes, including low-probability, high/consequence outcomes. Fourth, explaining climate change as a problem in managing risks links climate change to a wide range of sophisticated risk management tools and strategies that underpin much of modern society. Fifth, the concept of climate change as a challenge in managing risks helps cement the understanding that climate change is a threat multiplier, adding new dimensions and complexity to existing and emerging problems.\nFraming climate change as a challenge in managing risks creates an important but difficult agenda for research. The emphasis needs to shift from most likely outcomes to most risky outcomes, considering the full range of interacting processes, both in the climate system and in human responses. But conceptualizing the challenge of climate change as a challenge in managing risks also opens a path to a wide range of options for solutions. Together, the agenda for research and the options for solutions build toward Steve’s vision.",

            "abstract": "We report changes in stable isotope values (δ2H and δ18O) and concentrations of dissolved elements in groundwater before and after earthquakes in northern Iceland. Groundwater samples have been collected from 2 boreholes that penetrate basalt and basalt-derived sediments for >5 years at Hafralækur and for >10 years at Húsavík, northern Iceland. Comparison of δ2H and δ18O with the global meteoric water line reveals mixing between pre-Holocene and modern day groundwater and groundwater affected by water-rock interaction.  M >5 earthquakes occurred in 2002, 2012 and 2013.  There were also several M >4 earthquakes during our study.\nAt Hafralækur, we report δ2H maxima that are not part of a normal distribution (confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality) and which coincide with M >5 earthquakes in 2012 and 2013. These began before each earthquake with a gradual increase of δ2H towards heavier values and ended with a gradual return towards lighter values. At both sites, we report concentration maxima of dissolved elements which coincide with the M >5 and some M >4 earthquakes. Using a binomial test, we confirmed that the δ2H and concentration maxima were associated with the earthquakes. Possible causes of this association are mixing of groundwater components or exposure of fresh rock surfaces to groundwater. Both changes can be explained by expansion of the rock volume (dilation) enhancing permeability.\nThe M >5 and some M >4 earthquakes were followed by abrupt changes of δ18O and of dissolved element concentrations. These changes might be explained by different mixing ratios between groundwater components caused by switching between fracture pathways due to seismically induced changes of water pressure.\nOur results show that changes in groundwater chemistry before earthquakes can be statistically verified provided that measurement campaigns are long term. Although these changes are specific for northern Iceland, we infer that chemical and isotopic signals of dilation might be detected elsewhere before earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Mantle density structure is a key for tectonics. The density variations in the upper mantle are affected by temperature and composition. Seismic tomography method has been widely applied to obtain the P- and S-wave velocity structure in the mantle, which is then used to calculate the density perturbation. However, the velocity model is mainly due to the thermal effects but not the compositional effects. A method of 3-D inversion of gravity anomaly developed in spherical coordinates is used to image the large-scale density structure of upper mantle in Southeast Asia. The mantle gravity anomalies used in inversion are calculated by removing the crustal effects from the observed gravity. With constraints of thermal density model from seismic tomography, the integrative density structure is estimated from gravity inversion. Consequently, we obtain the compositional density by subtracting the thermal density from the integrative structure. The result of inversion shows the anisotropic composition of subduction zones, Cratons and plates boundary in Southeast Asia. In the shallow depth, the compositional density anomalies of large scales present uniform features in oceanic and continental mantle. In depth of 75-175 km, there are differences between the thermal and the compositional variations. The density anomalies at these depths are both affected by temperature and composition of the upper mantle. Below 175-km depth, the density anomalies are dominated by the compositional variations. Furthermore, comparing with high seismicity occurred at moderate-depth (50-300 km), we found that the compositional density variations is one of the factor that inducing earthquakes. The constrained inversion of mantle gravity anomaly has possibility to reveal the subduction which is not clearly seen from low-resolution tomography data, and may reveal the relation of seismicity and composition in the upper mantle.

Neutron monitors are large ground-based detectors that provide accurate measurements of variations in the cosmic ray flux at the top of the atmosphere above the detector. Furthermore, the Earth serves as a magnetic spectrometer, so a neutron monitor in a given location is sensitive to cosmic rays above a geomagnetic cutoff rigidity, which mainly depends on magnetic latitude. A latitude survey with a ship-borne neutron monitor is a useful technique to improve knowledge of the neutron monitor response function and directly determine solar cycle variations in the Galactic cosmic ray spectrum. In this work, we analyze data from the 1994 through 2007 series of latitude surveys conducted by the Bartol Research Institute, the University of Tasmania, and the Australian Antarctic Division. We report on data correction and calibration, show the differential response function, and summarize the results.

The stage M1 is presented by assemblage of plagioclase + quartz + hornblende + porphyroblastic garnet core + rutile. P-T conditions for this stage cannot be quantitatively estimated. The stage M2 is represented by the porphyroblastic garnet rim with the matrix quartz, plagioclase, pyroxene, amphibole, rutile and ilmenite. P–T conditions for this stage are estimated to be 1.0–1.2 GPa and 700–750 °C. The stage M3 is shown by symplectitic coronas of hornblende + plagioclase ± ilmenite around the embayed M2 porphyroblastic garnets and yields P–T conditions of 0.6–0.7 GPa and 600–650 °C. The stage M4 is represented by small garnet rings immediately growing on the embayed M2 garnet or around the M2 pyroxene and hornblende, or by assemblage of fine-grain garnet + hornblende + sodium plagioclase growing from the M3 intergrowth of hornblende + Calcium plagioclase. The stage M5 is represented by albite, chlorite, epidote and actinolite growing in greenschist-facies conditions reasonably of 400–500 °C at relatively lower pressures. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating on the metamorphic zircon indicates that the M2 garnet porphyroblast and related assemblage and the M3 coronas grew at ca. 1.95 Ga; the M4 garnet growth occurred at ca. 1.82 Ga with reference to regional geochronological data. Both M2 and M4 garnets and related assemblages are indicative of medium P/T-type metamorphism. Qualitative and quantitative P–T estimates for stages M1, M2 and M3 define a clockwise P–T path. The resulting data suggest two late Paleoproterozoic collisional metamorphic events with important implication for amalgamation of the Quanji Massif with unknown continental blocks in NW China and close links to the assembly of the Columbia supercontinent.",

            "abstract": "We investigate nitrate movement from non-point sources in deep, heterogeneous vadose zones, using multi-dimensional variably saturated flow and transport simulations. We hypothesize that porous media heterogeneity causes saturation variability that leads to preferential flow systems such that a significant portion of the vadose zone does not significantly contribute to flow. We solve Richards’ equation and the advection-dispersion equation to simulate soil moisture and nitrate transport regimes in plot-scale experiments conducted in the San Joaquin Valley, California. We compare equilibrium against non-equilibrium (dual-porosity) approaches. In the equilibrium approach we consider each soil layer to have unique hydraulic properties as a whole, while in the dual-porosity approach we assume that large fractions of the porous flow domain are immobile. However we consider exchange of water and solute between mobile and immobile zone using the appropriate mass transfer terms. The results indicate that flow and transport in a nearly 16 m deep stratified vadose zone comprised of eight layers of unconsolidated alluvium experiences highly non-uniform, localized preferential flow and transport patterns leading to accelerated nitrate transfer. The equilibrium approach largely under-predicted the leaching of nitrate to groundwater while the dual-porosity approach showed higher rates of nitrate leaching, consistent with field observations. The dual-porosity approach slightly over-predicted nitrogen storage in the vadose zone, which may be the result of limited matrix flow or denitrification not accounted for in the model. Results of this study may be helpful to better predict fertilizer and pesticide retention times in deep vadose zone, prior to recharge into the groundwater flow system.\nKeywords: Nitrate, Preferential flow, Heterogeneous vadose zone, Dual-porosity approach",

            "abstract": "With EarthScope’s USArray Transportable Array (TA), an unprecedented access to information about the crust and mantle beneath the North American Continent (NA) is possible. The depth and sharpness of upper mantle seismic discontinuities, parameters sensitive to chemical and thermal properties of the mantle, are indicative of the dynamics under NA. Using the high spatial sampling offered by TA, we analyze upper mantle discontinuity structure via topside reflections of seismic waves. This array-based approach allows us to investigate the discontinuity structure beneath NA at lateral scale lengths of several hundred kilometers or less.\nThe topside reflections are labeled as SdsS or SSds, where d represents the depth from which the wave reflects. Topside reflections arrive as postcursory phases of the primary S arrival, delayed up to several hundreds of seconds. Our analysis relies on the use of SH waves, the horizontal component of transverse polarization. Similar to other secondary seismic phases, SdsS amplitudes are roughly 5-15% of the main S-arrival amplitude. Stacking is then used to isolate the topside related phase components from the background noise.\nTopside reflections may occur at either the receiver-side or source-side of the path; lifting this ambiguity is made possible through use of multiple-array analysis. Using a dataset of ~251 earthquakes recorded during 2005-2014 by the large moving configuration of TA, with events originating in the Tonga-Fiji subduction zone, we address this ambiguity by implementing an array-based approach to image station-side heterogeneity beneath NA. Events are selected from a relatively compact region in the vicinity of Tonga, while the receiver-side observations are extensive across NA. Our new approach to analyzing the topside reflections allows inferences about the receiver side structure of the upper mantle discontinuities, a result that we relate to thermal and chemical heterogeneity beneath NA.",

            "abstract": "The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) is an important boundary at which the rigid lithosphere translates coherently upon the viscous asthenosphere. New observations have been made on LAB through detailed seismic analysis, especially that from receiver functions. Previous studies have found LAB depth varies significantly, systematically getting shallower from continental to oceanic lithosphere. In smaller scale, the depth and sharpness of LAB also differ from region to region, suggesting the effects of a combination of thermal and compositional origins. In this study, we investigate the LAB beneath the South China Sea, a region poorly instrumented that conventional seismological are less effective and impractical. The South China Sea is on the Sunda Plate, which is considered to be once the southeastern part of the Eurasia Plate before separating with a distinct moving direction from that of India-Eurasia continental collision. The South China Sea is Phanerozoic in age and continental in nature, but the striped magnetic anomalies observed from the sea floor have suggested multiple spreading events since early Miocene, indicating the presence of latter formed oceanic lithosphere. Previous seismic studies of this region focused mainly on shallow basin structure pertaining to petroleum exploration. The lithospheric structure, particularly the LAB, remains elusive, while it provides important insight into the complex tectonic history in this region. To image the LAB, we use the precursor of SS phase. The precursor bounces at the LAB discontinuity at depth would appear before the SS and presents a signal amenable to analysis for depth and properties. We collect seismic waveform data recorded mainly at Japan and Cocos Islands of corresponding teleseismic events from Southern Sumatera and Japan, with SS and potential precursors bouncing beneath the South China Sea. We employ an analysis technique, velocity spectral analysis (vespagrams), to identify precursory arrivals. The fourth root vespagrams are generated to verify the arrival times and slowness of the precursors that match the predictions from velocity model ak135. Through vespagrams analysis, the precursors of interest are separated from the interfering energy, such as SKiKs, and can be further migrated to depth to indicate the location of LAB.",

            "abstract": "In order to understand the transfer of energy, momentum and mass through the magnetopause one needs to know several plasma and field parameters including the DC electric field which is known to be challenging to measure in tenuous plasma regions, e.g. in the inner side of the magnetopause where the density drops below 1/cc. However, each of the Cluster spacecraft carries five different experiments that can provide information about DC electric fields, i.e. double probe antenna (EFW) and electron drift meter (EDI) as well as electron and ion spectrometers (PEACE, CIS-HIA, CIS-CODIF). Each technique is very different and has its own strengths and limitations. Therefore it is important to compare all available measurements before making a judgement on DC electric field variation at the magnetopause; note that only very rarely all five measurements are available at the same time. Although the full-resolution observations in the Cluster archive are calibrated, they can still contain various errors. However, when two experiments show the same field, it is quite likely that this is the right field because the different measurements are based on so complimentary techniques and the field varies so much when the spacecraft moves from the magnetosheath through the magnetopause into the magnetosphere, or vice versa. In this presentation we present several cases of the magnetopause crossings and how the different measurements agree and disagree around the magnetopause region.",

In contrast to previous studies, we have found that the total time of the radial IMF per year does not change with solar activity.

            "abstract": "In this study, the effect of vertical wind shear (VWS) on the intensification of tropical cyclone (TC) is investigated via the numerical simulations. Results indicate that weak shear tends to facilitate the development of TC while strong shear appears to inhibit the intensification of TC. As the VWS is imposed on the TC, the vortex of the cyclone tends to tilt vertically and significantly in the upper troposphere. Consequently, the upward motion is considerably enhanced in the downshear side of the storm center and correspondingly, the low- to mid-level potential temperature decreases under the effect of adiabatic cooling, which leads to the increase of the low- to mid-level static instability and relative humidity and then facilitates the burst of convection. In the case of weak shear, the vertical tilting of the vortex is weak and the increase of ascent, static instability and relative humidity occur in the area close to the TC center. Therefore, active convection happens in the TC center region and facilitates the enhancement of vorticity in the inner core region and then the intensification of TC. In contrast, due to strong VWS, the increase of the ascent, static instability and relative humidity induced by the vertical tilting mainly appear in the outer region of TC in the case with stronger shear, and the convection in the inner-core area of TC is rather weak and convective activity mainly happens in the outer-region of the TC. Therefore, the development of a warm core is inhibited and then the intensification of TC is delayed. The numerical result shows that the tropical storm can still experience rapid intensification and finally develop into a strong tropical cyclone after a relatively long period of adjustment in the strong VWS environment. It is found that the convection plays an important role in the adjusting period. On one hand, the convection leads to the horizontal convergence of the low-level vorticity flux and therefore leads to the enhancement of the low-level vorticity in the inner-core area of the cyclone. On the other hand, the active ascent accompanying the convection tends to transport the low-level vorticity to the middle levels. As a result, the vertical tilting of the vortex is considerably decreased, and then the cyclone starts to develop rapidly.",

            "abstract": "There are multiple indications that wind circulation characteristics may have been changing over the last decades. However, obtaining a globally consistent high-accuracy assessment of these changes from spaceborne remote sensing data has proved elusive in many cases, even though ocean vector wind data has been collected from space starting in the 1990’s.\nThe reason that a consistent assessment of these changes is still a work in progress is due to multiple factors. Firstly, many of the scatterometer instruments were designed to meet accuracies satisfactory for weather prediction, not for the smaller magnitude changes associated with climate change. Nevertheless, these instruments have proven at least self-consistent over long periods and suggest that climate signals may be retrievable from their data.\nSecondly, the instruments have used different microwave frequency bands, and uncertainties still remain regarding the consistency of the measurement physics across frequency bands. Thirdly, the data have been processed differently with different, and potentially inconsistent, model functions. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, all of these satellites have been in sun-synchronous orbits, with observations being made at different local times. These differences in observation time leads to aliasing of diurnal and semi-diurnal observations into the climate data record.\nIn the first part of this talk, I review our current state of knowledge of the intercalibration of the three major scatterometers of the past decades: NASA’s QuikSCAT, EUMETSAT’s ASCAT (A & B), and ISRO’s OSCAT. In the second part, I describe the design of the NASA ISS-RapidScat cross-calibration mission. This mission uses the non-sun-synchronous characteristics of the International Space Station (ISS) orbit to provide coincident data with scatterometers in the constellation every revolution. It is expected that it will be able to provide cross-calibration cross section and wind data for QuikSCAT, ASCAT, and the forthcoming ISRO ScatSat mission. RapidScat is expected to launch in September, 2014, and the final part of this talk will present the first results of the mission on orbit.",

            "abstract": "We present a new map of the multiscale topographic roughness of the northern circumpolar area of Mercury. The map utilizes high internal vertical precision surface ranging by the laser altimeter MLA onboard MESSENGER mission to Mercury. This map is analogous to global roughness maps that had been created by M.A.K. with collaborators for Mars (MOLA data) and the Moon (LOLA data). As measures of roughness, we used the interquartile range of along-track profile curvature at three baselines: 0.7 km, 2.8 km, and 11 km. Unlike in the cases of LOLA data for the Moon, and MOLA data for Mars, the MLA data allow high-quality roughness mapping only for a small part of the surface of the planet: the map covers 65N - 84N latitude zone, where the density of MLA data is the highest. The map captures the regional variations of the typical background topographic texture of the surface. The map shows the clear dichotomy between smooth northern plains and rougher cratered terrains. The lowered contrast of this dichotomy at the shortest (0.7 km) baseline indicates that regolith on Mercury is thicker and/or gardening processes are more intensive in comparison to the Moon, approximately by a factor of three. The map reveals sharp roughness contrasts within northern plains of Mercury that we interpret as geologic boundaries of volcanic plains of different age. In particular, the map suggests a younger volcanic plains unit inside Goethe basin and inside another unnamed stealth basin. -- Acknowledgement: Work on data processing was carried out at MIIGAiK by MAK, AAK, NAK and supported by Russian Science Foundation project 14-22-00197.",

            "abstract": "Understanding post-seismic sediment transport is important for assessing crustal mass redistribution by earthquakes and for managing seismically-induced geohazards, including channel aggradation and flooding. The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Mw 7.9) triggered over 60,000 landslides in the Longmen Shan range of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Records from hydrometric gauging show enhanced regional suspended sediment fluxes following the earthquake, resulting from evacuation of the landslide sediment (Wang et al., in revision). In addition to the insights into suspended sediment dynamics from gauging stations, this large-magnitude seismic event provides an opportunity to study bedload sediment transport after a large earthquake. Here we present primary results from a comprehensive investigation of the Min Jiang river system following the Wenchuan earthquake. Using a landslide inventory map (Li et al., 2014) and a DEM-based river network, we mapped landslide-river network connectivity. With photo-sieving techniques, we estimated the grain size distribution of medium-grained (mm to cm scale) landslide deposits. These data provide constraints on sediment sources. The mass of sediment in transport has been estimated from river sediment quartz 10Be measurements (West et al., 2014), supplemented here by constraints from rates of sediment infill in a downstream reservoir, determined by bathymetric profiling and analysis of sediment cores. Together with hydrometric data, this dataset provides the basic parameters for modeling sediment transport in the Min Jiang river system after the Wenchuan earthquake and promises insight into the mechanisms controlling post-earthquake sediment transport.\n",

Shear wave splitting of SK(K)S phases is often used as a common tool to evaluate upper mantle anisotropy. However, splitting of these phases can also constrain anisotropy in the lowermost mantle. SK(K)S phases have paths through lowermost mantle that are more vertical (incidence angles of ~30°–55°), potentially providing different sampling of D″ anisotropy and a different pattern of the anisotropic geometry than only using S, ScS, or Sdiff phases. Here we report observations of SKS–SKKS splitting measurements observed at10 stations (GSN network)in South America that sample D″ beneath Southeastern Pacific Ocean. About 10% of these show significantly different splitting between the two phases, which likely reflects a contribution from lowermost mantle anisotropy. Phases that have sampled the boundary of the Pacific large low shear velocity province (LLSVP) exhibit quite different splitting . Our results can be explained by deformation concentrations discrepancies of D″ region just outside the LLSVP boundary and its interior.",

            "abstract": "Recent seismic tomography studies indicate that some of the subducting slabs stagnate at the mantle transition zone. Subducting slabs generally comprise lithological layers of sediments, mid-ocean ridge basalt and peridotite. Some amount of water is believed to exist as hydrous minerals in sediments. Therefore, it is essential to understand the effect of hydrous minerals in sediments on global circulation of hydrogen in deep earth. Many hydrous minerals are not stable under the pressure-temperature conditions of the lower mantle. However, recent studies show that δ-AlOOH, which exists in a sediment layer of subducting slabs below 600 km depth, is stable up to the base of the lowermost mantle. This phase is a possible carrier and reservoir of water in cold slabs subducting into the deep mantle. We have conducted high pressure acoustic wave velocity measurements of δ-AlOOH using Brillouin spectroscopy and also we explored the chemical bonding of δ-AlOOH by Raman spectroscopy at high pressure in a diamond anvil cell up to 134 GPa. The result shows that δ-AlOOH becomes harder at pressures above 6 GPa due to the hydrogen bonding symmetrization and has a higher VS compared to those of the major minerals in the transition zone, such as wadsleyite, ringwoodite, and majorite. Therefore, the existence of δ-AlOOH phase might account for the positive Vs anomaly at 600 km depth beneath northwest Pacific subduction zone. In some stagnated slabs, VS at 600 km depth is 2 % faster than that of PREM. If sediments stagnate in the transition zone, the positive Vs anomaly at 600 km depth would be accounted for by the stagnated sediments containing δ-AlOOH in the transition zone.",

We first infer the TWS change from the monthly gravity field change in the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). We then estimate the stress change at the Earth’s surface caused by elastic loading of mass change associated with the inferred TWS change.The monthly spherical harmonics of the GRACE gravity solutions are processed using a decorrelation filter and Gaussian smoothing, to suppress the noise in high degree and order, following the approach of Swenson and Wahr [2006] and Chen et al. [2007]. The gravity variation associated with the glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is further removed from the GRACE solutions based on a geodynamical model by Paulson et al. [2007]. The inferred TWS changes exhibit a trend of increase from 2003 to 2013 in Amazon basin, southern Africa, the northern United State America (USA) and Queen Maud Land of Antarctica, and a trend of decrease in the same period in central Argentina, southern Chile, northern India, northern Iran, Alaska of the USA, Greenland and Marie Byrd Land of Antarctica.Surface stress variation due to the TWS loading is calculated, assuming an incompressible and self-gravitating Earth, with an elastic crust and a viscoelastic mantle overlying an inviscid core based on PREM model. We will present the geographical distribution of the stress variation caused by the TWS loading and discuss its possible implications.\nChen, J. L., C. R. Wilson, B. D. Tapley, and S.

            "abstract": "Throughout its orbital mission, the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft has detected energetic electrons at Mercury. The electrons have been measured by the Energetic Particle Spectrometer (EPS) component of the Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer (EPPS). Fewer but related bursts of hard X-rays measured by the sensors of the Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer (GRNS) on the MESSENGER spacecraft are identified as bremsstrahlung from these electron events produced within the sensors of these instruments. Following failure of the GRS cryogenic cooler required for measurement of gamma-rays of planetary origin, the GRS anticoincidence shield (ACS) of borated plastic has remained fully functional and able to detect neutrons and energetic electron (EE) events. Intensity, but not energy information, is now routinely obtained at a 10-ms cadence, compared with the 600-ms temporal resolution of the energetic particle detector on Mariner 10. Similar data, but at a slower cadence, also are provided by the scintillators of MESSENGER’s Neutron Spectrometer (NS). The X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) on MESSENGER makes regular observations of photons produced by the impingement onto its detectors of low-energy (~10 keV) electrons and hence provides the primary measure of this lower-energy suprathermal electron population at Mercury. The accumulating data of the EPS, XRS, GRS ACS, and NS continue to show that these suprathermal electrons are persistent at all longitudes and that a substantial fraction are found in the dawn sector. As Mercury’s orbit continues to evolve as a result of solar gravitational perturbations, this instrument suite will continue to probe the spatial and temporal structure of these events in magnetospheric regions not yet sampled. Combined with the magnetic field model of the planet, these additional measurements will constrain further the sources and energization mechanism of these energetic electrons.",

            "abstract": "Segregation of residual melt from partially crystallized magmas is a process of paramount importance for the chemical evolution of magmas and the construction of reservoirs of potentially eruptible magma. In this study we investigate the Takidani pluton, one of the youngest exposed plutons on Earth (∼1Ma). This chemically zoned magmatic body is located within the active Norikura Volcanic Chain in the Northern Japan Alps and associated with large dacitic to rhyolitic deposits (Nyukawa Pyroclastic Flow Deposit and Ebisutoge-Fukuda tephra). Our study focuses on the physical processes responsible for the extraction of residual melt from a crystallizing magma and the construction of the subvolcanic reservoirs that fed large silicic eruptions. Detailed structural mapping and sampling along four transects from the base to the top of the pluton were carried out along with a magnetic susceptibility survey. Our preliminary results indicate that the pluton was assembled by multiple intrusions. The pluton can be broadly separated into three distinct lithological units: 1) fine grained granite; 2) equigranular granodiorite that locally grades into either porphyritic granodiorite or granite towards the roof of the intrusion; and 3) mafic granodiorite. Units 1) and 2) form the core of the intrusion and together represent about 70% of the total volume of the pluton. Our results show that the equigranular granodiorite is internally inhomogeneous with felsic lenses of lower magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic susceptibility decreases gradually towards the roof of the pluton reaching its lowest value within leucrocratic porphyritic units. Higher magnetic susceptibility values at the contact with the roof correspond to a slightly more mafic porphyritic unit. Melt segregation and evolution of the Takidani Granodiorite are being further investigated using bulk rock and mineral chemistry (EMPA and LA-ICP-MS) together with anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility.",

Contact discontinuities are discontinuities with continuous magnetic fields but without plasma flows across a plasma density jump. Contact discontinuities are characterized by a remarkable plasma density jump but identical plasma bulk velocity, magnetic fields and thermal pressure on two sides of the discontinuity. Contact discontinuities are rarely observed in the nature. Due to a rapid diffusion of plasma along the continuous magnetic field lines across its surface, it is believed that contact discontinuities will rapidly broaden into a smooth transition then lose its identity. In this presentation, we study the effect of the orientation of magnetic field lines on the diffusion of plasma in contact discontinuities. With respect to the normal of a contact discontinuity, the cases of orientation of (1) parallel, (2) quasi-parallel, (3) perpendicular and (4) quasi-perpendicular magnetic fields are studied.",

We suggest the potential impact of the changes in information technologies such as mobile service and data fusion, and big data on GEBCO maps based. Less cost and high performance in data service will stimulate more information service; therefore it is necessary to have more customer-oriented manipulation on the data. By inquiring questionnaire, we can draw the potential needs on GEBCO products in various aspects: such as education, accessibility. The gap between experts and non-experts will decrease by digital service from the private and public organizations such as international academic societies since research funds and policies tend to pursue “openness” and “interoperability” among the domains.

The volcanic ash algorithms, such as those proposed by NOAA/NESDIS and by EUMETSAT, are based on the infrared absorption properties of the ash particles, and the refractive index of a typical volcanic rock (i.e. andesite) has been used in the forward radiative transfer calculations. Because of a variety of the absorption properties for real volcanic ash particles at infrared wavelengths (9-13 micron), a large retrieval error may occur if the refractive index of the observed ash particles was different from that assumed in the retrieval algorithm.\nSatellite infrared sounder provides spectral information for the volcanic ash clouds. If we can estimate the refractive index of the ash particles from the infrared sounder data, a dataset of the optical properties for similar rock type of the volcanic ash can be prepared for the ash retrieval algorithms of geostationary/polar-orbiting satellites in advance. Furthermore, the estimated refractive index can be used for a diagnostic and a correction of the ash particle model in the retrieval algorithm within a period of the volcanic activities.\nIn this work, optimal estimation of the volcanic ash parameters was conducted through the radiative transfer calculations for the window channels of the atmospheric infrared sounder (AIRS). The estimated refractive indices are proposed for the volcanic ash particles of some eruption events.",

            "abstract": "In two-phase flow in porous media only fractions of the resident fluid are mobilised during a displacement process and, in general, a significant amount of the resident fluid remains permanently trapped. Depending on the application, entrapment is desirable (geological carbon storage), or it should be obviated (enhanced oil recovery, contaminant remediation). Despite its utmost importance for these applications, predictions of trapped fluid saturations for macroscopic systems, in particular under changing displacement conditions, remain challenging. The models that aim to represent trapping phenomena are typically empirical and require tracking of the history of the state variables. This exacerbates the experimental verification and the design of sophisticated displacement technologies that enhance or impede trapping. Recently, experiments [1] have suggested that a macroscopic normalized Euler number, quantifying the topology of fluid distributions, could serve as a parameter to predict residual saturations based on state variables. In these experiments the entrapment of fluids was visualised through 3D micro CT imaging. However, the experiments are notoriously time consuming and therefore only allow for a sparse sampling of the parameter space.\nPore-network models represent porous media through an equivalent network structure of pores and throats. Under quasi-static capillary dominated conditions displacement processes can be modeled through simple invasion percolation rules. Hence, in contrast to experiments, pore-network models are fast and therefore allow full sampling of the parameter space.\nHere, we use pore-network modeling [2] to critically investigate the knowledge gained through observing and tracking the normalized Euler number. More specifically, we identify conditions under which (a) systems with the same saturations but different normalized Euler numbers lead to different residual saturations and (b) systems with the same saturations and the same normalized Euler numbers but different process histories yield the same residual saturations. Special attention is given to contact angle and process histories with varying drainage and imbibition periods.\n[1] Herring et al., Adv. Water.

            "abstract": "Carbon is a key element for life. One of the most interesting forms of carbon is methane, as it is both consumed and produced by microorganisms. Methane has also several possible ways of abiotic origin, some of which could provide understanding of the origin of life itself. The study of methane is thus important in order to understand deep subsurface ecosystems such as those found in the 2516 m deep Outokumpu Deep Drill Hole within the Precambrian Fennoscandian Shield in eastern Finland. There rock types differ from graphite-bearing mica schist and black schist to serpentinite and pegmatitic granodiorite and saline, gas-rich water, with up to 32 mmol l-1 of methane, and residence times of tens of millions of years occupies the fracture zones which host diverse microbial life, including methanogenic archaea. In order to understand methane systematics in crystalline bedrock, we analysed several forms of carbon, including dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), methane and ethane from the Outokumpu Deep Drill Hole for their isotopic composition. In addition, isotopic compositions of water and hydrogen were determined. The results show that hydrogen is in isotopic equilibrium in the system H2O-H2-CH4 at ambient temperatures, which could either indicate equilibration due to long residence time or relatively recent production of methane in situ. Therefore hydrogen is not a very useful indicator for the origin of methane in this case. Carbon isotope analysis shows that both methane and DIC becomes generally more enriched in 13C with depth, which could indicate higher amounts of microbial methane in the upper part of the bedrock. Based on carbon isotope composition, two types of ethane can be discerned. Taken all the evidence together, this leads us to suggest that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the methane production in Outokumpu: 1) Biotic which comprise most of methane and 2) abiotic which dominates in the deeper parts of the bedrock. The former type may include both thermogenic and microbial methane as evidenced by the presence of graphitic rocks and methanogens, respectively.",

This earthquake is considered as an induced earthquake of the 2011 March great Tohoku earthquake (M9.0). To reveal subsurface structure around the faults from several ten meters to a few kilometers in depth, we conducted seismic surveys along four lines which cross the Itozawa fault (line1), Yunodake fault (line2) and inferred extension area of the Yunodake fault (line3). In line1, the CMP stacked time section is relatively more reflective in the east side of the surface fault and lacks continuous reflectors in the west side of it between 0.3s and 1.5s in two way time. In deeper part, amplitude of reflectors decreases below 7km in depth. In line2, a sedimentary basin is well imaged in the area of Tertiary and Quaternary sediments. The top of the basement shows complicated shape and reaches 700m in depth. The velocity structure by a ray tomography technique corresponds very well to the sedimentary structure by the reflection survey. In line3, the basement is 500m deep at the southern edge, almost flat and gently dips at two parts and is 800m deep at the northern edge. The sediments gently dip northward. Large stratigraphic throws are not perceived on the line3 seismic section. Line 4 crosses the Itozawa fault and the target depth is from near surface to about 30m. In line4, very strong and continuous reflector is imaged down to 20m in depth and it is interpreted as the top of the metamorphic rock. Several faults are interpreted from the step-like structure of the reflectors near the surface fault.",

For the emergence of life, primordial Earth has to evolve with the following conditions. 1) Primordial Earth was formed without an atmosphere and ocean components where ultra-reductive materials such as Fe3P were formed. 2) At about 4.4Ga, atmosphere and ocean components were delivered to the Earth through heavy bombardment of asteroid bodies. 3) Direct reaction between komatiite and primordial atmosphere, associated with pseudo-plate tectonics, fixed atmospheric CO2 into the crust, which resulted in decreased density of atmospheric CO2; because of this, a primordial ocean appeared, and the Earth did not become a burning planet like Venus. 4) The primordial ocean was too toxic because of high salinity, ultra acidity, and high concentrations of heavy metal elements. 5) It was impossible to bear life in such a toxic ocean. However, the mass of the primordial ocean was small, e.g. only 3-5km depth, which enabled a landmass to appear on Hadean Earth. The surface environment was highly diversified with numerous lakes and river systems interacting with the landmass (i.e., primordial continent), providing varied and dynamic conditions (ultra-reductive to acidic environment) where prebiotic chemical evolution progressed. 6) On the other hand, plate tectonics started once the primordial ocean was formed. Due to the chemical reaction between the rocks and ocean, the toxic ocean gradually neutralized.\n Considering these tight conditions towards the emergence of life, the birth of life progressed on the tightrope of the Hadean Earth.",

            "abstract": "Seismicity along the subducting plate interface shows a regional variation, in which large earthquakes occur repeatedly at the strongly coupled patches that are surrounded by weakly coupled regions. This model suggests that the subduction plate interface is heterogeneous in terms of frictional properties; however, mechanism making the difference in strong and weak coupling is still not well understood. We consider this difference to relate to the alternation of plate interface due to aqueous fluids that result in the spatial distribution of clay minerals. In order to test this hypothesis, we measured frictional healing of clay minerals and discuss whether the frictional properties of clays can account for the weakly coupled non-asperity regions in the subducting plate interface.\nWe carried out a series of slide-hold-slide frictional experiments to examine the time-dependent frictional restrengthening of the simulated fault gouge. In the experiments, the axial loading was interrupted for periods ranging 10 to 3000 s after steady-state friction, and we measured the difference between the steady-state friction and the peak friction after each holding period. The preliminary results show that the frictional strength of clay minerals (saponite, illite and chlorite) slightly increases with holding time; however, the healing rate is significantly smaller than that of dry silicates such as quartz. Similar weak healing rate has been reported in the serpentinized simulated faults (Katayama et al. 2013). These experimental results suggest that the recovery of fault strength is different in materials, in which clay minerals show weak and slow recovery whereas dry materials show relatively quick and thereby strong coupling on the fault surface. Aqueous fluids that are released from the descending plate may change the mineralogy on the plate interface where clay minerals become dominant at the channel of fluid flow surrounding the unaltered dry patches that potentially act as a seismic asperity. Thus, the heterogeneous fluid pathway and spatial distribution of clay minerals may play a key role for the formation of asperity and non-asperity on the subducting plate interface.",

Therefore, understanding temperature dependency of the solute transport characteristics is essential to accurately assess environmental risks due to increased subsurface temperature. In this study, one-dimensional solute transport experiments were conducted in soil columns under temperature control to investigate effects of temperature on solute transport parameters, such as solute dispersion and diffusion coefficients, hydraulic conductivity, and retardation factor. Toyoura sand, Kaolin clay, and intact loamy soils were used in the experiments. Intact loamy soils were taken during a deep well boring at the Arakawa Lowland in Saitama Prefecture, Japan. In the transport experiments, the core sample with 5-cm diameter and 4-cm height was first isotropically consolidated, whereafter 0.01M KCl solution was injected to the sample from the bottom. The concentrations of K+ and Cl- in the effluents were analyzed by an ion chromatograph to obtain solute breakthrough curves. The solute transport parameters were calculated from the breakthrough curves. The experiments were conducted under different temperature conditions (15, 25, and 40 oC). The retardation factor for the intact loamy soils decreased with increasing temperature, while water permeability increased due to reduced viscosity of water at higher temperature. Opposite, the effect of temperature on solute dispersivity for the intact loamy soils was insignificant. The effects of soil texture on the temperature dependency of the solute transport characteristics will be further investigated from comparison of results from differently-textured samples.",

Moreover, it is demonstrated that it was metasomatized in the mantle wedge during the emplacement. We studied the detail of deformation history of the Finero phlogopite peridotite during the exhumation from the upper mantle through microstructural observation mainly with optical and electron microscopy, namely SEM/EBSD and TEM.\nThe summary of our microstructural observation is described as follows. The peridotite was originally deformed by dislocation creep with [100](010) olivine slip system, which is a general one for the upper mantle. The porphyroclastic texture was formed during this process. Subsequently, while deformation by dislocation creep was still proceeding, the active slip system of olivine changed to [100]{0kl}, which is known as a dominant system at higher stress condition. The change of slip system was probably caused by temperature reduction during ascent of the peridotite. Then, the fluid infiltration triggered the brittle deformation of the peridotite. The complex undulatory extinction observed in olivine grains due to high dislocation tangling should be created during this process under extremely high stress condition. The recrystallization of these olivine grains is characteristic. The driving force of the recrystallization might be the elastic strain energy introduced by high dislocation tangling. These recrystallized olivine grains make LPO with [100](001), which is a dominant system under wet condition.

            "abstract": "The aim of this PhD thesis is to assess the influence of inherited structures and heterogeneities on the architecture and tectonic evolution of hyper-extended rift systems, with special focus on the North Atlantic. We propose a new mapping approach using simple and robust observation-based criteria to identify key features of rift systems, namely: 1) structural elements of rift domains; 2) age of the major rift events; and 3) key structures and heterogeneities inherited from previous orogenic phases.\nWe distinguish between 3 major rift domains: 1) the not or barely thinned proximal domain; 2) the unequivocal oceanic domain characterized by steady-state seafloor spreading; and, between them 3) the hyper-extended domain concentrating most of the deformation using gravity, magnetic and reflection and refraction seismic data. Previous studies mapped these domains along the magma-poor Iberia-Newfoundland and Bay of Biscay. One objective of this PhD is to extend this mapping further to the North, along the Irish, Scottish and Norwegian margins, into domains with polyphase rifting and magmatic additions.\nIn addition, we assign an age to the two most important events in the development of rifted margins, namely the necking and the breakup. This approach requires us to determine how these two events are recorded in the stratigraphy and how they can be mapped in seismic sections.\nIn order to highlight potential links between both rift domain architecture and timing of rifting and orogenic inheritance we map the structures and heterogeneities inherited from previous collision events that may have influenced significantly subsequent rifting. We consider features that: 1) are important enough to have had a potential impact on subsequent deformation; 2) are preserved through time; and 3) bear the potential to be reactivated.\nBased on these data, we try to link the architecture and evolution of the North Atlantic rift system with the nature and in-depth location of weak features initially present within the lithosphere in the light of minimal numerical modelling experiments and use these results as a basis for designing more comprehensive numerical models for the North Atlantic rifting.",

Understanding its dynamics is of fundamental importance, given its major role in the carbon cycle and, hence, in the global climate system.\nThe first sub-mesoscale-resolving (1/80°) model of the Kerguelen Plateau Region, located in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, has been implemented. The model resolves sub-mesoscale filamentary structures and shows patchiness in the sub-mesoscale eddy kinetic energy and vertical velocities. The vertical velocities, which are dramatically higher than in mesoscale-resolving models, strongly enhance the vertical exchange of advected Lagrangian particles. Furthermore, we find evidence that the patchiness in the sub-mesoscale fields is related to the topographic features present in this location and that the topography indirectly generates these sub-mesoscale structures.\nWe conclude that in the Southern Ocean, with its low stratification and high eddy kinetic energy, the sub-mesoscales might provide a fundamental and new mechanism for vertical transport in this region.",

            "abstract": "In this work we highlight the importance of model error assessment in physical model calibration studies. Conventional calibration methods often assume the model is perfect and account for data noise only. Consequently, the estimated parameters typically have biased values that implicitly compensate for model deficiencies. Moreover, improving the amount and the quality of data may not improve the parameter estimates since the model discrepancy is not accounted for. In state-of-the-art methods model discrepancy is explicitly accounted for by enhancing the physical model with a synthetic statistical additive term, which allows appropriate parameter estimates. However, these statistical additive terms do not increase the predictive capability of the model because they are tuned for particular output observables and may even violate physical constraints.\nWe introduce a framework in which model errors are captured by allowing variability in specific model components and parameterizations for the purpose of achieving meaningful predictions that are both consistent with the data spread and appropriately disambiguate model and data errors. Here we cast model parameters as random variables, embedding the calibration problem within a density estimation framework. Further, we calibrate for the parameters of the joint input density. The likelihood function for the associated inverse problem is degenerate, therefore we use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to build prediction-constraining likelihoods and illustrate the strengths of the method on synthetic cases. We also apply the ABC-enhanced density estimation to the TransCom 3 CO2 intercomparison study (Gurney, K. R., et al., Tellus, 55B, pp. 555–579, 2003) and calibrate 15 transport models for regional carbon sources and sinks given atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements.",

            "abstract": "Hydroxylamine (HA) as a crucial intermediate in the microbial oxidation of ammonium to nitrite (nitrification) is a potential precursor of abiotic N2O formation in the soil. However, the determination of HA concentration in natural soil samples has not been reported until now. Here, we determined the HA concentrations in organic (Oh) and mineral (Ah) layers of 135 soil samples collected from a spruce forest (Wüstebach, Eifel National Park, Germany) using a novel approach, based on the fast extraction of HA from the soil at a pH of 1.7, the oxidation of HA to N2O with Fe3+, and the analysis of produced N2O using gas chromatography (GC). Meanwhile, N2O emission rates were determined by means of aerobic laboratory incubations of 3-g soil in 22-mL vials. Subsequently, the spatial distribution of soil HA concentrations and N2O emission rates in the Oh and Ah layers of the whole sampling area were analyzed using a geostatistical approach. The correlations among soil HA, N2O emission rate, pH, soil C, N, Fe, Mn and soil water content (SWC) were further explored. The HA concentrations ranged from 0.3–44.6 μg N kg-1 dry soil and 0.02–16.2 μg N kg-1 dry soil in the Oh and the Ah layer, respectively. The spatial distribution of HA was similar in both layers, with substantial spatial variability dependent on soil type, tree density and distance to a stream. For example, HA concentration was greater at locations with a thick litter layer or at locations close to the stream. The average N2O emission rate in the Oh layer was 0.38 μg N kg-1 dry soil h-1, 10-fold larger than in the Ah layer. Interestingly, N2O emission rate exhibited high correlation with soil HA content in the Oh (R2 = 0.65, p < 0.01) and Ah (R2 = 0.45, p < 0.05) layer. The results demonstrated that HA is a crucial component for aerobic N2O formation and emission in spruce forest soils. Moreover, HA concentration was negatively correlated with pH and positively correlated with SWC in the Oh layer, while positively correlated with C and N as well as NO3- content in the Ah layer. Mn content was the most important factor for HA recovery at the specific extraction conditions. Further studies should focus on the effects of soil organic matter, Mn content, and pH on the production of N2O from HA under aerobic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Sometimes large shallow earthquakes are preceded by increased local seismic activity, known as “foreshocks”. However, the exact relationship between foreshocks and mainshock nucleation is still in debate. Several studies have found accelerating or migrating foreshock activity right before recent large earthquakes along major plate boundary faults, indicating that foreshocks are likely driven by slow-slip events. However, it is still not clear whether similar features could be observed for earthquakes that occur away from plate-boundary regions. Here we conduct a systematic detection of possible foreshock activity around the times of 6 recent large earthquakes in China. The candidate events include the 2008 Ms7.3 Yutian, Ms8.0 Wenchuan, the 2010 Ms7.0 Yushu, the 2013 Ms7.0 Lushan, the 2014 Ms7.3 Yutian, and the 2014 Ms6.5 Zhaotong earthquakes. Among them, the 2010 Yushu and 2014 Yutian mainshocks had clear evidence of M4-5 immediate foreshocks listed in regional earthquake catalogs, while the rest did not. In each case, we use waveforms of local earthquakes listed in the catalog as templates and scan through continuous waveforms recorded by both permanent and temporary seismic stations around the epicentral region of each mainshock. Our waveform matching method can detect at least a few times more events than listed in the catalog. Our initial results show a wide range of behaviors. For the 2010 Yushu and 2014 Yutian cases, the M4-5 foreshocks were followed by many smaller-size events that could be considered as their aftershocks. For the Wenchuan case, we did not observe any obvious foreshock in the immediate vicinity of the epicenter. However, we found one swarm sequence that shows systematic migration a few months before the Wenchuan mainshock. Our next step is to relocate these newly detected events to search for spatio-temporal evolutions before each mainshock, as well as performing Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) modeling to examine whether slow-slip transients may drive these foreshocks. By using these techniques, we hope to obtain a more complete picture on evolutions of seismic activities around the epicenters of recent large intra-plate earthquakes in China.",

            "abstract": "Existence of a partially molten layer at depth has been proposed to explain the lack of observed farside deep moonquakes, the observation of reflected phases from deep moonquakes, and the dissipation of tidal energy within the lunar interior. However, subsequent models explore the possibility that dissipation due to elevated temperatures alone can explain the observed dissipation factor (Q) and tidal love numbers. We have explored the hypothesis that high titanium melt compositions associated with lunar mantle overturn may sink to the base of the mantle, locally or regionally. We have performed forward calculations varying composition and thickness of layers to evaluate if a partially molten layer at the base of the mantle is well constrained by the observational data. Self-consistent physical parameters are calculated for each compositional model that are then compared against the observed data to determine a subset of permissible models. The data constraints considered by this study include bulk density, moment of inertia, real and imaginary parts of the Love numbers, seismic travel times, and electrical conductivity. Dynamic calculations using ASPECT have also been considered to determine the implications of early lunar mantle convection for the survivability of the partially molten layer. Finally, and as a perspective for a future NASA New Frontiers Geophysical Network, we present 1D synthetic seismograms calculated for each proposed structure of the Moon to investigate the future seismological resolution of these deep lunar structure features.

EMIC rising tone emissions have recently attracted much attention because of their strong nonlinear interaction with energetic particles in the inner magnetosphere. We investigate two typical cases in detail, one case with a continuous single rising tone and the other characterized by a patchy emission with a broadband frequency. The degree of polarization of each sub-packet is generally higher than 0.8 with a left-handed polarization, and the wave direction of the sub-packets is typically field-aligned. We find that the observed frequency sweep rates and amplitude growth rates are consistent with estimations based on nonlinear wave growth theory. In addition, we compare the observed time duration of each sub-packet structure with the theoretical trapping time for second-order cyclotron resonance. These show reasonable agreement, indicating that individual sub-packet elements are continually generated through a triggering process which generates an element with the theoretically predicted optimum amplitude.",

The benthic community change was temporal and minimum in the IDI (In-direct Influence) area located outside the barrage.\nDuring PC stage, the species number and density tended to increase in DI, but they rapidly decreased during CC stage. They increased again during S stage in DI but the most of the species were composed of opportunistic species indicating a deteriorated environment. In IDI, the species number and density also increased during PC stage and decreased during CC stage, but unlike DI, the increase of species number and density in S stage was not observed. In DI area, the benthic community structure had changed due to hypoxia, desalination and landization after CC stage, and the opportunistic species like Theora fragilis, Tharyx sp., Heteromastus filiformis had dominated after S-stage. In IDI area, however, abrupt environmental changes had not appeared and species number and density had been constant and species composition did not change even after the CC stage.",

The air and surface water was sampled in Nakdong Estuary where the barrage had been constructed, and methane concentrations were measured using Gas Chromatography. To see the influence of the barrage, surface water was sampled outside and inside the barrage respectively. In the expectation that methane distribution would be different depending on the tides, surface water outside the barrage was collected at high and low tide respectively. Headspace technique and Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry were also used. The average atmospheric concentration (1.82ppm) was lower than the global average concentration expected from the IPCC scenario. The concentrations of water inside the barrage (average 173nM) were similar to those measured in other rivers but in the lower side. The average concentrations outside the barrage (52nM at high tide, 85nM at low tide) were lower than those measured in other coastal areas, but of the same order of magnitude as the European tidal estuaries. Methane concentrations in Nakdong estuary were higher than the methane concentration equilibrated with the atmosphere. The spatial variability of methane concentration in Nakdong estuary seems to be the result of the fresh (high methane) and sea (low methane) water mixing. Meanwhile large tidal flat area in Nakdong estuary should play a major role in methane dynamics and methane flux measurements during sediment incubation were conducted to evaluate the immersion/emersion cycle and photosynthesis by MPB (micro phyto benthos) effect.

            "abstract": "Recent upgrades to operational radar rainfall products in terms of quality and resolution call for re-examination of the factors that contribute to the uncertainty of radar rainfall estimation. Remapping or gridding of radar polar observations onto Cartesian coordinates is implemented using various methods, and is often applied when radar estimates are compared against rain gauge observations, in hydrologic applications, or for merging data from different radars. However, assuming perfect radar observations, many of the widely used remapping methodologies do not conserve mass for the rainfall rate field. Research has suggested that optimal remapping should select all polar bins falling within or intersecting a Cartesian grid and assign them weights based on the proportion of each individual bin’s area falling within the grid. However, to reduce computational demand practitioners use a variety of approximate remapping approaches. The most popular approximate approaches used are those based on extracting information from radar bins whose centers fall within a certain distance from the center of the Cartesian grid. This paper introduces a mass-conserving method for remapping, which we call “precise remapping”, and evaluates it by comparing against two other commonly used remapping methods based on areal weighting and distance. Results show that the choice of the remapping method can lead to large errors in grid-averaged rainfall accumulations.",

            "abstract": "Downward longwave radiation is important factor to affect climate change. In polar regions, estimation of the radiative effect of cloud on the downward longwave radiation has large uncertainty. Relatively large cloud effect to the radiation occurs there due to low temperature, small amount of water vapor, and strong inversion layer. The cloud effect is, however, not evaluated sufficiently because the long term polar night and high surface albedo make satellite retrieval difficult. The intent of the present study is to quantify cloud radiative effect for downward longwave radiation in the polar regions by in-situ observation and radiative transfer calculation.\nThe observation sites in this study are Ny-Ålesund (NYA), Syowa (SYO), and South Pole (SPO). These stations belong to the Baseline Surface Radiation Network. The period of data analysis is from 2003 to 2012. The effect of cloud on the downward longwave radiation is evaluated by subtraction of calculated downward longwave radiation under clear-sky condition from observed value under all-sky condition. Radiative transfer model was used for the evaluation of clear sky radiation with vertical temperature and humidity profile obtained by radiosonde observations. Calculated result shows good correlation with observation under clear-sky condition. The RMSE is +0.83±5.0.\nThe cloud effect varied from −10 - +110 W/m2 (−10 - +40 %). Cloud effect increased with increasing of cloud fraction and decreasing of cloud base height and precipitable water. In SYO negative effects were sometimes obtained. The negative cloud effect emerged under dry and temperature inversion condition lower than 2 km. One of reasons of negative effect is considered to be existence of cloud at temperature inversion altitude. When the cloud effect is smaller than −5 W/m2 (standard deviation between calculation and observation), 50 % of them have a condition with cloud base height estimated by micro pulse lidar lower than 2 km.",

            "abstract": "Japan Sea (JPS) is connected to other seas by five narrow and shallow straits with a minimal depth of the order of 100 meters or less, resulting in limited water exchange thereby isolating the water and aquatic ecosystem. The modeling and observational studies on quantifying the dynamics of JPS are still undergoing (e.g., Hirose et al., 2007), whereas effects of submesoscale dynamics on the mean structure, eddies, and material dispersal in JPS have not been extensively investigated yet. In the present study, we conduct a detailed oceanic downscaling numerical experiment using ROMS in a double nested configuration bounded on the assimilative JCOPE2 (Miyazawa et al., 2009) reanalysis at horizontal resolutions of 3 km (ROMS-L1) and 1 km (ROMS-L2).\nThe L1 and L2 models are compared to the observed data to show a good agreement with an appropriate parameter choice. Our models sufficiently reproduce the overall frontal structure and associated major currents in JPS consisting of the Liman Cold Current along the Russian coast and the Tsushima Warm Current along the Japanese coast. Surface normalized relative vorticity fields demonstrate that both the mesoscale and submesoscale eddies are apparently enhanced, as the model grid resolution is finer. In summer and fall, mesoscale eddies are evident in L1 and L2. In contrast in winter and spring, submesoscale eddies are significantly energized in the whole JPS particularly in L2 due to the surface cooling that preconditions symmetric instability (e.g., Thomas et al., 2012). The enhancement of EKE appears around Tsushima strait and along the Korean Peninsula in L1, while EKE in L2 is extensively increased in the most part of the southern JPS. On the other hand, a SSH variance, a proxy of mesoscale variability, is more realistically distributed in L2 than L1, suggesting a potential importance of submesoscale eddies on the mesoscale dynamics.",

            "abstract": "We describe two slow slip events observed using seafloor instruments at the northern Hikurangi margin, New Zealand. These transient deformation events were observed using ocean bottom pressure recorders (OBPR) as well as an onshore GPS network in 2013. The four OBPRs were deployed for over one year, from March 2013 to May 2014. Data from only two OBPRs are available as the other two instruments had trouble with their data loggers. One of the available OBPRs was installed on the incoming Pacific Plate near the trench. The other was installed approximately 40 km away from the trench on the Australian Plate, landward of the Hikurangi Trough, approximately 6 km above the plate interface. To remove tidal and oceanographic noise from the raw ocean bottom pressure data, we use the incoming plate site as a reference site to remove the oceanographic noise, which is largely common mode over such a small region. The first slow slip event was observed in July 2013, and produced up to 2 cm eastward displacement at onshore GPS sites over a period of 2-3 weeks. Crustal deformation observed by the OBPRs involved 16 mm of uplift during the slow slip event observed by the cGPS sites, followed by a subsequent subsidence over the following weeks. This suggests that the slow slip event initiated beneath the coastline and the rupture propagated seaward over ~3 weeks. We expect that large slip probably occurred near the trench in the later stages of the slow slip event. A second slow slip event was observed at onshore cGPS and the landward seafloor bottom pressure recorder in October 2013. The October SSE produced 36 mm total uplift at the OBPR. This suggests that in the offshore region, most of the slow slip in the October 2013 event was focused beneath the OBPR, and did not migrate trenchward significantly. Our results demonstrate the value of seafloor pressure observations to investigate slow slip events at offshore subduction margins.",

These megascale processes on the western margin of South America directly influenced climate, drainages patterns and biodiversity across the continent and reached into the Atlantic Ocean. Here we highlight the most recent models that explain the relation between mantle and lithospheric processes with the geological, paleontological, and biodiversity records both in continental Amazonia and its marine extent, the Amazon deep-sea fan. New evidence on the geochemical signature of Neogene deposits in Amazonia, underpins increased influence of the Andes on drainage patterns from the Middle Miocene onwards. Furthermore, new records from the Amazon deep-sea fan illustrate the transcontinental effect of mountain building and climate change on sedimentation patterns and marine environmental changes in the Atlantic Ocean from the Late Miocene onwards. The case of the Andes-Amazonian sedimentary and biological system serves as a good example for similar tectono-sedimentary systems around the world and can encourage scientists from both geological and biological communities towards integrated research.",

We will extend our analysis to the complete Antarctic continent, paying special attention to unavoidable leakage effects between basins, and glacial isotactic adjustment and its uncertainty. In addition, it is known that the gravitational flattening coefficient is better determined from satellite laser ranging (SLR) than from GRACE. The GRACE C20 coefficients are therefore routinely replaced by those from SLR. We will show that an alternative SLR time series, using tracking data to more satellites, may give ice mass trend differences of 10 – 15 Gt/yr (in the order of 13% of the total signal) compared with the commonly applied SLR time series. With data of the CryoSat-2 radar altimeter mission Antarctic ice sheet elevation changes can be determined, which can be converted to mass changes. GRACE/GOCE and CryoSat-2 ice mass trends will be compared and the possible cause of differences will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "InSAR phase signals are affected by the Earth's atmosphere like those of the GNSS. Therefore, InSAR can detect water vapor distribution with unprecedented spatial resolution if there are neither surface deformation signals or other errors, and thus is potentially useful for meteorological applications. However, there has been only a few studies using InSAR as a water vapor sensor (e.g. Hanssen et al., 1999, Kinoshita et al., 2013).\nWe reported six case studies that detected localized water vapor signals with InSAR based on ALOS/PALSAR data (Kinoshita et al., JpGU 2013), some of which reached over 20 cm in the LOS direction within 10 km2. Each signal located at the very location of high rainfall intensity in the weather radar data. Such localized signals strongly suggest the existence of developed convective systems at the SAR observation time.\nTo investigate the mechanism of the localized delay signals in the interferogram, we performed the WRF simulation in the case of Niigata on 25 August 2010. We used the JMA MSM data and the NCEP high-resolution SST data as the initial values. Two nested domains were used and horizontal resolutions of them were 3 km and 1 km, respectively. The WRF simulation could reproduce the convective system that extended east and west, and the shape of the reproduced convective system was similar to the localized signals in the interferogram, whereas the location of the reproduced convective system was about 30 km north of that of observed signals.\nTo improve the location of the reproduced convective system, we performed the 4DVAR experiment implemented in the WRF data assimilation model. In this study, we assimilated zenith total delay data derived from the Japanese GNSS network, GEONET. Due to the limitation of the computational resource, we performed the 4DVAR data assimilation in the coarser domain (10 km) and then we downscaled the assimilated initial value to the finer domain (2.5 km). The simulation with the assimilation could reproduce the convective system whose shape and amplitude were similar to the observed signals in the interferogram. In addition, the location of the strong signals was improved slightly in comparison with that without the assimilation.\nAt the presentation, we will show results from numerical simulations with and without data assimilation, and discuss them.",

            "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate three methods for the determination of sulfur species in volcanic gases using an artificial fumarole. Among three methods, both cadmium sulfide and silver sulfide precipitation methods utilized the NaOH solutions containing Cd2+ and Ag+, respectively, in pre-evacuated bottles. Sulfur gases (H2S + SO2) from the artificial fumarole were dissolved into the NaOH solutions, and then H2S reacted with either Cd2+ or Ag+ to precipitate as CdS and Ag2S. Subsequently, the alkaline solutions were filtered to separate the precipitates from the solution. While the filtrate was analyzed on an ion chromatograph (IC) for SO2 concentrations, the precipitate was oxidized by H2O2 solutions and analyzed on an IC for H2S concentrations. In the third method (the iodine method), KI-KIO3 solutions in falcon tubes were employed in addition to NaOH solutions in pre-evacuated bottles. Once sulfur gases were collected by the NaOH solution, they were also sampled into the KI-KIO3 solution. In the iodine solution, H2S was oxidized and precipitated as elemental sulfur, whereas SO2 was dissolved as sulfate. Once both sampling were done, the total sulfur in the NaOH solution was determined on an IC. The KI-KIO3 solution was centrifuged to separate elemental sulfur from the solution. Following the oxidation of elemental sulfur into sulfate, the resultant solution was analyzed on an IC for H2S concentrations. For all methods, the H2S concentrations determined from the fumarolic gases at low H2S flow rates were lower than expected. Notably, the H2S concentrations determined by silver sulfide precipitation method were lower than those by cadmium sulfide precipitation method. This is because Ag2S(s) is more soluble than CdS(s) under our experimental conditions. Also, the H2S determination by cadmium sulfide precipitation led to the similar results to the iodine method. However, the measured SO2 concentrations from the fumarolic gases were in good agreement with the expected ones.",

The most realistic way to model Antarctic ice streams is to resolve the full Stokes (FS) problem, but its cost prohibits the studies of large area and long term evolution. The Shallow Stream/Shelf approximation (SSA), and its improved version where vertical shearing modify effective viscosity (SSA*) have shown to be remarkably consistent with the FS solution on the particular case of the MISMIP3d setup.\nHere, we investigate for a much larger range in which conditions the SSA* remains a valuable alternative to FS.\nWe use the Elmer/Ice model, originally a FS model in with which the SSA and SSA* have been implemented. We can thus, within a single framework, compare the three equations: the FS, the SSA and its improved version the SSA*. These three equations are resolved on a large variety of synthetic glaciers with different geometries, basal shear conditions and ice viscosities. The sample tested aims to be representative of the large variety of outlet glaciers observed on the border of Antarctica ice sheet. ",

            "abstract": "Field geology provides a framework for advanced computer models and theoretical calculations of volcanic systems. Some field terrains, though, are poorly preserved or accessible, making documentation, quantification, and investigation impossible. Over 200 volcanologists at the 2012 Kona Chapman Conference on volcanology agreed that and important step forward in the field over the next 100 years should address the realistic size and shape of volcanic conduits. The 1969 Mauna Ulu eruption of Kīlauea provides a unique opportunity to document volcanic fissure conduits, thus, we have an ideal location to begin addressing this topic and provide data on these geometries. Exposed fissures can be mapped with robotics using machine vision. In order to test the hypothesis that fissures have irregularities with depth that will influence their fluid dynamical behavior, we must first map the fissure vents and shallow conduit to deci- or centimeter scale. We have designed, constructed, and field-tested the first version of a robotic device that will image an exposed volcanic fissure in three dimensions. The design phase included three steps: 1) create the payload harness and protective shell to prevent damage to the electronics and robot, 2) construct a circuit board to have the electronics communicate with a surface-based computer, and 3) prototype wheel shapes that can handle a variety of volcanic rock textures. The robot’s mechanical parts were built using 3d printing, milling, casting and laser cutting techniques, and the electronics were assembled from off the shelf components. The testing phase took place at Mauna Ulu, Kīlauea, Hawai’i, from May 5 – 9, 2014. Many valuable design lessons were learned during the week, and the first ever 3D map from inside a volcanic fissure were successfully collected. Three vents had between 25% and 95% of their internal surfaces imaged. A fourth location, a non-eruptive crack (possibly a fault line) had two transects imaging the textures of the walls with depth to compare to the fissure vents. The vent surface irregularity documented by Parcheta et al., (accepted) continues with depth into the fissure; depths are variable depending on the amount of talus filling them. We will show and discuss data from the main field vent location, and movies of descents in to the other vents.",

            "abstract": "We develop a dissipation model for solar wind turbulence at electron scales. The aim of our study is to describe observed magnetic energy spectra with a simple model to investigate the physical mechanisms of dissipation in the solar wind. The model combines the energy transport process from large to small scales and collisionless damping processes, which extract energy from the magnetic fluctuations in the kinetic regime. As damping rate, we use the imaginary part of the kinetic Alfvén wave frequency derived from an appropriate dispersion relation. We find that damping by kinetic Alfvén waves can explain observed spectral shapes in the dissipation range and leads to a quasi exponential decay. Our dissipation model exhibits an independence of the dissipation scale from the energy cascade rate, which is a remarkable difference compared to hydrodynamic turbulence. The dissipation model provides the possibility to investigate the influence of varying solar wind parameters and possibly different damping mechanisms on the dissipation range. A statistical study of modeled energy spectra shows a high correlation between the dissipation length and the electron Larmor radius.",

            "abstract": "The failure of coupled climate model ensembles to reproduce the increased Antarctic sea ice cover observed by satellites raises grave doubts about our ability to accurately predict the future of the Antarctic climate system, with important implications in the context of predicting Antarctica’s contribution to future sea level rise. While the increase in total Antarctic ice cover is within the bounds of coupled model internal variability, the spatially heterogeneous pattern of trends indicates that Antarctic sea ice may have a response to anthropogenic forcings that is not replicated by the models. A complete understanding of this discrepancy is hampered by the relatively short satellite record. In this work, 20th century sea ice reconstructions from a number of ice cores are combined to give a synthesis covering about 75% of the circumpolar region. It is found that in sectors with the biggest SAM response, late winter sea ice cover has been decreasing since the 1960s, in qualitative agreement with CMIP5 models. In the Ross Sea the observed increase in ice cover has been a occurring since the mid 1960s, when it was preceded by a sharp, decade long reduction, outside the range of simulated natural variability.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic landscape changes have dramatically altered near surface climate in many regions of the world. In particular, regional/local-scale land use change is attributed to the long-term change in observed surface air temperature through changes in surface radiation budget and energy partitioning. This study analyses the response of surface air temperature characteristics to the historical urbanization in Sapporo, a snowy city in North Japan.\nAround Sapporo, natural forest has been cleared and replaced with urban since the late 19th century. Annual mean temperature in Sapporo has increased dramatically, whose rate being approximately twice of that in the station without urbanization. The rate of temperature increase shows asymmetric feature among seasons and dependent on time of the day; a prominent warming in winter daily minimum temperature and no significant trend in summer daily maximum temperature. In order to clarify the seasonal and diurnal dependence of the response to land use change, two 27-year simulations were conducted using WRF-ARW model nudged to reanalysis data during 19872/1983 winter to 2008/2009 winter; a control run uses past land cover and a sensitivity run uses present land cover.\nThe numerical experiments successfully replicate the observed influence of urbanization with higher temperature change in winter nights and smaller temperature change in summer days. An analysis on surface energy balance indicates the changes in Bowen ratio is a primal cause of increasing sensible heat in both summer and winter. However, atmospheric response to the elevated sensible heat flux is very different depending on boundary layer structure between winter and summer or between night and day. This mechanism could clearly explain the asymmetric temperature trend observed worldwide, especially in cold regions where nocturnal inversion develops.",

            "abstract": "The Philippine Sea (PHS) plate is subducting beneath Kyusyu and a clear volcanic front is formed through the middle of the arc. However, there is a volcanic gap in the central part of Kyushu, between Aso and Kirishima volcanoes. Many studies have discussed arc magmatism in Kyushu in terms of 3D seismic velocity structure, but little is known on seismic attenuation structure. Seismic attenuation structure provides additional insights into subduction-zone dynamics, because higher-temperature environments or the existence of fluids may have different effects on seismic attenuation from on seismic velocity. Therefore the estimate of seismic attenuation is very important to understand arc magmatism and mantle dynamics in subduction zone. This study estimates seismic attenuation structure beneath Kyushu using a large number of high-quality waveform data.\nWe applied the method of Nakajima et al. (2013, JGR) to waveform data derived from 3052 earthquakes that occurred from April 2003 to May 2014. We determined the corner frequency of earthquakes by the spectral ratio method of S-coda waves. Then, we determined a whole-path attenuation term (t*), site-amplification factors and spectrum level simultaneously by a joint inversion. Finally, the t* values (N= 62290) were inverted to obtain three-dimensional attenuation structure.\nThe obtained results show several interesting features. First, the subducting PHS slab is imaged as a low attenuation zone. Second, high-attenuation zone exists in the fore-arc mantle. This high-attenuation zone corresponds spatially to a high Poisson’s ratio area, suggesting that the mantle is serpentinized as a result of fluids released by dehydration in the subducting crust. Third, an inclined high-attenuation zone that is interpreted as a mantle upwelling flow is observed in the back-arc mantle. However, the inclined high-attenuation zone is less developed in the volcanic gap between Aso and Kirishima volcanoes. This observation suggests the important role of mantle-wedge processes in the genesis of arc magmas.",

            "abstract": "Recently it has been pointed out that when the inflow conditions of magnetic reconnection are asymmetric, a new in-plane electric field can arise from the physics of finite ion Larmor radius, called the Larmor electric field. It is located next to the Hall electric field structure, making it a potential indicator of proximity to the diffusion region. However, the properties of the Larmor electric field have not previously been explored for the case of a nonzero guide field, which could occur for many reconnection sites, including the day-side magnetopause. In this study, we therefore further explore the properties of the Larmor electric field by adding guide fields with different strengths into our simulations. The results show that the width of the Larmor electric field structure will be smaller, but the strength of the field will be stronger as the guide field increases, consistent with what we expect from the existing theory. Moreover, we show that in the region where the Larmor electric field occurs, there also appears an electron anisotropy. The widths of the electron anisotropy and Larmor electric field structures are found to be similar, suggesting that observing the combination of these two signatures provides a useful indicator of proximity to a reconnection site.

            "abstract": "The vibration table is a large-scaled tool used for inspecting the performance of seismometers. The output from a seismometer on the table can be directly monitored when the vibration table moves in certain pattern. Compared with other inspection methods, inspecting seismometers’ performance indicators (frequency response, degree of linearity, sensitivity, lateral inhibition and dynamic range etc). using vibration tables is more intuitive. Therefore, the vibration tables are an essential testing part in developing new seismometers and seismometer quality control. Whereas, in practice, a cable is needed to connect the seismometer to the ground equipments for its signal outputs and power supply, that means adding a time-varying nonlinear spring between the vibration table and ground. The cable adds nonlinear feature to the table, distorts the table-board movement and bring extra errors to the inspecting work and affected the testing accuracy and precision.\nIn face of this problem, we developed a wireless acquiring system for the vibration table. The system is consisted of a three-channel analog-to-digital conversion, an acquisition control part, local data storage, network interface, wireless router and power management, etc. The analog-to-digital conversion part uses a 24-digit high-precision converter, which has a programmable amplifier at the front end of its artificial circuit, with the function of matching outputs with different amplifier from the vibration table. The acquisition control part uses a 32 bit ARM processor, with low-power dissipation, minute extension and high performance. The application software platform is written in Linux to make the system convenient for multitasking work. Large volume local digital storage is achieved by a 32G SD card, which is used for saving real time acquired data. Data transmission is achieved by network interface and wireless router, which can simplify the application software by the supported TCP/IP protocol. Besides, the acquisition system uses built-in power supply, which provides power to the system with Li-On rechargeable battery with high capacity, then all the cable link between the vibration table and the ground equipment have been removed. With all these changes, the whole system is immobilized on board of the vibration table after being packaged.",

The RICE ice core provides a unique opportunity to look into the past evolution of the West Antarctic Ice sheet. Further the site has high accumulation; 0.26 m of ice equivalent is deposited annually allowing annual layer determination for many chemical parameters. The RICE core was drilled to bedrock and has a total length of 763 metres. Preliminary results derived from water isotopes suggest that the oldest ice reaches back to the Eemian, with the last glacial being compressed in the bottom 60 metres.\nWe present preliminary results from the RICE ice core including continuous measurements of acidity using an optical dye method, insoluble dust particles, conductivity and calcium. The core was analyzed at the New Zealand National Ice Core Research Facility at GNS Science in Wellington. The analytical set up used to determine climate proxies in the ice core was a modified version of the Copenhagen CFA system (Bigler et al., 2011). Key volcanic layers have been matched to those from the WAIS record (Sigl et al., 2013). A significant anti-correlation between acidity and calcium was seen in the Holocene part of the record. Due to the proximity to the ocean a large fraction of the calcium originates from sea salt and is in phase with total conductivity and sodium. In combination with the insoluble dust record, calcium has been apportioned into ocean-related and dust-related sources. Variability over the Holocene is presented and attributed to changing inputs of marine and dust aerosols.",

            "abstract": "Selenium is a member of group 14 of the periodic table, directly below sulfur, and is generally acknowledged to exhibit similar geochemical behaviour to sulfur, as evidenced by complete solid solution between many sulfur and selenium minerals. However, in certain situations Se shows markedly different geochemical properties to S. In the context of igneous processes, for example, differences in the relative stabilities of Se2-/SeO42- and S2-/SO42- may be useful for unravelling the redox history of convergent margin magmas. Also, Se seems to be more resistant to late-stage degassing from magmas, allowing original S contents to be estimated from observed Se contents and assumed Se/S ratios (e.g. Jenner et al., 2010, Journal of Petrology, 51, 2445-2464). This raises the question of whether the Se/S ratios of these magmas can be assumed to reflect the Se/S ratios in the mantle source (usually assumed to be chondritic), or whether this ratio is fractionated during partial melting.\nTo address this issue, experiments were conducted in the piston-cylinder appratus to investigate the partitioning of S and Se between haplobasaltic silicate liquid and Fe-S-Se liquids near the FeS-FeSe join at 1400-1500 °C, 1.0-3.5 GPa and different Se/S ratios. Experimental results show that there is a slightly more compatible in Fe-S-Se liquid with increasing pressure, with KD (XS2- × XFeSe)/(XSe2- × XFeS) increasing from 2.2 at 0.75 GPa to 2.74 at 3.5 GPa for compositions at molar S/(S+Se) of 0.82. This modest pressure dependence is consistent with earlier experimental results (Rose-Weston et al., 2009, Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 73, 4598-4615). There is no significant temperature dependence over the relatively small temperature range investigated. Activity-composition relations derived from partitioning experiments suggest that FeS-FeSe liquids can be described by a symmetric regular solution model with a small positive deviation from ideality of 7.54 ± 1.16 kJ·mol-1.",

            "abstract": "The late Neoproterozoic was a period of major environmental perturbations including tectonic reorganizations, biologic evolution and environmental oxygenation (Neoproterozoic oxygenation event). Authigenic enrichments in redox-sensitive elements such as Mo, V and U in late Neoproterozoic black shales prior to the appearance of the first metazoan fossils indicate that increasing oxygen levels in the atmosphere-hydrosphere system have facilitated the evolution and diversification of multi-cellular life. The isotopic composition of these elements is another tool to trace (possibly global) changes in the oceanic redox state. For example, significantly higher δ98Mo of seawater and black shales are expected, when the sink of isotopically light Mo in oxic deep marine settings increased. Accordingly, modern anoxic sediments in the Black Sea as well as the well oxygenated seawater show high δ98Mo of 2.3 ‰. However, Mesoproterozoic black shales show relatively low δ98Mo values up to 1.4 ‰. To test if the enrichment of redox-sensitive elements and metazoan evolution temporally correlate with an increase in seawater δ98Mo, we present Mo and Fe isotope data of slightly younger late Neoproterozoic black shales of the Tepla-Barrandian, Czech Republic.\nWe observe a perfect correlation of Fe/Al ratios with δ56Fe that is best explained by mixing of detrital derived Fe with δ56Fe of ~0.1 ‰ and hydrothermal sourced Fe with δ56Fe of ~-0.7 ‰. Hydrothermally dominated samples with low δ56Fe are also enriched in heavy metals such as Ni, Cu and Zn as well as hydrothermally derived Mo (with δ98Mo of ~0.6 ‰). Samples with minor hydrothermal influence show authigenic Mo enrichment from seawater with a maximum δ98Mo of 1.2 ‰. This estimate indicates no significant increase in the seawater δ98Mo during the Neoproterozoic and after the evolution of metazoan life. Thus, our Mo isotope dataset provides no evidence for deep ocean oxygenation during the Neoproterozoic oxygenation event, which might have acted as a trigger for the evolution of metazoan life.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial biomarkers such as n-alkanes and cholesterol were analyzed to infer the variations of paleoproductivity and the corresponding paleoclimatologic information from the sediment of the Korean Plateau, East Sea (Japan Sea) since the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 (ca. 400 ka). Previous studies of SST variation have shown that glacial-interglacial scale changes were quite variable with the maximum range of 26oC in MIS 7, and the minimum range of 12oC during MIS 2 and 6. The distribution of terrestrial n-alkanes signatures is characterized by the occurrence of high odd number frequency with a minor contribution of specific compound (nC27 only). Average Chain Length (ACL) and Carbon Preferences Index (CPI), both of which are derived from n-alkane combination, show similar shifting between glacial and interglacial periods. This suggests that paleovegetation communities had been changed in responding to paleoclimatological variations, and the input amount of terrestrial compound was strongly linked with paleoclimatologic changes. In particular, depleted values of δ13Corg during MIS 2, 8 and 10 were coincident with lower nitrogen isotope values indicating local paleoceanographic effects such as paleoproductivity changes. Decoupling between δ13Corg and δ15Norg during MIS 1, 3, 5, 7 and coupling of the two during MIS 8 and 11 can be observed, which appear to be interpreted as local productivity changes. In particular, high abundance of cholesterol and C21 n-alkanes, which were derived from diatom, increased during interglacial periods. Therefore, alkenones, SST and n-alkanes signatures coincide with δ13Corg and δ15Norg variations during glacial-interglacial cycles and further strongly associated with cholesterol abundance suggesting that the paleoenvironmental conditions in East Sea during glacial-interglacial periods were sensitive not only to global climate changes but also to local paleceanographic variations. Surface water circulation around the Korea Plateau associated with eustatic sea-level changes may have been linked with paleoproductivity changes, at least on the Korea Plateau of the East Sea (Japan Sea) since the last MIS 11.",

These exohiss waves are discovered in the wide MLT distribution [9.1,13.4] and low magnetic latitude, with narrow-band structure and weak intensity compared with plasmaspheric hiss. Using the Continue Waveform Burst Mode data and MAG data on the EMFISIS, we analyze the normal angle, electromagnetic planarity and anti~/parallel-propagating Poynting flux of exohiss wave. The results show indicate that exohiss waves are the result of plasmaspheric hiss leakage into the trough region.

            "abstract": "Recent developments in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made it possible to access the reservoirs that are not available for massive production in the past. Hydraulic fracturing is designed to enhance rock permeability and reservoir drainage through the creation of fracture networks. Microseismic monitoring has been proven to be an effective and valuable technology to image hydraulic fracture geometry. Based on data acquisition, seismic monitoring techniques have been divided into two categories: downhole and surface monitoring. Surface monitoring is challenging because of the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio of the raw data. We applied the techniques used in earthquake seismology and developed an integrated monitoring system for mapping hydraulic fractures. The system consists of 20 to 30 state-of-the-art broadband seismographs, which are generally about hundreds times more sensible than regular geophones. We have conducted two experiments in two basins with very different geology and formation mechanism in China. In each case, we observed clear microseismic events, which may correspond to the induced seismicity directly associated with fracturing and the triggered ones at pre-existing faults. However, the magnitude of these events is generally larger than magnitude -1, approximately one to two magnitudes larger than those detected by downhole instruments. Spectrum-frequency analysis of the continuous surface recordings indicated high seismic energy associated with injection stages. The seismic energy can be back-projected to a volume that surrounds each injection stage. Imaging seismic emission volume (SEV) appears to be an effective way to map the stimulated reservior volume, as well as natural fractures.",

We provide a focused, qualitative discussion on the hydraulic tomography data reported in Berg and Illman (2011). At the North Campus Research Site (NCRS) of the University of Waterloo, 8 pumping tests are conducted sequentially at different locations of the well field while drawdown is monitored at 44 ports distributed at 8 other wells. Without conducting inverse modeling, we discuss the behavior of the drawdown curves and the temporal evolution head field in response to pumping location, heterogeneity in aquifer parameters (i.e. hydraulic conductivity (K) and specific storage (Ss)), flow regimes, and boundary conditions.\nWe emphasize the importance and direct benefits for conducting hydraulic tomography surveys relies primarily on the collection of non-redundant data, not on the inverse models. This paper attempts to use an intuitive/logical approach to qualitative hydraulic tomography analysis. Our interpretation on the aquifer heterogeneity largely agrees with the intensive core sampling (i.e. local K measurements) and inverse modeling results. We conclude some of the inspection procedures can be beneficial before the inversion of data, while the quantitative and unifying estimation of hydraulic parameter fields can only be done using an inverse model.",

The advantage of these second-generation SAR systems is that processes can be resolved that were not visible by the low-resolution first-generation systems, such as pre-eruptive deformation of a volcanic dome and uplift or subsidence of the bedrock in response to a glacial surge. The drawback is the limited temporal coherence because these satellites operate at X-Band, which makes them suitable only for particular environments.

Based on the case studies, statistical analysis on the ionospheric electron density data measured by the Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions satellite (DEMETER) over a period of 2005-2010 was executed in order to investigate the correlation between seismic activity and equatorial plasma density variations. To simplify the analysis, three equatorial regions with frequent earthquakes were selected and then one-dimensional time series analysis between the daily seismic activity indices and the EIA intensity indices were performed for each region with excluding the possible effects from the geomagnetic and solar activity. The statistically significant values of the lagged cross-correlation function, particularly in the region with minimal effects of longitudinal asymmetry, indicate that some of the very large earthquakes with M > 7.0 in the low latitude region can accompany observable seismo-ionospheric coupling phenomena in the form of EIA enhancements, even though the seismic activity is not the most significant driver of the equatorial ionospheric evolution. The physical mechanisms of the seismo-ionospheric coupling to explain the observation and the possibility of earthquake prediction using the EIA intensity variation are discussed.",

ET is a key climate variable linking the water, carbon, and energy cycles, and is very sensitive to changes in atmospheric forcing and soil water content. The response of ET to water and heat stress directly affects the surface energy balance and temperature which can be measured by thermal infrared remote sensing observations. The NASA ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) will be deployed in 2019 to address critical questions on plant–water dynamics, ecosystem productivity and future ecosystem changes with climate through an optimal combination of thermal infrared measurements in 5 spectral bands between 8-12 µm with pixel sizes of 38×57 m and an average revisit of 5 days over the contiguous United States at varying times of day.\nTwo instruments capable of providing proxy datasets are the MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator and Hyperspectral Thermal Emissions Spectrometer (HyTES). This study is focused on estimating evapotranspiration using shortwave and thermal infrared remote sensing observations from these instruments. The thermal infrared data from MASTER/HyTES is used as a proxy dataset for ECOSTRESS to demonstrate the capability of the future spaceborne system to derive ET and water stress information from thermal based retrievals of land surface temperature. MASTER and HyTES data collected from 2004 to present over the Western United States at different seasons are used to test and evaluate different ET algorithms using ground-based measurements. Selected algorithms are 1) explicitly based on surface energy budget calculation or 2) based on the Penman-Monteith equation and use information on land surface temperature to estimate the surface resistance to convective fluxes. We use ground data from the Fluxnet and Ameriflux networks, and from permanent validation stations over an agricultural landscape in California operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The impact of different error sources associated with both the input data or the parameterization of the different models is quantified and used to assess the uncertainty of the future operational spaceborne ET products.",

The concentrations of total suspended particle (TSP) and total PAH (t-PAH; gas + particulate) ranged from 1.6 to 78.8 μg m-3 and 430 to 4400 pg m-3, respectively. The highest levels of t-PAH concentrations and particle-associated PAHs were found during the northeast (NE) monsoon season. Long-range transport and rainfall scavenging mechanisms could contribute to seasonal variations in TSP and t-PAH concentrations. Results from principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that air mass movement caused by the monsoon system was the main influence on atmospheric PAHs profiles and concentrations. Gas-particle partition coefficients (Kp) of PAHs were well-correlated with the sub-cooled liquid vapor pressures (PoL), suggesting that the gas-particle partition of PAHs follows the characteristic of PAHs. In addition, the partitioning of PAHs between gas and particle phases varied significantly between NE and SW monsoon seasons. This study sheds lights on the role of Asian monsoon regarding atmospheric transport of PAHs.",

            "abstract": "Thermodynamic properties of silicate melts at high temperature (T) and pressure (P) are crucial to understanding Earth accretion, magma oceans, petrogenesis, and crustal growth. However, equations of state for silicate liquids at mantle conditions are scarce, due to experimental challenges. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations allow investigation of thermodynamic and transport properties of silicate melts at high P and T and enable the correlation of liquid structure with computed properties. Using classical MD, we studied liquid NaAlSi3O8 in the range 0-42 GPa and 3000-5137 K. Density ranged from 2.2 to 3.6 g/cm3, and all simulations were performed in the microcanonical (NEV) ensemble using the potential from Matsui (1998). An equation of state with internal energy E(V,T) was developed using the RT scaling-Vinet formulation (Ghiorso et al., 2009). From thermodynamic relationships, the Grüneisen parameter, isobaric expansivity, isothermal compressibility, heat capacity, and other functions are computed over the P-T range of the MD simulations. Diffusion coefficients (D) range from 1.5×10-9 to 5.9×10-8 m2/s and typically order Na>Al>O>Si at a given state point. Generally, D decreases with P and increases with T except for a low P anomalous region along the 3065 K isotherm. Anomalous diffusion for Al, Si, and O is congruent with laboratory experiments at P<10 GPa (e.g., Shimizu and Kushiro, 1984; Poe et al., 1997; Tinker and Lesher, 2001; Tinker et al., 2003). Activation energy for Na is on the order of -75.3 kJ/mol with activation volume -1.74 cm3/mol. The anomalous peak in diffusivity for Si and O occurs at ~3 GPa, which marks a subtle increase in the average coordination number (CN) for O around O from 9.35 to 10.31. The average CN for O around O generally increases with P, but it systematically drops at 8, 15, and 20 GPa for 3065, 3944, and 5137 K, respectively. The concentrations of AlO5 and SiO5 polyhedra maximize near 16 and 35 GPa, respectively.",

            "abstract": "We report the palynology of marine sediment core ARA02B/01A-GC from the Western margin of the shallow shelf of the Chukchi Sea in the Arctic, a site which was synchronously influenced by climatic changes during the last deglaciation with those in the Bering Strait. The core contains a rich concentration of continental palynomorphs, even though the coring location is quite a distance from land. The catchment area for the observed palynomorphs includes the territories of both North America (Alaska and North Canada) and Northern Siberia (Chukotka peninsula and Northern East-Siberian coast). Based on this fact, we can reconstruct a common paleoenvironmental history for this location and the Bering Strait during the postglacial interval. We hypothesize that palynomorphs were carried to the sea during low sea-ice coverage intervals by large rivers (Yukon, Mackenzie and Siberian rivers) and were then transferred by oceanic currents. During intervals of extensive sea-ice coverage the source of the palynomorphs was predominantly eroded shelf sediments. The percentage ratio of tree-herb pollen and spores in the palynomorph assemblages shows that favorable conditions for an increase in forest vegetation took place between ~8 and 4 kyr BP, which coincides with maximum freshwater input to the sea. During a climatic optimum at ~5 kyr BP, as inferred from the total dominance of tree and herb pollen, the Chukchi Sea was apparently warmer than today. This represents the maximum ice-free period for the sea. The low sea-ice interval ended ~3 kyr BP, as suggested by a sharp drop in tree pollen, a reduction in fresh water input, and a drop in the concentration of the algae Pediastrum. Our data correlate well with data from marine core HLY0501-5 from the Bering Strait (Polyak et al., 2009) for the interval of 10-8 kyr BP, but shows a divergence since ~4 kyr BP, which may correspond to the beginning of the differentiation of North American and East-Siberian ecosystem zones.",

Each magnetotelluric profile is made up of 30 wideband observations with site separations ranging from 1 to 5 km. Preliminary models, developed from wideband magnetotelluric data collected so far were modeled using sophisticated two- and three-dimensional inversion algorithms. Their results suggests that: (i) Central Anatolian Fault near Pozantı presents a sharp electrical conductivity contrast between Nigde-Kirsehir Massif and Anatolide-Tauride Block (ii) While Adana Basin sediments at the southeast appear as highly conductive, features associated with Nigde-Kirsehir Massif appear as clear low conductivity zones (iii) Deeper high conductivity anomalies appear at the vicinity of Central Anatolian Volcanic Province. Two additional profiles are being planned in the area and in addition to wideband observations, long period magnetotelluric (1 sec. – 10.000 sec.) stations are being installed on each profile to image the deep structure. Resulting conductivity models will be compared and/or correlated with results gained from other geophysical disciplines of the project, such as shear wave velocities.",

It is the most serious disaster of historic typhoons for the bridge and roadway damage in the past records. Most of the roads and bridges on No. 18, No. 20 and No.21 Highways were broken (shown as figure) because of great amout materials from landslides and debris flow including of soil, rock and wood, those mixed with water attacked all constructions along highways and finally caused these constructions destroyed. And due to the global climate change, the scale and freuency of these natural disaster are more difficult to predict and measure. Therefore the deeply understanding for the relationship between mountain roadways and multi-hazards is very important. In this study, the author would mainly focus on the broken bridges, and according to the collected rainfall data and post-disaster evidences to analysis the possible hazard resaons in the case of typhoon Morakot in Taiwan.\nThe authors collected and filed investigated all the 52 bridges data, and classified the reasons of possible causes by analyzing the spatial and rainfall factors of typhoon Morakot. For the distribution analyses of all these bridges, most of the bridges on upstream were caused by debris flow or slope failure because of the very steep terrain and enough soil materials from neighborhood, like landslides or rock falls. The bridges in midstream or downstream were damaged by excessive and rapid stream flow, like scouring, depositing, and very high water level. Due to these flow conditions with sediment, threaten for safety of bridges would be increased. In conclusions, the possible resaons was classified with 4 types by post-investigations and the environment conditions were be used to evulated the causes for these bridges including of Type I- slope failure near stream, Type II- debris flow, Type III- scouring and depositing, and Type IV- excessive peakflow.",

Recognising the importance of regional expertise, GEBCO is collaborating with regional groups to help to continually improve its global model.\nThanks to the European initiative EMODnet (www.emodnet-hydrography.eu), data providers from more than 30 organisations are working to build a regional DTM at 1/8th arc-minute (~ 250 meters resolution) for European waters; from the Norwegian and Icelandic Seas, through the Baltic, Celtic and North Seas to the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea.\nWith the aim of producing harmonised products and to prevent any duplication of effort, GEBCO and EMODnet are working together to build an authoritative DTM for European waters. This consists of the following steps:\nThe Emodnet group has generated a Digital terrain model (2013 version) for European waters, with gaps between data sources.\nThe EMODnet (2013) DTM has been used to update GEBCO’s global grid using the remove-restore procedure involving the generation of a difference grid between the EMODnet 2013 and the initial GEBCO grids, which is then added on top of the initial GEBCO grid.\n  When compiling a new 2014 version of the EMODnet DTM, data gaps are filled with the new GEBCO grid.\nAs a result of this collaboration and the process described above, the latest (2014) versions of both grids show a marked improvement in their precision and continuity.\nRepeating this procedure for the future releases of EMODnet and GEBCO bathymetric grids will help improve knowledge of the bathymetry of European waters while providing a fit-for-purpose and consistent grid to users.",

            "abstract": "The countries of Central Asia are known to be among the most exposed in the world to landslide hazard and risk. In the past, several devastating slope failures have caused intense economic and human losses across the entire region. The large variability of local geological materials, difficulties in forecasting heavy precipitation locally, and problems in quantifying the level of ground shaking, call for harmonized procedures to better quantify landslide hazard. Moreover, due to uncontrolled urban expansion in mountainous areas, a growth in vulnerability of exposed population as well as overall risk has to be expected. In order to mitigate landslide risk, novel and strategic approaches are required mainly for enhanced understanding of causal factors, for reducing exposure to hazards, and for controlling land-use practices in a harmonized transnational way.\nWe have already presented a regional landslide susceptibility assessment for Kyrgyzstan. First results allow for the identification of most potential landslide areas all over the country, with sufficient degree of accuracy. Based on this, we hereby propose a procedure for obtaining cross-border risk map of earthquake-induced landslides among central Asian countries, by employing statistical tools and updated input information in such remote and data-scarce regions. The method is initially applied to Kyrgyzstan where the majority of input parameters is available, and subsequently extended to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. At first, the influence of diverse potential parameters (topography, geology, tectonic lineaments) as well as seismic triggering to landslide activation is evaluated. Elements at risk are then analyzed in relation to landslide hazard, and their vulnerability is hence established. A sensitivity analysis is carried out, and results are validated to an independent dataset.",

            "abstract": "An uplifted flight of coral reef terraces, extending along the north-east margin of the Gulf of Aqaba (GOA), provides evidence for uplift rates and sea level high stands. GOA fills a narrow and deep tectonic depression lying along the southern sector of the Dead Sea Transform where it meets the Red Sea. This special configuration of the GOA and its latitude turn it into a dependable paleo-sea level monitor, sensitive only to global eustatic changes and local tectonic movements.\nA sequence of five uplifted coral reef terraces were mapped and characterized on basis of morphology and reef-facies, and their elevation above the present sea level was determined. The fossil reefs studied comprise fringing reefs, some with clear reef-structure that includes a reef flat and a shallow back lagoon. Most outcrops in the study area represent a transgressive sequence in which, during its highest stand, formed fringing reef terraces. We use U-Th ages of fossil corals samples found in growth position at various terraces.\nCorals from three uplifted reef terraces, R1, R2, and R3 were dated to the last interglacial period particularly to marine isotope stage (MIS) 5e. These ages were achieved from mainly calcitic corals (recrystallized in a freshwater phreatic environment). A few ages were derived from aragonite corals. The three terraces represent three sub-stages within MIS5e: R3 formed during a short standstill at ~130 ka BP; R2 formed during a long and steady standstill between ~128 to ~121 ka BP; and R1 represents a short standstill at ~117 ka BP. Assuming that terrace reef flats represent past sea level high stands, we calculated the coast average uplift rate and constrained the original terraces elevations.\nThe reconstructed eustatic sea level variation during MIS 5e at GOA resembles observations from reef terraces in other locations. Combined, all indicate a significant sea-level rise from the MIS 6 low stand at ~134-130 ka and followed by a long and stable sea level high stand between ~128 to ~121 ka, representing a major reef building period. The long and stable sea level was followed by additional sea-level rise at ~118-116 ka that transgressed over the “stable reefs”.",

Due to changes in the social structure of the region, a large area of the grassland has been abandoned and was invaded by the shrubs with different hydrological and ecophysiological traits. Ecophysiological traits and their responses to seasonally changing environments are fundamental to project the transpiration rates under changing air and soil water environments, but less is understood. We measured the tree- and leaf-level ecophysiological traits of a shrub, Alnus firma in montane region where both rainfall and soil water content drastically changes seasonally. Sap flux reached the annual peak in evaporative summer (July-August) both in 2013 and 2014, although the duration was limited within a short period due to the prolonged rainy season before summer (2014) and rapid decrease in the air vapor pressure deficit (D) in late summer. Leaf ecophysiological traits in close relationship with gas exchange showed modest seasonal changes and the values were kept at relatively high levels typical in plants with nitrogen fixation under nutrient-poor environments. Stomatal conductance, which was measured at leaf-level measurements and sap flux measurements, showed responses to D, which coincided with the theoretical response for isohydric leaves. A multilayer model, which estimates stand-level transpiration by scaling up the leaf-level data, successfully captured the temporal trends in sap flux, suggesting that major processes were incorporated. Thus, ecophysiological traits of A. firma were characterized by the absence of responses to seasonally changing environments and the transpiration rate was the function of the interannually variable environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "Long-term trends in total oxidants (Ox, defined as NO2 + O3) and ozone (O3) were analyzed based on the annual averages calculated from 56 air-quality stations (AQS) across Taiwan from 1994 to 2012. A simple regression of the annual averages for the period from 1994-2012 revealed an increasing trend for O3 (+0.51 ppbv/yr) and relatively constant levels of Ox at approximately 46 ppbv. However, when divided into two time periods, the O3 trend leveled off and remained constant at approximately 29 ppbv from 2007 to 2012, whereas the Ox level drastically decreased (-0.66 ppbv/yr) during this same period. These recent changes in the O3 and Ox trends island-wide were consistent with the trends observed in the largest metropolis, Taipei, suggesting a ubiquitous phenomenon. The changes in the O3 and Ox trends around 2007 can be attributed to two causes from the observation point of view. As for the sink perspective, NOx levels have continued to decrease rapidly since 1994 (-0.82 ppbv/yr or -44% over 19 years), diminishing the NO-titration and, thus, increasing O3 levels, resulting in constant Ox levels for the period prior to 2007. From the source perspective, continuous decreases in the levels of reducing agents (Non-methane hydrocarbons, NMHC: -0.012 ppmC/yr or -53% over 19 years, CO: -0.022 ppm/yr or -49% over 19 years) have lowered the photochemical O3 levels in recent years, resulting in altered O3 and Ox levels after 2007. The oceanic baseline O3 averages revealed by AQS on the satellite islands around Taiwan also indicated consistent results in recent years, with O3 values notably lower (38-40 ppbv) than the peak values of 40-45 ppbv in the early 2000s.",

            "abstract": "The lanthanide series of elements (the 14 rare earth elements, REEs) have similar chemical properties and respond to different chemical and physical processes in the natural environment by developing unique patterns in their concentration distribution when normalized to an average shale REE content. The interpretation of the REE content in a gas-bearing black shale deposited in a marine environment must therefore take into account the paleoredox conditions of deposition as well as any diagenetic remobilization and authigenic mineral formation. We analyzed 15 samples from a core of the Marcellus Shale (Whipkey ST1, Greene Co., PA) for REEs, TOC, gas-producing potential, trace metal content, and carbon isotopes of organic matter in order to determine the REE systematics of a black shale currently undergoing shale gas development. We also conducted a series of sequential leaching experiments targeting the phosphatic fractions in order to evaluate the dominant host phase of REEs in a black shale. Knowledge of the REE system in the Marcellus black shale will allow us to evaluate potential REE release and behavior during hydraulic fracturing operations. Total REE content of the Whipkey ST1 core ranged from 65-185 μg/g and we observed three distinct REE shale-normalized patterns: middle-REE enrichment (MREE/MREE* ~2) with heavy-REE enrichment (HREE/LREE ~1.8-2), flat patterns, and a linear enrichment towards the heavy-REE (HREE/LREE ~1.5-2.5). The MREE enrichment occurred in the high carbonate samples of the Stafford Member overlying the Marcellus Formation. The HREE enrichment occurred in the Union Springs Member of the Marcellus Formation, corresponding to a high TOC peak (TOC ~4.6-6.2 wt%) and moderate carbonate levels (CaCO3 ~4-53 wt%). Results from the sequential leaching experiments suggest that the dominant host of the REEs is the organic fraction of the black shale and that the detrital and authigenic fractions have characteristic MREE enrichments. We present our conclusions on the impact of depositional setting and diagenetic remobilization and authigenic mineral formation on the REE system in the Marcellus Shale.",

            "abstract": "The goal of this study is to apply the IPCC(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) concept of vulnerability to climate change and verify the use of a combination of vulnerability index and fuzzy operators to flood vulnerability analysis and mapping in Seoul using GIS. In order to achieve this goal, this study identified indicators influencing floods based on literature review. We include indicators of exposure to climate(daily max rainfall, days of 80㎜ over), sensitivity(slope, geological, average DEM, Impermeability layer, topography and drainage), and adaptive capacity(retarding basin and green-infra). Also, this research used fuzzy operator model for aggregating indicators, and utilized frequency ratio to decide fuzzy membership values. Results show that number of days of precipitation above 80㎜, the distance from river and impervious surface have comparatively strong influence on flood damage. Furthermore, when precipitation is over 269㎜, areas with scare flood mitigation capacities, industrial land use, elevation of 16∼20m, within 50m distance from rivers are quite vulnerable to floods. Yeongdeungpo-gu, Yongsan-gu, Mapo-gu include comparatively large vulnerable areas. The relative weight of each factor was then converted into a fuzzy membership value and integrated as a flood vulnerability index using fuzzy operators (fuzzy AND, fuzzy OR, fuzzy algebraic sum, and fuzzy algebraic product). Comparing the results of the highest for the fuzzy AND operator, fuzzy gamma operator (γ = 0.2) is higher with improved computational. This study improved previous flood vulnerability assessment methodology by adopting fuzzy operator model. Also, vulnerability map provides meaningful information for decision makers regarding priority areas for implementing flood mitigation policies.\nAcknowledgements: The authors appreciate the support that this study has received from “Development of Time Series Disaster Mapping Technologies through Natural Disaster Factor Spatial-Temporal Correlation Analysis and Integration: Focused on the Urban Disasters by Extreme Climate Change”, an initiative of the National Research Foundation of Korea.",

            "abstract": "Flow banding, which is characterized by deformation of highly vesicular part, is ubiquitously observed in rhyolite lavas. To explore the origin of the highly vesicular part, we examined Takanoobane rhyolite lava (TR lava) in Aso caldera, Japan, which effused at 51+/-5 ka (Matsumoto et al., 1991).\n The highly vesicular parts characterized by ductile deformation are well developed in the central crystalline layer, at which the parts tend to be flattened with an increasing of distance from the source. The part develops into flow bands. The highly vesicular parts are also recognized around fractures that developed perpendicular to the flow direction, and adjacent to phenocrysts.\n The highly vesicular part is composed of cavities with mainly <100 μm in diameter. Microscopic observation and the SEM image show that the cavities have ragged walls characterized by the protrusion of groundmass crystals and phenocrysts. Smith et al. (2001) described such cavities in detail using three silicic lavas in Japan, and proposed that the cavities were formed by failure of the magma by flow during ductile-brittle transition. The authors described the fracturing mechanism as cavitation, and considered that groundmass adjacent to phenocryst also appears to act as a site of strong cavitation because of the steep strain gradient between deforming matrix and non-deforming phenocrysts. The similarity of the textures means that the highly vesicular part in TR lava was also formed by cavitation during ductile-brittle transition. The part would be deformed and flattened with progression of lava deformation. We analyzed the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) to estimate the deformation style of TR lava. The results show that the highly vesicular part was deformed by pure shear strain.\n We established the following model for the development of flow banding. In TR lava, the highly vesicular parts were formed by failure of the magma during ductile-brittle transition during and/or after lava effusion. The continued lava effusion formed the large lava dome due to the high viscosity. The lava dome would be consequently squashed by its own weight. The lava was deformed by pure shear strain originated from the squashing. The highly vesicular parts formed by cavitation were flattened by the deformation and developed into the flow banding.",

            "abstract": "Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is widely applied to qualitative and quantitative interpretation of near-surface targets. Surface deployments of GPR most widely characterise physical properties in terms of some measure of GPR wavelet velocity. Wavelet amplitude is less-often considered, potentially due to difficulties in measuring this quantity: amplitudes are distorted by the anisotropic radiation pattern of antennas, and the ringy GPR wavelet can make successive events difficult to isolate. However, amplitude loss attributes could provide a useful means of estimating the physical properties of a target.\nGPR energy loss is described by the bandwidth-limited quality factor Q* which, for low-loss media, is proportional to the ratio of dielectric permittivity, ε, and electrical conductivity, σ. Comparing the frequency content of two arrivals yields an estimate of interval Q*, but only if they are sufficiently distinct. There may be sufficient separation between a primary reflection and its long-path multiple (i.e. a ‘repeat path' of the primary reflection) therefore a dataset that is rich in multiples may be suitable for robust Q* analysis. The Q* between a primary and multiple arrival describes all frequency-dependent loss mechanisms in the interval between the free-surface and the multiple-generating horizon: assuming that all reflectivity is frequency-independent, Q* can be used to estimate ε and/or σ.\nWe measure Q* according to the spectral ratio method, for synthetic and real GPR datasets. Our simulations are performed using the finite-difference algorithm GprMax, and represent our example data of GPR acquisitions over peat bogs. These data are a series of 100 MHz GPR acquisitions over sites in the Brecon Beacons National Park of South Wales. The base of the bogs (the basal peat/mineral soil contact) is often a strong multiple-generating horizon. As an example, data from Waun Ddu bog show these events lagging by ~75 ns: GPR velocity is measured here at 0.034 m/ns (relative ε of 77.9) and spectral ratios suggest Q* of 19.9 [-6.6 +19.4]. This Q* implies that the bulk σ of the bog is 21.7 [-10.7 +10.8] mS/m. Our measurements require in situ verification (e.g. comparison with co-located electrical resistivity profiles) but our method provides a promising addition to the suite of GPR analysis tools.",

            "abstract": "To develop a better understanding of the failure mechanisms leading to first time failure or reactivation of landslides, the British Geological Survey is operating an observatory on an active, shallow landslide in North Yorkshire, UK, which is a typical example of slope failure in Lias Group mudrocks. This group and the Whitby Mudstone Formation in particular, show one of the highest landslide densities in the UK. The observatory comprises geophysical (i.e., ERT and self-potential monitoring, P- and S-wave tomography), geotechnical (i.e. acoustic emission and inclinometer), and hydrological and environmental monitoring (i.e. weather station, water level, soil moisture, soil temperature), in addition to movement monitoring using real-time kinematic GPS.\nIn this study we focus on the reactivation of the landslide at the end of 2012, after an exceptionally wet summer. We present an integrated interpretation of the different data streams. Results show that the two lobes (east and west), which form the main focus of the observatory, behave differently. While water levels, and hence pore pressures, in the eastern lobe are characterised by a continuous increase towards activation resulting in significant movement (i.e. metres), water levels in the western lobe are showing frequent drainage events and thus lower pore pressures and a lower level of movement (i.e. tens of centimetres). This is in agreement with data from the geoelectrical monitoring array. During the summer season, resistivities generally increase due to decreasing moisture levels. However, during the summer of 2012 this seasonal pattern was interrupted, with the reactivated lobe displaying strongly decreasing resistivities (i.e. increasing moisture levels). The self-potential and soil moisture data show clear indications of moisture accumulation prior to the reactivation, followed by continuous discharge towards the base of the slope. Using the different data streams, we present 3D volumetric images of gravimetric moisture content (derived from the ERT data) that highlight the reasons for the differential behaviour and indicate precursors for landslide reactivation.",

Since EDGAR’s first release in 1996 (EDGARv2), a continuous improvement and upgrade of the emission data resulted in a sequence of releases. Here we present EDGAR_v4.3 (2014), which features new information on emission factors and an extension to 2009-2010 data compared to EDGAR_v4.2. EDGAR_v4.2 was used in many inverse modeling studies in EU, US, Africa and Asia yielding regional refinement of emission factors and adjustments of technology penetration (e.g. coal mining, power plants) and proxy data for geospatial distribution (e.g. passenger car transport). We focus on SO2, NOx, CO, NMVOC, NH3, PM10, PM2.5, BC and OC emissions for the most recent year (2010), and compare them to two global inventories used in global modeling, as well as the regional inventories included in them. HTAP_v2 is a harmonized, global, gridded, emission database for 2010, developed for global and regional model tasks within the Task Force Hemispheric Transport Air pollution. It uses officially reported, gridded national inventories, complemented with science based data, partly gap-filled with EDGAR. However, since HTAP_v2 is relying on (sub-)national statistics, it may not be as consistent across countries and regions, as a globally calculated inventory using international statistics and global geospatial distributions. Another available global inventory is MACCity, covering the years 1980-2010. We compare EDGAR_v4.3 with HTAP_v2 and MACCity in order to explain differences from national estimates and address emission inventory uncertainties, indicating weaknesses and strengths of these databases. We present the geospatial distribution of emissions at 0.1x0.1 degree resolution, comparing the contribution of developing and emerging countries with industrialized regions, both as absolute and per capita data.",

Based on these pros and cons, this study aims on assessing the applicability of computing site response from background noise in earthquake stations. Data were collected from Central Weather Bureau free field strong motion system, the instruments would be triggered when vibration amplitudes exceeding a specific threshold (about 3.9 gal), and the 20 seconds data before trigger point would be retained. The blank records before P wave arrival from this 20 seconds were considered as ambient noise, and Nakaruma horizontal to vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) technique was involved to analysis the site response. Results were compare with response frequency from S waves in middle Taiwan, showing that the background noise from strong motion records also could reflect peak frequency as S wave band, and had well consistency with previous studies used microseismic data. This study provides a new vision for strong motion station data applying to site effect analysis, the blank record is a worth considering material which could assist in understanding site response.",

Coordination of the configuration of the three Swarm spacecraft with the constellation of the four Cluster spacecraft has been planned through joint operations; providing a set of distributed, multi-point measurements covering this region. A particularly close coordination of all spacecraft has been achieved during the start of the Swarm operations.

We report here preliminary results of joint science targets, including coordinated cusp encounters; the comparative significance of the connecting R2 FACs, and the use and application of new analysis techniques derived from the calculation of curl B and magnetic gradients to compare estimates of the current distributions. For context, we will report on the coordination of Champ and Cluster data to interpret and resolve the R1 and R2 FACs using Champ derived models of the associated auroral boundaries.",

            "abstract": "Distributed models of snow and ice mass balance enable a better understanding of processes involved in glacier hydrology and the prediction of glacier runoff under possible future climatic scenarios. The so-called ‘Enhanced Temperature-Index’ (ETI) melt models are a good compromise between model simplicity, parsimony of input data, and the capability to account for dominant processes in snow and ice mass balance. Accurate spatial calculation of temperature input data is crucial, given the key role of air temperature in modeling ablation and accumulation processes, further emphasized in ETI models. Compared to ambient conditions, lower temperatures (the so-called glacier cooling effect), and temperature variability (the so-called glacier damping effect) generally occur over glaciers, complicating the extrapolation from off-glacier weather stations.\nA comprehensive dataset of mass balance measurements and high-altitude meteorological observations was collected on La Mare and Careser glaciers (Ortles-Cevedale, Italian Alps) in 2010 and 2011. This dataset was used to analyze the air temperature distribution and wind regime over the glaciers, and to evaluate the impact of different calculation methods proposed in the literature for calculating on-glacier temperatures from off-glacier data. A general-purpose ETI model (EISModel - Energy Index Snow-and-ice Model) was used for simulating snow and ice accumulation and melt processes.\nResults indicate that i) none of the existing methods fully accounts for the actual temperature distribution over glaciers, ii) even small deviations in air temperature calculations strongly impact the simulations, and iii) there is an important positive feedback related to glacier shrinking and disintegration. Among the tested methods, the more physically-based procedure of Greuell and Bohm (1998) provided the best overall results. Therefore, it was implemented in EISModel for distributed air temperature calculations over glaciers.",

            "abstract": "Our current understanding of peatland energy, water and carbon (C) cycles implies that northern peatlands are vulnerable to projected climate change, and that the perturbation of these cycles might cause a strong positive or negative net feedback to the climate system. About one third of Canada’s northern peatlands contain contain perennialy frozen ground (permafrost). Boreal forest-peatland ecosystems in the discontinuous permafrost zone (50-90% of frozen ground) are especially vulnerable to rising temperatures as permafrost is ice-rich, relatively warm and thin, and thus susceptible to complete disappearance causing ground surface subsidence and a decline in forest cover in response to water-logging. Several recent studies have substantially improved our understanding of northern peatland’s role in the climate system by quantifying their net ecosystem C balance which includes atmospheric and aqueous C fluxes generally dominated by the export of dissolved organic C (DOC). We characterize seasonal and diurnal variations in DOC export from five catchments (0.02-0.05 km2) at Scotty Creek, a 152 km2-watershed under the influence of rapidly degrading and disappearing discontinuous permafrost near Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories, Canada. The five catchments are characterized by different fractions of forested peat plateaus with permafrost (38-73%) and permafrost-free collapse bogs (27-62%). Dissolved organic carbon concentrations at Scotty Creek appear to be higher in catchments where the percentage of peat plateaus is higher compared to bogs, independent of catchment size. Average DOC concentration for catchments with a lower percentage of peat plateaus is lower (~43 mg/l) than for those with a higher percentage of plateaus (~60 mg/l). These preliminary results suggest that lateral C losses from this rapidly changing landscape are at least partly controlled by the peat plateau-bog ratio. Over the year, DOC export from the five catchments is limited to around a week due to the relatively dry conditions at Scotty Creek over the hot summer months: only one of the catchments produces continuous measurable surface runoff. However, as indicated through water level recordings, additional unaccounted DOC export may occur through diffuse subsurface flow.",

Such waves can propagate long distances and are thus useful for studying small events. However, factors controlling the amplitude and duration of T-waves remain unclear. In this study, we obtained data by using a broadband ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) that recorded T-waves produced by 60 Mw>3.3 earthquakes that occurred in Taiwan. In addition, we used T-waves produced by 90% of these events recorded at an island station. For each earthquake, we forward-calculated the travel times of the P- and S-waves converted to T-wave, and correlated them with different paths from the earthquake. The duration of the observed T-wave fits with the paths from the available conversion points in the regional bathymetry. The waveform gaps were correlated with the gaps of the bathymetry contour lines. However, the arrival times of abyssal earthquakes show that parts of the T-waves converted directly from the deep seafloor near the sources. We calculated the synthetic ground motions at the conversion points along the 1000-m bathymetric contour lines. We then calculated the synthetic T-wave amplitude at those conversion points. Using these results, we calculated the T-wave amplitude envelopes and determined that they fit the observed OBS data. Furthermore, we used the ratio of ground motions to water pressure change to determine whether the T-wave arrives at the OBS as ground motions or as acoustic waves from the water column. This method can help determine the different paths and amplitudes of the T-waves recorded using OBSs.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that the aerosol distribution in East Asia is complex due to both the increasing emissions of the anthropogenic aerosols associated with economic growth and the behavior of natural dusts. Therefore, detailed observations of atmospheric particles in East Asian are important. It is concerned about the change of concentration of aerosols causes various effects on the climate by directly and indirectly modifying the optical properties and lifetimes of cloud. In addition to radiation budget change, aerosol has a significant potential to change cloud and precipitation. These circulation fields change influence on emission of natural aerosols such as dust aerosols and sea salt aerosols. Also, air pollution in megacities in East Asia has become a serious problem. Especially problematic are fine particles called PM2.5, whose diameter is 2.5 mm or less. Particulate matter (PM) pollution as indicated by high PM2.5 readings will cause a spike in the mortality rate of patients suffering from heart and lung diseases. Because fine particles are much smaller than inhalable coarse particles, the can penetrate deeper into the lungs and cause more severe effects on human health. Anthropogenic sources of PM2.5 include automobiles, factories, coal-burning power plants, and heaters in homes. It is well known that the size of dust particles decreases during long-range transport via westerly winds, and the resulting dust storms can contain high concentrations of fine particles. Accordingly, PM2.5 concentrations correspond well to both anthropogenic and dust aerosols. This work intends to investigate impacts of aerosol on regional climate change and environment over East Asia using observations and model simulations.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a forecast model of solar proton flux profile (> 10 MeV channel) for well-connected events. Among 136 solar proton events (SPEs) from 1986 to 2006, we select 49 well-connected ones that are all associated with single X-ray flares stronger than M1 class and start to increase within four hours after their X-ray peak times. These events show rapid increments in proton flux. By comparing several empirical functions, we select a modified Weibull curve function to approximate a SPE flux profile, which is similar to the particle injection rate. The parameters (peak value, rise time and decay time) of this function are determined by the relationship between X-ray flare parameters (peak flux, impulsive time, and emission measure) and SPE parameters. For 49 well-connected SPEs, the linear correlation between the predicted proton peak flux and the observed proton peak fluxes is 0.65 with the RMS error of 0.55 pfu in the log10. In addition, we have developed another forecast model based on flare and CME parameters using 22 SPEs. The used CME parameters are linear speed and angular width. As a result, we find that the linear correlation between the predicted proton peak flux and the observed proton peak fluxes is 0.83 with the RMS error of 0.35 pfu in the log10. From the relationship between the model error and CME acceleration, we find that CME acceleration is also an important factor for predicting proton flux profiles. ",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive analysis of the earthquake cycle is a key issue for the definition of the hazard in seismic areas. Advanced SAR Interferometry (A-InSAR) techniques have today a key role in Earth Sciences thanks to the capability to detect and measure slow surface movements along wide areas, and to follow the evolution of signal along a certain time periods. A-InSAR techniques have been applied to large datasets of SAR images spanning long time intervals and, together with in-situ surveys and ground measurements, can provide suitable information about the causes of post seismic (deformation rebound or residual strain release) and interseismic (seismic, creep) movements. In the framework of FP7 MARSITE (Marmara Supersite) project we have investigated the Western sector of North Anatolian Fault System (NAFS) from Istanbul toward Duzce area. From West toward the Marmara Sea region (Mudurnu/Akyaz) the NAFS begins to lose its single fault line character and splays into a complex fault system. The main Marmara Fault is argued to be a very young structure and exhibits typical characteristics of a major strike slip fault. In 1999 the August 17th Izmit earthquake was followed few months later by the Duzce mainshock. We compare the A-InSAR results to permanent GPS stations installed in the region after the Izmit/Duzce earthquakes. These observations allow studying the post-seismic deformation of the 1999 Izmit/Düzce earthquake. We investigate the response of the eastern Marmara Fault to the quasi-static loading caused by Izmit/Düzce earthquakes. Overlapped post-seismic processes of fault creep (or afterslip) and viscoelastic relaxation of the lower crust and the upper mantle were investigated. We firstly estimated the viscoelastic relaxation effect using well covered long-term GPS data. This relaxation effect was subtracted from the InSAR data and the remaining InSAR data was inverted to identify localized slip variation along the MMF. Our inversion results imply that part of the MMF segment is subject to aseismic fault movement. The fault movement might be triggered by the 1999 Izmit/Düzce earthquakes, and has partially released the strain accumulated on this segment, challenging previous interpretations on a possible rupture of this segment of the fault.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the spatial distribution of surface and subsurface properties over a range of scales is critical for improved prediction of carbon cycling in the Arctic ecosystem. This is the first study to develop a multiscale zonation approach to characterize the spatial variability of geomorphic elements and to assess the relative controls of these elements on land surface and subsurface properties, and carbon fluxes. Working within an Arctic ice-wedge polygonal region near Barrow AK, we consider two-scales of zonation, including polygon features (troughs, centers, and rims of polygons) nested within polygon types (high, flat, and low-centered). The methodology includes (1) delineating polygons using the LiDAR digital elevation map (DEM), (2) identifying data-defined polygon types along the intensive observation transects by applying a clustering method to collocated ground-based geophysical imaging data and above-ground kite-based landscape imaging data, (3) distributing polygon types over the area using the polygon statistics extracted from the LiDAR DEM, and (4) characterizing the carbon fluxes and associated surface-subsurface properties including soil moisture, soil temperature, aqueous geochemistry, thaw depth and normalized difference vegetation index in each polygon type and polygon feature. Results show that nested zonation – polygon types and polygon features – can be used to represent distinct distributions of carbon fluxes and associated properties, as well as co-variability among those properties. Importantly, the results indicate that polygon types have more power to explain the variations in properties, including carbon fluxes, than polygon features. The developed approach is found to be valuable to tractably characterize multiscale zonation over large Arctic ecosystems using multiscale datasets as well as to derive information to assess the variability of the key components in the system, including carbon fluxes. This approach is expected to improve system understanding, site characterization, and parameterization of numerical models aimed at predicting ecosystem feedbacks to the climate.",

            "abstract": "It is commonly acknowledged that there is a source for pickup ions in the inner heliosphere. These so-called inner-source pickup ions are most probably created from solar wind ions interacting with interplanetary dust particles, but a production scenario consistent with all observations has not been found to date. As the composition of inner-source pickup ions should depend on their production, a precise knowledge of this could help identifying the production mechanism. For this purpose the raw pulse-height analysis data from the Charge-Time-Of-Flight (CTOF) sensor of the Charge, ELement, and Isotope Analysis System (CELIAS) on board the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was reanalyzed. An in-flight calibration of the sensor was performed to identify heavy pickup ions by their mass-per-charge. The composition of inner-source heavy pickup ions was derived by a sophisticated statistical assignment of the counts. Finally, this composition was compared to an estimated composition one would expect from a production scenario involving solar wind ions passing through nm-sized dust grains and a good agreement was found. Due to the large geometry factor of CTOF it was also possible to investigate the abundance ratio of the two most prominent inner-source heavy pickup ions, C+ and O+, at different solar wind speeds. A systematic increase of the O+/C+ abundance ratio with higher solar wind speeds was found. This is likely to be a further signature of the production mechanism of inner-source pickup ions.",

            "abstract": "The Yellow Sea (YS) is a semi-enclosed marginal sea located between China and the Korean peninsula. The mouth of the YS is open to the East China Sea. The Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC) has been shown prominent in winter and previous studies suggest that the main force driving the YSWC is northwesterly winds. The northwesterly wind results in sea level differences between northern and southern areas by decreasing and increasing the sea level respectively in the northern and southern areas. The northward pressure gradient induces the northward intrusion of the YSWC. However, the sensitivity tests of the numerical model used in this study show that the YSWC flows into the YS without northerly winds due to the density difference between the northern fresh water and the southern saline Tsushima Current. Model experiments also show that the northward flow of the YSWC is accelerated by the northerly wind in winter. The model used for the sensitivity test is Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. The model grid is 0.1degree horizontal resolution with 40 vertical levels. The sea surface forcing of the model is forced using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis data.",

            "abstract": "In 1975, DSDP Leg 42B to the Black Sea, three sites were drilled with a total of 2318 m cored and a recovery of 55%. While to modern standards this may not be very impressive, these sites still represent the best record of sedimentation in the basinal part of the Black Sea. The main stratigraphic objectives of DSDP Leg 42B were to 1) obtain a complete Pleistocene litho- and biostratigraphic section and 2) study interactions between the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea, focusing on glacio-eustatic sea level change, periods of lacustrine sedimentation, periods of stagnation, and to establish a paleoclimatic record. Major problems establishing a timescale emerged after drilling due to a) the general shortage of definitive paleontological age markers and b) the general lack of agreement on correlation and time zonation of sedimentary units.\nMagnetostratigraphic dating could have solved these timescale problems but was hindered by the presence of the little understood authigenic iron sulphide mineral greigite (Fe3S4) as main magnetic carrier. In recent years, the understanding of greigite has significantly improved and is considered a reliable magnetic carrier. Especially in the circum-Black Sea region, many Miocene to recent, land-based sections are magnetostratigraphically dated with greigite as magnetic carrier. We therefore resample the cores of DSDP Leg 42B to see whether after 40 years of storage any of the original signal is preserved.\nOur results show these cores are surprisingly useful for magnetostratigraphic dating. We create an integrated bio-magnetostratigraphic framework for the sites of Leg 42B, focusing on the Latest Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene. Ar/Ar dating of an ash-layer at site 380A gives additional age constraints. Our age model gives important new insights into the response of the Black Sea to major paleoenvironmental and climatic changes like e.g. the Messinian salinity crisis, the mid-Pliocene warm period and Pleistocene glaciations on the Northern Hemisphere.\nA future IODP expedition to the Black Sea is long overdue and important for paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental processes in central and eastern Europe and also for an array of geochemical studies. Given the chronological constraints are no longer problematic, a repeat of the confusion after the 1970’s expedition seems unlikely.",

Previous studies suggest that the freshwater transported from the South China Sea to the Indonesian Sea affects the magnitude and structure of the Indonesian throughflow, and the strong tidal mixing in the Indonesian Sea alters the time mean vertical structure of the water mass carried from the Pacific to the Indian Oceans. Sea level changes in the eastern Indian Ocean is known to be affected by those in the northwestern Pacific via coastal Kelvin wave propagation through the Indonesian Sea. However, whether the Maritime Continent region influences sea level changes in the eastern Indian Ocean has not been investigated. In this study, we used Argo floats and satellite altimeter data to study the near decadal change of sea level during the 2005-2013 period. We found that the steric sea level change in eastern Indian Ocean cannot be fully explained by either local forcing or the transmission of steric signal from the western Pacific. This implicates the potential role of the Maritime Continent region in regulating sea level changes in the eastern Indian Ocean.\n ",

            "abstract": "Non-linear interactions between landcover and soil moisture affects the partitioning of surface energy fluxes. On the other hand, spatial-temporal variability of soil moisture is dependent on: 1) Variability of meteorological conditions and precipitation events, and 2) Spatial heterogeneity of landcover, geology and topography. For numerical models, heterogeneity is a deterministic source of variability and a possible pattern generator dependent on the modeling scale (grid cell size) of the numerical domain. Modeling scale becomes important as one moves from column models ( related to modeling vertical fluxes) to physically based models with integrated surface-groundwater flows, adding a new dimension of spatial complexity. This study tries to examine how the model scales effect the soil moisture variability and surface-energy fluxes with the inclusion of lateral surface and groundwater flow. We use the hydrological component of the newly developed Terrestrial System Modeling Platform (TerrSysMP) over a subcatchment of Rur in Germany. The hydrological component of TerrrSysMP (TerrSysMP-Hydro) consists of NCAR Community Land Model (CLM) coupled with 3D variably saturated ground water model ParFlow.

Using a whole atmosphere-ionosphere coupled model (GAIA), effects of upward propagating gravity waves on the general circulation in the thermosphere are studied. The GAIA contains the region from the ground surface to the upper thermosphere, so that we can simulate excitation of gravity waves in the lower atmosphere, their upward propagation to the thermosphere, and their impact on the general circulation in the thermosphere. We have recently developed an atmosphere-ionosphere coupled model with high horizontal resolution (about 1 degree longitude by 1degree latitude). In this study, we focus our attention on behaviors of gravity waves in the mesosphere and thermosphere during stratospheric sudden warming event (SSW). The changes of the zonal mean zonal wind in the stratosphere during SSW alter propagation condition of gravity waves from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere. This means that SSW affects behaviors of thermospheric gravity waves. Our simulation result indicates that gravity wave drag in the thermosphere of the winter hemisphere is strongly influenced by SSW. This change of the gravity wave drag also modifies the mean meridional circulation and atmospheric composition in the thermosphere. The impact of the thermospheric gravity wave on the ionosphere during SSW is also discussed.",

Aerosol-cloud interactions are explicitly considered in two prognostic cloud droplet nucleation schemes, i.e., applying an osmotic model and the κ method. The two schemes have rather different effects on cloud properties such as cloud droplet number and size distribution, cloud water content, and cloud optical properties. Much higher cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC) are simulated with the osmotic model compared to the k method, leading to substantially different cloud radiative effects and consequently convection and precipitation, particularly over the continents. The osmotic model simulation yields an about 6.5 W/m2 stronger cooling effect over land than the κ method, with three times higher CDNC. The convective activity in terms of convective available potential energy (CAPE) is decreased by 20%, which corresponds to a decrease in convective precipitation by 23% in favor of large-scale precipitation. Note that in the current model setup only large-scale clouds are directly affected by interactions with aerosols, while in convection and associated precipitation are affected indirectly.",

            "abstract": "To monitor the injected CO2 in the subsurface, seismic monitoring techniques are extensively applied because of its high resolution. Among the seismic monitoring techniques, seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) has high applicability because it can delineate parameter changes by injected CO2. When seismic FWIs are applied, subsurface media can be generally assumed to be isotropic. However, most subsurface media are not isotropic, and shale is a representative anisotropic medium, particularly vertical transversely isotropic (VTI) medium, which is often encountered as a barrier to injected CO2. Thus, anisotropic properties of subsurface media are important for monitoring of injected CO2. For these issues, we need to consider anisotropy of subsurface media when seismic FWIs are applied as a monitoring tool for CO2 sequestration. In this study, we performed seismic FWI for 2-D elastic VTI media to investigate the effects of anisotropic properties in CO2 monitoring. For this numerical test, we assumed a geological model, which copies after one of CO2 storage prospects in Korea. We also applied seismic FWI algorithm for 2-D elastic isotropic media for comparison. From this comparison, we noticed that we can obtain more reliable results when we apply the anisotropic FWI algorithm. Numerical examples indicate that we should apply the anisotropic FWI algorithm rather than the isotropic FWI algorithm when we interpret seismic monitoring data acquired in anisotropic media to increase the success of monitoring for injected CO2. Our numerical results can also be used as references for real seismic monitoring of the Korea CO2 sequestration projects in the near future.  \n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Human Resources Development program (No. 20134010200510) of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) grant funded by the Korean government Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy and by the “Development of Technology for CO2 Marine Geological Storage” grant funded by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries of Korea.",

To reduce seismic risk associated with future earthquakes, accurate ground motion predictions are required, especially for cities located atop sedimentary basins that can trap and amplify these seismic waves. We focus this study on long-period ground motions produced by subduction earthquakes in Japan which have the potential to damage large-scale structures, such as high-rise buildings, bridges, and oil storage tanks. We extracted the impulse response functions from the ambient seismic field recorded by two stations using one as a virtual source, without any preprocessing. This method allows to recover the reliable phases and relative, rather than absolute, amplitudes. To retrieve corresponding Green's functions, the impulse response amplitudes need to be calibrated using observational records of an earthquake which happened close to the virtual source. We show that Green's functions can be extracted between offshore submarine cable-based sea-bottom seismographic observation systems deployed by JMA located atop subduction zones and on-land NIED/Hi-net stations. In contrast with physics-based simulations, this approach has the great advantage to predict ground motions of moderate earthquakes (Mw ~5) at long-periods in highly populated sedimentary basin without the need of any external information about the velocity structure.",

            "abstract": "Coastal adaptation to sea-level rise (SLR) in the deltaic region is a multidimensional and complex process requiring informed decisions based on predicted impact and vulnerability assessment of SLR. Elevation plays a key role in determining the impact and vulnerability of coastal land areas to inundation from SLR. Highly accurate mapping of the elevation of the landscape is essential to identify low-lying coastal deltaic regions with valuable ecosystem like mangroves and its dependent human communities that are potentially at risk of inundation. It is difficult for policy planners and decision makers to identify suitable adaptation strategies without having information on the predicted impact and degree of vulnerability of coastal systems to SLR. Importantly, modeling and mapping will provide valuable input to climate change adaptation planning (NOAA 2010). Unfortunately, the comprehensive range of information that is typically required is seldom available and rarely in the possession of decision makers responsible for management of the deltaic and coastal zone (O’Regan, 1996).\nThe present study seeks to provide insights on predicted impact of climate change induced SLR on mangrove ecosystem and its dependent human communities of Pichavaram mangroves, located at the Vellar-Coleroon estuarine region on the banks of Cauvery delta, Tamil Nadu, India. Based on real-time on-ground elevation measurement by DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System) survey and by using GIS portals, the study has identified about 597 ha of mangroves (one third of total mangrove regions) and about 9 fishing hamlets with 12,000 and more of human population that directly depends on this mangrove ecosystem for their livelihood are under threat of inundation to the predicted impact of 0.5m SLR. The present study is intended to showcase a method by providing reliable scientific information on predicted impact of SLR on mangroves and its dependent human communities to policy planner for informed decision making. Very importantly, this study has made an attempt to develop a robust picture of ecosystem based and community centered anticipatory adaptation strategies to the risk of rising sea level that are grounded in pressing community priorities of coastal regions of Cauvery delta.",

The largest relative moment variation ((ΔM0)max/M0regular) with respect to unperturbed events, the maximum creep velocity (VMax), and the postseismic relaxation time (τ), all systematically increase, along the creeping section of the SAF, toward the area that slipped coseismically during the 2004 Parkfield main earthquake. Postseismic perturbations of the repeats’ seismic moments are up to an order of magnitude larger than the typical seismic moments of the undisturbed events; recurrence times also show a systematic behavior.\nDynamic stress perturbations (increased loading rate of the specific asperities, and/or changes of normal stress across the SAF) are likely to be responsible for the observed variations of the repeats’ seismic moments and recurrence times. In addition to the postseismic response to a large event on the (locked) adjacent portion of the SAF, anomalous responses may be induced by: i) giant events at teleseismic distances (i.e., Sumatra, 2004); ii) strong regional events, within ~100 km (i.e., Loma Prieta, 1989, and Landers, 1992); iii) small earthquakes (M~2) in close vicinity to specific clusters.\nAfter the 2004 Parkfield main shock, the (shallow) clusters of small-magnitude repeats showed the largest relative perturbations, and the largest absolute cumulative slips. We point out an apparent inconsistency between the self-similar source scaling observed in this study, and the slip-moment relationship proposed by Nadeau and Johnson (1998). The model described by Sammis et al. (1999), in which a fractal distribution of asperities describes the seismogenic patches, may be used to explain the mentioned differences in scaling.",

            "abstract": "A semi-analytical model for dispersion of passive scalars from ground sources up to distances of a few hundred meters is presented. Most widely used analytical models are Gaussian models which assume both a uniform wind field and homogeneous turbulence. These assumptions are not valid when ground sources are involved since both the wind and the turbulence depend on height. The model presented here is free of these two assumptions. The formulation of the vertical dispersion is based on approximating the vertical profiles of the wind and the the vertical diffusion coefficient, based on Monin Obukhov Similarity Theory, as power laws. One advantage of this approach is that it allows for non Gaussian vertical profiles of the concentration which better fit the experimental data. For the lateral dispersion the model still assumes a Gaussian form. A system of equations was developed to compute the cloud width. This system of equations is based on an analytical solution of a Langevin equation which takes into account the non-homogeneity of the wind and the turbulence in the vertical direction. The model was tested against two field experiments. Comparison with a Gaussian model showed that it performed much better in predicting both the integrated cross wind ground concentration and the cloud width. Analytical, or semi-analytical models are useful as they are simple to use and require only a short computation time, compared, for example, to Lagrangian Stochastic Models. The presented model is very efficient from the computational point of view. As such it is suitable for cases in which repeated computations of the concentration field are required, as for example in risk assessments and in the inverse problem of source determination.",

For comparative verification, the base and top heights data obtained from ceilometer (CL51) and Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS), respectively were used. During rainfall, the cloud base and top heights observed by the cloud radar were lower than that observed by ceilometer-COMS due to signal attenuation and reflectivity caused by raindrops. The stronger rainfall intensity gets, the more the difference grows. In the case of rainfall, the base and top heights data from cloud radar could be replaced with these obtained data from ceilometer-COMS. In the case of no rainfall, the cloud base and top heights observed by the cloud radar and ceilometer-COMS were relatively similar. The clouds with thin thickness or low density were more effectively observed in cloud radar compared to ceilometer-COMS. Based on these results, in case of rainfall or missing cloud radar data, the ceilometer and COMS data were effectively used to correct the cloud radar data. These corrected cloud data were used to classify the cloud types of low (Cloud base height (CBH) < 2 km), middle (2 km ≤ CBH < 6 km), and high (CBH ≥ 6 km) clouds, and it was shown that the frequency of occurrence for low clouds were highest. When the low clouds were further subdivided, the most common type was shown to be deep precipitable clouds (CBH < 200 m and Cloud top height (CTH) ≥ 2 km), followed by non-precipitable clouds (200 m ≤ CBH < 2 km) and shallow precipitable clouds (CBH < 200 m and CTH < 2 km) in this order.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade numerous glaciers and glacier forelands connected to distal glacier-fed lakes have been mapped and sampled in Scandinavia and in the Arctic with the purpose to obtain high resolution records of past glacier fluctuations. Direct dating of moraines combined with multi proxy analyses of lake sediments is shown to be a powerful tool for robust glacier reconstructions. We have emphasised comparing different sediment parameters by means of statistical methods as well as integrating chronological uncertainties along with uncertainties of reconstructed glacier activity. Here we will present several new and un- published studies showing the potential to use distal glacier-fed lakes to resolve the puzzle of past climate. For the Late-Glacial and early Holocene we present and discuss new data along the Arctic coast of Norway that with its high precision shows that the late glacial culmination occurred around 14.1 followed by rapid retreat of land based glaciers throughout the Late Glacial except from glacier advances during the Intra Allerød Cold period and at the very end of the Younger Dryas time period. For the Neoglacial we will present new data from Lyngen in Arctic Norway towards Svalbard discussing the onset and type of variability as recorded in lake sediment along the coast. For the late Holocene we will present a new high resolution spatiotemporal reconstruction from the small plateau glacier Northern Folgefonna in western Norway covering the last 1200yrs. Reliably proxy reconstructions reflecting seasonal changes in past atmospheric circulation are sparse. However, it is shown that winter accumulation on glaciers in western Norway is highly sensitive to changes in the strength of wintertime westerly winds, which makes them valuable recorders of past atmospheric circulation. Our spatiotemporal reconstruction is based on an integrated study of terrestrial moraine sequences, sub-glacial topography, and multi-proxy records from two distal glacier-fed lakes located at the opposite sides of the glacier in an east-west transect indicating that the” Little Ice Age” was caused by a strengthening of the westerlies.",

Baffin Bay is a sensitive area due to close link between ocean circulation and ice sheet dynamics. In this study, we present high-resolution reconstructions of August sea surface temperatures (aSST) and sea ice cover based on fossil marine diatoms for the time interval 15-10.9 cal. ka BP. A 600 cm-long marine sediment core GeoTü SL-170, recovered from 1 078 m water depth from central Baffin Bay was studied for diatom assemblages on 5 cm intervals. The age-depth model was created by using 8 radiocarbon dates, with an average chronological resolution of 11.3 yr cm-1. The raw diatom data was converted into aSSTs by using the weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) transfer function method and a calibration dataset consisting of 184 surface samples from the North Atlantic and Baffin Bay with 52 diatom species. The sea ice reconstruction was based both on a qualitative method based on the statistically defined occurrence of diatom assemblages (Fragilariopsis spp.) according to their relation to modern surface hydrography, and a quantitative method for May sea ice cover based on the Maximum Likelihood transfer function method. The results show cooling of aSSTs at the onset of Younger Dryas (YD) around 12.6 ka BP. The YD stage ended with gradual warming around 11.7 ka BP when relative abundances of diatom species Thalassiosira Antarctica var. borealis spore and Actinocyclus curvatulus decreased. The final stage of the YD is characterized by a decline of sea ice related species (Fragilariopsis spp.) and a distinctive peak of increased proportion of relatively warmer water species Thalassiosira gravida around 11.4 cal. ka BP.",

We examined the observed fast directions against tilting/rotation of olivine fabric relative to the geometry of the subduction. We found that at the SW edge of the Ryukyu subduction zone the olivine fabric in the subslab mantle must rotate clockwise by 25 degrees from the slab subduction trajectory to explain the observed pattern of shear-wave splitting. This rotation echoes the deformation model of the slab when it is impinging against the Eurasian lithosphere.

Here we focus on ultramafic rocks from two plate interface settings: (I) metasediment-dominated mélange (Cima di Gagnone, CdG, Adula Unit), where eclogite-facies de-serpentinized garnet peridotite and chlorite harzburgite lenses are embedded in paraschist; (II) dominated by high-pressure serpentinite (Erro-Tobbio, ET, and Voltri Units, VU, Ligurian Alps).\nCdG metaperidotite shows low [B], negative δ 11B and high Sr and Pb isotopic ratios. As, Sb loss from metasediment and gain by garnet and chlorite metaperidotite points to exchange between the two systems. Presence of As and Sb in eclogite-facies peridotite minerals and preferential low-T mobility of such elements suggest that exchange was during early subduction burial and prior to eclogitization.\nBased on high [B], positive δ11B, oxygen and hydrogen isotope, the ET serpentinties were recently interpreted as supra-subduction mantle flushed by slab fluids (Scambelluri & Tonarini, 2012, Geology, 40, 907-910). Their 206Pb/204Pb and 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios range between 18.300-18.514 and 0.7048-0.7060, respectively. Compared with ET rocks, VU serpentinites have higher As, Sb (up to 1.3 and 0.39 ppm, respectively) and are enriched in radiogenic Sr (up to 0.7105 87Sr/86Sr). This signature reflects interaction with fluids that exchanged with sedimentary rocks, either in outer rise environments or during accretion atop the slab. In the above cases, the serpentinized mantle rocks fingerprint interaction with fluids from different sources, indicating a timing of accretion to plate interface domains. We provide evidence that serpentinized mantle slices of different size and provenance (slab or wedge) accreted to plate interface domains since early subduction stages. They also represent FME and radiogenic isotope sources for arcs and for deep mantle refertilization.",

            "abstract": "Imaging shallow subsurface structures and monitoring related temporal variations are two of the main tasks for modern seismology. Although many observations have reported temporal velocity changes, e.g., in volcanic areas and on landslides, new methods based on passive sources like ambient seismic noise can provide accurate spatially and temporally resolved information on the velocity structure and on velocity changes. The success of these passive applications is explained by the fact that these methods are based on surface waves which are always present in the ambient seismic noise wave field because they are excited preferentially by superficial sources. Such surface waves can easily be extracted because they dominate the Green´s function between receivers located at the surface.\nFor real-time monitoring of the shallow velocity structure of the Solfatara crater, one the forty volcanoes in the Campi Flegrei area characterized by an intense hydrothermal activity due to the interaction of deep convection and meteoric water, we have installed a dense network of 50 seismological sensing units covering the whole surface area in the framework of the European project MED-SUV. Continuous recordings of the ambient seismic noise over several days as well as signals of an active vibroseis source have been used. Based on a weighted inversion procedure for 3D-passive imaging using ambient noise cross-correlations of both Rayleigh and Love waves, we will present a high-resolution velocity model of the structure beneath the Solfatara crater. We discuss why and how it is possible to perform high precision and real-time monitoring of temporal changes in the properties of the propagation medium at small scales. In particular, we will focus on the depth resolution of the presented approach and further discuss the perspectives of noise-based real-time 4-D tomography.",

            "abstract": "Lake Purrumbete Maar of the Newer Volcanics Province, south-eastern Australia is one of the largest maar volcanoes in the world with a near circular crater up to 2800 m in diameter and hosting a 45 m deep crater lake. Surrounding tephra ring deposits are comprised of cross-bedded fine ash and lapilli-ash deposits typical of efficient subsurface phreatomagmatic eruptive activity. Erupted accessory lithics suggest subsurface phreatomagmatic activity occurred to a depth no greater than 250 m, whilst irregular clast shapes and peperitic textures observed in marl lithics suggest the host rock was poorly consolidated during eruptive activity. To further understand factors controlling Lake Purrumbete Maars immense size, high resolution lake and land-based gravity and magnetic data were collected for use in forward modelling of the subsurface architecture associated with the maar. Collection of gravity data presented a unique challenge due to the nature of measuring small changes in gravitational forces (<1 mGal) associated with the geology of the maar, on an inherently unstable water body. The magnetic anomaly over the maar shows irregular shaped high magnetic anomalies associated with several coalesced eruption points. 2.5-D forward models include five coalesced eruption points and an undulating shallow bowl-shaped diatreme structure, consistent with maars hosted within poorly consolidated sediments. 2.5-D forward models were used to produce a 3-D reference model for property and geometry inversions, to test and optimise the modelled features. Inversions suggest the major vents likely occur to a greater depth than 240 m as suggested in the initial reference model.",

In this system, two fumarolic vents (namely Bocca Grande and Bocca Nuova) are the preferential pathways for hydrothermal fluid uprising. For our goal, the chemistry of VOCs discharged from these sites were compared to that of soil gases. Our results highlighted that C4-C9 alkanes, alkenes, S-bearing compounds and alkylated aromatics produced at depth were the most prone to degradation processes, such as oxidation-reduction and hydration-dehydration reactions, as well as to microbial activity. Secondary products, which were enriched in sites characterized by low soil gas fluxes, mostly consisted of aldheydes, ketons, esters, ethers, organic acids and, subordinately, alcohols. Benzene, phenol and hydrofluorocarbons (HCFCs) produced at depth were able to transit through the soil almost undisturbed, independently on the emission rate of diffuse degassing. The presence of cyclics was possibly related to an independent low-temperature VOC source, likely within sedimentary formations overlying the hydrothermal reservoir. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were possibly due to air contamination. This study demonstrated the strict control of biogeochemical processes on the behaviour of hydrothermal VOCs that, at least at a local scale, may have a significant impact on air quality. Laboratory experiments conducted at specific chemical-physical conditions and in presence of different microbial populations may provide useful information for the reconstruction of the degradation pathways controlling fate and behaviour of VOCs in the soil.",

            "abstract": "Insufficient water quality is one of the main global topics causing risk to human health, biodiversity, and food security. At this, salinization of water and land resources is widely spread especially in arid to semi-arid climates, where salinization, often induced by irrigation agriculture, is a fundamental aspect of land degradation. High salinity is crucial to water use for drinking, irrigation, and industrial purposes, and therefore poses a risk to human health and ecosystem status. However, salinization is also an economic problem, in particular in those regions where agriculture makes a significant contribution to the economy and/or where agriculture is mainly based on irrigation. Agricultural production is exposed to high salinity of irrigation water resulting in lower yields. Hence, not only the quantity of irrigation water is of importance for growing cops but also its quality, which may further reduce the available resources. Thereby a major concern for food production and security persists, as irrigated agriculture accounts for over 30% of the total agricultural production.\nIn this study, the large scale water quality model WorldQual was applied to simulate recent total dissolved solids (TDS) loadings and in-stream concentrations from point and diffuse sources to get an insight on potential environmental impacts as well as risks to food security. Regional focus in this study is on developing countries, as these are most threatened by water pollution. Furthermore, insufficient water quality for irrigation and therefore restrictions in irrigation water use were examined, indicating limitations to crop production. For this purpose, model simulations were conducted for the year 2010 to show the recent status of surface water quality and to identify hotspots and main causes of pollution.\nOur results show that salinity hotspots mainly occur in peak irrigation regions as irrigated agriculture is by far the dominant sector contributing to water abstractions as well as TDS loadings. Additionally, large urban areas are initially loading hotspots and pollution prevention becomes important as point sources are dependent on sewer connection rates. River discharge plays a crucial role due to the dilution potential, especially in semi-arid to arid regions and in terms of seasonal variability.",

Although the information stored in tables is based on a data model and therefore well organized and structured, a direct mashup with RDF based data stored in triple stores is not possible. One solution of the problem consists in the transformation of the whole content into RDF structures and storage in triple stores. Another interesting way is the use of a specific system/service, such as e.g. D2RQ, for the access to relational database content as virtual, read only RDF graphs. The Semantic Web based -proof of concept- GFZ ISDC uses the triple store Virtuoso for the storage of general context information/metadata to geo and space science satellite and ground station data. There is information about projects, platforms, instruments, persons, product types, etc. available but no detailed metadata about the data granuals itself. Such important information, as e.g. start or end time or the detailed spatial coverage of a single measurement is stored in RDBMS tables of the ISDC catalog system only. In order to provide a seamless access to all available information about the granuals/data products a mashup of the different data resources (triple store and RDBMS) is necessary.

            "abstract": "Much effort has been invested in developing snow models over several decades, resulting in a wide variety of empirical and physically-based snow models. Within the two categories, models are built on the same principles but mainly differ in choices of model simplifications and parameterizations describing individual processes. In this study, we demonstrate an informative method for evaluating a large range of snow model structures for hydrological applications using an existing multi-model energy-balance framework and data from two well-instrumented sites with a seasonal snow cover. We also include two temperature-index snow models and one physically-based multi-layer snow model in our analyses. Our results show that the ability of models to predict snowpack runoff is strongly related to the agreement of observed and modelled snow water equivalent whereas such relationship is not present for snow depth or snow surface temperature measurements. For snow water equivalent and runoff, the models seem transferable between our two study sites, a behaviour which is not observed for snow surface temperature predictions due to site-specificity of turbulent heat transfer formulations. Uncertainties in the input and validation data, rather than model formulation, appear to contribute most to low model performances in some winters. More importantly, we find that model complexity is not a determinant for predicting daily snow water equivalent and runoff reliably, but choosing an appropriate model structure is. Our study shows the usefulness of the multi-model framework for identifying appropriate models under given constraints such as data availability, properties of interest and computational cost.",

            "abstract": "Climatic and oceanic perturbations associated with the Deccan Traps eruption and with the Chicxulub impact are still strongly debated. Because lithium isotopes significantly fractionate during low temperature processes, the composition of mineral phases formed across the K-Pg boundary can provide quantitative information concerning environmental changes at that time. In this study, we investigate in parallel the Li isotope composition of both marine authigenic smectite and benthic foraminifera over a time window of 3 Ma. Comparing both phases is important because the d7Li of foraminifera may be subject to vital effects during calcification, while authigenic clays are not. The objectives are: 1/ To determine the long-term variation of seawater d7Li due to changes in continental flux and alteration rate and 2/ To detect short-term variations of the ocean carbon chemistry, recorded by Li isotope fractionation during foraminifera growth.\nLi isotopes are measured in clays by MC-ICP-MS, and in benthic foraminifera tests using the ims 1280 ion microprobe, at University of Hawaii. Initial results show a limited variation (<2‰) of clay d7Li across the Ir-rich layer, indicating little disturbance of the ocean Li at that time. Compared with 0-6 Ma seawater, K-Pg seawater d7Li was 5.5‰ lower. In contast, contemporaneous benthic foraminifera tests vary significantly on time scales much shorter than the oceanic residence time of Li (≈1.5 Ma), too short to attribute to changes in the d7Li of the global ocean Also, these variations precede deposition of the Ir-rich layer. These results strongly suggest changes in Li isotope fractionation through time. The d7Li of cultured foraminifera indicate a strong dependency on the DIC concentration, but no impact of pH and T on Li isotope fractionation during foraminifera growth. If these data are representative of natural conditions, then our results indicate significant short-term oscillations of ocean DIC before Chicxulub, possibly related to eruption events in the Deccan.",

            "abstract": "Anisotropy in the solar wind turbulence is introduced by the presence of a background magnetic field. Recently, it has been shown that the return to isotropy at small scales invoked in the classical fluid turbulence does not hold in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. It is also well known that in the inertial range of solar wind turbulence the spatial inhomogeneity in the fluctuations increases towards small scales, i.e. the intermittency increases with scale. Here, the anisotropy and intermittency in the solar wind magnetic field fluctuations are investigated with Cluster spacecraft observations. The analysis is based on the computation of the magnetic structure function tensor which consists of isotropic and anisotropic terms. This allows to estimate the degree of anisotropy in the magnetic field fluctuations. The structure function tensor is computed as a function of spacecraft separation using a pair of spacecraft. Then the scale dependence of the second and fourth order moments has been studied. We have performed the same analysis up to 50 Hz frequency using single-point measurements. We have found that the anisotropy in the magnetic field is persistent towards small scales and increases up to 1 Hz (around the proton scale). In the higher frequency range the degree of both anisotropy and intermittency tends to become constant. The minimum variance analysis performed in the same frequency range suggests a 3D distribution of the fluctuations in the kinetic range.",

We implemented constant continuous emissions from each location in the model and simulated atmospheric transport and removal via dry and wet deposition processes over 20 years (2010–2030), driven by boundary conditions based on the IPCC A2 future emissions scenario. We present global overall and seasonal risk maps for potential surface layer concentrations and ground deposition of radionuclides, and estimate potential doses to humans from inhalation and ground-deposition exposures to radionuclides. We find that the risk of harmful doses due to inhalation is typically highest in the Northern Hemisphere during boreal winter, due to relatively shallow boundary layer development and limited mixing. Based on the continued operation of the current nuclear power plants, we calculate that the risk of radioactive contamination to the citizens of the USA will remain to be highest worldwide, followed by India and France. By including stations under construction and those that are planned and proposed, our results suggest that the risk will become highest in China, followed by India and the USA.",

Satellite observed SST data provided by NOAA were compared with the in-situ SST data routinely obtained by NFRDI. Match-up data between the satellite and in-situ SSTs were analyzed, and the match-up results showed root mean square errors (RMSEs) of about 1˚C offshore and 2~3˚C onshore. Satellite SST observations have cold bias less than 1˚C offshore and warm bias of 1~3˚C onshore. The difference between the two datasets in the East Sea is smaller compared with the South Sea and the Yellow Sea. The RMSE between the two datasets in the South Sea is 1~2℃. The Satellite SST observations in the Yellow Sea have warm bias of 0.5~1.0℃ in early 1980’s and cold bias of 0.5℃ in early 2010’s. A warming trend is found for the study period, which is 0.024℃/year in the in-situ data and 0.011℃/year in the satellite data. The difference in the long-term trend between the two SST datasets is mainly due to warm bias in the past and cold bias in the present in the satellite data, which can change the warming trend in the Yellow Sea.",

            "abstract": "We observed foreshock activity of an Mw2.2 earthquake (the mainshock) that occurred in a gabbroic dyke at a depth of about 3.3 km from the surface in a deep gold mine in South Africa. Foreshock activity, selectively occurring on a plane on which the mainshock would occur, lasted for at least six months until the mainshock. Rock samples in the mainshock source region were recovered by drilling afterward. Indication of ancient hydrothermal alteration on the rupture plane of the mainshock suggests that the foreshock activity occurred on a pre-existing weakness, probably a healed joint, to nucleate the mainshock. The foreshocks during the three months leading up to the mainshock concentrated to three clusters (F1-F3), which, we interpreted, represent the nucleation at multiple sites. The temporal variation in the foreshock activity in the three months can be well explained by the temporal variation of the stressing state in the source region of the mainshock due to nearby mining. One of these clusters (cluster F2) showed an accelerated activity from about 10 days before the mainshock, while activity over the entire foreshock area was rather constant. The foreshock sources in the final 41 hours, during which the stress state was constant, migrated from F2 to F1 that neighbored to the mainshock hypocenter, suggesting coalescence of the two nuclei. The occurrence of mainshock was 0.4-2.3 days earlier than the time expected from an extrapolation of the accelerated foreshock activity in F2. The nucleation of mainshock may have been advanced to the criticality for dynamic instability in a stepwise manner upon the coalescence of nuclei.\nWhile the heterogeneity of geological structures obscures the straightforward manifestation of self-driven quasi-static nucleation, the present careful analysis suggests that some essence of such nucleation as known from the fracture theory and laboratory experiments was caught in the pre-M2 AE data on a natural joint at a depth of 3.3 km.",

            "abstract": "Around the Boso Peninsula, Japan, slow slip events (SSEs) accompanying earthquake swarms recur with repeating intervals between two to seven years, associated with the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate (PHS) from the Sagami trough beneath the Kanto metropolitan area. These SSEs share an almost identical source area for each episode, which is adjacent to the source area of the Kanto megathrust earthquakes. Because both of the SSEs and the earthquakes are slip events on the same PHS plate interface, understandings on factors that control the recurrence behavior of the SSEs provides important information not only for the nature of the SSEs itself, but also about the slip property on the plate interface.\nThe latest event occurred in January 2014, i.e., it is the shortest interval of 27 months after the previous event in October 2011 (Ozawa, 2014) while the average recurrence interval is 61 months for over 30 years since 1983 (Hirose et al., 2012). Although the recurrence intervals could be modulated by stress changes caused by nearby large earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and its afterslip (Hirose et al., 2012), there is no such large earthquake or other phenomenon that can hasten the latest SSE, and thus other factors are required for the shortening of the interval.\nIn order to clarify factors that control the recurrence intervals, we estimated the source slip processes for the recent SSEs whose crustal deformations have been observed with tiltmeters and GNSS. The 2007 and 2011 SSEs have similar size in seismic moment (Hirose et al., 2014), while the 2014 SSE has a smaller seismic moment than the two previous SSEs. The maximum stress drop for the 2014 SSE is estimated as about 1/2 of those for the 2007 and 2011 SSEs. Although we can not specify mechanisms that hastened the occurrence of the latest SSE, this might suggest that the strength of the source area might have reduced and the slip event occurred at a lower stress level.",

While the simulations reproduced the available experiments on perovskite very well the surprising result for post-perovskite merits testing.\nPost-perovskite CaIrO3 does not show strong anisotropy in Ir-Pt interdiffusivity by either experiment or simulation (2) but the fluoride analogue systems are predicted by ab initio simulations to show very similar anisotropy to MgSiO3 and the difference between perovskite and post-perovskite are, likewise, similar to the silicate system.

            "abstract": "The Red River shear zone (RRSZ) is the most significant geologic discontinuity in Southeast Asia. The Day Nui Con Voi (DNCV) massif at the southernmost part of the shear zone bears records of Cenozoic RRSZ activity. The DNCV in northwestern Vietnam predominantly consists of HP granulite facies metapelites, and lenticular enclaves of HP mafic granulites, calc-silicate granulites and UHT aluminum-rich rocks in the metapelites.\nHP granulites are characterized by the key associations of garnet-kyanite-ternary feldspar (in metapelites) and garnet-clinopyroxene-plagioclase-quartz (in mafic granulites). In the latter case, rocks are typically orthopyroxene-free. The peak assemblage of the HP metapelites includes garnet + kyanite + ternary feldspar + quartz + rutile. The peak assemblage of the HP mafic granulites is garnet + clinopyroxene + plagioclase + quartz. Meanwhile, the peak assemblage of the calc-silicate granulites is high-Ca garnet (Grs>50) + diopside + scapolite + quartz. On the other hand, characteristic UHT metamorphic assemblage occur as the coexistence of spinel and quartz which indicates the metamorphic temperature is higher than 900℃. The peak assemblage of the UHT rocks in DNCV is corundum + spinel + garnet + sillimanite + quartz.\nP-T conditions of peak metamorphism within HP granulite facies are: T = 750～850℃, P = 12.5～14kbar. The temperature of UHT metamorphism is higher than 900℃, the pressure is higher than 9～9.4 kbar.\nSHRIMP U-Pb dating of zircons from the HP mafic granulites and UHT rocks gave minimum ages of ca. 59 Ma and 40 Ma, respectively. HP metapelites gave ca. 60~50Ma and 30Ma. The above facts suggest the DNCV massif experienced HP granulite facies at its peak metamorphism at ∼59 Ma. Thermal disturbance on the local scale to UHT metamorphism occurred at ∼40 Ma. Then isothermal decompression to medium-pressure granulite facies occurred at ∼30Ma, which may reflect a rapid exhumation.\nThe HP rocks are interpreted to be resulted from crustal thickening due to far-field compression during Indian-Eurasian convergence. However the high heat flow for UHT metamorphism was possibly attributed to upwelling of asthenosphere triggered by delamination of the thickened crust. The delamination may also be responsible for subsequent generation of high potassic magmas along the RRSZ belt.",

Governments compile bottom-up inventories from the different source sectors, but top-down measurements of the individual species, such as CO2, are totals. Top-down measurements are required to verify bottom-up inventories based on economic data. We must use other methods, such as analysis of ratios between species and ratios between isotopologues, in addition to model calculations, in order to determine the contributions of the various sectors that are actually observed in the atmosphere. Because of the very large signal in megacities, due to large anthropogenic emissions, these are the ideal regions to study to disentangle the signals from such sources as fossil fuel combustion, including identifying gasoline and natural gas signatures, and the biosphere. In this study, we extend our isotopic study of mid-afternoon flask samples in Pasadena, CA to continuous measurements of CO2 mixing ratios and δ13C in order to understand how the relative contributions of different sources vary with time of day and with time of year. Summers are characterized by larger contributions from natural gas combustion during the afternoons and evenings than during the mornings.",

            "abstract": "For a planet to provide conditions that are conducive for the origin and evolution of life, it is required to host liquid water and other volatile elements and compounds. The details of the planet forming processes starting from the condensation of matter in the solar nebula to the accretion of planets are, however, still elusive. Specifically, how planets like Venus, Earth, and Mars acquired their volatile element content, although they formed so close to the Sun and inside the snowline of the early solar system is a matter of the current scientific debate.\nTo constrain the origin and addition of moderately to highly volatile components to the rocky planets of the inner solar system we studied the variation of the isotopes of the highly volatile, chalcophile, and siderophile element selenium (Se) and its abundance in different early solar system materials, planetesimals, and planets. Selenium is depleted within the Silicate Earth relative to CI , but in chondritic-relative abundance to siderophile elements like S and Te (Wang and Becker, 2013). The latter might reflect the accretion of a chondritic ‘late veneer’ after core formation which might also be the dominant source of water and carbon.\nThe Se isotope composition (δ82/76Se) of ordinary and iron meteorites and a terrestrial sample (Green River Shale, SGR-1, USGS) were found to be identical within the measurement uncertainty. If the depletion of volatile elements on Earth were exclusively caused by removal during core formation and/or evaporation during planet formation, a strongly Se-depleted and isotopically fractionated silicate reservoir would be expected. The relatively uniform δ82/76Se values between different groups of meteorites and the terrestrial value point to a later addition of volatiles to Earth from a source that contained unfractionated Se isotopes and thus originates most likely from a region within the solar system where the volatile elements and compounds condensed quantitatively.\nWang, Z., Becker, H., 2013. Ratios of S, Se and Te in the silicate Earth require a volatile-rich late veneer. Nature 499, 328-331.",

            "abstract": "Using the GPS data obtained from dual-frequency GPS receivers in New Zealand, we have made two-dimensional maps of total electron content (TEC) in 2012 in order to reveal statistical characteristics of MSTIDs at mid-latitudes in southern hemisphere. As of 2012, approximately 40 GPS receivers are in operation in New Zealand. We found that most of the MSITDs over New Zealand propagate northwestward during nighttime in summer and northeastward during daytime in winter. The propagation direction of the nighttime MSTIDs is consistent with the theory that polarization electric fields play an important role in the generating MSTIDs. Because the daytime MSTIDs propagate equatorward, we can speculate that they could be caused by atmospheric gravity waves in the thermosphere. The propagation direction of the daytime MSTIDs also has an eastward component in addition to the equatorward component. This feature is consistent with the daytime MSTIDs observed at mid-latitudes in both northern and southern hemispheres. By carrying out model calculations, we have shown that the eastward component of the MSTID propagation direction during daytime is attributed to an interaction of gravity waves to the background neutral winds. Because most of the daytime MSTIDs appear before 14 LT, the background neutral winds could blow westward. According to the dispersion relation for atmospheric gravity waves, vertical wavelength of the gravity waves becomes larger when the gravity wave propagates in the direction opposite to the background winds. Consequently, the gravity waves having an eastward component of the propagation direction could cause larger amplitude of TEC variations compared to the gravity waves propagating westward. This could be a reason why the propagation direction of the dime MSTIDs has an eastward component.",

            "abstract": "The convecting mantle represents Earth’s largest reservoir for volatile storage on geological timescales. Continuous outgassing in volcanic settings worldwide indicates that volatile recycling during subduction of oceanic crust is critical for the maintenance of mantle volatile contents. Subducting basaltic crust initially contains a cocktail of volatiles, but it loses effectively its entire water cargo as hydrous fluids between 70 and 300 km depending on slab temperature [1], which may leave a residual anhydrous carbonated MORB assemblage. The fate of this carbon during subduction to greater depths is important geologically due to its potential role in causing mantle melting and metasomatism. Large discrepancies exist among studies of carbonated eclogite, and results are scarce beyond 10 GPa. Here we present results of experiments on MORB containing 2.5 wt.% CO2between 3 and 21 GPa.\nWe observe a subsolidus phase assemblage dominated by garnet, clinopyroxene and SiO2 at all pressures. At pressures lower than 7 GPa CO2 is the stable carbon phase in all runs due to the reaction dol + 2coes = cpx + CO2 [2]. Solid dolomite, magnesite and/or Na2(Ca,Mg,Fe)4(CO3)5 are observed in subsolidus experiments at higher pressure. Near-solidus melts above 7 GPa are carbonatites, with Ca# > 0.5 and alkali contents that increase with pressure. The solidus temperature of 1200 °C at 3 GPa rises to 1375 °C at 13 GPa. At higher pressure the melting temperature drops sharply by > 200 °C to ~ 1150 °C. This creates a ledge in the solidus at 13 – 15 GPa, just above or within the uppermost transition zone, which coincides with the appearance of Na2(Ca,Mg,Fe)4(CO3)5. Temperature paths for the majority of worldwide slabs [3] intersect this ledge and produce carbonatite melt that will metasomatise the overlying mantle, potentially causing a region of increased diamond formation. Only material in the coldest slabs will pass beneath the ledge and carry carbon deeper into the Earth. Thus, this ledge may act as a carbon filter for downgoing slabs, and might be responsible for some low velocity anomalies seen above the 410 km seismic discontinuity.\n[1] Maruyama & Okamoto (2007) Gond Res 11, 148-165.

            "abstract": "As several ocean and climate models predict a decline in dissolved ocean oxygen concentrations associated with future global warming [1], recent research is increasingly focusing on past episodes of low ocean oxygen levels. Trace metals are generally enriched in organic‐rich sediments deposited under such low oxygen conditions, and the concentration and isotopic signatures of several of these elements (e.g. Mo, U, Cr) may be applied as proxies to reconstruct the processes involved in these redox changes [2,3]. This project investigates the use of the molybdenum isotope system as a proxy for redox changes during an interval of abrupt environmental change spanning the Paleocene/Eocene boundary (the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum, PETM, ~56 Ma). The PETM is characterized by global warming and environmental and ecological changes including decreased ocean oxygen levels [4]. Study of the PETM can therefore offer us a valuable insight into how marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles may respond to future climate changes, and the predicted decrease of oxygen concentrations in seawater. The molybdenum concentrations and isotope compositions of organic-rich sediments spanning the PETM have been obtained from a Jordan oil shale drill core (OS-28). The obtained δ98/95Mo isotopic ratios range between -0.12‰ and 1.59‰ and coincide with significant fluctuations in trace metal abundances. The data together demonstrate that the global environmental changes associated with the PETM were manifest in the Jordanian basin as significant changes in basin hydrography and dissolved oxygen levels.",

            "abstract": "Six years of high resolution pCO2, water quality, and meteorological data were used to calculate air-sea CO2 fluxes on yearly, seasonal and monthly timescales, and relate the temporal and spatial variation in CO2 fluxes to meteorological events and land derived inputs.\nThree MAPCO2 buoys are deployed in coastal waters of Oahu as part of the NOAA/PMEL Carbon Program, that autonomously collects CO2 and water quality data at 3-hour intervals. The buoys are located on a backreef in Kaneohe Bay and two fringing reef sites on Oahu's south shore, the latter two in open ocean like conditions but with one also influenced by fluvial inputs.\nData for this study were collected from June 2008 to July 2014. Mean pCO2 values at the Ala Wai, Kilo Nalu and CRIMP2 buoys were 396, 381 and 447µatm, respectively, with mean daily ranges of 51, 32 and 190 µatm, respectively. The daily range in pCO2 is largest at CRIMP2, reflecting a combination of higher primary production and respiration, vigorous calcification and longer water residence time within the barrier reef environment.\nNet annualized air-sea CO2 fluxes of the entire study period were 0.083, -0.014 and 1.167 mol C m-2 year-1 for Ala Wai, Kilo Nalu and CRIMP2, respectively. Positive values indicate a CO2 flux from the water to the atmosphere (source behavior), and negative values from the atmosphere to the water (sink behavior).\nThis presentation will also discuss the effects physical and biogeochemical processes on the magnitude and variability of air-sea CO2 fluxes. We observe a negative correlation between CO2 flux and rainfall over monthly, seasonal, and annual timescales. This correlation however, can partly be explained by temperature, because increased rainfall is more common during the colder winter months. Nevertheless, rainfall affects CO2 fluxes, both by rain-induced nutrient and organic matter runoff, as well as the physical effect of raindrops on air-sea gas exchange and the dilution of the air-sea boundary layer. We report that air-sea CO2 fluxes are highly variable on short time scales, and that Kilo Nalu and Ala Wai are weak sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, although after rainstorms and certain months in the winter season, the flux direction can reverse they become weak sinks for CO2.",

            "abstract": "Since the first cGPS have been installed in 1997 in the Guerrero-Oaxaca region of the Central American subduction zone in Mexico, several slow slip events (SSE) have been observed there. Further studies showed that the SSE characteristics are disparate in Guerrero and Oaxaca in terms of duration, amplitude and depth. In particular, recent investigations show that the slip during SSE intrudes the seismogenic zone in Guerrero, but barely in Oaxaca. The SSE lateral and depth extent has important implications on the seismic cycle. It affects the redistribution of stress (increasing or decreasing it) within the seismogenic zone, thus the timing and magnitude of future earthquakes.  It is thus important to constrain a degree of coupling on the subduction interface and how the coupling evolves in space and time. This can be achieved by refining coupling models based on the observations and exploring a sensitivity of the models to variations of their main parameters.\nTo better understand the effect of the SSE on the seismic cycle along the Mexican subduction zone, we analyze cGPS data and invert the time series, using a method based on a principal component analysis: PCAIM (Principal Component Analysis-based Inversion Method). For both Guerrero and Oaxaca areas, we first discuss the geometry of the plates’ interface. Then we investigate in particular the effect of possible lateral and down-dip variations of the subduction interface on coupling models. Subsequent modeling using the PCAIM of the sequential SSEs that occurred in the past decade permitted to compare our results with the inferences of previously published works. We present the first analysis of the latest large SSE that started in January 2014 in Guerrero. We show that the PCAIM allows to describe a complex slip history in space and time of different SSEs and to provide a comparative analysis of behavior of the individual SSEs. We then discuss the potential interplay between SSE in Guerrero and Oaxaca, and the link between them and seismicity. Finally, we interpret our coupling map in terms of slip budget and seismic hazard in Guerrero and Oaxaca areas.",

            "abstract": "Model error, despite its varied sources, is typically written as a stochastic noise term for the purposes of data assimilation (DA). Accounting for model error improves uncertainty quantification and is essential in sequential DA in order to prevent filter divergence. The two most common techniques for dealing with model error are multiplicative inflation and additive noise. In the context of ensemble methods, we propose a novel approach based on the square root methodology developed for the EnKF analysis step, which we duplicate into the forecast step. The technique boils down to a right-multiplication by a \"transform matrix\", and is a particularly benign update mechanism thanks to its linearity. Further advantages include covariance structure preservation, modularity, and a minimal ensemble disarrangement (optimal transport) quality. Benchmarks from twin experiments with simple, prototype, nonlinear dynamics indicate improved performance over additive and multiplicative techniques.",

Major future eruptions will occur, but their size or timing cannot be predicted. How could global society prepare for, and react to, such emergencies?\nOne possibility is deliberate, coordinated emissions of short-lived greenhouse gases, along a pathway designed to match the climate responses to the eruption. We estimate such an emission pathway, countering a hypothetical eruption three times the size of Mt Pinatubo in 1991. Using a global climate model to evaluate global and regional responses to the eruption, with and without counter emissions, we show that it may be possible to counteract its climate effects, significantly dampening the abrupt impact of the eruption.\nWe then raise practical, financial and ethical aspects related to such a strategy. Designed emissions to counter temporary global cooling would not have the disadvantages associated with more commonly discussed geoengineering to avoid long-term warming. Nevertheless, implementation would still face significant challenges.",

            "abstract": "Yuan et al. (2013) developed a 3D radially anisotropic shear wave model of North America (NA) upper mantle based on full waveform tomography, combining teleseismic and regional distance data sampling the NA. In this model, synthetic seismograms associated with regional events (i.e. events located inside in the region imaged NA) were computed exactly using the Spectral Element method (Cupillard et al., 2012), while, synthetic seismograms associated with teleseismic events were performed approximately using non-linear asymptotic coupling theory (NACT, Li and Romanowicz, 1995). Both the regional and the teleseismic dataset have been inverted using approximate sensitivity kernels based upon normal mode theory. Our objective is to improve our current model and to build the next generation model of NA by introducing new methodological developments (Masson et al., 2014) that allow us to compute exact synthetic seismograms as well as adjoint sensitivity kernels associated with teleseismic events, using mostly regional computations of wave propagation. The principle of the method is to substitute a teleseismic source (i.e. an earthquake) by an “equivalent” set of seismic sources acting on the boundaries of the region to be imaged that is producing exactly the same wavefield. Computing the equivalent set of sources associated with each one of the teleseismic events requires a few global simulations of the seismic wavefield that can be done once for all, prior to the regional inversion. Then, the regional full waveform inversion can be preformed using regional simulations only. We present a 3D model of NA demonstrating the advantages of the proposed method.",

Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) enables measurement of Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios in situ at micro-scales on standard thin sections. Because melt composition and structure affect Fe3+/ΣFe, XAS measurements of unknowns require calibration standards with like compositions. To address this need, a suite of 33 synthetic glass standards covering a wide range of geologically-relevant compositions was generated under four varying fO2conditions.\nRuns were conducted in a 1-atm gas mixing furnace using the Pt (fO2 ≥ QFM) or Re (fO2 < QFM) wire-loop technique. Air, MH (CO2), QFM, and IW were used to equilibrate each composition, with fO2 values fixed by gas mixing or use of a solid buffer. Samples were then prepared for Mössbauer and XAS analyses, with Fe2+/Fe3+values from the former used to calibrate the latter using a multivariate model. XAS data were acquired both at NSLS beamline x26a and at the GSECARS beamline (13-ID) at APS.\nOver the compositional range from andesite (7.1-11.8 wt.% FeO and 53.6-55.9 wt. SiO2) to basaltic andesite (4.6-7.9 wt.% FeO and 58.8-62.4 wt. SiO2) to basalt (6.8-11.0 wt.% FeO and 47.9-50.7 wt. SiO2), Fe3+ contents of glasses equilibrated at each buffer are comparable, as expected. Those samples equilibrated in air are ~89±2% Fe3+, in CO2, ~77±3 Fe3+, and in QFM and IW, ~11±4% Fe3+. Predictive models (e.g., Kilinc et al., 1983) suggest that the increased SiO2 concentrations in dacites and rhyolites result in increased Fe3+ at higher fO2s (Figure 1). Our data support this prediction; e.g., dacites with 67.1-71.6 wt.% SiO2 at IW are 20±10%Fe3+. Once synthesized and characterized, these equilibrated glasses will form the basis for multivariate analysis of XAS spectra that will provide a broad calibration for measuring Fe3+ in silicate glasses at any synchrotron facility.",

            "abstract": "At the high-frequency end of the inertial range, the solar wind turbulence power spectrum was recently found to be anisotropic with respect to the direction of local magnetic field, as an evidence for the presence of a “critical balance” style turbulence cascade. However, we find that the spectral anisotropy seems to result from intermittent structures. The following two independent studies corroborate this statement by showing that the power spectra of the background turbulence, in which there are no intermittent structures, have an isotropic nature. In Study 1, we remove the wavelet coefficients of the local intermittency with large partial variance increment (PVI), and find the spectral indices of the magnetic field are 1.63±0.02, independent of the angle θRB between the direction of the local background magnetic field and the radial direction. In Study 2, we make a statistical study on the magnetic field spectral indices obtained by using Fast Fourier Transform on 40 time series, in which no intermittent structures appear. We find that for the time series with 0o<θRB <6o, the probability distribution of the observed spectral indices peaks at -1.7, while the -2 index predicted by the “critical balance” theory rarely appears. For the time series with 84 o <θRB <90 o, the probability distribution of the indices peaks at -1.5. Considering the uncertainty of the statistics, these results show that the background-turbulence spectra are nearly isotropic with respect to θRB, which may be consistent with some explanations based on hydrodynamic turbulence theory.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the relations between climate indexes and high runoff is of importance for seasonal flood forecasting and non-stationary flood frequency analysis. This study aims to investigate the relationship between three climate indexes (PDO, SOI and EASMI) that are of influence, and high runoff events for the Lanjiang River Basin, East China. To accomplish this aim, the relationships between precipitation and runoff, precipitation and three climate indexes, runoff and three climate indexes at Jinhua and Quzhou stations in the basin are studied. The linear and multiple regression methods are used to compute Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. The final results show that both Jinhua and Quzhou have a positive high relationship between precipitation and runoff. Generally, a rainfall event with lag time of zero days and a temporal resolution of three days is sufficient to gain an optimal correlation value. The relationship between the PDO index and the precipitation is found to be positively significant for both areas but the relationship between the PDO and the runoff at Jinhua is not significant any more. The optimal temporal resolution for Jinhua starts at 9.5 years and for Quzhou at 14 years, both with a lag time of 1.5 years. For the long term, the SOI index has a negative relationship with the precipitation. The relationship between the precipitation and the EASMI index is negatively significant for Quzhou but not significant for Jinhua. The multiple regression showed that for most combinations of climate indexes, the correlations between climate indexes and precipitation or runoff are higher than the linear regression.",

            "abstract": "Due to the large emission of gas and ash particles into the atmosphere, volcanic eruptions are among the most important sources of natural pollution. The size, density and shape of volcanic ash particles determine their residence time in the atmosphere that varies from minutes (for particles with radius larger than 100 μm) to weeks (for particles smaller than 10 μm). The interest in determining the abundances of these particles is high because of their effects on the environment, climate, public health and aviation. A practical consequence after the recent 2010 Eyjafjallajökull (Iceland) eruption, was the introduction of a volcanic ash concentration threshold to reduce the level of flight disruption whilst ensuring the passenger safety. This requirement forces the scientific community to develop novel techniques to obtain reliable results in real time. On the other hand, from the research point of view, an accurate estimation of the volcanic ash emissions can also yield insights into magmatic processes which control volcanic activity during the eruptive phases.\nWorldwide volcanic activity is observed with a variety of ground and space-based instruments that offer advantages and drawbacks. Because doesn’t exist a single system able to give a comprehensive description of a particular phenomenon, an integrated approach based on the use of different types of remote sensing data is required. This approach is the core of the Multi-platform volcanic Ash Cloud Estimation (MACE) procedure that will be developed within the European FP7-APHORISM project.\nIn this is work the measurements obtained from the geostationary MSG-SEVIRI, the polar Terra/Aqua MODIS and the ground-based weather RADAR instruments are integrated thus blending infrared and microwave ash estimation techniques from space and ground platforms. The expected outcomes are the improvements of the volcanic ash retrievals (mass, aerosol optical depth, effective radius, concentration, size distribution, cloud altitude and thickness) and a better characterization of the volcanic eruption.\nAs test case the Mt. Etna (Sicily-Italy) volcano lava fountaining event of the 23 November 2013 has been considered.",

In this work, effects of magnetic field configuration on the day-night asymmetry of chorus occurrence rate are investigated using a recently developed hybrid code DAWN. Previous observations demonstrate that dayside chorus occur in regions where background magnetic field is almost homogeneous, suggesting that the magnetic field configuration might play a significant role in the dayside chorus excitation. Using the DAWN code, we numerically study the threshold conditions of hot electron distributions to excite chorus waves with different magnetic field configurations. Our results demonstrate that in a magnetic field with smaller inhomogeneity, smaller temperature anisotropy and hot electron density are needed to excite chorus waves. This conclusion could help understand the higher occurrence rate of chorus waves on the dayside compared with that on the nightside especially during quiet times.",

            "abstract": "Results of three-dimensional hydro-mechanical-chemical (HMC) pore-scale simulations of fractures in siliciclastic rocks are presented. The coupled processes of pressure-solution at contacting asperities, diffusion of dissolved mass in the pore-fluid, and precipitation-dissolution at the free pore space, are modelled in pore and contact regions defined by self-affine fracture surfaces under confining pressure. The governing equations derive from the Boussinesq solution for elastic contact between rough surfaces and diffusion-reaction equations. No constitutive relationships are assumed relating dissolution/precipitation to changes in surface geometry and contact area; these changes arise as a direct result of the simulation. Results are compared against existing conceptual models derived from pressure solution experiments to assess the effect of scale dependency, and against theoretical models to assess the effect of assuming an idealized surface geometry. Results suggest that when using realistic stress distributions, local concentration of contact pressure leads to rapid compaction at early times, compared to the lower dissolution rates obtained by applying averaged pressures. The geomechanical model confirms that the increase in contact area reduces the energy available to deform the free fracture surface, thereby reducing elastic compaction, and leading to a non-linear relationship between dissolved asperity height, pore-volume, and transmissivity. The complex effect on static friction is discussed by quantifying two contrasting phenomena: the increase in contact area over which adhesive forces act, and the concurrent reduction in surface roughness that is responsible for interlocking between the surfaces.",

A line of bathymetric highs running subparallel to this recent volcanic front was observed ~20 km to the east. A set of small, sharply defined magnetic anomalies extends southward from this line of bathymetric highs to the islands Kume-jima and Aguni-jima, suggesting the former existence of an ancient volcanic front. The ages of volcanic rocks from these islands indicate that magmatic activity along the ancient volcanic front continued until at least ~2.1 Ma. The presence of magnetic anomalies between the two volcanic fronts suggests that the volcanic front has moved gradually westward. This shift can be explained by the termination of asthenospheric upwelling and/or the rapid retreat of the Ryukyu Trench after its change in subduction direction.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric thermal pollution in densely populated areas is recognized as a severe problem with consequences for human health, and considerable efforts are being taken to mitigate heat stress in cities. However, anthropogenic activities also influence the thermal environment beneath the ground level, with commonly growing temperatures that affect groundwater ecology and geothermal use efficiency. In our work, we identify the controlling mechanisms for the long-term evolution of such urban heat islands. The shallow groundwater temperatures in several central European cities such as Cologne, Karlsruhe, Munich, Berlin and Zurich were mapped at high spatial and temporal resolution. Thermal anomalies were found to be highly heterogeneous with local hot spots showing temperatures of more than 20°C. Accordingly, these urban regions show a considerable groundwater warming in comparison to undisturbed temperatures of 8-11°C. Examination of potential heat sources by analytical modelling reveals that increased ground surface temperatures and basements of buildings act as dominant drivers for the anthropogenic heat input into the groundwater. The factors are revealed to be case-specific and they may have pronounced local or regional effects. Typical local factors are for example buried district heating networks. In selected cities we find that the average urban heat flux is around one order of magnitude higher than the elevated ground heat flux due to recent climate change. Additionally, such as observed in Zurich, naturally controlled temperature variations can be substantial and they are shown to wash out anthropogenic thermal footprints.",

The collision between them resulting in Taiwan orogeny, and forming a fold-and-thrust belt aglined in nouth-south direction. Therefore, the western plains and foothills of Taiwan have formed by the action of the north-south strike reverse faults in the belt. More to the west, the age of fault is younger , and the dip is smaller. These structure lines will extend south to Kaoping area. Most geologists believe that the youngest Changhua fault extends southly to Tainan area, but becomes fragmented further to south; therefore, fault line is hard to located especially in Tainan area. According to the reflection seismic profiles, in the continental slope offshore the Tainan and Kaohsiung areas, some researchers believe the paleo-trace of the Manila Trench can be extending northwards and connected to the Changhua fault, marking a deformation front going from land to ocean floor. However, their conclusions lack nearshore topographical and geophysical data such that the doublt has been prevailed to support the Manila Trench was previously located in Taiwan Orogon. Therefore, nearshore geophysical survey was conducted off Tainan coast, firstly, the R2 Multi-beam Sounder was used and the significant topographical lineations related with those geological structures shown onland Tainan are found. Besides, by using 3.5kHz bottom profiler, the dislocation in shallow sediments is also dominant. This study indicates there is less evidence to suggest the deformation front formed along Taiwan Isand can extends offshore into the continental slope and shall connect with the Manila Trench.\nKey words: deformation front, fold-and-thrust belt, Manila trench , geophysical prospecting",

            "abstract": "Glossy, highly smooth surfaces, recently termed Fault Mirrors (FMs), are commonly observed on exposed fault-zones. At least for carbonate faults, TEM investigation of FMs indicates that they are composed of a thin layer of ultra-fine, nano-size grains (Siman-Tov et al., 2013). Recent carbonate shearing experiments suggest FMs form during seismic slip and may serve as seismic indicators. To explore the formation and destruction of FMs we performed rotary shear experiments on experimental fault surfaces in three types of limestone. The experiments were conducted at slip-velocities ranging between V=0.001-0.7 m/s, and normal stress up to 1.5 MPa. FMs started to develop when the slip velocity exceeded a few cm/s, and fault coverage by FMs increased systematically with velocity, reaching ~ 50% of fault surface at V=0.6 m/s. No FMs developed at V~<3 cm/s, and importantly, pre-existing FMs were destroyed at these low velocities. The measured friction coefficient, μ, was found to be inversely correlated with the FM coverage: μ~0.8 for no-FM, low velocity, and μ~0.4 for 50% FMs coverage at high velocity. The analysis of the experimental thermal conditions and SEM FM images suggests that the FMs form by sintering of gouge nano-grains in a process similar to industrial 'hot pressing'. We propose that formation and destruction of FMs is indicative of a thermally and mechanically controlled brittle–ductile transition: destruction of the highly smoothed fault mirrors is caused by brittle wear at relatively low temperature, while their formation is controlled by ductile deformation at higher temperature. We further suggest that the observed velocity weakening at high velocity is caused by formation of an extremely localized and ductile nano-slip zone that reduces friction. Based on these results we conclude that the presence of fault mirrors along natural carbonate faults indicates that the fault slipped at seismic velocities and had weakened during the slip event, and also in some cases may indicate that the fault has not crept since the earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Increasing temperatures are projected to have a positive effect on the length of Alaska’s tourism season, but the natural attractions that tourism relies on, such as glaciers, wildlife, fish, or other natural resources, may change. In order to continue to derive benefits from these resources, nature-based tour operators may have to adapt to these changes, and communication is an essential, but poorly understood, component of the climate change adaptation process. The goal of this study was to determine how to provide useful climate change information to nature-based tour operators by answering the following questions: 1. What environmental changes do nature-based tour operators perceive? 2. How are nature-based tour operators responding to climate and environmental change? 3. What climate change information do nature-based tour operators need? To answer these questions, twenty-four nature-based tour operators representing 20 different small and medium sized businesses in Juneau, Alaska were interviewed. The results show that many of Juneau’s nature-based tour operators are observing, responding to, and in some cases, actively planning for further changes in the environment. The types of responses tended to vary depending on the participants’ certainty in climate change and the perceived risks to their organization. Using these two factors, this study proposes a framework to classify climate change responses for the purpose of generating meaningful information and communication processes that promote adaptation and build adaptive capacity. During the course of the study, several other valuable lessons were learned about communicating about adaptation. The results of this study demonstrate that science communication research has an important place in the practice of promoting and fostering climate change adaptation. While the focus of this study was tour operators, the lessons learned may be valuable to other organizations striving to engage unique groups in climate change adaptation planning efforts and to social scientists trying to understanding of the role of communication in climate change adaptation.",

During the last 7 million years the basin alternately was flooded and fell dry. Therefore, up to 2.5 km thick lacustrine and ancillary continental deposits are found which provide an unique archive of climatic changes and paleo-climatic events.\nPlans exist to analyze the sedimentary record with regard to the paleo-climate in the Mediterranean as well as on a global scale within a scientific drilling project.\nIn preparation for the future drilling activities, controlled-source seismic measurements are used to investigate the structure of the Baza Basin and to find local zones of neo-tectonic deformation bounding the basin to the west (Baza fault).\nIn October 2013 a seismic reflection experiment was carried out in the center of the Baza Basin. A net of three 2D seismic profiles was arranged crossing the basin and the bounding fault system. A vibroseis source (two vibrators with 200 kN peak force each) was used with a source point distance of 60 m along each of the 18 km long profiles. Eight sweeps with a frequency range of 8 ­- 100 Hz were conducted at each source point. The seismic wavefield was recorded by a cable-free acquisition system of more than 330 continuously operating digital data recorders. The receivers were spread along the currently active profile with a spacing of 20 m. They were moved in a roll-along-configuration to mainly cover the near-field offsets of the source points. The seismic data of the three profiles were conventionally processed so far. Tomographic inversion of the first arrivals (P-waves) provide additional information.\nThe images show the asymmetrical basin geometry. Several seismic sequences and the basement can be identified. Furthermore, the Baza fault system and a series of other - previously unknown - faults can be seen.",

GWs are short scale free waves while STs are global scale and thermally driven. Mostly exited in the lower atmosphere and propagating upward, GWs and STs form the main constituents of the dynamical coupling between troposphere and MLT.\nGWs and STs incorporate a huge range of scale, from small to global. But conventional GWs parameterizations used to describe this interaction neglect time-dependence and horizontal gradients of the background flow, with potentially fatal effects. We here consider a step-by-step approach to study the GWs and diurnal STs interaction.\nGWs propagate in a time-dependent background flow, modeled by a new WKB GW model (ray tracer scheme) where the crossing of rays (caustic problem) is prevented. Climatological mean (which include stationary planetary waves) and diurnal tidal fields extracted initially from a general circulation model (HAMMONIA) compose the background flow. The deposition of momentum and buoyancy from the GWs propagation is calculated. The evaluated Rayleigh-friction and temperature-relaxation coefficients impose in turn a GW forcing on the propagation of diurnal STs in a climatological mean background flow. The propagation of STs is described in a linear version of a general circulation model (KMCM), allowing for planetary waves in the background state. The extracted STs are then used for a new computation of the GW fluxes. This is iterated a few times to obtain a converged result on GW fluxes and STs.\nA simplified GWs ensemble is considered, homogenously launched in all directions, at a single launch level. STs are projected onto their migrating and non-migrating components DS0, DE[1,2,3] and DW[1,2,3]. The temporal dependence of the background flow leads to a modulation of the GWs momentum deposition. Due to constructive and destructive interferences, planeraty waves play an active role in the modulation of the GW fluxes but they also influence the DS0 and DW[1,2] amplitudes. Because transient critical layers disappear, the horizontal and temporal dependence of the background flow reduce the amplitude of GW momentum and entropy. In concequence, the amplitude of the STs is also reduced. The seasonal variability of the GWs-STs interaction is studied as well.",

            "abstract": "Fluvial discharge from the rivers is viewed as a missing piece in the inventory of the radionuclides in the ocean during the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FNPP). The land-derived input introduces a time lag behind the direct release through hydrological process because these radionuclides mostly attach to suspended fine particles (sediments) that are transported quite differently to the dissolved matter. Therefore, we implement a sediment transport model proposed by Blaas et al. (2007) consisting of a multi-class non-cohesive sediment transport model, a wave-enhanced bed boundary layer model, and a stratigraphy model into ROMS. A 128 x 256 km domain with the grid resolution of dx = 250 m centered at FNPP is configured as a test bed embedded in the existing ROMS model domain at dx = 1 km (Uchiyama et al., 2012, 2013). A spectral wave model SWAN at dx = 1 km nested in the JMA GPV-CWM wave reanalysis is used for the wave forcing field. A surface runoff model (Toyota et al., 2009) provides daily-mean discharges and associated sediment fluxes at the mouths of 20 rivers in the study area.\nThe model results show that bed stresses are enhanced in the coastal area about 10 to 20 km from the shore, most part of the semi-sheltered Sendai Bay, and on the continental shelf slope at about 600 m deep. In contrast, band-like structures are formed between the nearshore and the shelf slope where bed stresses are found to be modest. This low stress bands correspond to the areas where fine particles such as silt and clay are predominant in the bed. Since the cesium 137 is quite readily attached to fine particles rather than coarse sediments (sand), this result suggests that the band acts as a hot spot of the sediment-attached radionuclides. Indeed, a qualitative correlation is found between the low stress band with high radioactivity of cesium 137 in the bed sediment off FNPP based on the field measurement (Ambe et al., 2013).",

            "abstract": "Glacial/deglacial sea ice variations in the Southern Ocean are suggested to be an important factor impacting ocean’s surface structure and biological productivity and thus controlling glacial/interglacial changes in atmospheric CO2. However, the description of involved mechanisms and their implication on nutrient cycling and biological productivity remains incomplete.\nIsotope measurements on siliceous microorganisms (diatoms and radiolarians) provide a means of reconstructing past changes in nutrient utilization and surface water structure, thus provide information on past biological and physical properties crucial to better describe and model the mechanisms regulating glacial/interglacial variability in CO2 draw down in the Southern Ocean. As diatoms belong to the phytoplankton, they present a sea surface signal. Radiolarians, by contrast, are siliceous zooplankton distributed from surface to deep waters and their stable isotope signals can provide information about deeper water layers.\nHere, we specify Southern Ocean surface/subsurface contrasts using combined oxygen and silicon isotope measurements of diatom and radiolarian opal obtained from two cores gathered in the sea ice-free Antarctic Zone and northern Polar Front Zone of the Atlantic Southern Ocean. Our records point to a well established glacial spring/summer stratification induced by sea-ice melt. Numerical simulations corroborate this, but also suggest that seasonal stratification was variable with relatively deep mixing that occurred during fall/winter. We discuss various aspects of nutrient utilization in surface and subsurface waters with specific emphasis on the impact of sea ice variations on mixed layer depths and biological productivity during the last glacial and deglacial transition.",

            "abstract": "Many IPCC models suffer from significant Sea Surface Temperature (SST) biases in the Southern Ocean that adversely affects the representation of the cryosphere and global circulation in these models. Evidence suggests that much of this error is linked to Short Wave (SW) radiation, sensible and latent heat biases. Flaws in the representation of clouds and a deficit of supercooled liquid water in mixed-phase clouds are suspected as a likely source of the SW error.\nA physically based method that uses subgrid turbulence to control a new liquid production term has been developed. Comparisons between theory, based on a stochastic differential equation used to represent supersaturation fluctuations, and decametre resolution Large Eddy Simulations will be presented. An implementation of this approach in a GCM shows an increased prevalance of supercooled liquid water and a reduction in the magnitude of the Southern Ocean SW bias.\nTo conclude, we will summarize the complete package of changes that have been made to tackle the Southern Ocean SST bias in a physically meaningful way.",

            "abstract": "The June 1991 Pinatubo volcanic eruption perturbed the atmosphere, triggering short-term worldwide changes in climate. The following winter was anomalously wet in the Levant, with a ~2-meter increase in the Dead Sea level that created a morphological terrace along the lake's shore. Given the global effects of volcanogenic aerosols, we tested the hypothesis that the 1991-92 shore terrace is a modern analogue to the linkage between past volcanic eruptions and a sequence of shore terraces in the Dead Sea Basin.\nAnalysis of precipitation series from Jerusalem showed a significant positive correlation between the Dust Veil Index (DVI) of the modern eruptions and annual rainfall. The DVI was found to explain nearly 50% of the variability in the annual rainfall, such that greater DVI means more rainfall. Other factors that may affect the annual rainfall in the region as the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the North Atlantic oscillations (NAO) were incorporated along with the DVI in a linear multiple regression model. It was found that the NAO did not contribute anything except for increased noise, but the added SOI increased the explained variability of rainfall to more than 60%.\nVolcanic eruptions with a VEI of 6, as in the Pinatubo, occurred about once a century during the Holocene and the last glacial-interglacial cycle. This occurrence is similar to the frequency of shore terrace build-up during the Lake Lisan desiccation. Sixteen shore terraces, detected using airborne laser scanning data, were interpreted as indicating short-term level rises due to episodes of enhanced precipitation and runoff during the dramatic drop in Lake Lisan’s (palaeo-Dead Sea) level at the end of the LGM. The terraces were compared with a time series of volcanogenic sulfate from the GISP2 record, and similar numbers of sulfate concentration peaks and terraces were found. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between SO4 concentration peaks and the terraces heights. This correlation may indicate a link between the explosivity, magnitude of stratospheric injection, and the impact on the northern hemisphere water balance. The record of such short-term climato-hydrological effects is made possible by the dramatic desiccation of Lake Lisan. Detailed records of such events provide a demonstration of global climatic teleconnections.",

            "abstract": "Boreal Summer Intra-seasonal Oscillation (BSISO) is known to have a strong impact on the development of drought in South Asian Summer Monsoon (SASM). Our research found that in 6 of 8 past extremely wet / dry SASM years, monsoonal precipitation tendency dynamically reversed during May to July, associated with BSISO (figure). Since the predictability of BSISO is greatly limited, the perturbation associated with BSISO could be the main causality of the difficulty in seasonal prediction. Careful analysis on the atmospheric condition in 2002 and 2003, which are extremely dry / wet year with seasonal dynamical change of precipitation tendency, revealed that BSISO influenced on the development of both extremely dry and wet rainy season. The key factor of the influence of BSISO on the development of wet/dry atmospheric condition is the difference in the northward propagating activity of BSISO. Though it is already known that northward propagation of BSISO active (phase 1-4) phase depends on the environmental atmospheric condition [Jiang et al., 2004; Wheeler and Hendon, 2004], break (phase 5-8) phase northward propagating activity is also revealed to be different between various environment. In 2002, both of active and break convection of BSISO contributed to the development of dry condition. Both of those phases created convergence over Pakistan and north India (SASM region) in the upper troposphere. On the other hand, the opposite effect was caused by the BSISO of 2003. In order to show the generality of this impact of BSISO, theoretical analysis and carefully designed numerical experiment with Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) were conducted. We created a convection which shares common characteristics with BSISO by the forcing of sea surface temperature (SST). Further analysis revealed that northward propagation of BSISO differs depending on strong (weak) vertical shear of wind and with plenty (meagerness) of specific humidity in planetary boundary layer. BSISO could have a negative feedback on the development of extremely dry / wet condition through the difference in the northward propagation. For the effective management of water resources, the further understanding of the influence of BSISO on extremely wet rainy season should be needed as well as the drought events.",

This modelling activity involves simulations that are computationally expensive and its soaring uptake is tightly linked to the increasing availability of supercomputing power and easy access to powerful nonlinear solvers such as PETSc (\nhttp://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/\n). The Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) is a finite-element, multiphysics framework (\nhttp://mooseframework.org\n) that can harness such computational power and allow scientists to develop easily some tightly-coupled fully implicit multiphysics simulations that run automatically in parallel on large clusters. This open-source framework provides a powerful tool to collaborate on numerical modelling activities and we are contributing to its development with REDBACK (\nhttps://github.com/pou036/redback\n), a module for Rock mEchanics with Dissipative feedBACKs.\nREDBACK builds on the tensor mechanics finite strain implementation available in MOOSE to provide a THMC simulator where the energetic formulation highlights the importance of all dissipative terms in the coupled system of equations. We show first applications of fully coupled dehydration reactions triggering episodic fluid transfer through shear zones (Alevizos et al, 2014). The dimensionless approach used allows focusing on the critical underlying variables which are driving the resulting behaviours observed and this tool is specifically designed to study material instabilities underpinning geological features like faulting, folding, boudinage, shearing, fracturing, etc. REDBACK provides a collaborative and educational tool which captures the physical and mathematical understanding of such material instabilities and provides an easy way to apply this knowledge to realistic scenarios, where the size and complexity of the geometries considered, along with the material parameters distributions, add as many sources of different instabilities.\n",

For its large scale and extent it is a unique initiative which will foster new scientific discoveries and enable scientists to investigate the solid earth system in unprecedented ways. A key aspect of EPOS is to provide end-users with homogeneous access to services and multidisciplinary data collected by monitoring infrastructures and experimental facilities as well as access to processing and visualization tools. Such a complex system requires a solid, scalable and reliable architecture in order to accommodate innovative features and to meet the evolving expectations of the heterogeneous communities involved. Within the FP7 EU project EPOS PP\n1 (Preparatory Phase), which is approaching its completion in October 2014, the goal of the infrastructure and virtual community working group (WG7) was to design and test a preliminary architecture. The EPOS e-infrastructure architecture has been systematically developed based on collected primary (user) and secondary (interoperation with other systems) requirements and through three distinct design refinement phases (Strawman, Woodman and Ironman). The EPOS architecture is constituted of Integrated Core Services (ICS), which provide access to thematic (domain-specific) services (Thematic Core Services - TCS) integrating national research infrastructures. The key component of the architecture is the metadata catalogue, which utilizes the CERIF\n2(Common European Research Information Format) standard. The metadata catalogue is conceived to effectively capture all the information needed and to make large (re-)use of existing domain specific standards. In this contribution we will present the lessons learned and the technical achievements of the EPOS Preparatory Phase.\n1www.epos-eu.org\n2www.eurocris.org",

Titration of dissolved Cr(III) and Fe(III) by NaOH solutions indicated that no bulk-phase precipitation occurred at pH 4.5. Also, the removal of Cr(VI) at pH 4.5 was the greatest by FeS-coated NS. Consistent with these, Cr-K edge EXAFS revealed that Cr was removed by FeS-coated NS via surface precipitation, and that it was immobilized by FeS-coated WS and Al by forming surface clusters. Regardless of FeS-coated sorbents, at pH 7.0 and pH 9.5, the initially added Cr(VI) was quantitatively removed from the solution phase. By EXAFS analysis, the Cr sorption by FeS-coated Al was mainly due to the bulk-phase precipitation of Cr(OH)3(s) or [Cr, Fe](OH)3(s). In case of FeS-coated WS and NS, the short Cr-Cr distance (~2.6 Å) at pH 7.0 and pH 9.5 was not simply accounted for by the bulk precipitation as either hydroxide (rCr-Cr ~ 3.0 Å), and it would rather result from the surface precipitation. Such a difference in the coordination structure among FeS-coated sorbents was likely due to in the lower surface area of the former available for the surface precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Ion dispersions observed by the Cluster spacecraft as they cross the polar cusps offer a unique opportunity to investigate the large-scale topology and dynamics of magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetosphere. In particular, consecutive crossings of the cusp resulting from the string of pearl configuration of the Cluster spacecraft in that region are well suited for investigating the temporal evolution as well as the spatial extent of ion dispersions as solar wind discontinuities interact with the dayside magnetopause. We have revisited our simulation study of the response of the cusp to a large rotation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), which was observed by the Cluster spacecraft on 23 September 2004. During that event the four satellites crossed the polar cusp within 2-16 minutes of each other while the IMF rotated from a southward to a northward direction. When simulating such events, we first run a three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation to determine the global topology of the magnetic field at different times during the event and then use a large-scale particle (LSK) simulation to determine the regions where ions enter the magnetosphere and to predict their energy-latitude dispersion in the cusp. We present the results of new simulations of the event that used idealized rotation of the IMF for input instead of the actual IMF observations that were used in our previous study. The global simulations show that strong North-South and Dawn-Dusk asymmetries developed as the magnetic field interacting with the magnetopause rotated. In particular, a spot of high-energy ions injected in the cusp moved poleward and dawnward in the northern hemisphere, but was not observed in the southern hemisphere. Accordingly, reconnection was found close to the poleward edge of the northern cusp, while it occurred further tailward in the southern hemisphere.",

            "abstract": "Using a high-sampling rate (100 kHz) loop antenna installed at subauroral latitudes in Athabasca (ATH), Canada (54.7N, 246.7E, L=4) we have been able to continuously monitor VLF/ELF emissions since September 2012. Several types of VLF/ELF emissions were observed, including chorus, hiss and quasi-periodic emissions. We report statistics of VLF/ELF emissions using a one-year data set from November 1, 2012 until October 31, 2013. Using 10 minute and 24 hour spectra, we selected clearly defined emissions with a minimum intensity of 2.10-5 pT2/Hz and recorded their starting time, duration, frequency range and spectral characteristics. This data set allowed us to calculate their occurrence rate as a function of AE, Dst and other geomagnetic parameters. We found similar occurrence rates on the ground in all cases, showing a peak around 07 MLT (7-10%) and a minimum from 18 to 02 MLT (1-3%), in agreement with previous satellite measurements at the geomagnetic equator. However, occurrence rates on the ground can be 8 times lower than those observed at the equator. This could be caused by the ionosphere preventing some frequencies to go all the way through, but could also suggest an interference in the propagation process between the generation region in the geomagnetic equator and the ground.\nTo investigate this, we compared this data set of VLF/ELF emissions with the observations made by the Van Allen Probes near the equatorial plane. We found 77 conjugate events for which the footprints of either the Van Allen Probes A or B (or both) were within 1000 km of ATH. Using the L2 magnetic field data from the EMFISIS instrument (CDF files available at https://emfisis.physics.uiowa.edu/), we were able to determine that the satellites observed VLF/ELF emissions for at least 54 of those events, suggesting that the spatial extent of the emissions is large. Within these events, we found 8 cases showing similar frequency and spectral features on the ground and on the satellite(s). We report the preliminary conclusions from our analysis of these events.",

            "abstract": "This study evaluates the suitability of radar-based quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) for the simulation of stream flow in the Marikina River Basin (535 km2), The Philippines. We used observed reflectivity from the wet season period of 2012 and 2013 from an S-band radar near Subic. Radar data processing and precipitation estimation were carried out using the Open Source library wradlib. To evaluate the potential added value of radar-based QPE, we generated a benchmark precipitation product based on the interpolation of rain gauge observations (GO product). The GO product was also used to quantify rainfall estimation errors at the point scale. For stream flow simulation, we used a semi-distributed conceptual hydrological model based on the Open Source ECHSE framework.\nAt the point scale, the radar-based QPE was benchmarked against the GO product at daily and hourly accumulation intervals. It turned out that the radar-based QPE outperformed the GO product in the 2012 while the performance was similar in the 2013. For both periods, estimation errors substantially increased from the daily to the hourly accumulation intervals, most likely due to a lack of representativeness at the point scale.\nInterestingly, though, the hourly rainfall estimates allowed for a good simulation of observed stream flow when used to force the hydrological model. In particular, the two main flood events, induced by an enhanced South-West monsoon, are well represented using both hourly rainfall products. The results show that the quality of the simulated stream flow was well in line with the point-based verification: while the radar-based QPE clearly outperforms the GO product in 2012, both perform similarly in 2013. The hydrological model had been recalibrated for each rainfall product to allow for a fair comparison of the two competing rainfall products.\nAs the Marikina River Basin has a comparatively dense rain gauge network, the results of this study are encouraging with respect to usability of the radar-based QPE in other parts of the Philippines where dense rain gauge network are not available.",

Yet, the magnitude and controls of greenhouse gas emissions from coastal wetland ecosystems, especially mangroves in the subtropical regions, are still largely unknown. In this study, we conducted chamber measurements in the Mai Po Marshes Nature Reserve of Hong Kong at monthly intervals to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of the emission of greenhouse gases, including CO2, CH4 and N2O from mangrove soils, and examine the influence of environmental and biotic variables on greenhouse gas fluxes. We found the highest mean CH4 and N2O emissions in autumn and the highest CO2 flux in summer. Along the tidal gradient, we observed significantly higher CH4 and N2O emissions from the middle zones and landward zones, respectively, while no clear spatial variation of CO2 emissions was observed. There were significantly higher soil greenhouse gas emissions from sites dominated by Avicennia marina than those dominated by Kandelia obovata, which might be due to the presence of pneumatophores which facilitated gas transport. We found a significant, negative correlation between CH4 flux and soil NO3-N concentration, while CO2 flux was positively correlation with total Kjeldahl nitrogen content. Soil temperature was positively correlated with the emissions of all three greenhouse gases, while water table depth was positively and negatively correlated with CH4 and N2O emissions, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the high spatial and temporal variability of greenhouse gas emissions from mangrove soils which could be attributed in part to the differences in environmental conditions and dominant plant species.",

It overlies glacial diamictites of the Chang’an Formation or its correlatable units and underlies diamictites of the Nantuo Formation. The base and top of the Datangpo Formation is constrained by U-Pb ages of 662.9±4.3 and 654.5±3.8 Ma, respectively. The existing ages roughly constrain the duration of the Datangpo Formation between 2.66 and 14.14 million years. To better understand the sedimentary cycles, climate events and astrochronological signal recorded in the Datangpo Formation, we investigated the millimeter and sub-millimeter scale siltstone-mudstone rhythmites from a drillcore northestern Guizhou Province, which was paleogeographically located in a slope environment of the Yangtze platform.\nHigh-resolution color scale and X-ray fluorescence records are obtained from the drillcore of the Datangpo Formation. Power spectrum and wavelet transform analyses of gray scale variations and chemical element contents (e.g., Si, Al, Mn/Fe, Rb/K…) reveal a hierarchy of sedimentary cycle bands of 0.59 mm, 1.18 mm, 4.92 mm, which are likely derived by the solar variation periods of 11 yr, 22 yr, 90 yr, respectively. Cyclostratigraphic study indicates that the duration of the Datangpo Formation can be estimated as 9.2 m.y., which is consistent with the existing U-Pb age constrains. These results suggest that the climate fluctuations manifested in the color scale and geochemical records of the Datangpo Formation may have been controlled by periodic solar variations during late Neoproterozoic. The average sedimentary accumulation rate of the Datangpo Formation is thus calculated as 53.6 mm/ka using the duration derived from cycle analysis.",

In this study, changes in lake area greater than 1 km2 are mapped using Landsat datasets, spanning the 1970s, 1990, 2000, and 2010. In addition, high-resolution images (GeoCover Landsat mosaic 2000, with a pixel size of 14.25 m) are used for the first time to map lakes as small as 0.001 km2 across the entire Tibetan Plateau (TP). Results show that the numbers and areal extent of individual lakes >1 km2 in size show a slight decrease between the 1970s and 1990, followed by a clear increase from 1990 to 2010. Ninety-nine new lakes are identified between the 1970s and 2010, 71 of which are found between 1990 and 2010. This indicates the accelerated glacier melt and/or increased difference of precipitation minus evaporation since the 1990s. More than 80% of the lakes show an increase in their area between the 1970s and 2010. The lake census, using 2000 imagery, shows that there are 32,843 lakes with a total area of 43,151.08 ± 411.49 km2, which makes up 1.4% of the total area of the TP. Around 96% of all lakes are small, with an area < 1 km2, while the 1,204 large lakes (> 1 km2) account for 96% of the total lake area. The TP is subdivided into 12 greater drainage basins, and of these the Inner TP dominates in terms of the number of lakes (55.03%), the total area of lakes (66%) and lake density (0.026/km2 compared to the mean, 0.011/km2). A plot of lake abundance against size shows that the size distribution of lakes departs from a typical power law distribution, but displays such a distribution at the mean elevation (4,715 m), with an r2 value of 0.97 and a slope of −0.66. The slopes of the abundance-size equations from each of the 12 greater basins, and from all basins together, are larger than −1, supporting the inference that larger lakes, rather than the small lakes, contribute more to the total lake surface area across the TP. The lake inventory provided in this study, along with the assessment of lake size distribution, have important implications for estimates of water balance, for water resource management, and for lake area estimations in the TP.",

            "abstract": "The relationships between subduction dynamics, continental collision, surface erosion, upper mantle flow and the tectonic history recorded in the continental crust have attracted significant interest. Major results confirmed that mantle convection is a valuable mechanism behind much of the observed dynamic topography and plate motion. However, the degree to which mantle flow controls surface deformation and how this is modulated by erosion are major open questions. Geodetic measurements, coupled with geological observations, enable to achieve a fairly good understanding of the evolution of active features, but the long-term dynamic origins of this kinematics are still controversial. For example, mantle flow is proposed as a driver of plate tectonics, but lithospheric processes such as slab rollback are also known to affect mantle flow. In addition, surface erosion affects crustal deformation, but the interactions between surface mass transfer, crustal strain and deeper dynamics are still widely unknown. More definitive conclusions, especially regarding how the dynamical mantle flow associated to slab tearing and rollback and the mass transfer by surface erosion affect crustal strain, require the investigation of the 3D relationships between the lithosphere and mantle, from the topmost crustal layers to the asthenosphere.\nWe present new high-resolution 3D thermo-mechanical numerical joint models of continental collision, oceanic subduction and slab tearing which allow self-consistent reproduction of first order Tethyan tectonic structures such as back-arc rifting and large scale strike-slip faults accommodating continental escape. We compare these numerical outcomes with observations from the Aegean-Anatolian and eastern Indian-Eurasian margins. We show that the dynamical mantle flow due to slab rollback and tearing can modulate surface deformation by locally enhancing trench retreat and actively dragging the upper plate from below. Further investigations will include surface processes and allow us to assess the role of erosion. However, the similarities between modeled and natural surface kinematics suggest that horizontal to sub-horizontal mantle flow due to slab rollback and tearing codetermined the surface strain across the Aegean-Anatolian and eastern Indian-Eurasian domains.",

            "abstract": "The physiography of landscapes is a complex response to uplift generated by crustal and sub-crustal processes. Conversely, landscapes, when properly decoded, could provide information about histories of uplift and denudation rates. On most continents drainage networks set the pace of denudation. Since these networks are widespread, the notion of combining a quantitative understanding of drainage development with independent calibration is attractive. We build upon our recent work to show that it is possible to determine meaningful spatial and temporal patterns of uplift rates from linearised inversion of longitudinal river profiles. The uplift rate histories of Africa and Australia are estimated by inverting 964 river profiles, following careful calibration of a simplified version of the stream power erosional model (\n∂z/∂t=−K\nA\nm\nS\nn\n+U\n, where\nn=1\n). Misfit between calculated and theoretical profiles is small (Africa,\nχ\n2\n=2.4\n; Australia,\nχ\n2\n=1.8\n). Calculated patterns of uplift suggest that the topography of both continents grew during the last 65 million years. The calculated uplift histories are consistent with the age of emergent marine terraces, sedimentary flux information, the history of magmatism, rock cooling and denudation estimates in both continents. Using more general non-linear inverse methods we show that precipitation rate has to vary with a periodicity of 10 million years or more to significantly effect our results. Large changes in upstream drainage area (\n±50%\n) have a small effect on the timing or amplitude of calculated uplift. Residual misfit between families of observed and theoretical river profiles is smallest when\nn=1\n. Drainage networks contain coherent signals that record the growth of topography on the continents.",

            "abstract": "Many climate models simulate significant spectral power in large scale, North Atlantic subpolar gyre indices at timescales of around 20 years. Despite similar periodicities, the underlying mechanisms reported in individual models can vary greatly. For example, the timescale can be set by any combination of geostrophic self advection, Rossby wave propagation, or advection by the mean circulation. The role of the overturning circulation can either be active or passive, and the ultimate driver of density changes in the deep water formation regions is split roughly evenly in the literature between salinity and temperature – with implications for any feedback mechanisms. These simulations typically span many centuries with constant external forcings to capture internal climate variability. The extent to which either this periodicity carries over to the real world under increasingly strong external forcing, or which, if any, of the modelled feedbacks are applicable, is unclear.\nWe present new results from a state-of-the-art high resolution coupled climate model (HadGEM3) in which the mechanism of internal decadal variability in the North Atlantic is diagnosed and discuss the causes of differences from previous work. Due to the non-linear equation of state, biases in the simulated mean state can explain some of the inter-model differences via the relative importance of temperature or salinity in density changes. These biases can then propagate throughout the mechanistic chain resulting in fundamentally different simulated mechanisms. For example, whether temperature or salinity control densities in the Labrador Sea influences whether a strengthening overturning circulation acts as a negative or positive feedback.\nAlthough analysis of the model proceeds via lagged regressions, this is generally not possible with observational data. We use a combination of palaeo reconstructions and targeted process-based analysis to investigate whether there is any signal of bidecadal periodicity within the real world subpolar gyre and to what extent our simulated mechanisms exist. While uncertainties remain large, we conclude that there is some hope for determining those models more likely to simulate real world decadal variability. This knowledge will hopefully help understand and add-value to decadal forecasts.",

            "abstract": "The idea that hybridized mantle rocks can contribute to the oceanic crust composition has recently emerged thanks to studies on primitive (olivine-rich) troctolites [e.g. 1]. These rocks are considered to be formed by melt-rock interaction, but the exact reaction process by which they originate is still debated and their role on the bulk oceanic crust composition has been never defined. Olivine-rich troctolites have been mostly found at slow spreading ridges [2] or at their fossil analogues [3]. Similar rocks have been recently collected in the 25ºS area of the intermediate spreading Central Indian Ridge (CIR), and rarely characterize the crust mantle boundary at fast spreading ridges [4]. We show that textural and chemical inheritances of the pre-existing mantle are preserved in the CIR troctolites. In particular, the local occurrence of granular, mantle-derived orthopyroxenes and the composition of the associated clinopyroxene indicate that these crustal rocks formed through a direct (one-stage) conversion of a mantle peridotite. We use chemical evidence to infer the same origin of the olivine-rich troctolites worldwide, concluding that the reactive overprint of the oceanic mantle is a process diffused over the entire spreading rate spectrum. Bulk oceanic crust estimates of the Hess Deep (Pacific) and Atlantis Massif (Atlantic) crustal sections are used to quantify and compare the effect of these rocks on the bulk crust composition at fast and slow spreading ridges. Our inferences suggest that the significance of the bulk oceanic crust should be reassessed. When hybrid troctolites are included at crustal levels, the oceanic crust cannot be considered equal to the composition of the melt extracted from the mantle, but it results more primitive and importantly thicker.\n",

Shock--turbulence interaction is one of the most challenging problems in turbulence modeling. A strong variation of the mean density () leads to a strong density variance. The expressions for the turbulent correlations such as the Reynolds and turbulent Maxwell stresses, the turbulent electromotive force, etc. are examined in a compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. It is shown that in the presence of the density variance, a mean density gradient () oblique or perpendicular to the mean magnetic field gives rise to the turbulent electromotive force. Since the electric current density induced by this effect is in the direction of the reconnection electric current density, the turbulent energy near the slow shock in the fast magnetic reconnection is expected to be enhanced. The physical origin of this effect is discussed. A turbulence model incorporating this effect is proposed. This model is expected to reproduce the spatial distribution of the turbulent energy around the fast magnetic reconnection.",

            "abstract": "The liquid outer core of the Earth consists predominantly of iron with 10 wt.% lighter elements, such as hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, silicon, and sulfur. Other terrestrial planets such as Mars, Mercury and Venus are also similar to the Earth in that they have a central metallic core, which are considered to be at least partially molten. The popular models for those planetary cores also favor the existence of lighter elements. The nature of the light elements is important for understanding the core formation processes and the present core structure and dynamics in terrestrial planets, which are still not well understood. The seismic wave speed is the primary information on the Earth’s core. The sound velocity of liquid Fe–light-element alloys is therefore key to constrain the light component in the Earth’s core and will be referenced for the future survey of other planets. Recently we have developed the techniques for inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) measurement combined with diamond-anvil cell (DAC) experiments at the SPring-8 synchrotron facility, in order to investigate the sound velocities of liquid Fe–light-element alloys under high pressure and high temperature. Recently we have succeeded in determining sound velocities of liquid Fe-C and Fe-Ni-S alloys to about 40 GPa using both externally-heated and laser-heated DACs, which corresponds to the pressures of Martian and Mercurian cores. We will present our recent development of IXS measurements of liquid iron alloys and discuss the effects of carbon and sulfur on the sound velocity of planetary liquid cores.",

            "abstract": "Despite the extreme complexity that characterizes earthquake generation process, simple phenomenology seems to apply in the collective properties of seismicity. The best known is the Gutenberg-Richter relation. Short and long-term clustering, power-law scaling and scale-invariance have been exhibited in the spatio-temporal evolution of seismicity providing evidence for earthquakes as a nonlinear dynamic process. Regarding the physics of “many” earthquakes and how this can be derived from first principles, one may wonder, how can the collective properties of a set formed by all earthquakes in a given region, be derived and how does the structure of seismicity depend on its elementary constituents – the earthquakes? What are these properties?\nThe physics of many earthquakes has to be studied with a different approach than the physics of one earthquake making the use of statistical physics necessary to understand the collective properties of earthquakes. Then a natural question arises. What type of statistical physics is appropriate to commonly describe effects from the microscale and crack opening level to the level of large earthquakes?\nAn answer to the previous question could be non-extensive statistical physics, introduced by Tsallis (1988), as the appropriate methodological tool to describe entities with (multi) fractal distributions of their elements and where long-range interactions or intermittency are important, as in fracturing phenomena and earthquakes. In the present work, we review some fundamental properties of earthquake physics and how these are derived by means of non-extensive statistical physics. The aim is to understand aspects of the underlying physics that lead to the evolution of the earthquake phenomenon introducing the new topic of non-extensive statistical seismology.\nThis research has been funded by the European Union (European Social Fund) and Greek national resources under the framework of the “THALES Program: SEISMO FEAR HELLARC” project.",

The package allows to compute light scattering by a mixture of spheroids for 25 logarithmically equidistant axis ratios ranging from 0.3 (oblate spheroids) to 3.0 (prolate spheroids) and 41 size bins covering the size parameter (x) from 0.012 to 625. To cover such a large range, two complementary methods were used for computing kernels. For x < 30 - 60, the simulations were performed using the T-matrix method by Mishchenko et al. (JQSRT, 55(5), 535, 1996). For x exceeding the T-matrix convergence limits, the approx. geometric-optics-integral-equation method of Yang & Liou (Appl. Opt. 5.33, 6568, 1996) was used. The roughness is described by a parameter σ that is equal to 0 for smooth surface and > 0 for rough surface. In the package, look-up tables were simulated for quadrature coefficients employed in the numerical integration of spheroid optical properties over size and shape to reduce computation time. The pre-calculated kernels in the software package allow fast, accurate, and flexible modeling of different size and shape distributions.\nWe compare smooth and rough spheroids that obey log-normal size distribution with standard deviation 0.1 and effective radius 8.71 mm. Size parameter was varied by variation of wavelength within 0.34 – 25 mm. We considered silicate-like refractive index (1.53, 0.008), spheroids of two aspect ratios a/b=2.07 and 0.48, and two roughnesses σ = 0 and 0.2. We study how different photopolariemtric properties of smooth and rough spheroids are depending on the size parameter and scattering angle.\nWe also make computations for rough spheroids that have composition typical for cometary dust and find characteristics of an ensemble of rough spheroids that fit cometary photopolarimetric observations.",

The corresponding human, social, environmental and economic costs of volcanic activity are likewise set to rise. Monitoring of active volcanoes is imperative to minimize the impact of volcanic activity. However, people’s responses towards risk are not just determined by objective scientific information, but also by socio-cognitive factors such as hazard salience; risk perception; anxiety levels and sense of self efficacy.\nThis project aims to take a citizen science approach to the monitoring of hazardous volcanic gases: a low-cost automated ubiquitous technology station will increase spatial and temporal data resolution while providing citizens access to relevant, accurate, timely and local information. This means a single data stream can be used to develop a better understanding of volcanic degassing and raise levels of hazard salience and increase feelings of self efficacy.\nA year and two prototypes into the project, this work presents the lessons learnt to date. Careful consideration was given to the station design in light of the harsh conditions it may encounter. Once the first prototypes were built, results from the initial lab tests were encouraging. Yet it wasn’t until the stations were taken into the field that unexpected challenges were encountered: humans. During the very first field trial the prototype was vandalised, our second attempt was thwarted by customs and courier services.\nAs a result, we’ve had to be flexible in our approach and adapt our strategy and station design in response to these events, which will eventually result in a better outcome. However, this case study serves as a reminder of the importance of considering factors beyond the equipment, data, interpretation and involvement of the public, when planning and implementing a citizen science initiative.",

Group A poles have been interpreted to reflect the Early Jurassic Earth magnetic field but the significance of Group B poles is less clear. Here we report new data from the Kirkpatrick basalts at Gair Mesa (73.47°S; 162.87°E), where about 800 stratigraphic meters including 23 volcanic flows were sampled. After removal of a steep magnetic overprint straight linear segments trending toward the origin of the projection plane are identified in 151 samples from 22 sites. All characteristic directions are of normal polarity and interpreted to be carried by magnetite. The resulting mean pole plots at 66.4°S; 227.7°E, A95=6.2°, k = 25.7 similar to group B poles. Reflecting light microscopy suggests that the original magnetization has survived low temperature alteration. Since secular variation has been averaged (Sb=15.9°) we argue that the Gair Mesa basalts have recorded the time averaged geomagnetic field during early to mid Jurassic times. Hence, we conclude that both groups A and B are of primary origin and consequently speculate that group B paleopoles might reflect the onset of the recently postulated Jurassic pole shift.",

            "abstract": "There are lagoons in the northern east coast of the South Korea, which were formed during the transgression period in the early Holocene. These lagoons shrank about 5-30 % during the first half of 20 century due to terrestrial sediment input from soil erosion in reclamation lands. However, buried lagoonal sediments record Holocene climate change. In this study, multi-centennial scale paleo-climate and paleo-ecosystem change were investigated by analysis of this buried and present lagoon deposits. Based on the diatom assemblage analysis of the sediment in the lagoon Maeho where it is the east coast lagoons in Korea, this lagoon was formed about 8,400 years ago, and halophilic diatoms showed high peaks at three times within the last 8,400 years. Timings of these peaks were well coincident with the high-sea level periods reported in the western Japan. It is considered that sea-level of the east coast in Korea also showed high at three times during the mid-late Holocene, and then, salinity of the lagoon increased in these periods. Except for such sea-level dependent change, salinity of the lagoon Maeho showed the multi-centennial (200 or 400 years) scale periodic variation. Magnetic susceptibility (MS) also showed the clear 400 years periodicity in the mid-late Holocene. When the MS showed high value, oligohalobous diatoms showed high value. However, halophilic diatoms and number of total diatom valves increased when the MS showed low value. This correspondence probably indicates that magnetic minerals flew into the lagoon with river fresh water, and then volume of fresh water inflow has changed with 400 years cycles. Such MS cycle was also confirmed in the sediments of other lagoons. Change of fresh water inflow should be not local event, was a part of regional environmental change. These results probably indicate that the precipitation on the northeastern South Korea has changed by the 400 years cycle. On the basis of lagoon bottom sediment, it made clear that the change of diatom assemblage during the last 600 years has been well corresponded with the variation of Korean tree ring delta 14C. There is a high possibility that water quality and ecosystem in the Koran lagoons was controlled by 200-400 years periodical precipitation change, and they are further affected by the solar irradiance change may be via monsoon intensity change.",

            "abstract": "Wind energy is increasing in importance as a renewable energy source due to its potential role in reducing carbon emissions. It is a safe, clean, and inexhaustible source of energy. The amount of wind energy generated by wind turbines is closely related to the wind speed. Wind speed forecasting plays a vital role in the wind energy sector in terms of wind turbine optimal operation, wind energy dispatch and scheduling, efficient energy harvesting etc. It is also considered during planning, design, and assessment of any proposed wind project. Therefore, accurate prediction of wind speed carries a particular importance and plays significant roles in the wind industry.\nMany methods have been proposed in the literature for short-term wind speed forecasting. These methods are usually based on modeling historical fixed time intervals of the wind speed data and using it for future prediction. The methods mainly include statistical models such as ARMA, ARIMA model, physical models for instance numerical weather prediction and artificial Intelligence techniques for example support vector machine and neural networks. In this paper, we are interested in estimating hourly wind speed measures in United Arab Emirates (UAE). More precisely, we predict hourly wind speed using a nonparametric kernel estimation of the regression and volatility functions pertaining to nonlinear autoregressive model with ARCH model, which includes unknown nonlinear regression function and volatility function already discussed in the literature. The unknown nonlinear regression function describe the dependence between the value of the wind speed at time t and its historical data at time t -1, t – 2, … , t - d. This function plays a key role to predict hourly wind speed process. The volatility function, i.e., the conditional variance given the past, measures the risk associated to this prediction. Since the regression and the volatility functions are supposed to be unknown, they are estimated using nonparametric kernel methods. In addition, to the pointwise hourly wind speed forecasts, a confidence interval is also provided which allows to quantify the uncertainty around the forecasts.",

            "abstract": "The deep geology of northern Trøndelag is somewhat speculative as the Central Scandinavian Caledonides are intersected by the Møre-Trøndelag Fault Complex (MTFC) and only a few depth-penetrating geophysical profiles exist. Here, we correlate the mapped geological units and faults between a seismic-reflection profile and a MT profile.\nThe seismic-reflection data were acquired in 5 segments over the period 1986-1990. The westernmost section of the seismic profile is dominated by a complex pattern of reflections and diffractions. This type of pattern is typical of polydeformed terranes with a mixture of contrasting felsic and mafic lithologies. The two steeply-dipping strands of the MTFC (Hitra-Snåsa and Verran faults) that transect the profile do not show any distinctive signature in the seismic data.\nThe MT data were acquired in 2007 from the Swedish border to the Norwegian coast. The conductivity profile shows some distinct vertical changes as well as changes from the near-surface to shallow depths. The strands of the MTFC show especially a distinctive change in conductivity.\nThe two profiles are almost parallel but separated by 100 km. To correlate the structures seen on both profiles, we have applied lineament analysis and 3D modelling of the gravity and magnetic field.\nThe tilt derivative of the magnetic and isostatic gravity anomaly clearly allows us to identify and link the main geological boundaries between the profiles and to trace the strands of the MTFC from one profile to the other. This trend analysis indicates that at least the Verran Fault visibly modifies the pattern of seismic reflections. However, the main change in crustal lithology occurs farther to the west, almost at the coast where the Tarva Fault intersects the MT profile.\nThis integrated analysis shows the benefit of combining gravity and magnetic interpretations with MT and seismic data to enable us to understand the near-surface geology and structure in more detail.",

Black carbon (BC) is the most effective impurity in reducing snow albedo by mass, and it has been shown to negatively affect the albedo in various regions of the globe, for example the Himalayas and the Arctic. Within the Arctic, the Scandinavian sector is a region where models have estimated high concentrations of BC in the seasonal snowpack compared to the rest of the Arctic. In this work, ambient snow samples were collected in 2012, 2013 and 2014 to examine the spatial variability of BC particles in the Scandinavian Arctic (Finland, Norway, and Sweden). Some of the sampling sites were revisited on consecutive years, during winter and spring conditions. Samples were analyzed for their elemental carbon (EC) content using a filter-based thermal-optical method (EC used as a proxy of BC). Samples collected in 2013 and 2014 were also analyzed with the single particle soot photometer. During the winter of 2013, BC concentrations increased with longitude, i.e. reflecting higher BC concentrations in samples closer to the Russian boarder. Air pollution (including BC particles) originating from the Kola Peninsula has been suggested to contribute to the higher BC concentrations. Similar spatial trends were found in samples collected in 2012.",

The satellite-retrieved AOT trends are estimated using the weighted trend method that minimizes the uncertainty effect of unrepresentative monthly means induced by frequent cloud occurrence in cloudy seasons because the AOT products are retrieved from cloud-free radiances by the visible imager. The EMAC simulations distinguish various aerosols components (i.e. black carbon, organic carbon, dust, aerosol water, sea salt, and water soluble compounds) for selected regions and the decomposed trends for each of them. A significant decrease in the satellite-retrieved AOT is estimated over Western Europe (i.e. by up to about -6.59 ± 5.30% per year with a 95% confidence interval) due to the decreasing water-soluble compounds (i.e. ammonium, nitrate and sulphate) and aerosol water content. In contrast, a statistically significant increase is observed over East China (about +5.66 ± 4.14% per year), which is attributed to the increase in black carbon, water-soluble compounds, and aerosol water.",

            "abstract": "Lagrangian stochastic particle models provide a well-established theoretical framework for the description of pollutant dispersion in different atmospheric boundary layer scenarios. Such modeling depends on an adequate description of the turbulent processes. Usually turbulent structure in the surface layer is described in terms of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) using universal relationships between scaling parameters. These relationships have been shown to be valid in the case of horizontal homogeneity for stationary turbulence. The description of the turbulent processes above rough surfaces, such as over canopies, is a more complex case. For the urban canopy it was found that under developed stationary turbulence conditions MOST relations are approximately valid (in some cases, with extensions). An even more complex case is that of rough surfaces over topography, as no similarity theory has been established to properly describe the turbulence exchange over heterogeneous surfaces in complex terrain.\nThe Haifa 2009 urban tracer meteorological and dispersion campaign is discussed. We model near-neutral stratification using the full velocity fluctuation covariance matrix and the convective stratification using skewed velocity probability density function. Simulations show good agreement with direct tracer measurements. Turbulence parametrizations were adopted based on their accordance with our measurements and with other measurements and fits from the literature. The characteristics of turbulence in the urban area over topography are discussed. It is shown that in conditions of developed stationary turbulence, at most areas, there is in an agreement with MOST predictions. In contrast, in very low wind conditions the turbulent nocturnal boundary layer is not necessarily stationary and is spatially non-homogeneous, as manifested in the pollutant pattern.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate mineral inclusions are quite rare in diamonds from the upper mantle, but are evidence for a carbonate abundance in the mantle. It is believed that such carbonatitic inclusions originated from high-density fluids (HDFs) that were enclosed in diamond during its growth. Using TEM and EPMA, several kinds of carbonate inclusions have been identified in Yakutian diamonds : aragonite, dolomite, magnesite, Ba-, Sr-, and Fe-rich carbonates. Most of them are represented by multi-phase inclusions of various chemically distinct carbonates, rich in Ca, Mg, and K and associated with minor amounts of silicate, oxide, saline, and volatile phases. Volatiles, leaving some porosity, played a significant role in the diamond growth.\nA single crystal of aragonite (60μm) is herein reported for the first time. This inclusion is located in the center of a diamond from the Komsomolskaya pipe. Careful CL imaging reveals the total absence of cracks around the aragonite inclusion – i.e., closed system. This inclusion has been identified by X-ray diffraction and microprobe analysis.  At temperatures above 1000 0C, aragonite is only stable at high pressures of 5-6 GPa. Inside this aragonite, we observed nanocrystalline inclusions of titanite, Ni-rich sulfide, magnetite, water-bearing Mg-silicate, and fluid bubbles. Dolomite is common in carbonate multi-phase inclusions in diamonds from the Internatsionalnaya, Yubileinaya, and Udachnaya kimberlite pipes. Alluvial diamonds of the northeastern Siberian Platform are divided into two groups based on the composition of HDFs: 1) Mg-rich multi-phase inclusions (60% magnesite + dolomite + Fe-spinel + Ti-silicate + fluid bubbles); and 2) Ca-rich multi-phase inclusions (Ca,Ba-, Ca,Sr-, Ca,Fe-carbonates + Ti-silicate + Ba-apatite + fluid bubbles). High-density fluids also contain K. Volatiles in the fluid bubbles are represented by water, Cl, F, S, CO2, CH4, and heavy hydrocarbons. Origin of the second group of HDFs may be related to the non-silicate carbonatitic melt.\nWe consider the primary hydrous, Сa-rich and Mg-poor carbonate melts as having formed in subducted oceanic crust. Variations of carbonate-inclusion compositions among diamonds indicate the variability in the source media during the formation of diamond and may be the result of metasomatic interaction with host rocks.",

            "abstract": "Speleothems preserve organic biomarkers, proxies for surface climate. Microbial-derived lipids, specifically glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraetheral (GDGT) lipids have been identified in cave deposits and shown to correlate well with surface air temperature using the archaea-derived isoprenoid ‘(i)GDGT’ index of TEX86 and the bacteria derived branched ‘(b)GDGT’ index of MBT/CBT of modern speleothems [1]. Two competing sources for GDGTs in karst systems have been suggested: 1) A soil derived microbial signal dominated by bGDGTs; and 2) An in situ signal dominated by iGDGTs, representative of archaea existing within the cave or overlying bedrock [2].\nThese findings are yet to be thoroughly tested by characterising the seasonal nature of GDGTs in caves to establish the source and transport pathways within these complex fractured rock systems. Here, we address this and present the results of a yearlong monitoring campaign of GDGTs within two contrasting cave sites from the Yarrangobilly Caves in Kosciuszko national park, SE Australia. The caves are located at a high altitude, semi-arid site. Harriewood cave is dominated by discrete infiltration events throughout the year. Above the cave there are thin soils consisting of loose shallow scree, steep slopes and sparse shrub vegetation. The surface above Jillabenan is characterised by thick red clays of moderate to no slope and Eucalypt dominated forest. As such, these caves provide ideal test sites to characterise the variability in GDGT signals that may be a result of non-temperature related factors, including varying inputs (groundwater vs. in situ growth) or site-specific hydrological conditions. We present data obtained from within the cave: drip waters and in situ collection of GDGTs formed on filter papers left inside the cave throughout the year, and externally sourced signals from soils and their leachates. We also identify key differences in soil pH and cave air temperatures that are best predicted by using cave specific GDGT calibrations of [1].\n[1] Blyth et al. 2013.

            "abstract": "Measuring micro physical properties of snowfall is a challenging task that is essential in many areas of research. Some examples are wet deposition of atmospheric pollution, electromagnetic wave propagation during snowfall, avalanche and glacier research. In recent years the 2D-video-disdrometer (2DVD, Joanneum Research) has been established for ground based in-situ rain measurements. The 2DVD is an optical device that delivers shape, size and velocity information derived from a front and a side view taken from each hydrometeor falling through the sensitive area. In case of snowfall the user has to be aware of certain di\u000effculties that are addressed in this contribution.\nFor our study we installed the 2DVD at the Environmental Research Station Schneefernerhaus (UFS) on Mt. Zugspitze, Germany (2650m a.s.l.). We analyzed a data set consisting of 150 days with snowfall and 70 man made observations including a classif cation according to the World Meteorologic Organization code 4677. We compared measured micro physical parameters with man made observations of shape, degree of riming and humidity of single hydrometeors and correlated the precipitation rate and total water equivalent from the 2DVD with measurements of a weighing precipitation sensor (in cooperation with the Institute for Geophysics and Meteorology, University Cologne).\nWe show that the implementation of a matching algorithm that fi nds appropriate pairs of pictures is essential for reliable measurement results. Without the improved matching algorithm the data sets contain about 80% of hydrometeors with extreme geometries and velocities. Applying the new matching algorithm 2DVD measurements and man made observations fi t in most of the cases of calm winds. Simply summing up hydrometeor volumes derived from the measured apparent diameters leads to an overestimation of water equivalent by a factor of 10. The measurement of water equivalent is improved significantly with the use of a size-density relation for snow flakes.\nWith the mentioned improvements in the analysis algorithm, the 2DVD is a suitable instrument for micro- and macroscopic snow event characterization. Nevertheless ground based in-situ measurement of snow properties stays a diff\u000ecult task, regarding the influence of wind fields especially at alpine mountain stations.",

For the solar meridional flow, the global-scale travel-time measurements are dominated by the center-to-limb effect. To remove this effect, previous methods used the equatorial East-West travel time as a proxy, and measure the extra travel time in North-South direction along the central meridian for the interior meridional flow.\nHere we present a new strategy to measure the deep meridional flow. Instead of measuring only East-West and North-South acoustic travel times, the new strategy measures travel times along a number of selected directions. The center-to-limb effect is presumably independent of the measuring direction, while the meridional flow contributes a cosine-angle component to the travel-time shifts. The center-to-limb effect and the travel-time differences caused by the interior meridional flow can thus be decoupled by solving a set of least-square equations.

            "abstract": "Green water flows, a key ecohydrological process, dominates the hydrological cycle in arid region. The structure of green water flows reflects the landscape water consumption characteristics and can be easily obtained by means of remote sensing approach. In arid region, limited fresh water and fragile environment resulted in sharp contradictions between economy and natural ecosystem concerning water demands. To rationally allocate economic and ecological water use, to maximize the regional freshwater use efficiency, is the route one must take for sustainable development in arid area. The pursuit of the most necessary ecological protection function and the maximum ecological water use efficiency is the key to ecological water allocation. However, we are short of simple and quick detectable variables or indexes to assess ecological water allocation decision. This paper introduced the green water flows structure as a decision variable, chose Heihe river flow allocation to downstream Ejina Delta for ecological protection as an example, put forward why and how green water flows structure could be used for ecological water allocation decision. The authors expect to provide reference for integrated fresh water resources management practice in arid region.",

            "abstract": "The Mead Stream section (South Island, New Zealand) consists of a 650-m-thick series of continuous and well-exposed strata deposited on a South Pacific continental slope from the Late Cretaceous to the middle Eocene. We examined the uppermost Paleocene–middle Eocene part of the Mead Stream section, which consists of ~360 m of limestone and marl, for detailed magnetic polarity stratigraphy, calcareous nannofossil, and foraminifera biostratigraphy. Magneto-biostratigraphic data indicate that the section straddles magnetic polarity Chrons from C24r to C18n, calcareous nannofossil Zone from NP9a to NP17 (CNP11–CNE15 following a recently revised Paleogene zonation), and from the Waipawan to the Bortonian New Zealand stages (i.e., from the base of the Ypresian to the Bartonian international stages), encompassing 17 Myr (56–39 Ma) of Southwest Pacific Ocean history. The ages of calcareous nannofossil biohorizons are consistent with low to mid-latitude data from the literature, indicating that during the early–middle Eocene the low-mid latitude calcareous nannofossil domain extended at least to ~50–55°S in the South Pacific. Correlation of the magnetic polarity stratigraphy from the Mead Stream section with the geomagnetic polarity time scale allows us to derive the sediment accumulation rates (SAR), which range between 8 and 44 m/Myr. Comparing the SAR with paleotemperature proxy records, we found that two intervals of increased SAR occurred during the early Eocene climatic optimum (EECO; 52–50 Ma) and during the transient climate warming culminating with the middle Eocene climatic optimum (MECO; 40.5 Ma). This correlation indicates that the climate evolution of the early–middle Eocene is recorded in the sedimentation patterns whereby times of warmer climate promote continental weathering, transportation, and accumulation of terrigenous sediments.",

            "abstract": "Comet impacts are ubiquitous phenomena in the Solar system and the frequency was extremely high in the early history. Comets contain abundant organic materials, including bio-essential amino acids. Thus, it is proposed that comets have delivered organic molecules, which are important for the origins of life, to the outer solar bodies as well as the Earth.\nIn the study, we conducted shock experiments on icy mixtures of amino acids (glycine and alanine), water ice, and forsterite at cryogenic condition (77 K), simulating comet impacts. The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of impact shock on amino acids in comets. We also focused on the oligomerization of amino acids to produce peptides. Peptides are important molecules for the origins of life, because they are building block of proteins and also act as catalysts to form other biomolecules. In the experiments, the starting mixture was kept frozen in a reaction capsule placed in liquid nitrogen (77K) and was impacted by a vertical propellant gun. The shock pressure range achieved in the experiments was 4.8-26.3 GPa.\nThe results showed that amino acids were oligomerized into peptides up to tripeptides by impact shock at cryogenic condition. In addition, the yields of linear dipeptides were higher than those of cyclic diketopiperazines. These results are in contrast to the results of shock experiments to amino acid solutions at room temperature, which resulted in the synthesis of comparable amount of diketopiperazines to that of linear peptides (Blank et al., 2001). Thus, the cryogenic condition at impact shock would be a key to facilitate the formation of linear peptides. If we apply our results to the event of icy satellite formation, comet impacts should play an important role to supply linear peptides to the satellites. The shock-synthesized peptides would have been spread over the subsurface seas of the icy satellites (e.g. Enceladus) and might have been an important source for chemical evolution on the satellites.",

            "abstract": "Solar type II radio bursts are excited by energetic electrons accelerated at coronal eruption-driven shocks. Streamers are quasi-steady and dense, and magnetically-closed structures in the corona, where the Alfven speed is much lower and plasma outflow is much slower than that of the surroundings, therefore are expected to facilitate the formation/enhancement of shocks. In recent studies, streamers have been suspected to be important on the generation of type II radio bursts and the morphology of radio dynamic spectra. In this study, we first present two type II events in which the type II ends upon the CME front (shock) passing by the streamer tip (cusp). The observations lead us to conjecture that the large-scale closed magnetic field of the streamer may be important to electron acceleration at coronal shocks and excitation of type II bursts. To validate this physical implication, we develop a streamer-shock model consisting of a streamer and an outward-propagating shock, and perform a test-particle simulation. It shows that only those electrons that are injected within the closed field regions can be accelerated efficiently, and the trapping effect via closed field lines allows the trapped electrons to return to the shock front multiple times and be repetitively accelerated. We suggest that the scenario may be potentially important to the generation of more metric type IIs considering the fact that most solar eruptions originate from closed field regions. This scenario also provides an explanation to the ending frequencies of many metric type IIs and the long-standing issue of the disconnection between metric and interplanetary type II bursts.",

For low permeable units the uncertainty of estimated hydraulic conductivity and diffusion coefficient values typically could be an order of magnitude and more. For long term migration prediction the role of low permeable units is very important in overall contaminant subsurface spreading.\nTo quantify the role of uncertainty of parameters of low permeable units on migration processes at the waste injection site we developed using 3-D TP/MC approach series of high-resolution lithological models of injection aquifer that includes about 40% of discontinuous clay hydrofacies. The difference between the models is in the used for simulation characteristic lengths of clay hydrofacies due to uncertainty of experimental variogramms.\nUsing core samples we estimated in lab hydraulic conductivity and diffusion coefficient of clay. Next we simulated with the developed models pure advective and advective-diffusion vertical contaminant transport with estimated in lab and found in previous studies parameters of clay and compared the simulation results. The comparison shows that the role of hydraulic and diffusion parameters of clay hydrofacies strongly depends from its characteristic length, which controls the portion of advective flow through the clay units in overall flow. The difference between advective and advective- diffusion results decreases with decreasing the horizontal characteristic length of clay for broad range of hydraulic and diffusion parameters of clay. Thus developing of realistic model of internal aquifer lithological heterogeneity and analysis with this model future migration is the essential step effecting on the program of site hydraulic characterization.",

            "abstract": "The long-term marine carbon isotope record responds to changes in the proportional burial rates of organic carbon relative to carbonate carbon on a global scale. For this reason, high\nδ13C values in marine carbonate rocks are normally interpreted to reflect faster rates of organic burial and increased atmospheric oxygenation. Geochemical redox tracers fail to support this paradigm for sustained deviations from the long-term δ13C mean, indicating perhaps that proportionally high organic burial may be associated with lower overall flux rates. Here I propose that ~107-108 year trends in average δ13C, as with seawater 87Sr/86Sr, are driven by changes in the balance between volcanism and denudation (~uplift). In other words, high proportional organic burial may be related to increases in the net CO2 flux (= organic carbon burial + Ca-Mg silicate weathering) relative to the carbonate weathering flux. According to this model, high baseline δ13C values will be associated with periods of heightened volcanic activity and/or diminished tectonic uplift. Conversely, lower baseline δ13C values can be related to times when the global carbon cycle was dominated by carbonate and oxidative weathering due to high rates of physical erosion. Shorter 105-106 year positive δ13C excursions have also been interpreted as the ‘smoking gun’ to extreme oxygenation events. However, large increases in organic burial are difficult to sustain under steady-state conditions without very high volcanic fluxes, indicating that some of these excursions might be better explained by transient changes to the isotopic composition of carbon sources and sinks.",

In this study, we develop a new algorithm for aerosol retrievals from twilight photographs taken by a digital single reflex-lens camera in solar zenith angle of 90–96˚ with interval of 1˚. A radiative transfer model taking spherical-shell atmosphere, multiple scattering and refraction into account is used as a forward model, and the optimal estimation is used as an inversion calculation to infer the aerosol optical and radiative properties. The sensitivity tests show that tropospheric (stratospheric) aerosol optical thickness is responsible to the distribution of twilight sky color and brightness near the horizon (in viewing angles of 10˚ to 20˚) and aerosol size distribution is responsible to the angular distribution of brightness near the solar direction. The AOTs are inferred with small uncertainties and agree very well with that from the Skyradiometer. In this conference, several case studies using the algorithm will be shown.",

            "abstract": "Migmatites are fantastic targets to study melt compositions, because they represent levels in the crust where melting has occurred. However, migmatites commonly are products not only of (i) melt producing reactions, but also of (ii) melt loss and (iii) retrograde reactions. Evidence of such events is preserved in the minerals and microstructures of rocks that outcrop in deeply exhumed orogens. The apparent complexity of migmatites is due to their chemical and textural heterogeneity visible in different domains with various mineral assemblages. Partial melting of pelites involves reactions, which are predictable using thermodynamic models. However, a forward modeling approach based on rock-specific equilibrium phase diagrams requires the knowledge of local bulk compositions of each equilibrium assemblage. In this contribution we show how suitable local effective bulk (LEB) compositions can be derived by means of standardized microprobe X-ray images, using the program XMapTools. For chemically heterogeneous samples, such as migmatites, these LEB allow to model the stable mineral assemblages for each domain and to obtain reliable P-T estimates.\nA metapelite studied in detail is embedded within a metasedimentary xenolith in the Marcabeli pluton, El Oro Complex, Ecuador. This sample shows complex mineral patterns due to local melt redistribution (at mm to cm-scale), involving major changes that affect the local chemical composition observed today. Four domains are identified: A residuum domain made of cordierite + biotite + plagioclase + spinel, which is predicted to be stable at P-Tmax conditions of 750 ± 50°C and 2 ± 1 kbar. In the leucosome (plagioclase + Kspar + quartz + biotite + orthopyroxene) three sub-domains show different mineral assemblages. Domain-specific equilibrium assemblages in the P-T diagrams demonstrate that these three assemblages reflect three interconnected melt-rich domains, each with different melt fractions (from 23 to 90%), yet all coexisted at equilibrium near P-Tmax conditions.",

            "abstract": "Intermittent structures in the solar wind turbulence carry important information on the turbulent non-linear dynamics and the heating effect of solar wind. However, the intermittency on small scales was rarely studied. Here we present a study of intermittent structures in the small timescale from 5 seconds to 100 seconds using the data from WIND observations in the high-speed solar wind. We find that the intermittent structures dominate the magnetic field turbulence in the scale. In this scale, the power spectrum of the intermittent structures with PVI >1 appears to be anisotropic with regards to the angle θRB between the direction of the local background magnetic field and the radial direction. The anisotropic nature in this sub-range is presented as follows: 1. At the scale τ=12s, the power spectral density of the intermittency withθRB = 84o-90o is one time larger than that of the intermittency with θRB =0o-6o; 2. The power spectrum becomes flatter as θRB increases, with an index of -2 at θRB =0o-6o and index of -1.6 at θRB =84o-90o; 3. The most probable value of the proton temperature distribution of the intermittent structures is 2.1×105K, higher than the most probable proton temperature for the general solar wind (1.9×105K); 4. The most probable value of the proton temperature of the intermittency with θRB =70o-90o is 2.2×105K, clearly higher than that with θRB =0o-20o, which is 2.0×105K. We think that the intermittent structures in the scale from 5s to 100s and their anisotropic spectral nature could be related to the non-linear interactions in the MHD turbulence, and they may have some influence on the dissipation processes in the solar wind turbulence.",

To understand the dynamics of water and suspended sediment at the watershed scale, we conducted the hydrological observation and fingerprinting source of suspended sediment using natural and fallout radionuclides as tracers in the Mu River (1270 km2) and the Saru River (1350 km2), Hokkaido, northern Japan. Furthermore, the distributed hydrological SWAT model was applied to evaluate temporal and spatial variation in water and suspended sediment dynamics in the watersheds. Combination of hydrological observation and fingerprinting technique using natural radionuclides enables to estimate the suspended sediment yield for each lithological source area within the watersheds, suggesting that the variation in suspended sediment yield was related to the potential factors of erosion represented by steep slope, landslide and bare surface of slope failure. Cesium-137 activity associated with suspended sediment was almost under detection limit, suggesting that the suspended sediment was likely to originate from subsurface material by stream channel. These results indicated that the suspended sediment was provided mainly from subsurface material to stream channel by mass movement and/or surface erosion on bare surface of slop failure. Meanwhile, the SWAT model could simulate the runoff discharge at each outlet of the rivers, but could not show any good fitting in suspended sediment concentration. This disagreement may be attributable to the erosion model, MUSLE, incorporated into the SWAT model, which can evaluate only the surface erosion on hillslope but the mass movement and/or erosion on bare slope by stream channel. To assess and predict the water and suspended sediment dynamics in the Mu River and the Saru River watersheds, further improvement should be needed for the SWAT model.",

            "abstract": "We develop waveform inversion schemes for density, based on numerical wave propagation, adjoint techniques and various non-seismological constraints to enhance resolution.\nDensity variations drive convection in the Earth and serve as a discriminator between thermal and compositional heterogeneities. However, classical seismological observables and gravity provide only weak constraints, with strong trade-offs. To put additional constraints on density structure, we develop waveform inversion schemes that exploit the seismic waveform itself for the benefit of improved density resolution.\nOur inversion scheme is intended to incorporate any information that can help to constrain 3D density structure. This includes non-seismological information, such as gravity and the geoid, the mass and moment of inertia of the Earth, and mineral physical constraints on maximum density heterogeneities (assuming reasonable variations in temperature and composition).\nIn a series of initial synthetic experiments, we aim to construct efficient optimisation schemes that allow us to assimilate all the available types of information. For this, we use 2D numerical wave propagation combined with adjoint techniques for the computation of sensitivity kernels. With these kernels, we drive gradient-based optimisation schemes that incorporate our non-seismological constraints. Specifically, we assess the usefulness of an inversion strategy where additional information is used as hard constraints, as opposed to the optimisation of a single objective functional that incorporates all the information. Hard constraints may consist of the Earth's mass or moment of inertia, and are applied by solving a separate optimisation problem to project the initial (unconstrained) solution onto an allowed range.\nThese synthetic experiments will allow us to assess to what extent velocity and density structure need to be coupled in order to obtain useful and meaningful results to a density inversion.",

            "abstract": "The thinning of the crust and the exhumation of subcontinental mantle is accompanied by a series of extensional detachment faults. Exhumation of mantle and crustal rocks is intimately related to percolation of fluids along detachment faults leading to changes in mineralogy and chemistry of the mantle, crustal and sedimentary rocks.\nField observation, analytical methods, refraction/reflection and well-core data, allowed us to investigate the role of fluids in the Iberian margin and former Alpine Tethys distal margins and the Pyrenees rifted system. In the continental crust, fluid-rock interaction leads to saussuritization that produces Si and Ca enriched fluids found in forms of veins along the fault zone. In the zone of exhumed mantle, large amounts of water are absorbed in the first 5-6 km of serpentinized mantle, which has the counter-effect of depleting the mantle of elements (e.g., Si, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Ni and Cr) forming mantle-related fluids.\nUsing Cr-Ni-V and Fe-Mn as tracers, we show that in the distal margin, mantle-related fluids used detachment faults as pathways and interacted with the overlying crust, the sedimentary basin and the seawater, while further inward parts of the margin, continental crust-related fluids enriched in Si and Ca impregnated the fault zone and may have affected the sedimentary basin. The overall observations and results enable us to show when, where and how these interactions occurred during the formation of the rifted margin. In a first stage, continental crust-related fluids dominated the rifted systems. During the second stage, mantle-related fluids affected the overlying syn-tectonic sediments through direct migration along detachment faults at the future distal margin. In a third stage, these fluids reached the seafloor, “polluted” the seawater and were absorbed by post-tectonic sediments.\nWe conclude that a significant amount of serpentinization occurred underneath the thinned continental crust, that the mantle-related fluids might have modified the chemical composition of the sediments and seawater. We propose that the chemical signature of serpentinization that occurs during the mantle exhumation is recorded in the sediments and may serve as a proxy to date serpentinization and mantle exhumation in present day magma-poor rifted margins.",

            "abstract": "In Taiwan, groundwater resources play a vital role on the regional supply management. Because the groundwater resources have been used without proper management in decades, several kinds of natural hazards, such as land subsidence, have been occurred. The Choshui alluvial fan is one of the hot spots in Taiwan. For sustainable management, accurately estimation of recharge is the most important information. The accuracy is highly related to the uncertainty of specific yield (Sy). Besides, because the value of Sy should be tested via a multi-well pumping test, the installation cost for the multi-well system limits the number of field tests. Therefore, the low spatial density of field test for Sy makes the estimation of recharge contains high uncertainty.\nThe proposed method combines MODFLOW with a numerical integration procedure that calculates the gravity variations. Heterogeneous parameters (Sy) can be assigned to MODFLOW cells. An inverse procedure is then applied to interpret and identify the Sy value around the gravity station. The proposed methodology is applied to the Choshui alluvial fan, one of the most important groundwater basins in Taiwan. Three gravity measurement stations, “GS01”, “GS02” and “GS03”, were established. The location of GS01 is in the neighborhood of a groundwater observation well where pumping test data are available. The Sy value estimated from the gravitation measurements collected from GS01 compares favorably with that obtained from the traditional pumping test. The comparison verifies the correctness and accuracy of the proposed method. We then use the gravity measurements collected from GS02 and GS03 to estimate the Sy values in the areas where there exist no pumping test data. Using the estimated values obtained from gravity measurements, the spatial distribution of the values of specific yield for the aquifer can be further refined. The proposed method is a cost-saving and accuracy alternative for the estimation of specific yield in a regional groundwater system.",

            "abstract": "Viscous fingering is a major concern in many natural and engineered processes such as water flooding of heavy-oil reservoirs. Common reservoir simulators employ low-order finite volume/difference methods on structured grids to resolve this phenomenon. However, their approach suffers from a significant numerical dispersion error along the fingering patterns due to insufficient mesh resolution and smears out some important features of the flow. We propose use of an unstructured control volume finite element method for simulation of viscous fingering in porous media. Our approach is equipped with anisotropic mesh adaptivity where the mesh resolution is optimized based on the evolving features of flow. The adaptive algorithm uses a metric tensor field based on solution error estimates to locally control the size and shape of elements in the metric. We resolve the viscous fingering patterns accurately and reduce the numerical dispersion error significantly. The mesh optimization, generates an unstructured coarse mesh in other regions of the computational domain which significantly decreases the computational cost. The effect of grid resolution on the resolved fingers is thoroughly investigated. We analyze the computational cost of mesh adaptivty on unstructured mesh and compare it with common finite volume methods. The results of this study suggests that mesh adaptivity is an efficient and accurate approach for resolving complex behaviors and instabilities of flow in porous media such as viscous fingering.",

            "abstract": "The 1867 Keelung tsunami event has drawn significant attention from people in Taiwan. Not only because the location was very close to the 3 nuclear power plants which are only about 20km away from the Taipei city but also because of the ambiguous on the tsunami sources. This event is unique in terms of many aspects. First, it was documented on many literatures with many languages and with similar descriptions. Second, the tsunami deposit was discovered recently. Based on the literatures, earthquake, 7-meter tsunami height, volcanic smoke, and oceanic smoke were observed. Previous studies concluded that this tsunami was generated by an earthquake with a magnitude around Mw7.0 along the Shanchiao Fault. However, numerical results showed that even a Mw 8.0 earthquake was not able to generate a 7-meter tsunami. Considering the steep bathymetry and intense volcanic activities along the Keelung coast, one reasonable hypothesis is that different types of tsunami sources were existed, such as the submarine landslide or volcanic eruption. In order to confirm this scenario, last year we proposed the Tsunami Reverse Tracing Method (TRTM) to find the possible locations of the tsunami sources. This method helped us ruling out the impossible far-field tsunami sources. However, the near-field sources are still remain unclear. This year, we further developed a new method named ‘Impact Intensity Analysis’ (IIA). In the IIA method, the study area is divided into a sequence of tsunami sources, and the numerical simulations of each source is conducted by COMCOT (Cornell Multi-grid Coupled Tsunami Model) tsunami model. After that, the resulting wave height from each source to the study site is collected and plotted. This method successfully helped us to identify the impact factor from the near-field potential sources.\nThe IIA result (Fig. 1) shows that the 1867 tsunami event was a multi-source event. A mild tsunami was trigged by a Mw7.0 earthquake, and then followed by the submarine landslide or volcanic events. A near-field submarine landslide and landslide at Mien-Hwa Canyon were the most possible scenarios. As for the volcano scenarios, the volcanic eruption located about 10 km away from Keelung with 2.5x108 m3 disturbed water volume might be a candidate. The detailed scenario results will be presented in the full paper.",

The meridional meteor winds from the longitudinally spaced SuperDARN network are used to derive the planetary wave activity with zonal wave numbers 1 and 2 in the polar summer MLT (~95 km). In addition planetary wave amplitudes throughout the middle atmosphere have been retrieved from the meridional wind data of the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application (MERRA) of the NASA Global Modelling and Assimilation Office. The fitting technique used to derive the planetary wave amplitudes will be presented, and it will be shown that there are strong quasi-stationary longitudinal differences in the strength of the meridional wind in the MLT during summer which can be described as a quasi-stationary planetary wave number 1. The ground-based network allows this planetary wave to be separated from tidal perturbations that are aliased in satellite observations, and the combination of these two data sets provides evidence that the mesopause planetary wave activity is produced in situ in the MLT rather than propagating upwards from lower altitudes. Finally, the impact of this planetary wave feature on Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMC) and Polar Mesospheric Summer Echoes (PMSE) will be discussed.",

In particular, the wave model is now coupled with the ocean model through a modified version of the K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) including the influence of Langmuir mixing. The misalignment of wind and waves and the effects of Stokes depth are considered in our implementation of Langmuir mixing in KPP.\nWave-ocean only tests show substantial improvements in the upper ocean simulation, including reductions in both the shallow biases of mixed layer depth and the low biases of pCFC-11 in the Southern Ocean. Ocean-Ice-Wave and Atmosphere-Ocean-Ice-Wave coupled tests confirm these improvements when other climate feedbacks are included. Progress toward a more computationally efficient data wave model will be summarized.",

            "abstract": "To better constrain the rheology of the mantle, experimental studies on olivine grain growth have been conducted (Faul and Scott, 2006; Karato, 1989; Nichols and Mackwell, 1991) since the grain size is an important parameter under dynamic regimes (e.g. diffusion creep and grain boundary sliding). In order to better define the melt effect on the rheological response of a partially molten olivine aggregate, we have experimentally investigated the effect of melt on olivine grain growth and the connectivity of this melt phase. Experiments were performed in 3/4” piston cylinders at 500 MPa confining pressure, different temperatures (i.e. 1100°C, 1250°C and 1400°C) and four durations (1h, 12h, 72h and 15 days). Starting material was composed of natural San Carlos olivine (5 μm<grain size<15 μm) containing different amounts (0 wt%, 0.2 wt%, 1 wt% and 10 wt%) of volatile-free basalt (Sifré et al., 2014). San Carlos olivines were previously handpicked and annealed under controlled oxygen fugacity conditions close to the FMQ buffer. After the experiments, the melt connectivity was assessed through scanning electron microscope (SEM) images in backscattered electron mode. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps of each sample were also collected in order to determine the olivine grain sizes as a function of time and melt content.",

            "abstract": "Human activities including agriculture, metallurgy (e.g. mining, processing, smelting), and deforestation have altered cycles of erosion and sedimentation in lake environments for thousands of years. In the Yunnan province of southwestern China, where written records are incomplete, it is unclear when, where, and how much disturbance occurred. Lake sediments offer a means to investigate a wide variety of human activities. Here, we present a lake sediment record from Erhai (25°43’N, 100°12’E) based on trace metal concentrations that reveals substantial atmospheric and erosional pollution to the lake environment over the last 4,000 years.\nSediments indicate the initiation of copper-based metallurgy at 3,600 years BP, the existence of which has been debated amongst archaeologists. Beginning 2,000 years BP, sedimentation rates increase and concentrations of metals such as aluminum, titanium, lead, and zinc increase. This is likely linked to increased sediment flux to the lake associated with the initiation of terraced agriculture according to historical documents. The most prominent feature of the record is an abrupt and intense increase in lead, silver, cadmium, and zinc beginning at 700 years BP. The peak of this increase occurs at 600 years BP and is consistent with historical records that the Mongols established the first government operated silver mine in Yunnan. Notably, the concentrations of lead during this time are an order of magnitude greater than modern day levels of pollution.",

            "abstract": "A study of two observation-based maps (the Harmonised World Soil Database, HWSD and the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, NCSCD) of the surface 1m of soil carbon in the Arctic reveal that, although the amounts of carbon estimated to be present in this region are very uncertain, the patterns are robust: both maps have soil carbon maxima that coincide with the major wetlands in the region, as described in the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database, the GLWD. In fact, the relationship between near-surface soil carbon and the presence of wetlands is stronger than the relationship with soil temperature and vegetation productivity.\nThese relationships are explored using the land surface model of the UK Hadley Centre GCM: JULES (Joint UK Land Environment Simulator). The model is run to represent conditions at the end of the 20thcentury. Observed vegetation and phenology are used to define the vegetation, the physical properties of organic soils are represented, the fine-scale topography of the region is included in the parameterisation of the hydrology and as a result the GPP and wetlands of the region are reasonably well simulated using JULES.\nDespite this, the soil carbon simulated by the model does not reveal the same patterns and correlation with the wetland regions that are present in the data. This suggests that the model does not represent sufficiently strongly the suppression of heterotrophic respiration by saturated conditions.\nA simple adjustment to the JULES model was made whereby the heterotrophic respiration was reduced by the fraction of the grid that is modelled to be saturated. In effect, for the saturated areas the respiration was zero. This adjustment represents a simple experiment to establish the role of wetlands in defining the spatial patterns of near-surface soil carbon.\nThe results were an improved predicted spatial pattern of soil carbon, with an increase in the correlation between soil carbon and wetlands although not as strong as suggested by the analysis of the data.\nThe study suggests that land surface models in general, and JULES in particular, need to establish a stronger moderation of soil respiration in saturated conditions in order that future climate controls on wetlands in the Arctic will result in the correct changes in soil carbon and carbon emissions.",

            "abstract": "SUMO is an innovative proof-of-concept nanosatellite aiming to measure on the same platform the different components of the Earth radiation budget (ERB), the solar energy input and the energy reemitted at the top of the Earth atmosphere, with a particular focus on the far UV (FUV) part of the spectrum and on the ozone layer. The FUV is the only wavelength band with energy absorbed in the high atmosphere (stratosphere), in the ozone (Herzberg continuum, 200–220 nm) and oxygen bands, and its high variability is most probably at the origin of a climate influence (UV affects stratospheric dynamics and temperatures, altering interplanetary waves and weather patterns both poleward and downward to the lower stratosphere and tropopause). A simultaneous observation of incoming FUV and ozone production would bring an invaluable information on this process of solar-climate forcing. Space instruments have already measured the different components of the ERB but this is the first time that all instruments will operate on the same platform. This characteristic by itself guarantees original scientific results. SUMO is a 3.6 kg, 3W, 10x10x30 cm3 nanosatellite (\"3U\"), with a \"1U\" payload of <1 kg and 1 W. 5 instruments: an ozone meter, a FUV measure at 215 nm, 2 radiometers (0.2 – 3 & 0.2 – 40 µm) and a bolometer. Orbit is polar, Sun-synchronous, ~600 km, since a further challenge are relations between solar UV variability and stratospheric ozone on Arctic and Antarctic regions. Mission is expected to last 1 to 2 years. SUMO definition has been completed (platform and payload AIT are possible in 24 months). SUMO is proposed for the nanosatellite program of Polytechnic School and CNES (following QB50) for a flight in 2018. Follow-up is 2 fold: on one part more complete measurements using SUMO miniaturized instruments on a larger satellite; on the other part, increase of the coverage in local time and latitude using a constellation of SUMO nanosatellites around the Earth to further geolocalize the Sun influence on our planet. Nanosatellites, with cost and risk limited, are also excellent platforms to evaluate technologies for future missions, e.g. nanotechnology ZnO protection barriers to limit contamination from solar panels in the UV and reduce reflection losses in the visible, or MgZnO solar blind detectors (R&D initiatives proposed to CNES).",

            "abstract": "In a simple linear alluvial reach, upstream perturbations of grain size, sediment concentration and water discharge control river aggradation/degradation through their effect on river slope. At the downstream end of the system, base level also controls aggradation/degradation of the riverbed, but without change of river slope. We show that this dichotomy is important as it implies different timescale of adjustment to perturbations. Minimum aggradation time can be computed as a function of slope change or base level rise and sediment supply. Degradation time is more delicate to estimating as it depends partly on poorly constrained parameters such as the erodibility of the substratum. We use an analytical solution of alluvial slope to explore the aggradation problem: how likely is aggradation to record upstream versus downstream signals? For the degradation problem, we use a numerical model of water flow with erosion and deposition. We investigate a range of natural variations in grain size, sediment concentration and water discharge for rivers with similarity with known large fluvial systems such as the Brahmaputra and Mississippi. First results show that aggradation due to base level rise is in most cases faster than aggradation due to grain size increase or water discharge decrease, thus suggesting that such upstream perturbations will likely be overshadowed by base level changes in an icehouse climate, except in the upstream segments of a fluvial system. Perturbations of sediment concentration however are usually transmitted faster, and may thus propagate fully during periods of base level rise. This work emphasizes the competing effects of source area signals versus basin signals in determining aggradation-degradation of fluvial systems and sediment delivery to the basin margin. It confirms in particular the important disconnection between the marine and the fluvial environments during low sea level and decreased rainfall, with implications for sediment delivery to the basin margin and sequence stratigraphy.",

GMRT grids and images can be accessed through a variety of tools and interfaces including GeoMapApp (\nhttp://www.geomapapp.org\n) the GMRT MapTool (\nhttp://www.marine-geo.org/tools/maps_grids.php\n), and images can also be accessed through a Web Map Service.\nWe have recently launched a new version of our web-based GMRT MapTool interface, which provides custom access to the gridded data values in standard formats including GeoTIFF, ArcASCII and GMT NetCDF. Several resolution options are provided for these gridded data, and corresponding images can also be generated. Coupled with this new interface is an XML metadata service that provides attribution information and detailed metadata about source data components (cruise metadata, sensor metadata, and full list of source data files) for any region of interest. Metadata from the attribution service is returned to the user along with the requested data, and is also combined with the data itself in new Bathymetry Attributed Grid (BAG) formatted files.",

            "abstract": "We are proposing a secular variation candidate model for the 12th generation of the international geomagnetic reference field, spanning the years 2015-2020.\nThe novelty of our approach stands in the initialization of a 5-yr long integration of a numerical model of Earth’s dynamo by means of inverse geodynamo modelling, as introduced by Aubert (GJI, 2014). This inverse technique combines the information coming from the observations (in the form of an instantaneous estimate of the Gauss coefficients for the magnetic field and its secular variation) with that coming from the multivariate statistics of a free run of a numerical model of the geodynamo. The Gauss coefficients and their error covariance properties are determined from Swarm data along the lines detailed by Thébault et al. (EPS, 2010). The numerical model of the geodynamo is the so-called Coupled Earth Dynamo model (Aubert et al., Nature, 2013), whose variability possesses a strong level of similarity with that of the geomagnetic field.\nWe illustrate and assess the potential of this methodology by applying it to recent time intervals, with an initialization based on CHAMP data, and conclude by presenting our SV candidate, whose initialization is based on the 1st year of Swarm data\nThis work is supported by the French “Agence Nationale de la Recherche” under the grant ANR-11-BS56-011 (http://avsgeomag.ipgp.fr) and by the CNES.\n",

            "abstract": "The gross pattern of the ozone daily cycle in urban areas is similar to that of rural areas, which shows a unimodal variation. However, urban areas can evidence a secondary peak in ozone concentrations during the nighttime, thus presenting a bimodal variation in the daily cycle. Although the occurrence of nocturnal maxima (peaks) has been identified in previous studies, statistics based on long data series have not yet been fully analyzed. The main goal of this communication is to present a study of the daily variation of surface ozone, the frequency of occurrence of nocturnal maxima, their seasonality and their dependence on the type of air quality station. Hourly ozone concentrations collected in 39 background air quality stations during 24 years in Portugal were analyzed. Relationships between the frequency of occurrence of nighttime peaks and the season and the type of air quality station are demonstrated. Using road traffic data, it is suggested that the dependence on the type of air quality station is due to the impact of road traffic emissions in the late afternoon and early morning ozone titration. Moreover, using an automatic weather type classification, relationships between weather types and surface ozone concentrations are also suggested.",

            "abstract": "Detection of low magnitude event is critical and challenging in seismology. Traditional methods of event detection, which rely on phase identification, are usually hindered by low signal to noise ratio (SNR) in small event recordings. We develop a new method, named the match and locate (ML) method, for small event detection. The ML method employs some template events and detects small events through stacking cross-correlograms between waveforms of the template events and potential small event signals in the continuous waveforms over multiple stations and components. Unlike the traditional match filter method which assumes that the template event and slave event are co-located, the ML method scans over potential small event locations around the template, by making relative travel time corrections based on the relative locations of the template event and the potential small event before stacking. It makes event detection more efficient and at the same time relocates the detected event in high-precision. As an example of application and comparison with the matched filter method, we apply the ML and matched filter methods to detect the foreshocks before the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. The ML method detects four times more events than the templates and 10% more than the matched filter under the same detection threshold. Up to 42% of the events detected by the ML method are not co-located at the template locations with the largest event separation of 9.4 km. As another example of application, we apply the ML method to search for potential nuclear tests conducted by North Korea in the continuous seismic data recorded in Northeast China, using North Korea’s 2009 and 2013 tests as templates. We report detection of a low-yield nuclear test conducted by North Korea in 2010.",

Using contact data bases from AGU, the American Astronomical Society’s Solar Physics Division (AAS-SPD), attendees of NOAA’s Space Weather Week and proposal submissions to NSF’s Atmospheric, Geospace Science Division, the AIP’s Statistical Research Center cross correlated and culled these data bases resulting in 2776 unique email addresses of US based working professionals. The survey received 1305 responses (51%) and generated 125 pages of single space answers to a number of open-ended questions.

            "abstract": "When observing aerosols from space in the UV range , the upwelling radiation is dependent not only on the aerosol intrinsic properties but also on the location of the aerosol layer in the atmospheric column. In the current operational retrieval by the OMI 2-band algorithm (OMAERUV), the aerosol height is assumed and the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA) at 388nm are derived. Since the sensitivity to aerosol altitude occurs only at UV wavelengths, it suggests that if the AOD is known a priori, the associated SSA and aerosol height can be derived. The theoretical approach and first applications of this method has been explored previously by combining OMI with MODIS AODs (extrapolated to the OMI’s wavelengths) over the ocean. However, no detailed studies have been carried out by comparing with independent measurements such as those from the CALIPSO lidar.\nThis poster will show detailed case studies of collocated and simultaneous observations of aerosol height (from the space borne lidar CALIOP) and AOD (from MODIS-Aqua) with the objective to evaluate the aerosol height assumed and the AOD at 500nm derived by OMAERUV. The cases were selected in areas known for biomass burning (off the coast of South Africa-Madagascar) and for dust and dust mixed with smoke (such as off the coast of Dakar). By comparing with Calipso, this analysis will highlight the sensitivity of OMAERUV retrievals to aerosol layer thickness and location in the atmospheric column, both parameters currently assumed by the retrieval algorithm.",

            "abstract": "The western rift of Corinth (Greece) is one of the most active tectonic structures of the euro-mediterranean area. Its NS opening rate is 1.5 cm/yr ( strain rate of 10-6/yr) results into a high microseismicity level and a few destructive, M>6 earthquakes per century, activating a system of mostly north dipping normal faults. Since 2001, monitoring arrays of the European Corinth Rift Laboratory (CRL, www.crlab.eu) allowed to better track the mechanical processes at work, with short period and broad band seismometers, cGPS, borehole strainmeters, EM stations, …). The recent (300 kyr) tectonic history has been revealed by onland (uplifted fan deltas and terraces) and offshore geological studies (mapping, shallow seismic, coring), showing a fast evolution of the normal fault system. The microseismicity, dominated by swarms lasting from days to months, mostly clusters in a layer 1 to 3 km thick, between 6 and 9 km in depth, dipping towards north, on which most faults are rooting. The diffusion of the microseismicity suggests its triggering by pore pressure transients, with no or barely detected strain. Despite a large proportion of multiplets, true repeaters seem seldom, suggesting a minor contribution of creep in their triggering, although transient or steady creep is clearly detected on the shallow part of some majors faults. The microseismic layer may thus be an immature, downward growing detachment, and the dominant rifting mechanism might be a mode I, anelastic strain beneath the rift axis , for which a mechanical model is under development. Paleoseismological (trenching, paleoshorelines, turbidites), archeological and historical studies completed the catalogues of instrumental seismicity, motivating attempts of time dependent hazard assessment. The Near Fault Observatory of CRL is thus a multidisciplinary research infrastructure aiming at a better understanding and modeling of multiscale, coupled seismic/aseismic processes on fault systems.",

            "abstract": "I use a simple box model to explore possible differences in the liquid composition of Titan’s seas. Major variations in the abundance of involatile ethane, somewhat analogous to salinity in terrestrial waters, arise from the hydrological cycle, which introduces more “fresh” methane rainfall at the highest latitudes in summer and keeps the system 'off balance'. Comparing the precipitation and evaporation fluxes with likely tidal mixing fluxes, I find the composition of Ligeia Mare to be substantially flushed by methane rainfall which causes it to export its solutes to Kraken via a narrow labyrinth of channels. Ligeia therefore may have a methane-rich (~80%) composition, well out of thermodynamic equilibrium with the atmosphere, whereas the basins of Kraken are relatively well-mixed and will be ethane-dominated (~60%). These composition variations, analogous to Earth’s salinity gradient between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean (or the Baltic and the North Sea) may be detectable with Cassini measurements and are important for future exploration.\nComparing the depth of Ligeia measured at 160m with the annual rainfall predicted by Global Circulation Models of about 10m at the highest latitudes, and assuming a modest catchment area, suggests that Ligeia Mare should undergo only modest seasonal changes in composition, assuming surface 'waters' are mixed into the depths.

            "abstract": "Removing the Merrimack Village Dam on the lower Souhegan River (drainage area ~570 km2) in southern New Hampshire in August 2008 provided a field-scale experiment in river response to a major change in sediment flux and base level. We began monitoring the study area in August 2007, surveying a series of eight permanent cross sections within the impoundment and four downstream between the dam and the confluence with the Merrimack River (drainage area ~8,000 km2). We also surveyed the longitudinal profile through the 1-km study reach, measured bed grain size distribution, and photographed the site from ground-level stations. We conducted nine repeat surveys from 2008 to 2014, with the greatest frequency soon after dam removal. In 2012 and 2014, we also surveyed the former impoundment using low-altitude aerial photographs and structure-from-motion photogrammetry. The dam removal resulted in a near-instantaneous 3.9-m drop in base level in the impoundment. The river incised rapidly through the impounded sand and removed over 50% of it within the first two months. This added sediment load resulted in up to 3.2 m of deposition in the downstream reach. After the initial, rapid phase of channel adjustment, ongoing erosion of reservoir sediment depended primarily on flood events that could access sediment stored outside of the newly developed, active channel. By 2011, about 20% of the impounded sand remained, and this proportion was similar in the 2012 and 2014 surveys. The erosion process in the former impoundment was modulated by the recruitment of large wood (several 15-20 m tall trees with intact rootballs) from terraces through bank erosion, which remained stable in the channel and armored the banks. In the past two years, these trees have begun to be buried in newly deposited sediment, suggesting initiation of a floodplain large-wood cycle (Collins et al., 2012). At present, establishment of herbaceous vegetation on geomorphic surfaces is an important process controlling the medium-term response of the former impoundment.",

These repeated transects (at least two per year, separated in time by days-weeks) provide an opportunity to assess the inter-annual and shorter term (days-weeks) changes in hydrographic structure, ocean temperature, current velocity and transport, chlorophyll fluorescence, nutrients, and micro- and mesozooplankton community composition and abundance. Inter-annual variability in all properties was high and was associated with larger scale, meteorological forcing. Shorter-term variability could also be high but was strongly influenced by changes in local wind forcing. The sustained sampling at this location provided critical measures of inter-annual variability that should permit detection of longer-term trends that are associated with ongoing climate change.",

            "abstract": "To make a significant impact on anthropogenic CO2 emissions, geologic carbon sequestration would require thousands of CO2 repositories around the world. Unconventional reservoirs, such as igneous rocks and fractured formations, may add substantial storage capacity and diversify CO2 storage options. In particular, basaltic rocks represent a promising target due to their widespread occurrence, potentially suitable reservoir structure and high reactivity with CO2, but a comprehensive evaluation of worldwide CO2 sequestration capacity in unconventional reservoirs is lacking. In this presentation we summarize available data on storage potential of basaltic rocks and fractured formations illustrated by field examples from the Columbia River Basalt, the Newark Rift Basin and IODP Site 1256, and discuss potential limiting factors, such as effective porosity and the risk of inducing earthquakes by CO2 injections.\nLarge Igneous Provinces (LIPs), low-volume flows and intrusions, and ocean floor basalt represent three general classes of basaltic reservoirs, each characterized by different structure and storage capacity. Oceanic plateaus and LIPs are projected to have the highest CO2 storage capacity, on the order of thousands gigatons (Gt) per site, followed by continental LIPs and ocean floor basalts (hundreds to thousands Gt per site). Isolated basalt flows and intrusions are likely to offer only low- to moderate-capacity options. An important limiting factor on CO2 injection volumes and rates is the risk of inducing earthquakes by increasing pore pressure in the subsurface. On continents, available in situ stress analysis suggests that local stress perturbations at depth may create relaxed stress conditions, allowing for pore pressure increase without reactivating fractures and faults. Remote storage sites on oceanic plateaus and below the seafloor are advantageous due to low impact of potential seismic and/or leakage events. Other effects, such as thermal stresses created by temperature difference between injected fluid and the host formation, may be particularly important for reservoir stability in high-temperature offshore locations. Overall, unconventional reservoirs in offshore locations offer the potential benefits of vast and safe storage for captured CO2 emissions.",

            "abstract": "In this study the analysis of a heavy rainfall event on 13 December 2009 over the United Arab Emirates (UAE) region is presented. This event, with daily maximum rainfall greater than 90 mm is observed with ina span of 9 hours which is very high over this region. The main aim is to understand the synoptic features and its large scale dynamics associated with this event. The favorable conditions responsible for the formation of the event have been studied using surface and upper air data sets. The relation between heavy precipitation event and the mid and low tropospheric conditions is investigated by using National Center for Environmental precipitation (NCEP) reanalysis data sets. The dynamics associated with the heavy rainfall event is studied by using composite maps. The synoptic situation with low level trough and strong south westerly wind with high equivalent potential temperatures across the baroclinic zone is one of the important patterns that favor the formation of convection or instability conditions. The existence of anti-cyclonic flow over the Arabian Peninsula causes the moisture transport from the nearby seas, which plays a major role in fueling the precipitation processes over this region. This event is characterized by the south westerly flow and eastward propagating waves, which causes wave amplification and breaking the intrusion of mid latitude upper level troughs into the subtropics that trigger storm activity or convection over this region. The combination of advected moisture, low level warm and upper level cold air causes tropospheric instability. Strong upper level divergence over the Mediterranean Sea and convergence over the southern parts of the Saudi Arabia is observed. More details will be presented during conference.",

            "abstract": "Over most of the Earth, sea salt aerosol (SSA) derives from sea spray and bubble bursting at the open ocean surface. SSA as the major component of marine aerosol contributes directly to the radiative balance and can act as cloud condensation nuclei. SSA can also significantly impact the lifetime of methane, ozone or mercury through the photochemical release of reactive halogens. A recent model study suggested that the sublimation of saline blowing snow above sea ice can generate more SSA than is produced from a similar area of open ocean. A winter cruise through the Weddell Sea during June - August 2013 provided unique access to a potential SSA source region in the Antarctic sea ice zone to test this hypothesis.\nReported are first measurements of snow particle as well as aerosol concentrations, size distributions and chemical composition, during blowing snow events above sea ice. Snow particle spectra are found to be similar to those observed on the continent. Even though the salinity of surface and blowing snow was very low (<0.1 psu) a significant increase of aerosol in the SSA size range was observed during and after blowing snow events. This is consistent with model runs including a blowing snow parameterisation which suggest low sensitivity of SSA number densities to snow salinity within the observed range. First estimates of SSA flux from blowing snow using eddy correlation are significant, although falling below published values of the sea spray source function. We discuss the dependance of observed SSA production rates on ambient conditions as well as the significance to the Southern Ocean environment.",

We assumed in our computation that the parameter values are all the same although the Perry et al’s relationship between crustal thickness and heat flows to compute Moho temperature was derived for the Canadian Shield. For the heat flow data, we used the published global heat flow data (\nhttp://www.heatflow.und.edu\n) augmented with some recent heat flow measurements from Korea, and the LLN3_G3Dv3 for P-wave tomography model (JGR, doi:10.1029/2012JB009525). Preliminary results do not show a significant correlation between the computed Moho temperature and the P-wave velocity model perhaps due to uncertainty in the parameter values used in the computation as well as the empirical relation. An empirical relationship between the observed heat flow and the Moho temperature for the Canadian shield might be different for a backarec basin area like the East Sea, Korea. However, we noted that there exists a moderate negative correlation between the total crustal thickness and heat flow - less heat flows with increasing crustal thickness with a relation of Heat_Flow (mW/m2) = 205 – 18.3 * Crustal_Thickness (km). The modeled Moho temperature displays a trend of higher values (900o K -1400o K) from Japan toward the beneath of Yamato Basin and Rise in the NW direction, and beneath the Ulleung Basin area. Another higher Moho temperature (>1000o K) contour band is observed in the area north of Japan Basin, approximately centered along the 139.5o E.",

            "abstract": "The relation between ground deformation and caldera development can be studied at the Askja caldera complex at the divergent plate boundary in Iceland. The Lake Öskjuvatn caldera, 4-5 km wide and about 250 m deep, began forming shortly prior to a major explosive eruption in 1875 and continued to grow rapidly for over 2 decades. The boundaries of the caldera collapse remain unstable. A large rockslide on 21 July 2014 of the order of 30-100 million cubicmeters generated a lake tsunami with run up heights of over 30 m. Geodetic measurements at the volcano since 1983 suggest that instability of the basal plane of failure of the rockslide may have steadily increased as the volcano deflated throughout this period. Deformation (subsidence and horizontal contraction) has been mapped by levelling, distance measurements, GPS and satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) using the ERS, Envisat, Radarsat, TerraSAR-X and Cosmo-SkyMed satellites. An intermediate digital elevation model has been delivered by the TanDEM-X mission. Initial subsidence rate was up to 7 cm/yr, decaying to 2-3 cm in recent years. A large part of the signal can be reproduced by a model with pressure decrease in a spherical source at 3 km depth, interpreted as a pressure drop in a magma chamber, or subsidence may occur over a structurally weak region in relation to plate spreading. The 2014 rockslide has a basal plane of failure passing through intact rock. A section of the basal plane is exhumed by the slide, revealing impressive striations and slip marks. A simple model, assuming uniform elastic halfspace with a rectangular failure plane extending to the surface, indicates that Coulomb stress on the failure plane or a deeper weakness zone under the rockslide, increased by over 2 MPa since 1983 due to the deflation, exceeding the change often associated with stress triggering of earthquakes. Furthermore, the slide occurred in an area of persistent geothermal and seismic activity. Although gravity, geothermal alteration, topography and climate factors are likely to dictate mostly the 21 July 2014 rockslide, our observations and modelling indicate the rockslide is an integral event in the development of the Öskjuvatn caldera, with deflation of the volcano in recent decades contributing to instability of the caldera boundary and failure on the basal plane of the rockslide.",

            "abstract": "When analyzing CMEs in real time for space weather forecasting, a lack of sufficient coronagraph images can make it difficult to determine the CME’s location. In these cases, usually the location of significant disk signatures (for example, an associated flare) is used to estimate the CME’s location. Although this assumption seems reasonable, observational and numerical studies have shown that CME locations can deviate by ten or more degrees from the source location close to the solar surface. In this work, we present a study of more than 50 events during 2010-2014 covering a range of CME speeds, widths, and source locations. We use the CCMC’s space weather Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, and Information (DONKI) to select events, and use the SWPC’s CME Analysis Tool to measure CMEs in the SOHO/LASCO and STEREO/SECCHI coronagraph images. We find a range of deflections, from less than 5 degrees to more than 15 degrees. It has been proposed that CMEs deflect during propagation due to interactions with other large-scale structures such as coronal holes, streamers, current sheets, and other CMEs. In this study we focus on the influence of coronal holes. We use a combination of SDO/AIA and SECCHI/EUVI images to locate coronal holes near the CME source locations. We present the calculated CME deflection angles as a function of height in the corona, average speed, average width, and coronal hole properties. The goal of this study is to determine appropriate ranges of latitudes and longitudes that can be used in CME ensemble modeling. This requires that coronal hole observations are more systematically incorporated in real time CME analysis for space weather forecasting.\nJ.

The satellite-derived estimates were produced with a neural network operating on a combination of microwave, visible, and infrared satellite data products. Properties of these flux datasets were assessed by subjective and statistical methods, including comparisons with data from flux towers. The agreement with tower fluxes is closer for the satellite-derived fluxes than for the LSM fluxes with respect to overall temporal variability. For interannual variations of sub-seasonal fluxes, the satellite/NN and LSM fluxes have similar, moderate correlations (~0.4) with the tower fluxes. Driving factors contributing to the interannual variability and recurrent discrepancies between these flux estimates were identified.

            "abstract": "Ganymede is the only satellite which has its own magnetosphere, which is embedded in the Jovian magnetosphere (Kivelson et al. 1996). This peculiar interaction has been investigated by means of a 3D parallel multi-species hybrid model based on a CAM-CL algorithm (Mathews et al. 1994). In this formalism, ions have a kinetic description whereas electrons are considered as an inertialess fluid which ensures the neutrality of the plasma and contributes to the total current and electronic pressure. Maxwell’s equations are solved to compute the temporal evolution of electromagnetic field. Hybrid simulations are performed on a uniform cartesian grid with a spatial resolution of about 240 km. Our results are globally consistent with other models and Galileo measurements. Nevertheless, our description of the magnetopause and the ionosphere is not satisfying enough due to the low spatial resolution. Indeed, we want to describe scale heights of 125 km in the ionosphere whereas the best spatial resolution that we are allowed to use is about 240 km. Therefore, in order to obtain more efficient and relevant results, it is necessary to improve the size of the grid. In this optic, we are introducing a multi-grids approach in order to refine the spatial resolution by a factor 2 (~120km) near Ganymede. The creation of a finer mesh in the simulation grid leads to make some peculiar computations at the interfaces between the two different grids, whether for the calculation of moments, such as charge density or current, or the computation of electromagnetic fields. Moreover, the parallelization of the code, based on domain decomposition methods, imposes us to take care of boundary conditions. In the hybrid model, macroparticules, which represent a kind of cloud of physical particles, have a volume equal to that of a grid cell. Then, the macroparticules entering into the higher spatial resolution region are splited into smaller macroparticules whose the volume corresponds to the volume of a cell of the finer mesh. The improvement of the spatial resolution in the hybrid model will also allow us to relevantly couple the results of this model with those of our 3D multi-species exospheric model (Turc et al. 2014), into a test-particle model that describes the ionosphere of Ganymede. Basic tests and validation results of the multi-grids approach are presented.",

            "abstract": "Temporary rivers, those rivers that periodically cease to flow, constitute over half of the total discharge of the global river network and are expected to increase in extent as a consequence of climatic shifts and water resource development. Despite their ubiquity, projected increased frequency, and ecological significance, the spatial and temporal controls on flow permanence remain poorly understood. Hydrogeomorphic research to date on temporary rivers has primarily focused on network expansion and contraction patterns with comparatively little consideration of mechanistic controls on temporary streamflow dynamics. The present work integrates hydrologic, geomorphic, and land cover processes across spatiotemporal scales that control streamflow dynamics in temporary rivers that are meaningful to ecological research in these systems. We first present a conceptual diagram that describes spatiotemporal expansion and contraction cycles of temporary rivers. Spatiotemporal dynamics of network expansion and contraction are complex; however, commonalities in wetting and drying patterns and degrees of connectivity exist at network (>103m), reach (101-3m), and local (<101m) spatial scales. Next, we propose a spatiotemporal framework to evaluate hydrologic, geomorphic, and land cover controls on temporary streamflow based on a synthesis of the current state of knowledge. For example, we identify specific precipitation patterns and watershed characteristics that influence flow permanence across spatial and temporal scales that range from the watershed to sub-meter and millennial to hours. Finally, we discuss research priorities for temporary rivers that can elucidate confounding interactions and directionality of hydrology, geomorphology, and land cover on flow permanence. Two methods priorities for future field research are: use of tracers and isotopes for identifying age, sources, and pathways of water within a riverscape and monitoring networks for assessing spatiotemporal patterns of surface and subsurface flow within temporary river networks. Currently, we are forced to infer from studies of perennial rivers and a few well studied temporary rivers. Further temporary river specific research is required to test and validate our assertions.",

            "abstract": "Soil-atmosphere exchange is an important transport process influencing environmental fate and transport of many persistent organic pollutants (POPs). This study focuses on modelling the gaseous exchange of a semi-volatile polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (phenanthrene) between soil and the atmosphere using the multicomponent reactive transport code MIN3P. MIN3P is typically applied to simulate aqueous and vapor phase subsurface transport and reaction processes. We extended the code to also include an atmospheric boundary layer where eddy diffusion and photodegradation take place. The relevant processes and parameters affecting soil-atmosphere exchange were investigated in several scenarios and at various time scales. We found that phenanthrene is well-mixed in the atmospheric boundary layer under neutral or stable atmospheric conditions due to fast eddy diffusion. Uptake of airborne phenanthrene to soils is limited by the soil properties and initially depends on diffusion in soil gas and sorption to the solids. On the long term seepage water dominates transport into deeper soil layers; biodegradation finally leads to steady-state concentration profiles in the subsurface typically achieved after a few centuries. If concentrations in the atmosphere decrease, e.g. due to environmental legislation, then soils become sources for the POPs for the first two months and function as sinks again for the POPs until new steady state concentrations are reached (after decades to centuries). MIN3P was also used to simulate diurnal soil-atmosphere exchanges of airborne pollutants due to temperature changes and photodegradation, both which cause fluctuations in atmospheric concentrations and therefore affect mass transfer between soil and the atmosphere. The model can further be applied to estimate the environmental fate of other POPs between soil and the atmosphere under different environmental pollution and climate change scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The mechanical behaviour -- and hence earthquake potential -- of faults in continental interiors is a question of critical importance for the resultant seismic hazard, but no consensus has yet been reached on this controversial topic. The debate has focused on the central and eastern United States, in particular the New Madrid Seismic Zone, struck by three magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes in 1811--1812, and to a lesser extent the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone just to the north. A key aspect of this issue is the rate at which strain is currently accruing on those faults in the plate interior, a quantity that remains debated. Understanding if the present-day strain rates indicate sufficient motion to account for the historical and paleoseismological earthquakes by steady-state fault behaviour, or if strain accumulation is time-dependent in this area, is critical for investigating the causative process driving this seismicity in the plate interior, and how regional strain reflects the interplay between stresses arising from different geological processes. Here we address this issue with an analysis of up to 14 years of continuous GPS data from a network of 200 sites in the central United States centred on the New Madrid and Wabash Valley seismic zones. We find that high-quality sites in these regions show motions that are consistently within the 95% confidence limit of zero deformation relative to a rigid background. These results place an upper bound on regional strain accrual of 0.2 mm/yr and 0.5 mm/yr in the New Madrid and Wabash Valley Seismic Zones, respectively. These results, together with increasing evidence for temporal clustering and spatial migration of earthquake sequences in continental interiors, indicate that either tectonic loading rates or fault properties vary with time in the NMSZ and possibly plate-wide.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting the impacts of biomass burning (BB) plumes on air quality is difficult due to the complex photochemistry that takes place in the concentrated young BB plumes. The spatial grid of global and regional scale Eulerian models is generally too large to resolve BB photochemistry, which can lead to errors in predicting the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and O3, as well as the partitioning of NOyspecies. AER’s Aerosol Simulation Program (ASP v2.1) can be used within plume-scale Lagrangian models to simulate this complex photochemistry. We will present results of validation studies of the ASP model against aircraft observations of young BB smoke plumes. We will also present initial results from the coupling of ASP v2.1 into the Lagrangian particle dispersion model STILT-Chem in order to better examine the interactions between BB plume chemistry and dispersion.\nIn addition, we have used ASP to develop a sub-grid scale parameterization of the near-source chemistry of BB plumes for use in regional and global air quality models. The parameterization takes inputs from the host model, such as solar zenith angle, temperature, and fire fuel type, and calculates enhancement ratios of O3, NOx, PAN, aerosol nitrate, and other NOy species, as well as organic aerosol (OA). We will present results from the ASP-based BB parameterization as well as its implementation into the global atmospheric composition model GEOS-Chem for the SEAC4RS campaign.",

FADN is an instrument for evaluating the income of agricultural holdings and the impacts of the Common Agricultural Policy.\nCrops were selected based on incidence of cultivated area on the total arable land of FADN farms net. Among others, the database contains data on irrigation management (irrigated surface, length of irrigation season, volumes of water, etc.), and crop production. Meteorological data series were obtained by a combination of local weather stations and ECAD E-obs spatialized database.\nCrop water footprints were evaluated against water availability and risk of desertification maps of Italy. Further, we compared the crop water footprints obtained with our methodology with already existing data from similar studies in order to highlight the effects of spatial scale and level of detail of available data.",

            "abstract": "Global wetland methane (CH4) emissions and its spatiotemporal patterns were evaluated using a new process-based model called TRIPLEX-GHG. The model was developed based on the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS), coupled with a new CH4 biogeochemistry module and a water table module to simulate CH4 emission processes in natural wetlands. The model has been validated using a number of field observations successfully. This study reported the initial results of global scale application, including total CH4 emissions, spatiotemporal patterns, and contributions to the atmospheric CH4 fluctuations. Global annual wetland CH4 emission ranged from 150 TgC yr-1 to 174 TgC yr-1 between 1901 and 2012 with the peak occurring in 1991 and 2012. Between 1990 and 2010, global CH4 emission decreased with a rate of approximately 0.38 TgC yr-1. It was largely due to the decrease of CH4 emissions from topical wetlands, which had a decreasing trend with a rate of 0.33 TgC yr-1 since the 1970s. CH4 emissions from tropical, temperate, and high latitude wetlands comprised 63%, 22% and 15% of global CH4 emission, respectively. Tropical wetlands are the primary contributor of the inter-annual variability of global wetland CH4 emissions as well as atmospheric CH4. The stable-to-decreasing wetland CH4 emissions owing to the balance of emissions between tropical and extratropical wetlands was a contributing factor to the slow-down atmospheric CH4 growth rate during 1990s. The rapid drop in tropical wetland CH4 emissions from 2000 onwards is supposed to offset the increases of the anthropogenic CH4 emissions, hence leading to a relatively stable level of atmospheric CH4 during 2000-2006. Increases of wetland CH4 emissions particularly after 2010 can be considered as an important contributor to the resumed growth of atmospheric CH4 since 2007 and for further increasing in the near future.",

The high energy plasmasphere tail is the upper 5% of plasmasphere energies, consisting of ions between 1 - 10 eV. We calculated plasma densities over this energy range and see that there is strong depletion in O+ and H+ from 1-4 MLT and a similar but less dramatic density decline in He+.

            "abstract": "A new concept for in situgroundwater remediation was recently developed where drilled horizontal wells filled with granular treatment media are installed in the direction of groundwater flow. Due to the differences in hydraulic conductivity (K) of the media in the well and the surrounding aquifer, groundwater is “focused” into the well and treated (Figure 1).\nInitial computer simulations demonstrate that the horizontal well will have a substantial capture zone making this a viable and appealing remediation strategy. In this work, a laboratory scale model was constructed to validate the computer simulations and determine the expected capture zone of a horizontal well under a range of hydraulic conductivity differentials.\nWe have built a physical model to replicate a horizontal well in a confined aquifer. The model is constructed inside a 55-gallon drum packed with sand and water is pumped into the bottom of the drum and flows upward through the system. Within the aquifer, we installed a 1” screened well packed with lime-soda beads. To define the capture zone, we placed manometers in the aquifer. Finally, a constant head is applied to the system (Figure 2 and 3).\nInitial tests have shown that the 1” well with a hydraulic conductivity 65 times greater than the surrounding aquifer (kwell= 1.3 cm/sec vs. kaquifer= 0.02cm/sec) will capture a significant percentage (over 80% in some configurations) of the water applied to the system. A tracer test has shown that the water velocity in the well is substantially higher than the aquifer. Manometer readings confirm the flowfield effects of the well and these data are being used to calibrate numerical models.\nThe presentation will focus on the observed behavior of the physical model under varying applied head and hydraulic conductivities and discuss the potential design implications for full-scale application.",

This work revises these ideas and uses earthquakes as the paradigm to demonstrate that slowly driven systems evolving through uncorrelated and power-law distributed avalanches (UPLA) are not necessarily critical systems, and therefore not necessarily unpredictable. By linking the correlation length to the pdf of the distribution, and comparing it with the one obtained at a critical point, a condition of criticality is introduced. Simulations in the classical Olami-Feder-Christensen (OFC) earthquake model confirm the findings, showing that earthquakes are not a critical phenomenon. However, one single catastrophic earthquake may show critical properties and, paradoxically, the emergence of this temporal critical behaviour may eventually carry precursory signs of catastrophic events.",

            "abstract": "Despite the wealth of historical and geological insights into coastal and estuarine landform behaviour, models capable of generating quantitative predictions at decadal to centennial scales are required if we are to meet the management challenges of the 21st century. Despite an emerging consensus that progress on this front is more likely to be made through models that are essentially synthesist in approach, the nature of marine forcing, especially in estuaries, means that it is frequently necessary to retain a degree of hydrodynamic complexity that can only be obtained via more reductionist models. We see great potential, therefore, in fusing these approaches rather than deploying them separately as end members of a modelling spectrum. This paper thus presents a novel approach to mesoscale estuary morphological evolution that combines physically complete 1-D simulation of tidal hydrodynamics, highly parameterised 2-D mechanistic representation of wave-driven tidal flat morphodynamics, and a largely empirical representation of 2-D variation in salt marsh deposition. This approach is embodied in the Estuary SpaTial LandscapE Evolution Model (ESTEEM) code, being developed in the UK as part of the NERC-funded iCOASST project. ESTEEM classifies an estuary into the distinct landform types (subtidal channel, tidal flat, etc), which are then simulated appropriately via one of the approaches highlighted above. Other notable aspects of the model architecture include use of a composite raster and vector data model and compatibility with the OpenMI external coupling standard. The paper describes the contrasting algorithmic approaches and presents illustrative 100-year simulations for a test case estuary.",

            "abstract": "Winter storms pose a number of hazards to coastal communities in the U.S. Northeast including heavy rain and/or snow, strong wind, cold temperatures, as well as coastal and fresh water flooding. In combination and as separate “events”, these hazards threaten infrastructure and can cause millions of dollars of property damage in one state from one storm alone. A study of the impacts of several recent winter storms from 2005-2012 on 4 coastal counties in Connecticut, 15 in New Jersey, and 13 in New York underscores the significant economic consequences the climate can have on private and public property. Data on events and associated property damage from the National Climatic Data Center Storm Events Database indicates that flood and wind events were documented most frequently for these winter storms and were responsible for the highest damages overall. Although New Jersey experienced the most events and property damage, there is no discernable connection between the number of events that afflict a county or state and the level of damage they face. For example, the data shows that a low number of flood events, both coastal and freshwater, accounted for the largest losses. Furthermore, the study reveals that winter storms may affect suburban property more than urban infrastructure since suburban New Jersey suffered the most property damage while urban counties in New York sustained little to no costs in comparison. An examination of the relationship between property damage from the recent storms and each county’s coastal land area and population below 3 meters suggests that the amount of damage reported is related to the land area at lower elevations but there is no direct link between losses and the population density below 3 meters.",

            "abstract": "A diverse suite of tectonic and climatic drivers influenced the topographic evolution of the western USA Cordillera. Despite years of study, considerable uncertainty remains about fundamentals of this evolution, such as the timing and magnitude of maximum average elevations for the different physiographic provinces; the drivers and topographic effects of different episodes of extension during the Cenozoic; and the relative relief of peaks and intermontane basins within the Cordillera at different times and in different places. Numerous tectonic models have been developed to explain the evolution of the Cordillera, and understanding these details is key for distinguishing between these different models. In addition, the topographic changes in the Cordillera have important implications for regional and local climate of the western US at different times in the past, and may drive important differences in local climatic responses to global climate changes through the Cenozoic. The majority of the tools that currently exist for quantitatively reconstructing changes in topography through time and space rely on paleoclimate proxy data. Thus it is also important to be able to disentangle climatic change from elevation change in terrestrial paleoclimate records.\nTo address some of these outstanding questions, we have generated and compiled paleotemperature estimates from the Late Cretaceous through the Miocene of the western US. In this presentation, we will focus on the latest installment of the project, which utilizes Oligocene paleotemperature records from central Utah and South Dakota and Miocene-Holocene paleotemperature records from Kansas. The data are dominantly composed of mean annual temperature estimates from leaf margin analysis and summer temperature estimates from carbonate clumped isotope thermometry. We will discuss how these data compare to temperature data from the Paleogene from the western US, what general trends exist within all the data and how these compare to global climate trends, and finally what the data suggest for topographic changes through time.",

            "abstract": "Analysis of the oscillations of buildings — either excited by earthquakes or by ambient noise — has become an effective tool to evaluate the response of such structures to strong ground motion, and hence to assess their seismic vulnerability. Response to small-amplitude ground motion may also provide crucial information on the elastic and anelastic properties of a structure — essential in the case of historical buildings — and constrain numerical full dynamic structural analyses. We report about an analysis carried out for a tall medieval monumental building in the urban center of the Norther Italian city of Bologna. Seismic monitoring, carried on for six months using field seismic instrumentation, has revealed the response to ambient noise, and has allowed to reconstruct, with high detail, the free oscillation modes of the tower.\nAt 97 meters, the XII-century tower of the Asinelli is the tallest masonry building in Europe, and the most slender. We measured the fundamental, and several higher-order, flexural normal modes of oscillation, as well as the fundamental torsional mode. Asymmetry due to non-coincidence of centers of mass and of stiffness produces slightly different modal frequencies of oscillation in two orthogonal directions, consistently with dynamical modeling. Horizontal particle-motion polarization plots show the cyclic energy transfer between two degrees of freedom of the system. The Asinelli spectral signature can also be easily recognized in the motion recorded at the base of nearby Garisenda. We verify that there is correlation of spectral amplitudes with time of the day — in agreement with expected time-variance of anthropic disturbance —- but also with wind velocity and, intriguingly, with temperature variations inside the buidings.\nWe are using these data to adjust the numerical dynamical models of the buildings, to examine time variations of behavior, and to identify the origin of anthropogenic sources of vibration in view of their possible mitigation.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG). Its 100-year global warming potential (GWP) is 25 times larger than that for carbon dioxide. Oxidation of CH4 by OH is the main loss process, thus affecting the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and contributing to the global ozone background. The 100-yr integrated GWP of CH4 is sensitive to changes in OH levels and feedbacks of CH4 emission itself. In this study we implement a computationally efficient CH4-CO-OH parameterization into the NASA GEOS5-AGCM to simulate CO, OH and CH4 over the last three decades. We use this efficient interactive parameterization to investigate the CH4, CO and OH trends and variability and will compare the results to a CH4-only (with fixed CO and OH fields) as well as to a full chemistry model setup, constrained with CH4 fluxes, to see how differences in simulated OH may impact methane. We will investigate the key chemical processes that may affect the global OH budgets and thus the CH4 lifetime and trends. In this context, we will investigate the global OH-recycling as well as the impact of important OH sources. The results will be validated with a suite of ground based and satellite measurements. The results are expected to improve our understanding of OH and CH4 global budget and trends.",

            "abstract": "The association between cold-water coral mounds and contourite drift deposits has been demonstrated in the Belgica mound province, off Ireland. On that location, IODP expedition 307 was able to drill through the base of a mound, dating mound initiation at 2.65 Ma. However, the Belgica mounds are just one of the many expressions of mound growth. More enigmatic is the buried Magellan mound province, located in the northern part of the Porcupine Basin, featuring over 1000 relatively closely spaced buried mounds, which are all rooted on a common reflector. This indicates a common start-up event, but the true driving forces behind their initial settling, growth and demise are still unknown. The influence of bottom currents cannot be ruled out, since clear obstacle marks are present surrounding the mounds. In 2013, some 3000 km south of the Magellan mounds, a new province of buried mounds was discovered along the Moroccan Atlantic Margin, which may shed new light on the “life” cycle of mounds. Here, we report the preliminary results and propose a first view on the controls, interactions and connectivity between these 2 provinces, assisted by a series of studies of contourite drifts along the Eastern Atlantic Margin.\nThe newly discovered buried mounds can be associated to a vast province of several clusters of seabed mounds. They occur in water depths between 500 and 1000 m, buried under up to 50 m of sediment. With respect to the Magellan mounds, they are smaller, but more importantly, they do not root on one single stratigraphic level. At least 4 different initiation levels were identified. The off-mound reflectors indicate a slight influence of bottom currents, since the mounds are located in a large sediment drift. Moreover, the link between the two buried mound provinces may be found in connecting the evolution of the associated contourite drift systems, respectively in Porcupine Seabight and the Gulf of Cádiz. Intermediate sites on Goban Spur and near Le Danois Bank have enabled to correlate stratigraphic events over such large distances, mainly driven by changes in the Mediterranean Outflow Water. However, the influence of the Antarctic Intermediate Water on the Moroccan Margin may not be underestimated, suggesting a linkage between the dynamics of both water masses in the southern Gulf of Cádiz.",

            "abstract": "About 6 millennia ago the maximum Holocene transgression reached c. 20 km inland. Thereafter, the coastline has continuously shifted westwards due to the progradation of the Küçük Menderes delta and its tributaries. Consequently, settlement and harbour sites were established following the retreating coastline. Our interdisciplinary geoarchaeological research focuses on (i) the detection of spatial and temporal shifts in the coastline during the past millennia and the human response to these changes; (ii) the human impact on the landscape, especially in the environs of the Roman Harbour and the harbour canal; (iii) the reconstruction of the vegetation history of the Ephesia. More than 200 drill cores were retrieved from geo-bioarchives. For a better understanding of the depositional environments, we carried out geochemical, sedimentological, microfaunal, palynological and parasitological analyses in Ephesus’ harbours and in the environs of two Neolithic settlement sites. Diagnostic ceramic finds, AMS-14C age estimates and a tephra layer were used for the chronological framework.\nThe results reveal human impact in sediments: early agricultural use in the Neolithic period; several meters of sediment with a high concentration of fig and grape seeds in the Koressos harbour during the 6th-3rd centuries BC; an accelerated sedimentation rate up to the factor of ten in Hellenistic and Roman times. Heavy metal pollution, sugar melon and fruit tree pollen, as well as eggs of intestinal parasites occur in the Roman harbour and its canal during the prosperity period of the city. Pollen analysis revealed the dominance of deciduous oak, in a landscape with human impact, already since the 6th millennium BC. From Hellenistic times onwards, fruit trees appear next to crop and pasture farming. After the decline of the city in the 7th century AD, pine trees became dominant, presumably on abandoned land. In the Belevi swamp to the northeast of Ephesus, the ash from the Minoan eruption of the Thera volcano (Santorini) in 1630 BC is archived.",

Over the course of a month, this highly sheared zone was intensely sampled with an array of Eulerian and Lagrangian instruments, in part, as a means of creating a synoptic, three-dimensional data set for validating various satellite remote sensing platforms. A component of this project was to deploy the Surface Physics Experimental Catamaran (SPEC), which is a mobile vessel designed specifically for collecting detailed meteorological and oceanographic data in coastal waters. Among its suite of instruments, SPEC was outfitted with a pair of acoustic doppler velocimeters (ADV), an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP), and an optical backscatter sensor (OBS). This instrument package allowed for high resolution mapping of the acoustic signature of the ebb tidal plume and the sub-surface, two-dimensional flow field. On May 8th, at 18:40 UTC, a panchromatic satellite image with a 0.6 m resolution, covering 122 km2, was taken of the New River Inlet Estuary and the inner shelf waters just off-shore. Numerous interesting features are visible in the image, such as the river outflow plume, surface streaks and slicks, a complex wave-field, and a remnant frontal edge from the past ebb tide. Interpretation of the surface features in these types of optical images remains a significant challenge and we have used data collected by SPEC immediately after the image acquisition to help illuminate the processes underlying these signatures.",

Recruitment for both species was episodic, with a dominant pulse in the interval 1970-2000. This period is associated with wet autumns and warm growing-season minimum temperatures. Spectral analyses of limber pine recruitment birth year densities resolved strong primary peaks at 5 years. These peaks occurred at all elevations, but were strongest for high-elevation transects and weakest for low elevations. Radial growth from four limber pine chronologies (analyzed for the years 1883 to 2013) showed greatest growth during the same period as the recruitment pulse, with significant declines in growth since 1990 at all sites.",

            "abstract": "Accurate knowledge of Mercury’s magnetospheric magnetic field is required to understand the sources of the planet’s internal field. We present the first model of Mercury’s magnetospheric magnetic field that is confined within a magnetopause shape derived from Magnetometer observations by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft. The model consists of individual modules for magnetic fields of internal origin, approximated by a dipole of magnitude 190 nT RM3, where RM is Mercury’s radius, offset northward by 479 km along the spin axis, and of external origin resulting from currents flowing on the magnetopause boundary and in the cross-tail current sheet. The cross-tail current is prescribed having a disk shape near the planet and extending into a Harris sheet at larger distances. The magnitude of the tail current is fit to minimize the root mean square residual between the magnetic field within the magnetosphere observed by MESSENGER and the model field. The magnetic field contribution from each module is shielded individually by a scalar potential function consisting of Cartesian harmonic expansions with linear and non-linear coefficients, which are fit to minimize the root-mean-square normal magnetic field component at the magnetopause. The resulting model resembles the observed magnetic field better than the previously developed paraboloid model in regions that are close to the magnetopause, i.e., at northern high latitudes and on the dayside. It will allow more accurate characterization of crustal magnetization, which may be observed during low-altitude orbits in the final months of the MESSENGER mission.",

            "abstract": "Joint inversions of sub-areal surface deformation and tsunami waves generated by seafloor ground motions, while still in their infancy, have the opportunity for realistic representations of megathrust earthquake slip responsible, which occurs primarily offshore. Such joint inversions, including Gusman, et al. [JGR, 2010] and Wei et al. [PAGEOPH, 2014], highlight fault slip unobservable with on land measurements alone. Careful detection of possible slip patterns can affect how nearby communities prepare for future events, therefore their discovery is important for hazard mitigation. Joint inversions could also prove invaluable during a large even through a rapid inversion of real time data. This study looks at the availability and accessibility of land-based GPS and deep-ocean pressure sensor data for rapid join inversions, and the latency between such solutions and both local and global tsunami wave arrivals. We consider GPS rather than other ground-based deformation techniques because of its ability to provide rapid and continuous translations of the ground surface. For tsunami observations, we focus on deep-ocean pressure sensors such as those used in DART systems, because of similarly rapid and continues data availability. Similarly tsunami waves traveling through the deep-ocean have negligible non-linear components, making them ideal for inversion methods. We create a source event in a zone with an elevated seismic risk and then track tsunami travel times to the coast and the nearest deep-ocean pressure sensors to determine a temporal limit to warnings that can be issued to nearby regions. By assessing this latency, focus can be given to areas where an inversion of this type has the potential to improve warning information. This study also identifies regions that lack necessary on and offshore instrumentation to warn coastal communities at risk for tsunamigenic earthquakes. By assessing the feasibility of joint inversions, it becomes easier to move forward with future studies focusing on regions that would see the largest benefit in real-time hazard mitigation.",

            "abstract": "Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) delivers significant amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to coastal zones where it is subject to photooxidation. To date little is known about the photoreactivity of DOM in groundwater (GW) and sediment porewater (PW), which are the source water of SGD. We studied the photobleaching, photomineralization, and photoammonification of DOM in GW and beach sediment PW collected from the Magdalen Islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the spring of 2012. The PW, with a specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) of 12.73 L mg-1 m-1, was much more colored than the GW (SUVA254: 4.84 L m-1 mg-1). Furthermore, the fluorescence index (FI370) and humification index (HIX) suggest that DOM in the PW was dominantly of terrestrial and soil origin whereas DOM in the GW primarily originated from aquatic and microbial sources. A 20-d solar-simulated irradiation of the PW resulted in a nearly complete loss of DOM absorbance but only a 47% loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). For the GW, the absorbance dropped by 66% while DOC decreased only by 24% after a 4-d irradiation. The photoammonification rate reached 106 µmol N m-3 d-1 in the GW and 42 µmol N m-3 d-1 in the PW. The absorbed photon-based efficiencies of photobleaching, and photomineralization for the PW were, respectively, 17% and 21% higher than those for the GW ; whereas the efficiency of photoammonification for the PW was 32% lower than that for GW. Irradiation increased the absorption spectral slope (275-295 nm) from 0.014 to 0.025 nm-1 for the GW and from 0.010 to 0.029 nm-1 for the PW. Conversely, irradiation decreased the FI370 and HIX for both the PW (FI370: 1.25→1.09; HIX: 25.90→7.27) and GW (FI370: 1.61→1.29; HIX: 6.97→1.45). This study demonstrates that photooxidation can substantially alter the chemical structure of SDG-derived DOM and potentially impact DOC and nutrient cycling in coastal waters.",

            "abstract": "There has been a tremendous amount of research conducted that examines disparities in health and wealth of persons between urban and rural areas however, relatively little research has been undertaken to examine variations within urban areas. A major limitation to elucidating differences with urban areas is the lack of social and demographic data at a sufficiently high spatial resolution to determine these differences. Generally the only available data that contain this information are census data which are collected at most every ten years and are often difficult to obtain at a high enough spatial resolution to allow for examining in depth variability in health and wealth indicators at high spatial resolutions, especially in developing countries. High spatial resolution satellite imagery may be able to provide timely and synoptic information that is related to health and wealth variability within a city. In this study we use two dates of Quickbird imagery (2003 and 2010) classified into the vegetation-impervious surface-soil (VIS) model introduced by Ridd (1995). For 2003 we only have partial coverage of the city, while for 2010 we have a mosaic, which covers the entire city of Accra, Ghana. Variations in the VIS values represent the physical variations within the city and these are compared to variations in economic, and/or sociodemographic data derived from the 2000 Ghanaian census at two spatial resolutions, the enumeration area (approximately US Census Tract) and the neighborhood for the city. Results indicate a significant correlation between both vegetation and impervious surface to type of cooking fuel used in the household, population density, housing density, availability of sewers, cooking space usage, and other variables. The correlations are generally stronger at the neighborhood level and the relationships are stable through time and space. Overall, the results indicate that information derived from high resolution satellite data is related to indicators of health and wealth within a developing world city and that the even if the imagery is collected 10 years after the census information, the relationships are still significant.",

With its increasing economic benefits to many sectors including business, industry, and academia and its potential to make science more accessible not only to science students but also to the general citizenry, we suggested answers to the questions: Why has greater success not been realized? What are the particular barriers to wider implementation? And what are incentives and ways to move green chemistry forward? We suggest some strategies and options to both increase the use of green chemistry principles and to also increase stakeholders’ understanding of the importance and utility of green chemistry in their daily lives. For example, our main suggestions are that an inclusive, multidisciplinary network would aid in coordinating data and in translating the science into user friendly tools, and that an educational component embedded in this greater effort would also serve to move green chemistry forward.",

            "abstract": "We added a layer of automation to the Debayle and Ricard (2012)’s waveform modeling scheme for fundamental and higher mode surface waves in the period range 50-160s.\nWe processed all the Rayleigh waveforms recorded on the LHZ channel by the virtual networks GSN_broadband, FDSN_all, and US_backbone between January 1996 and December 2013. Six millions of waveforms were obtained from IRIS DMC. We check that all the necessary information (instrument response, global CMT determination) is available and that each record includes a velocity window which encompasses the surface wave. Selected data must also have a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 3 in a range covering at least the periods between 50 and 100 s. About 3 millions of waveforms are selected (92% of the rejections are due to the signal to noise ratio criterion) and processed using Debayle and Ricard (2012)’s scheme, which allows the successful modeling of about 1.5 millions of waveforms. We complete this database with 60,000 waveforms recorded between 1976 and 1996 or after 1996 during various temporary experiments and with 161,730 Rayleigh waveforms analyzed at longer period, between 120 and 360 s. The whole data set is inverted using Debayle and Sambridge (2004)’s scheme to produce a 3D shear velocity model.\nA simple shell command \"update_tomo\" can then update our seismic model in an entirely automated way. Currently, this command checks from the CMT catalog what are the potential data available at the GSN_broadband, FDSN_all, and US_backbone virtual networks, uses web services to request these data from IRIS DMC and applies the processing chain described above to update our seismic model. We plan to update our seismic model on a regular basis in a near future, and to make it available on the web.\nOur most recent seismic model includes azimuthal anisotropy, achieves a lateral resolution of few hundred kilometers and a vertical resolution of a few tens of kilometers. The correlation with surface tectonics is very strong in the uppermost 200 km. Regions deeper than 400 km show no velocity contrasts larger than 1%, except for high velocity slabs which produce broad high velocity regions within the transition zone. The use of higher modes and long period surface waves allows us to extract the shear velocity structure down to about 1000 km depth.",

            "abstract": "The Re-Os isotope system has become increasingly used as a tracer of lithological heterogeneity in the convecting mantle, with radiogenic 187Os/188Os in high-Os oceanic basalts and picrites widely interpreted as evidence of a melt contribution from ancient recycled oceanic crust. When combined with 206Pb/204Pb and O isotopes, 187Os/188Os ratios have been used to identify distinct lithological units (i.e. sediments, gabbros and basalts). We report new 187Os/188Os for basalts with high Os (>40 ppt) and MgO from Galápagos, which range from near primitive mantle values (0.130) to highly radiogenic (0.155). While co-variations in 187Os/188Os and 206Pb/204Pb for some Galápagos basalts (Floreana-type) are HIMU like, and consistent with melting of ancient recycled oceanic crust, others have variable 187Os/188Os ratios and primitive to depleted mantle like 206Pb/204Pb. Similar variations in Os and Pb isotopic space have been interpreted in other OIB suites as melts from recycled ancient oceanic gabbros, entrained by upwelling mantle plumes. Nevertheless, a marked east-west spatial variation in 187Os/188Os of Galápagos basalts does not correlate with postulated lithological variations in the Galápagos plume (Vidito et al., 2013). We show that basalts in eastern Galápagos with elevated 187Os/188Os and positive Sr anomalies occur in the vicinity of over-thickened 10 Ma gabbroic crust, that formed when the Galápagos plume was on-axis. We propose the elevated 187Os/188Os of Galápagos basalts are due to in-situ assimilation of young gabbroic lower crust, with high Re/Os, rather than melting of ancient recycled material in the Galápagos plume. In western Galápagos recent plume accreted crust is thick but more mafic, the melt flux higher and assimilation more sporadic.\nThe contamination thresholds of Os and MgO in Galápagos basalts occur at higher contents than for many global OIBs (Azores, Iceland, Hawaii) and may reflect both a relatively low melt flux into the crust from the weak Galápagos plume (Tp=1400 oC) and excess thickness of ridge-formed gabbro in the east of the archipelago. Similar in-situ assimilation of lower oceanic crust by high-Os and MgO-rich OIBs suites may have been overlooked in the quest for establishing melting of ancient recycled oceanic gabbro in hotspots and heterogeneity in the convecting mantle.",

We modified an established method of porphyrin (T-4(CP)P) addition, by incorporating a heating step and coupling a 100-cm cell to a UV/Vis detector, to achieve a 4.0 nM sample DL. Surface waters were collected from June to August, 2014 and total dissolved Mn (0.23 – 1.92 μM) first increased then decreased along the salinity gradient (31 ppt to freshwater). However, Mn speciation was highly variable; Mn(III) made up 0-49 % of the total dissolved Mn, where the highest Mn(III) values occurred at sites with high salt-marsh runoff. Mn(III) was not recoverable without the addition of a strong reducing agent, indicating that little or no weak ligand was present, and that a strong ligand was responsible for complexing Mn(III). An assessment of potential strong ligand character was made by precipitating humic matter, by acidifying subsamples to pH<1.5, then 100 μM Mn(III)-pyrophosphate was added to acidified supernatant samples and non-acidified samples. In non-acidified samples, the Mn(III)-pyrophosphate peak at 484 nm rapidly disappeared and was replaced by a broad peak at 400 nm and the resulting sample had a yellow color. Upon the addition of 500 μM desferrioxamine-B (DFOB) to the same sample, a peak at 310 nm appeared, indicating the formation of Mn(III)-DFOB. In acidified samples, the Mn(III)-pyrophosphate peak did not change. Humic matter, therefore, may be acting as an Mn(III) binding ligand, outcompeting pyrophosphate for Mn(III), however this natural ligand is outcompeted by a large excess of DFOB. The humic matter and increased Mn likely come from the salt marsh runoff during tidal exchange, and we observed that as salinity increased, the amount of humic binding decreased. These results present the first Mn speciation measurements along a salinity gradient in oxygenated waters.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, the Cassini RSS (Radio Science Subsystem) instrument has provided fundamental new insights into many aspects of the Saturn system. Taking advantage of the capability to use up to three simultaneous wavelengths (Ka, X, and S bands), a series of occultation experiments of Titan and Saturn have provided detailed vertical profiles of the atmospheric and ionospheric structure, exhibiting seasonal and regional variability. Gravity experiments, conducted during close flybys of Saturn's moons, have yielded information about their internal structure, including evidence of sub-surface oceans on Titan and Enceladus. From dozens of ring occultation experiements, the radial structure, scattering properties, and particle sizes of the rings have been measured to high precision, enabling detailed comparative studies of ring dynamics and orbital characteristics. Recent bistatic observations of Titan, in which the transmitted signal reflects off of the specular point and is received on Earth, have traversed the northern polar regions, crossing the boundaries between seas and land, showing that the surface of the seas is remarkably smooth, and providing information about the dielectric properties of the liquids and surface materials. The best is yet to come, during the final three years of the Cassini mission, when the RSS instrument will observe the rings in a series of occultation measurements at their most favorable geometry of the entire Cassini mission, and a companion set of close fly-bys of Saturn will provide the first detailed determination of Saturn's gravitational field.",

A high plasticity sodium bentonite was used as the expansive soil. The additive materials including fly ash (FA) and lime (L) were evaluated as potential stabilizers to decrease the swelling pressure of bentonite. Depending on the type of additive materials, they were blended with bentonite in different percentages to assess the optimum state and approch the maximum swell pressure reduction. According to the results of swell pressure test, both fly ash and lime reduce the swelling potential of bentonite but the maximum improvement occurs using bentonite-lime mixture while the swelling pressure reduction approaches to 49%. The results reveal a significant reduction of swelling potential of expansive soil using chemical stabilizers.\nKeywords: Expansive soil; swell pressure; chemical stabilization; fly ash; lime",

            "abstract": "Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, has been the topic of much interest and mystery. This satellite is the second largest moon in the solar system and is even larger than the planet Mercury. It has a dense, nitrogen-rich atmosphere and no intrinsic magnetic field. Thus, it was believed that as Titan orbits in Saturn’s outer magnetosphere it serves as the primary source of heavy magnetospheric particles assumed to be dominated by nitrogen. However, HST observations and the last 10 years of Cassini data have revealed that cryogenic plumes from the tiny moon, Enceladus, actually provide the majority of heavy magnetospheric particles which are water-group in composition. Therefore, Titan was demoted to having a relatively minor impact on Saturn’s magnetosphere. However, as more observations become available, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to explain all of the magnetospheric nitrogen observations as originating from Enceladus. For this talk, we review previous observations and findings and then present recent results based on Cassini CAPS and MIMI charged particle observations. We combine these data with modeling to examine the relative impact of Titan in generating magnetospheric particle populations as well as examining outer magnetospheric plasma conditions along Titan’s orbit and during encounters. These further results appear to suggest that Titan may actually be a much more significant component of Saturn’s magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "The complex three-dimensional (3D) structure of tropical forests generates a diversity of light environments for canopy and understory trees. Light availability in tropical forests is dynamic on diurnal and seasonal timescales based on variability in solar illumination and the fraction of diffuse radiation. The distribution of light availability ultimately controls light utilization—the amount of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) available for photosynthesis. Understanding the dynamics of light utilization is critical for interpreting measurements of net ecosystem exchange and improving ecosystem models. Here, we used the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model to simulate 3D light profiles for a range of Amazon forest scenes. DART was initialized using small footprint airborne lidar data, and characteristics of each 3D simulation were constrained using local measurements of leaf properties, incident PAR, and atmospheric conditions. For each simulation, we separated the fraction of absorbed PAR (FAPAR) into light interactions with leaves, branches, and the ground surface. Leaf-absorbed PAR in each 1 m3 voxel was further constrained to account for light saturation effects. Under midday illumination conditions, most canopy leaves were saturated, leading to a reduction in light utilization (0.65 - 0.7) even as leaf-absorbed PAR remained nearly constant (0.82-0.84). Light utilization also varied seasonally, with lowest fractional utilization in the dry season. Clear sky conditions and low solar zenith angles accentuated shadowing and saturation effects during dry season months, decreasing light utilization by 20-25% compared to total leaf-absorbed PAR. These findings suggest that a potential response of Amazon forests to increasing PAR in the dry season, as measured at the top of canopy, is moderated by seasonal variability in light utilization from changes in shadowing and saturation effects at the leaf level. Our results point to the need for additional spatial information on forest structure to improve the representation of light availability in models of tropical forest productivity.",

Satellite remote sensing is emerging as a key solution to this need. GOCI is the first satellite remote sensor that is able to provide multi-spectral aerosol optical properties in Northeast Asia on an hourly basis. We implemented a set of filters to minimize cloud contamination in GOCI aerosol optical depths (AOD). Evaluation of filtered GOCI AOD by AERONET AOD data at three sites in China indicates significant agreement (hourly RMSE=0.03-0.16). A global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) is used to relate total column AOD to near-surface PM2.5. The simulated PM2.5/AOD ratio generally captures the seasonal variation in ground measurements. We assess the relationship of a full year of GOCI-derived PM2.5 concentrations versus ground measurements at more than 800 locations across China, and found significant agreement (r=0.86, slope=0.8), indicating GOCI is a promising tool to provide in-depth and accurate data for air quality studies in Northeast Asia.",

            "abstract": "The 2011-2012 activity at Cordon Caulle has provided an unprecedented opportunity to observe a sustained explosive rhyolitic eruption. An initial 27 hour Plinian phase commenced on 4 June 2011, followed by ten months of hybrid explosive-effusive activity, which generated disruptive ≤6 km ash plumes. In January 2012 our close observations of the active vent[1] revealed how episodic release of gas and ash from several sub-vents on an incipient lava dome (Fig. 1b) merged to form a sustained ash plume. Sub-vents ranged from metric point sources to arcuate fractures (>10 m) in the dome carapace.\nWe visited the vent in January 2014, and found two ~50 m-wide, rubble-strewn vent areas adjacent to pancake-like obsidian domes, all within a breached, ~100 m-high tuff cone. Vent areas consist of fractured obsidian lava strewn by loose, rotated lava blocks ≤5 m across. Prominent red fracture surfaces (Fig. 1 d,e) occur in both the in-situ lava and the blocky veneer; these closely correspond to the type of sub-vents observed in 2012[1]. They range from smooth, curviplanar surfaces extending over several m to complex smaller-scale surfaces that follow pre-existing cooling joints in the lava carapace. In-situ fracture surfaces display prominent, predominantly vertical grooves and impact marks, but negligible displacement.\nSurfaces are coated by µm-mm thick veneers of fine-grained ash, to which larger ash-coated clasts have adhered. Veneer thickness and sintering degree strongly decrease towards the upper carapace of the lava. SEM analysis of ash veneers reveals 1) a high proportion of sub-micron clasts, 2) strong clast sintering, 3) abundant ash aggregation textures spanning submicron-mm scales, and 4) local surface scouring and corrosion of glass and phenocrysts.\nDuring ash venting the smallest particles are preferentially trapped on fracture surfaces and rapidly sintered, encouraging sub-vent blockage. Extensive ash aggregation may have been electrostatically aided, with strong charging induced by high venting velocities through narrow fracture networks. Fluctuating gas/ash ratios and velocities, as observed[1], led to periods of both deposition and erosion. Rafting of earlier ash nozzles down the advancing obsidian flow has created a record of evolving vent dynamics.\n1. Schipper C.I. et al., 2013, JVGR 262, 25–37.",

            "abstract": "For the analysis of radiation risks to astronauts and planning exploratory space missions, detailed knowledge of particle spectra is an important factor. Detailed measurements of the energetic particle radiation environment on the surface of Mars have been made by the Mars Science Laboratory Radiation Assessment Detector (MSL-RAD) on the Curiosity rover since August 2012, and particle fluxes for a wide range of ion species (up to several hundred MeV/u) and high energy neutrons (8 - 1000 MeV) have been available for the first 200 sols. Although the data obtained on the surface of Mars for 200 sols are limited in the narrow energy spectra, the simulation results using the Badhwar-O’Neill galactic cosmic ray (GCR) environment model and the high-charge and energy transport (HZETRN) code are compared to the data. For the nuclear interactions of primary GCR through Mars atmosphere and Curiosity rover, the quantum multiple scattering theory of nuclear fragmentation (QMSFRG) is used, which includes direct knockout, evaporation and nuclear coalescence. Daily atmospheric pressure measurements at Gale Crater by the MSL Rover Environmental Monitoring Station are implemented into transport calculations for describing the daily column depth of atmosphere. Particles impinging on top of the Martian atmosphere reach the RAD after traversing varying depths of atmosphere that depend on the slant angles, and the model accounts for shielding of the RAD by the rest of the instrument. Calculations of stopping particle spectra are in good agreement with the RAD measurements for the first 200 sols by accounting changing heliospheric conditions and atmospheric pressure. Detailed comparisons between model predictions and spectral data of various particle types provide the validation of radiation transport models, and thus increase the accuracy of the predictions of future radiation environments on Mars. These contributions lend support to the understanding of radiation health risks to astronauts for the planning of various mission scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Satellite data from microwave humidity sounders onboard NOAA and MetOp satellites play an important rule in weather forecasting as well as climate monitoring and assessment. These data are widely used to derive various hydrological products, including precipitation, precipitable water vapor, snow cover, tropospheric humidity, cloud liquid water, deep convective clouds, and land surface emissivity. MW data are subject to several radiometric and geometric errors and need to be properly bias corrected and inter-calibrated before being used for any climate assessment.\nInter-calibration theoretically requires that two satellites should observe the same target at the same time with the same geometry. One specific case is when two satellites observe the same target at the same time at the nadir position and is called Simultaneous Nadir Observation (SNO). However, in terms of polar orbiting satellites, SNO's only occur in polar regions but the inter-satellite differences are scene dependent. The requirement that two satellites should observe the target at the same time can be neglected if the diurnal variation of brightness temperatures is negligible. There are several places where the diurnal variation can be neglected including tropical region as well as polar regions during polar nights. Therefore, we use observations averaged over tropical region as the warm end and averages over polar regions for the cold end of the brightness temperatures for inter-calibrating data from similar instruments. Then, the calibration coefficients are calculated using regression analysis for monthly data and interpolated to derive the daily values. We present the results of inter-calibrating AMSU-B and MHS observations for the period 2000 – 2010. The time series of the observations show significant improvement and consistency between multiple satellites after inter-calibration and bias correction.",

However, some of the IceBridge ATM and Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS) sea-ice flights have no coincident imagery data. In particular, the IceBridge “South Basin Transect” flights just north of the Canadian Archipelago have historically been flown under darkness (nighttime) and coincident imagery data are not available. Here we apply an algorithm using ATM waveform parameters to identify leads to derive sea-ice freeboard. ATM waveforms were fitted with Gaussian curves to calculate pulse width, peak location, pulse amplitude, and signal baseline. For each waveform, centroid, skewness, kurtosis, and pulse area were also calculated. Received waveform parameters, such as pulse width, pulse amplitude, pulse area, skewness, kurtosis, and transmitted/received pulse area ratio show a coherent response to variations of geophysical features along an ATM profile. These parameters, combined with elevation, were used to identify leads to enable sea-ice freeboard calculation. A similar algorithm is applied to the LVIS data to calculate sea-ice freeboard. Arctic sea-ice freeboards for ATM and LVIS data with no coincident visual imagery are derived in this study, extending the IceBridge sea-ice record over a large portion of thick multi-year sea ice. The results are evaluated/validated by using ATM data with coincident DMS imagery and near coincident ATM and LVIS data comparison.",

            "abstract": "Basal slip is an important component of ice sheet mass flux and dynamics. Basal slip varies over time due to variations in basal temperature, water pressure, and sediment cover. All of these factors can create coherent patterns of basal slip that migrate over time. Our knowledge of the spatial variability in basal slip comes from inversions of driving stress, ice thickness, and surface velocity, but these inversions contain no information about temporal variability. We do not know if the patterns in slip revealed by those inversions move over time. While englacial stratigraphy has classically been used to constrain surface accumulation and geothermal flux, it is also sensitive to horizontal gradients in basal slip. Here we show that englacial stratigraphy can constrain the velocity of basal slip patterns.\nEnglacial stratigraphy responds strongly to patterns of basal slip that move downstream over time close to the ice sheet velocity. In previous work, we used a thermomechanical model to discover that thermally controlled slip patterns migrate downstream and create stratigraphic structures, but we were unable to directly control the pattern velocity, as that arose naturally out of the model physics. Here, we use a kinematic flowline model that allows us to directly control pattern velocity, and thus is applicable to a wide variety of slip mechanisms in addition to basal temperature. We find that the largest and most intricate stratigraphic structures develop when the pattern moves at the column-average ice velocity. Patterns that move slower than the column-average ice velocity produce overturned stratigraphy in the lower part of the ice sheet, while patterns moving at the column-average eventually cause the entire ice sheet to overturn if they persist long enough. Based on these forward models, we develop an interpretive guide for deducing moving patterns in basal slip from ice sheet internal layers. Ice sheet internal stratigraphy represents a potentially vast untapped source of information on basal sliding.",

            "abstract": "The Precipitation Research Facility (PRF) at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center - Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) employs numerous remote sensing and in-situ instruments for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) ground validation program. Among these assets are the NPOL S-band radar, D3R Ku/Ka-band radar, 2-D video disdrometers, Parsivel2 disdrometers, tipping bucket, and weighing bucket rain gauges. The WFF PRF has deployed these instruments in the Mid-Atlantic Delmarva region, and is actively collecting data for GPM ground validation. The NPOL radar is an observational tool to bridge the spatial difference between ground and satellite observations. Connecting the points near the ground between NPOL and other instruments leads to the extension of the full column through the atmosphere for direct comparisons with GPM observations. This in turn provides critical feedback to physical algorithm developers. Therefore, the verification and refinement of observations from radar, rain gauges, and disdrometers are critical to the GPM ground validation program by providing confidence in the underlying data used to validate satellite measurements. This research entails comparisons of data and derived products between validation instruments to verify and quantify differences in reflectivity, computed rain rates, and derived drop-size-distribution (DSD) parameters. Results comparing reflectivity from NPOL and 2-D video disdrometers indicate agreement within 1 dB from several significant rain events with light wind. Mixed-phase and windy events show greater variability. Rain rates and DSD parameters will show significant variability depending on computational methods chosen for each instrument. Comparisons between two radar-based dual-polarimetric approaches for estimating rain rates will be discussed, in addition to the retrieval of DSD parameters. Careful consideration of specific events will be needed for the best possible datasets for GPM statistical and physical validation.",

            "abstract": "Convectively coupled equatorial waves (CCEWs) are a result of the interplay between the physics and dynamics in the tropical atmosphere. As a result of such interplay, tropical convection appears often organized into synoptic to planetary-scale disturbances with time scales matching those of equatorial shallow water waves. CCEWs have broad impacts within the tropics, and their simulation in general circulation models is still problematic. Several studies showed that dispersion of those waves characteristics fit the dispersion curves derived from the Matsuno’s (1966) solutions of the shallow water equations on the equatorial beta plane, namely, Kelvin, equatorial Rossby, mixed Rossby-gravity, and inertio-gravity waves. However, the more common methodology used to identify those waves is yet controversial.\nIn this communication a new methodology for the diagnosis of CCEWs will be presented. It is based on a pre-filtering of the geopotential and horizontal wind, using 3--D normal modes functions of the adiabatic linearized equations of a resting atmosphere, followed by a space--time spectral analysis to identify the spectral regions of coherence. The methodology permits a direct detection of various types of equatorial waves, compares the dispersion characteristics of the coupled waves with the theoretical dispersion curves and allows an identification of which vertical modes are more involved in the convection. Moreover, the proposed methodology is able to show the existence of free dry waves and moist coupled waves with a common vertical structure, which is in conformity with the effect of convective heating/cooling on the effective static stability, as traduced in the gross moist stability concept. The methodology is also sensible to Doppler shifting effects.\nThe methodology has been applied to the ERA-Interim horizontal wind and geopotential height fields and to the interpolated Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) data produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The same type of data (i.e. u, v, Φ and OLR) from CMIP5 historical experiments (1976-2005) were analyzed. The obtained results provide examples of the aforementioned effects and points deficiencies in the models.",

Extensive OSSEs have been conducted at NASA/ GSFC and NOAA/AOML over the last three decades. These OSSEs determined correctly the quantitative potential for several proposed satellite observing systems to improve weather analysis and prediction prior to their launch, evaluated trade-offs in orbits, coverage and accuracy for space-based wind lidars, and were used in the development of the methodology that led to the first beneficial impacts of satellite surface winds on numerical weather prediction. At the present time, we are expanding the application of OSSE methodology to severe storm, air quality, and ocean studies. In this paper, we summarize early applications of global OSSEs, and new experiments using both global and regional models (with a special emphasis on atmosphere and ocean analysis, numerical weather prediction and hurricane forecasting). These experiments are aimed at determining (1) the relative impact of alternative concepts for space-based lidar winds, (2) the potential impact of new GNSS RO satellites, (3) the potential impact of a geostationary microwave sounder, and (4) the relative impact of alternative concepts for polar and geostationary hyperspectral sounders.",

            "abstract": "With a current moratorium on High Volume Hydraulic Fracturing (HVHF) in New York State, we have a critical opportunity to make baseline predictions of how HVHF development will impact water supplies. Our research focuses on Broome and Tioga counties in New York State’s southern tier. Both counties share a border with Pennsylvania, where heavy HVHF development is currently taking place. It is anticipated that both counties will also experience heavy HVHF development if the moratorium ceases.\nThrough the use of GIS linked with a transient finite difference groundwater model, we created various HVHF well development scenarios. These scenarios represent historical HVHF development rates from nearby Pennsylvania counties of Bradford, Susquehanna, and Tioga from 2008-2012 as well as an average Pennsylvania rate. The transient finite difference groundwater model simulates how water extraction for HVHF purposes may impact the two study counties water resources over a five-year initial development period.\nResults of this research are presented as a first step in water resource management in Broome and Tioga County and define where state and local policies may need further investigation or modification of proposed regulations. In addition results point to future work that needs to be in place should the moratorium lift in order to take advantage of the small window of opportunity to study HVHF water usage through an entire well development lifespan.",

            "abstract": "We report a new occurrence of melt inclusions in polymetamorphic granulitic gneisses of the Jubrique unit, a complete though thinned crustal section located above the Ronda peridotite slab (Betic Cordillera, S Spain). The gneissic sequence is composed of mylonitic gneisses at the bottom and porphyroblastic gneisses on top. Mylonitic gneisses are strongly deformed rocks with abundant garnet and rare biotite. Except for the presence of melt inclusions, microstructures indicating the former presence of melt are rare or absent. Upwards in the sequence garnet decreases whereas biotite increases in proportion. Melt inclusions are present from cores to rims of garnets throughout the entire sequence. Most of the former melt inclusions are now totally crystallized and correspond to nanogranites, whereas some of them are partially made of glass or, more rarely, are totally glassy. They show negative crystal shapes and range in size from ≈5 to 200 micrometers, with a mean size of ≈30-40 micrometers. Daughter phases in nanogranites and partially crystallized melt inclusions include quartz, feldspars, biotite and muscovite; accidental minerals include kyanite, graphite, zircon, monazite, rutile and ilmenite; glass has a granitic composition. Melt inclusions are mostly similar throughout all the gneissic sequence. Some fluid inclusions, of possible primary origin, are spatially associated with melt inclusions, indicating that at some point during the suprasolidus history of these rocks granitic melt and fluid coexisted. Thermodynamic modeling and conventional thermobarometry of mylonitic gneisses provide peak conditions of ≈850 ºC and 12-14 kbar, corresponding to cores of large garnets with inclusions of kyanite and rutile. Post-peak conditions of ≈800-850 ºC and 5-6 kbar are represented by rim regions of large garnets with inclusions of sillimanite and ilmenite, cordierite-quartz-biotite coronas replacing garnet rims, and the matrix with oriented sillimanite. Previous conventional petrologic studies on these strongly deformed rocks have proposed that anatexis started during decompression from peak to post-peak conditions and in the field of sillimanite. The study of melt inclusions shows, however, that melt was already present in the system at peak conditions, and that most garnet grew in the presence of melt.",

            "abstract": "Increased methane emissions from arctic environments due to amplified polar warming have long been postulated as a potent positive feedback mechanism for climate change. However, measuring methane in the Arctic for the purpose of monitoring the feedback presents a daunting observational challenge since techniques must ideally be able distinguish between biological and anthropogenic methane sources, have the ability to cover large spatial ranges, and have the sensitivity to distinguish changes from season to season, and year to year. The FOCAL platform has been engineered to address this niche and help bridge the gap in spatial coverage between ground based and inverse modelling studies. It consists of a small aircraft equipped with the best atmospheric turbulence (BAT) probe, and gas sensors for in situ measurements of CH4, CO2, δ13CH4, δ13CO2 to make regional scale surface eddy-covariance flux measurements of methane and carbon dioxide as well as their stable isotopologues to gain mechanisitic insight and assist in source determination. The initial FOCAL flight series in August 2013 based out of Deadhorse, AK was a low altitude (<50m) survey mission to observe spatial and temporal variability of CH4 and CO2 over the Northern Slope. We will present the CH4 concentration and δ13CH4 data, and discuss some of the possible drivers behind their observed spatial heterogeneity.",

The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) dataset is quite widely documented and used. Substantial improvements to the GEOS-5 system since the MERRA version was frozen (about five years ago) motivate the production of a successor dataset, MERRA-2: a major consideration, though, is the fact that MERRA cannot ingest the most recent data types, such as IASI, GPS-RO, whose value is demonstrated by the more recent versions of GEOS-5 run in near-real time. Aspects to address are how the following changes impact the middle atmosphere: updates to the GCM, especially a new representation of gravity wave drag; use of a different radiation transfer model for the Stratospheric Sounding Unit radiances; introduction of GPS-RO datasets into MERRA-2; the choice of using the EOS-Aura Microwave Limb Sounder temperature and ozone fields after 2004. The impacts of these datasets will be shown using suitable examples.",

            "abstract": "The past 100 years of research on fluvial dunes and their deposits has produced bedform scaling laws based on flow depth, grain size and flow velocity. Such flow-form-deposit scaling is used ubiquitously for a wide range of paleo-environmental interpretations and in predictions of river bed roughness in floods. Recent research from marine environments, density currents, and fluvial flows with strong secondary circulation shows that these laws are often extrapolated beyond the limits of the original research. In submarine density currents, for example, paleo-hydraulic reconstructions commonly predict dune forming flow conditions, but preserved dune cross strata are rarely found. One particular difference between these geophysical flows is the velocity profile shape and bed shear stress that results.\nIn a series of novel laboratory experiments the shape of the mean downstream velocity profile was systematically altered so the velocity maximum was lowered toward the bed through the addition of roughness elements at the water surface; whilst maintaining flow depth and depth-averaged velocities. This produced velocity profile shapes closer to those in density currents, and open-channel flows with strong secondary circulation. The initial lowering of the velocity maximum position increased dune height and length by 250%. The lowest velocity maximum position produced a stable upper-stage plane bed, whilst predictions based on flow depth and mean velocity remained within the dune regime phase-space. The results therefore demonstrate that the vertical position of the downstream velocity maximum can be a better predictor of equilibrium bedform geometries than flow depth or depth averaged velocity and also highlight that paleo-hydraulic reconstructions need to account for the possible variation in profile shape between geophysical flows.\nThis research improves fundamental understanding of fluvial bedform stability and flow-form-deposit scaling laws for extrapolation into in a broader variety of depositional environments beyond open-channel flows.",

            "abstract": "The rise in atmospheric CO2 during Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1; 14.5-17.5 kyr BP) may have been driven by release of carbon from the abyssal ocean. Model simulations suggest that wind-driven upwelling in the Southern Ocean liberates 13C-depleted carbon from the abyss, causing atmospheric CO2 to increase and the δ13C of CO2 to decrease. One prediction of the Southern Ocean hypothesis is that watermass tracers in the deep South Atlantic should register a circulation response early in the deglaciation. Here we test this idea using a depth transect of twelve cores from the Brazil Margin. We show that records below 2300 m remained 13C-depleted until 15 kyr BP or later, indicating the abyssal South Atlantic was an unlikely source of light carbon to the atmosphere during HS1. Benthic δ18O results are consistent with abyssal South Atlantic isolation until 15 kyr BP, in contrast to shallower sites. The depth dependent timing of the δ18O signal suggests that correcting δ18O for ice volume is ill advised on glacial terminations. New data from 2700-3000 m also show the deep SW Atlantic was isotopically distinct from the abyss during HS1. As a result, we find that mid-depth δ13C minima are consistent with conservative behavior and were most likely driven by an abrupt decrease in the δ13C of northern component water. Low δ13C at the Brazil Margin coincided with a ~80‰ decrease in Δ14C. Our results are consistent with a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and point toward a northern hemisphere trigger for the initial rise in atmospheric CO2 during HS1.",

            "abstract": "Newly recognized ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) mineral occurrences including diamonds in ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) felsic granulites of orogenic belts, in chromitites associated with ophiolitic complexes, and in mafic/ultramafic xenoliths suggest the recycling of crustal materials through profound subduction, mantle upwelling, and return to the Earth’s surface. Recycling is supported by unambiguously crust-derived mineral inclusions in deep-seated zircons, chromites, and diamonds from collision-type orogens, from eclogitic xenoliths, and from ultramafic bodies of several Alpine–Himalayan and Polar Ural ophiolites; some such phases contain low-atomic number elements typified by crustal isotopic signatures. Ophiolite-type diamonds in placer deposits and as inclusions in chromitites together with numerous highly reduced minerals and alloys appear to have formed near the mantle transition zone. In addition to ringwoodite and stishovite, a wide variety of nanometric minerals have been identified as inclusions employing state-of-the-art analysis. Reconstitution of now-exsolved precursor UHP phases and recognition of subtle decompression microstructures produced during exhumation reflect earlier UHP conditions. Some podiform chromitites and associated peridotites contain rare minerals of undoubted crustal origin, including Zrn, corundum, Fls, Grt, Ky, Sil, Qtz, and Rtl; the zircons possess much older U–Pb ages than the formation age of the host ophiolites. These UHP mineral-bearing chromitites had a deep-seated evolution prior to extensional mantle upwelling and its partial melting at shallow depths to form the overlying ophiolite complexes. These new findings plus stable isotopic and inclusion characteristics of diamonds provide compelling evidence for profound underflow of both oceanic and continental lithosphere, recycling of biogenic carbon into the lower mantle, and ascent to the Earth’s surface through deep mantle ascent.",

            "abstract": "Lake Quinault, located at the foot of the Olympic Mountains in western Washington, has served as a trap for sediment delivered from the steep, landslide-prone terrain of the Upper Quinault River catchment since its formation between 20,000 and 29,000 years ago. High resolution seismic reflection and sedimentological data reveal a record of both the in-lake and upland response to large earthquakes that have impacted the region during that period.\nThe sedimentary infill of Lake Quinault is dominated by deposition during river floods, which delivered both abundant siliciclastic sediment and plant debris to the lake bottom. Minor episodes of soft-sediment deformation at the lake margins are recorded, and based on a preliminary age model, may be related to known earthquakes, including the well documented 1700 AD Cascadia megathrust event. By far the most dramatic event in the middle-late Holocene record of Lake Quinault, however, is the lateral spreading and degassing of sediments on its gentle western slopes during an event ca. 1300 years ago. Abundant gas chimneys are visible in seismic stratigraphic profiles from this part of the lake. Several of these gas chimneys extend from the limit of seismic penetration at 15-20 m depth in the lake bed upward to the lake bottom where they terminate at mounds with evidence for active venting. Most of the gas chimneys, however, end abruptly around 2.5 m beneath the lake floor and are overlain by parallel, continuous reflectors. Piston cores show soft-sediment deformation at this level, and abrupt shifts in density, magnetic susceptibility, flood layer thickness, particle size, color, and inorganic geochemistry. We interpret these shifts to mark the contact between sediments that experienced shaking and degassing during a strong earthquake event and overlying sediments that have not experienced comparable seismicity. The earthquake evidently strongly affected the Upper Quinault River catchment, causing increased sediment input to the lake and stepwise progradation of the delta at its eastern end. Our results suggest that similar events may have occurred previously in the lake, at a frequency of several thousands of years, and may reflect a response to large earthquakes generated on nearby crustal faults rather than at the subduction interface.",

            "abstract": "We perform modeling and analysis of water in the lunar exosphere. There were two controlled experiments of water interactions with the surface of the Moon observed by the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS). The Chang’e 3 landing on the Moon on 14 Dec 2013 putatively sprayed ~120 kg of water on the surface on the Moon at a mid-morning local time. Observations by LADEE near the noon meridian on six of the orbits in the 24 hours following the landing constrain the propagation of water vapor. Further, on 4 Apr 2014, LADEE’s Orbital Maintenance Manuever (OMM) #21 sprayed the surface of the Moon with an estimated 0.73 kg of water in the pre-dawn sector. Observations of this maneuver and later in the day constrain the adsorption and release at dawn of adsorbed materials. Using the Chang’e 3 exhaust plume and LADEE’s OMM-21 as control experiments, we set limits to the adsorption and thermalization of water with lunar regolith. This enables us to predict the efficiency of the migration of water as a delivery mechanism to the lunar poles. Then we simulate the migration of water through the lunar exosphere using the rate of sporadic inputs from meteoritic sources (Benna et al., this session). Simulations predict the amount of water adsorbed to the surface of the Moon and the effective delivery rate to the lunar polar cold traps.",

            "abstract": "Wave modes including lower hybrid waves (LHW), whistler mode waves (WW), electrostatic solitary waves (ESW) and electron cyclotron waves (ECW) have been frequently observed in the Earth’s magnetosphere and at the Earth’s magnetopause. We present the first simultaneous observations of these waves at the low latitude boundary layer (LLBL) of the Earth's magnetopause using data from the THEMIS-E satellite. The waves were identified through auditory analysis in the high resolution (16384 samples/s) electric field burst data and occurred at the same time as large fluctuations of plasma density and temperature (at time scales of ~3 to 4 minutes) at a location of 9.3 Re, 14.4 magnetic local time, and 5.8 degrees magnetic latitude. Large fluctuations in the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind flow speed were observed associated with this wave event and could be responsible for the variations seen in the LLBL at THEMIS-E. The particle distribution functions show that lower-energy ions (<1.3 KeV) are anisotropic with Ti_perp > Ti_para while lower-energy (<300 eV) electrons are anisotropic with Te_perp < Te_para. In addition, electrons show a double-peaked distribution, i.e., bi-streaming beams. These distributions are consistent with instability mechanisms proposed for the observed waves. The results provide insights into wave coupling near the magnetopause and suggest that coupling processes may be more important than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "Numerous seafloor pockmarks with episodic methane venting have been reported at the Vestnesa Ridge (1200-1350 mbsl), a sediment drift in the West Svalbard continental margin gas hydrate province. What is driving the free gas through the hydrate stability zone (HSZ) to the seafloor pockmarks in the study area is not well understood, although over-pressured gas, water limitation and high salinity caused by the formation of hydrate are likely to be contributory factors. Knowledge of the fluid constituents within the acoustic chimney imaged by seismic reflection data could help in understanding how methane gas migrates through the HSZ. Electrical resistivity obtained from controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) data offers improved information on fluid saturation, which helps predict the saturations of hydrate, gas, water and its salinity, within the fluid migration pathways. With the objective of a joint interpretation, we acquired coincident seismic reflection and CSEM data on the Vestnesa Ridge during 2011 and 2012. The CSEM survey was conducted over an active pockmark using a 100-m horizontal electric-dipole-source, 9 ocean-bottom electric-field (OBE) receivers and a towed tri-axis electric-field receiver. Preliminary interpretation of CSEM and seismic reflection data suggests high concentrations of free gas (40-65% pore saturation) within the main chimney, with a possible hydrate plug underneath the seafloor pockmark. High resistivity anomaly and high percentage of resistive fluids predicted within the chimney indicate water limitation to be an important factor enabling free gas migration to the seafloor. A deeper gas reservoir (>30% pore saturation) can also be observed, which appear to feed free gas into the HSZ. The rising gas from the deeper reservoir forms a heterogeneous distribution of hydrates (~10% pore saturation) and also feeds the fluid-escape features.",

            "abstract": "Highly fertile lherzolite and spinel websterite in the Ronda peridotite massif are enriched in Pt and Pd compared to Os, Ir, Ru and Re. The fractionation of the highly siderophile elements (HSE) in these rocks was produced by reaction of melt with their peridotite and pyroxenite precursors. Modelling indicates that upon reaction primary HSE hosts were dissolved and magmatic sulphides precipitated, largely erasing the original HSE signature of reacting protoliths. The budget of HSE in the melt was controlled by sulphide-silicate partitioning or entrainment of molten sulphide in silicate melt. Rhenium was likely removed from precursor peridotite and pyroxenite by previous melt extraction. Refertilization of peridotite by melts increased Al2O3, CaO, Pt, Pd contents and 187Os/188Os beyond typical values for mantle peridotite and the primitive upper mantle. The interaction of melts with residual peridotite and pyroxenite, as illustrated in the Ronda massif, can generate radiogenic-Os-enriched domains in the mantle with high melt productivity, higher Pt/Os and Pt/Re than common peridotite, and lower Re/Os than typical pyroxenite. As also previously proposed for pyroxenites, these “hybrid” domains can account for the difference in Os isotope compositions between many basalts (e.g., MORB and OIB) and common depleted mantle peridotites. Moreover, the presence of these enriched hybrid components in the mantle, evolved over sufficient timescales and in geologically reasonable proportions, may account for the 186Os-187Os enrichment of plume lavas without requiring a chemical contribution from the core.",

            "abstract": "Evaporation from the Arctic Ocean has implications for cloud and water vapor feedbacks, Arctic amplification, and ablation of sea ice. Accurately estimating the evaporation continues to be associated with large uncertainties leading to latent heat differences of up to 55 Wm-2 in the Beaufort-East Siberian Seas (BESS) region between models. To help constrain this uncertainty we compare data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and ECMWF’s ERA-Interim reanalysis with a variety of in situ data. When comparing input data, ERA-Interim skin temperatures had twice as large an error compared to AIRS, but had smaller errors in air specific humidity. Differences in the input data into the same model can cause moisture flux estimates to differ by as much as 1.6 x10-2 gm-2s-1 (equivalent to 40 W m-2 latent heat) in the BESS region. Moisture flux products from the BMF13 and the ERA-Interim scheme are also compared. Similarities in these products were seen in the Kara/Barents Seas having a ratio of 1:1, and differences were seen in the BESS region, having a ratio of roughly 5:1. Issues found between ERA-Interim and AIRS support the need for more in situ measurements of temperature and humidity in the BESS region to improve the quality of the input data and thus reduce model uncertainties. We also show regional changes in the moisture flux produced between 2003-2014 and try to explain if the majority of the water vapor in the lower atmosphere is from evaporation at the surface rather than from lower-latitude transport.",

            "abstract": "Road Radar generally refers to ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys intended to investigate pavement construction using pulses centered above 1 GHz. In interior Alaska thick sand and gravel grading and its frozen state by late winter generally afford up to 10 m of signal penetration at lower frequencies. Consequently, this penetration potentially allows identification of pavement issues involving frost heave and thaw settlement, while the smooth surface allows assessment of GPR performance in permafrost areas under ideal survey conditions. Here I discuss profiles using pulse center frequencies from 50 to 360 MHz, recorded over sections of the Steese and Elliott Highways within and just north of Fairbanks, respectively, and of the Tok Highway near Glennallen. Construction fill is easily recognized by its stratification; where marginally present along the Elliott it is replaced by steeply dipping horizons from the underlying schist. The frost depth and water table horizons are recognized by phase attributes of the reflected pulse, as dictated by the contrasts present in dielectric permittivity, their relative depths, and their continuity. Undulating stratification in the sand and gravel fill indicates thaw settlement, as caused by the melting of buried massive ice. The Tok section reveals the top and likely the bottom of massive ice. Generally, signal penetration is greatly reduced beneath the water table and so the highest resolution, at 360 MHz, covers all horizons. There is rare evidence of a permafrost table because it is most likely masked or nearly coincident with the water table. Permafrost penetration in frozen silts is a long-standing problem for GPR, for which I discuss a possible cause related to Maxwell-Wagner dielectric relaxation losses associated with unfrozen water.",

            "abstract": "Greenhouse gas emissions from salt marshes, especially of nitrous oxide (N2O), are a central interest because anthropogenic nutrient loads may substantially alter net climatic forcing of these globally significant ecosystems. In a series of lab and field experiments, a new cavity ring down spectrometer (CRDS, Picarro G2508) that uses mid-infrared (mid-IR) frequencies to measure N2O was compared to a near-IR gas analyzer (LGR N2O/CO analyzer). The Picarro G2508 reports N2O as well as CO2 and CH4 concentrations roughly every second at the parts per billion level. Responses of N2O fluxes to experimental ammonium nitrate additions in marsh mesocosms and marsh plots in situ were compared among these analyzers, along with minimum detectable N2O fluxes. At fluxes above 150 µmol N2O m-2 d-1, the Picarro G2508 and LGR analyzers performed similarly in both mesocosm and field plots that had been enriched with ammonium nitrate, however there were significantly lower minimum detectable N2O fluxes (about 1 order of magnitude) for the LGR than for the Picarro. A gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC 2014) was also used to test calibration of the G2508. These experiments suggest that mid-IR CRDS technology offers a new tool for simultaneous analyses of N2O along with CO2 and CH4, which fills an important need for quantifying the net climatic forcing of ecosystems. However based on relatively high minimum N2O detection levels of the CRDS, it may work best in highly eutrophic environments.",

            "abstract": "Biogenic manganese (Mn) oxide minerals are ubiquitous in the environment, and their high reactivity can profoundly impact the fate of contaminants and cycling of carbon and nutrients. In contrast to bacteria, the pathways utilized by fungi to oxidize Mn(II) to Mn(III,IV) oxides remain largely unknown. Here, we explore the mechanisms of Mn(II) oxidation by a phylogenetically diverse group of filamentous Ascomycete fungi using a combination of chemical assays and bulk and spatially-resolved mass spectrometry.\nWe show that the mechanisms of Mn(II) oxidation vary with fungal species, over time during secretome compositional changes, and in the presence of other fungi. Specifically, our work implicates a dynamic transition in Mn(II) oxidation pathways that varies between species. In particular, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced via transmembrane NADPH oxidases are involved in initial oxidation, over time, secreted enzymes become important Mn(II) oxidation mediators for some species. In addition, the overall secretome oxidation capacity varies with time and fungal species. Secretome analysis reveals a surprising absence of enzymes currently considered to be Mn(II)-oxidizing enzymes in these organisms, and instead highlights a wide variety of redox-active enzymes. Furthermore, we implicate fungal cell defense mechanisms in the formation of distinct Mn oxide patterns when fungi are grown in head-to-head competition. The identification and regulation of these secreted enzymes are under current investigation within the bulk secretome and within the interaction zone of structured fungal communities.\nOverall, our findings illustrate that Ascomycete Mn(II) oxidation mechanisms are highly variable and are dictated by complex environmental and ecological interactions. Future work will explore the connection between Ascomycete Mn(II) oxidation and the ability to degrade cellulose, a key carbon reservoir for biofuel production.",

            "abstract": "Scientists use myriad tools to reconstruct past surface ocean conditions to develop a comprehensive image of our Earth. Corals are often utilized to create high-resolution records of sea surface temperature, local salinity or precipitation, and overall reef health via geochemical analyses. Paleoceanography is often a completely foreign topic for younger students or is taught in an abstract way unaccompanied by lab experiences for older students. Additionally, it is quite rare for students to be regularly interacting with marine organisms and coastal processes, weakening their connection to the ocean. In order to strengthen this bond and help students to understand the global impacts of a distant ocean it is sometimes necessary to bring the coral reef to the classroom. Using modeling clay and large straws students can take their own coral cores and examine the alternating clay layers to create their own chronology. Different clay colors represent a spectrum of environmental conditions. Students can reconstruct the oceanic conditions according to their coral core and begin to appreciate the wealth of information stored in these reef structures. The goals of this activity are to introduce students to paleoceanography and teach just one of many ways that scientists can learn about the past. Ideally students will begin to cultivate an appreciation for the ocean and its role in the climate system.",

            "abstract": "Daily streamflow information is critical for solving any number of hydrologic problems. One promising approach to estimate a time series of daily streamflow at an ungauged location is to estimate a continuous, daily, period-of-record flow-duration curve (FDC) at the ungauged location and use the timing of observed streamflows from a donor streamgauge to transform the FDC at the ungauged location into a time series of streamflow. Ideally, if one were to find a suitable probability density function (pdf) to represent daily streamflow, only the parameters of the distribution would need to be estimated at the ungauged location. Determining the pdf of daily streamflow could also provide functional linkages between the pdfs of daily precipitation and other catchment processes toward a probabilistic framework which explains how catchments filter the precipitation signal. Three- and four parameter distributions were fit to daily streamflow observations from streamgauges located in the north- and southeastern United States. No suitable three or four-parameter probability distribution were found to adequately represent the distribution of daily streamflow, particularly at streamflow quantiles greater than 0.9 and less than 0.01 exceedence probabilities. Furthermore, the properties of these distributions caused estimated streamflows to be bounded at both the highest and lowest streamflow quantiles, creating a severe bias in the estimation of the FDC. Traditional goodness-of-fit statistics were also unable to revealing this lack of fit; only examination of the individual probability plots showed this inadequacy.",

The basin trends nearly EW; it is 500km in length, 40-50km in width. The sedimentary thickness of Cenozoic is 7000m; the maximum thickness of quaternary is 1400m. The basin shows an extremely asymmetry dustpan in shape, the sedimentary thickness is thick in south thin in north, and is controlled by a series of normal faults, it is an extensional fault basin. Weihe Basin is formed by salient and fault-concaves, and shows a motion feature of different settlement. There are two main depressions in the basin——Gushi depression and Xi’an depression.\nGushi depression has the thickest sediment of quaternary in Weihe Basin. Many artificial earthquake prospecting have been done in Gushi depression recent years, and we are able to summarized some characteristics from the cross sections as below:\n 1. The southern margin of Gushi depression is Weinan front loess tableland and frontal zones of Huashan Mt., northern margin is Kouzhen——Linyi fault, western margin is Jingyang——Weinan fault, eastern margin is along the Yellow River. The long axis of Gushi depression is in the direction of NEE.\n2. A series of normal faults dipping south are found in the trench, and centralized in the southern part of the depression. Secondary faults cut the bottom boundary of quaternary strata, some reach a depth of around 1200m, and some faults in the upper part cut the late Pleistocene strata. They are secondary antithetic faults in the hanging wall of Weinan front loess tableland faults(fig.).\nFig. stucture of Gushi depression\nF1 Lishan piedmont fault F2 .F3 Weinan front tableland faults F4 Kouzhen-guanshan fault\n 3.A series of secondary antithetic faults are also found in the hanging wall of Lintong-Chang’an fault, eastern margin of Xi’an depression. Therefore, Gushi depression and Xi’an depression have the same structural feature. In Xi’an depression, secondary antithetic faults formed dozens of ground fissures in the surface, which do not show as many as in the Gushi depression, the reason may attribute to the groundwater extraction and stratum structure.\n4.According to the motion features of the faults, the combination of the faults reflects an extensional and rotational sheared sliding.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive field experiment devoted to the study of coastal processes on a micro-tidal beach was conducted from March 30th to April 12th 2014 in Sisal, Yucatán México. Wave conditions in the study area are controlled by local (i.e., sea-breezes) and meso-scale (i.e., Nortes) meteorological events. Simultaneous measurements of waves, tides, winds, currents, sediment transport, runup, and beach morphology were obtained in this experiment. Very dense nearshore instrumentation arrays allow us the study of the cross-/along- shore variability of surf/swash zone dynamics during different forcing conditions. Strong sea-breeze wind events produced a diurnal cycle with a maximum wind speed of 14 m/s. The persistent sea-breeze system forces small-amplitude (Hs<1 m) short-period (Tp<4 s) NE waves approaching with a high incidence wave angle. These wave conditions drive westward alongshore currents of up to 0.6 m/s in the inner surf zone and hence produce an active sediment transport in the swash zone. On the other hand, the more energetic (Hs>1 m) Norte event, lasting 48 hours, reached the coast on April 8th generating a long-period swell (Tp>10 s) arriving from the NNW. This event induced an eastward net sediment transport across a wide surf zone. However, long-term observations of sand impoundment at a groin located near the study area suggests that the net sediment transport in the northern Yucatan peninsula is controlled by sea-breeze events and hence swash zone dynamics play an important role in the net sediment budget of this region. A comparative study of surf and swash zone dynamics during both sea-breeze and Norte events will be presented.

            "abstract": "Atmospheric gravity waves provide a major coupling mechanism between the troposphere and the middle atmosphere. However, the conditions under which they propagate into the mesosphere are still not completely understood. So far, ground-based lidar is the only remote sensing technique that can provide the high vertical and temporal resolution that has been found necessary for studying gravity wave propagation into the middle atmosphere. But most lidar systems cannot provide suitable data for the investigation of gravity waves at altitudes lower than 30 km. This study presents a new approach for closing this altitude gap by combining lidar measurements with numerical simulations.\nMeasurements with the Esrange lidar (68°N, 21°E) have been conducted during the first field campaign of the project “Investigation of the life cycle of gravity waves” (GW-LCYCLE) in winter 2013/14. Combining these measurements with regional numerical simulations with the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model allows for a comprehensive analysis of gravity wave propagation. Results from the numerical simulations were compared against nightly mean temperature profiles determined with the Esrange lidar’s rotational-Raman channels and measured with radiosondes launched from Esrange in intervals of 3 h. The comparison indicates that the WRF-ARW simulations are suitable for substituting the missing lidar observations below 30 km altitude.\nThe combination of observations and simulations shows gravity waves propagating from the tropopause region deep into the mesosphere. By calculating gravity wave potential energy densities and vertical energy fluxes the conditions conducive for gravity wave propagation are examined in detail. Our approach of reconciling lidar measurements with model simulations is found to be a promising method for gravity wave studies applicable to all lidar systems lacking temperature or density measurements below an altitude of 30 km.",

            "abstract": "To first order, the Earth exhibits seismic anisotropy (the variation of wave speed with direction) only in the uppermost and lowermost mantle, as well as the inner core. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that it is also present in the transition zone (TZ) and uppermost lower mantle (LM). We use the method of ‘source-side’ shear wave splitting to observe anisotropy in the regions of deep earthquakes distributed globally. This technique removes the effects of anisotropy near well-characterised receiver stations to infer the splitting at the source, allowing us to probe the midmantle where slabs appear to be impinging on the LM.\nOver 130 observations, mainly beneath South America, Tonga and Japan, are made for earthquakes 200–650 km deep. They show shear wave splitting with mean delay time 1.0 s, but there is no trend of decreasing—or increasing—δt with depth. Because of the distribution of circum-Pacific deep earthquakes, our data are only sensitive to anisotropy in the sub-slab region and the slab itself.\nOur observations reveal a consistent pattern: the data are best fit with a style of anisotropy which has a rotational symmetry axis pointing upwards along the slab. This pattern of anisotropy is typical of approximately uniaxial flattening of material which develops a lattice preferred orientation (LPO) by dislocation creep. This is consistent with the expected mechanics of slab sinking and supported by the P-axes of moment tensor solutions for the events we analyse. Because the amount of anisotropy does not appear to be related to the depth, we can confine the source region to either the slab itself, or the top of the LM.\nThe amount of anisotropy makes it unlikely that MgSiO3-perovskite in the LM is the source, as it would require a high-strain layer over 1500~km thick. Dense hydrous magnesium silicate (DHMS) phases which are known to become stable at the base of the TZ (the so-called ‘alphabet’ phases; such as D and superhydrous B), do however have very large single crystal anisotropy, would likely develop LPO, and if distributed over a few tens of km could produce the splitting we observe at subduction zones. If these phases are as ubiquitous as our data imply, then significant water volumes may be brought into the LM over geological time, influencing our understanding of subduction zone dynamics and lower mantle composition.",

Precipitation is the major forcing of stormwater modeling and one of the most important variables for accurate representation of the water cycle in urban areas. However, rainfall data availability in both temporal and spatial adequate scales is scarce. Here we investigate the potential to apply satellite precipitation products to small-scale urban watersheds with a focus on real-time data for operational use and historical data for model calibration and planning. We present a study case in Northern Virginia, part of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region.\nWe compare several rainfall datasets from satellites, radar and rain gauges during 2002-2008, using two multi-satellite precipitation products. The first one is the NASA TRMM TMPA at daily/0.25° time/space resolution, which is available in two forms: 3B42-Real Time and 3B42-Version 7, where the latter is a post-processed product, corrected with ground-based observations. The second one is the NOAA CMORPH at 3hrs/0.25° time/space resolution. The NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) data and NCEP Stage IV radar-based product are used as reference datasets for TMPA and CMORPH, respectively.\nStatistical analyses are conducted to compare these datasets: correlation coefficient, RMSE, bias, probability of correct no-rain detection and of false alarm were computed with a focus on Fairfax, VA county. Preliminary results show that the TMPA products outperform CMORPH, when compared to rain gauges and radar data over the county. Moreover, no appreciable difference is detected between TMPA-V7 and TMPA-RT, which demonstrates that real-time data could be used over the urban watershed with results that are comparable to the adjusted product. Analyses are undergoing to investigate higher temporal resolution and to include a comparison with the Fairfax county rain gages data. Future work will also evaluate the impacts of different precipitation datasets on stormwater runoff for Fairfax county, using the EPA-SWMM5 storm water model.",

            "abstract": "The decadal hindcast simulations performed for the “Mittelfristige Klimaprognosen” (MiKlip, decadal climate predictions) project are evaluated using satellite-retrieved cloud parameters from the CM SAF cLoud, Albedo and RAdiation dataset from AVHRR data (CLARA-A1) provided by the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) and from the International Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). The forecast quality of two sets of hindcasts, Baseline-1-LR and Baseline-0, which use different ocean anomaly initializations, is assessed. While Baseline-0 uses an ocean only initialization, Baseline-1-LR additionally uses full field initialization of atmospheric fields.\nBasic evaluation focuses on multi-year ensemble mean fields and cloud-type histograms utilizing satellite simulator output. Additionally, ensemble evaluation employing analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis rank histograms (ARH) and a deterministic correlation score is performed. Satellite simulator output is available for a subset of the full hindcast ensembles only. Therefore, the raw model cloud cover is additionally used. The Baseline-1-LR hindcasts are closer to satellite data with respect to the simulated tropical/subtropical mean cloud cover pattern than the reference hindcasts (Baseline-0) emphasizing improvements of the initialisation procedure used for Baseline-1-LR when compared to Baseline-0. A slightly overestimated occurrence rate of optically thick cloud-types is analyzed for different experiments including hindcasts and simulations using realistic sea surface boundaries according to the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project. By contrast, the evaluation of cirrus and cirrostratus clouds is complicated by observational based uncertainties. Ensemble evaluation of the Baseline-1-LR hindcasts reveals potential predictability of the 2-5 lead year averaged total cloud cover for a large part of the tropical warm pool (TWP) region when regarding the full observational period. However, the hindcasts show only moderate positive correlations with the CLARA-A1 satellite retrieval for the TWP region which are hardly statistical significant. Evidence for predictability of the 2-5 lead year averaged total cloud cover is found for parts of the equatorial to mid-latitudinal North Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "The early 21st century was marked by several severe winters over Central Eurasia linked to a blocking anti-cyclone centered south of the Barents Sea (BS). The increased occurrence of such anomalously cold winters coincided with a strong reduction of winter Arctic sea ice cover (ASIC), especially in the BS where sea ice area exhibited a step-like decline in 2005, suggesting a possible connection. To study the possible link we performed simulations with a high-resolution global atmospheric general circulation model forced by a set of multi-year sea ice anomalies observed during the last decades. The regional circulation response to reduced ASIC in 2005-2012 exhibits a statistically significant anti-cyclonic surface pressure anomaly and a surface temperature response similar to that observed. The results suggest that the recent BS sea ice reduction may have been responsible for the recent anomalously cold winters in Central Eurasia. Furthermore, a positive sea ice anomaly in the late 1960s associated with negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation also results in a similar anti-cyclonic anomaly and a cooling over the continent in the model. This implies that the atmospheric circulation response to sea ice anomalies during the period of modern sea ice decline can be essentially non-linear, both with respect to amplitude and pattern.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the earth´s climate as well as the oceanic chemical and isotopic evolution in the past is one of the main aims in earth science. Ca as one of the major elements in the ocean is especially important. Its variation in concentration are controlled by different factors including the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere, continental weathering and Ca carbonate sedimentation. We used samples from IODP Exp. 320/321 to establish a δ44/40Ca paleo-seawater record between 45 and 25 Ma and model changes in the Ca budget through time. Our results show differences in the Eocene and Oligocene Ca isotope record of benthic foraminifers. The δ44/40Ca values during the Eocene are relatively constant with no significant fluctuations during phases of large short term CCD fluctuations[1]. The Oligocene is characterized by sediments with uniformly high carbonate content and increasing δ44/40Ca towards the late Oligocene. Past seawater δ44/40Ca values (Fig. 1) were calculated from the measured benthic foraminifer record applying the calibration for Gyroidinoides spp.[2]. The Ca budget during the Eocene is relatively constant and not affected by short term CCD fluctuations, indicating that they are too small to alter the isotopic Ca budget. The Oligocene, in contrast is characterized by a general increase in δ44/40Ca seawater values and a continuously deep CCD[1]. This is consistent with a massive long term (>1Ma) CaCO3 deposition and decreasing Ca concentration in the ocean water. To examine the preservation (dissolution and recrystallization) of the foraminifer test through time, we studied additionally the changes in the crystallographic orientations trough time by Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) analysis and Raman spectroscopy. As a final step we use our δ44/40Ca seawater record to run a combined Ca and C model showing the effect of Ca weathering input, carbonate remobilization and dolomitization on the Ca and carbonate system of seawater [1].\n[1]Pälike H., Mitchell W.

            "abstract": "Intraplate regions are often characterized by scattered, clustered and migrating seismicity and the occurrence of low-strain areas next to high-strain ones. Increasing evidence for large paleoearthquakes in such regions together with population growth and development of critical facilities, call for better assessments of earthquake hazards. Existing seismic hazard assessment for intraplate Europe is based on instrumental and historical seismicity of the past 1000 years, as well some active fault data. These observations face important limitations due to the quantity and quality of the available data bases. Even considering the long record of historical events in some populated areas of Europe, this time-span of thousand years likely fails to capture some faults’ typical large-event recurrence intervals that are in the order of tens of thousands of years. Paleoseismology helps lengthen the observation window, but only produces point measurements, and preferentially in regions suspected to be seismically active. As a result, the expected maximum magnitudes of future earthquakes are quite uncertain, likely to be underestimated, and earthquakes are likely to occur in unexpected locations. These issues in particular arise in the heavily populated Rhine Graben and Vienna Basin areas, and in considering the hazard to critical facilities like nuclear power plants posed by low-probability events.",

            "abstract": "Soil carbon dioxide (CO2) respiration is a primary mechanism for soil carbon (C) loss and is intricately linked to processes that affect soil C storage. As a result, land-use changes that affect soil CO2 flux (Flux) rates can significantly influence regional C budgets. The páramo grasslands of the high altitude Ecuadorian Andes are important in regional C budgets due to large soil C stocks. Though some forms of land use history have been shown to reduce soil C and affect known drivers of Flux, such as soil moisture (MS) and soil temperature (TS), the effect of land use history on Flux and its role in páramo soil C budgets remains poorly understood. This study investigated Flux differences among sites representing four land-use histories (PA-páramo; PAB-páramo recently burned; NA-native forest; PI-planted pine forest) and assessed the role of MS and TS on Flux rates within and across sites. Flux, MS, and TS were measured over a 3-week period at the Mazar Wildlife Reserve in southern Ecuador. Flux varied significantly among site pairs, except PI and NA. Flux rates were highest in the PI (5.79 g CO2-C m-2 d-1) and NA sites (5.59 g CO2-C m-2 d-1), with Flux rates at PA and PAB of 4.84 g CO2-C m-2 d-1 and 3.76 g CO2-C m-2 d-1, respectively. MS ranged from 29% at PI to 55% at PA, with grass sites having higher MS than forested sites. On average, páramo soils were ~3°C warmer than forested soil, with PI warmer than NA. Across all sites, Flux was weakly, negatively correlated with MS. Flux and TS were positively correlated within each site except PAB; the strongest correlation (p<0.0001) was observed at PI. Our results show that in the Ecuadorian Andes, Flux is significantly affected by land use history with higher Flux rates observed in forested areas than in páramo grasslands. To our knowledge, these are the first Flux rates reported for the Ecuadorian páramo region.",

            "abstract": "Despite extensive application of conservation practices to minimize sediment P delivery to streams, hypoxic conditions and harmful algal blooms persist in receiving water bodies. Tile-drainage networks are a focal point for reducing soluble P in the food-producing Midwestern United States in that they promote higher connectivity between upland soils and stream channels which decreases soil contact time, and biogeochemical alterations. A critical next step to reduce the environmental impact and maintain sustainable agriculture is to implement best management practices (BMPs) under a holistic framework that considers adverse effects to water resources and crop production, while maintaining economic feasibility. The objective of this study was to apply a robust numerical model, the Agricultural Policy Environmental Extender (APEX), in a tile-drained landscape in Central Ohio in order to evaluate the effectiveness of a suite of BMPs on soluble and particulate P delivery to stream channels. The model was applied and evaluated at two adjacent edge-of-field sites with similar soil, topographic and management characteristics (except for tillage and tile installation on the south field in 2012, preceded by more than 20 years of no-till operations). Three years of daily discharge, total suspended solids, soluble P, soluble N (NO3 and NH4), total P, total N, and crop yields were utilized to verify the model performance. Prevalent BMPs simulated within the modeling framework included drainage water management, tillage and crop rotations, the 4Rs framework (right fertilizer source, rate, time, and placement), and bioreactors. Results of the study quantify the ability of the numerical model to simulate hydrology and P transport for surface runoff and subsurface tile drainage and highlight modifications that improve model performance. Further, results highlight BMPs that effectively reduce P loads to streams while maintaining crop yields, which can later be used to inform BMPs implemented at edge-of-field sites in Ohio. While beyond the scope of this study, future work aims to investigate the sustainability of BMPs under dynamic climate conditions and across watershed gradients.",

            "abstract": "The extent of the Maya civilization spanned across portions of modern day Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Paleoclimatic studies suggest this region has been affected by strong hurricanes for the past six thousand years, reinforced by archeological evidence from Mayan records indicating they experienced strong storms. It is theorized hurricanes aided in the collapse of the Maya, damaging building structures, agriculture, and ceasing industry activities. Today, this region is known for its active tropical climatology, being hit by numerous strong storms including Hurricane Dean, Iris, Keith, and Mitch. This research uses a geographic information system (GIS) to model hurricane hazards, and assess the risk posed on the Maya civilization. GIS has the ability to handle various layer components making it optimal for combining parameters necessary for assessing the risk of experiencing hurricane related hazards. For this analysis, high winds, storm surge flooding, non-storm surge related flooding, and rainfall triggered landslides were selected as the primary hurricane hazards. Data sets used in this analysis include the National Climatic Data Center International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardships (IBTrACS) hurricane tracks, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model, WorldClim monthly accumulated precipitation, USGS HydroSHEDS river locations, Harmonized World Soil Database soil types, and known Maya site locations from the Electronic Atlas of Ancient Maya Sites. ArcGIS and ENVI software were utilized to process data and model hurricane hazards. To assess locations at risk of experiencing high winds, a model was created using ArcGIS Model Builder to map each storm’s temporal wind profile, and adapted to simulate forward storm velocity, and storm frequency. Modeled results were then combined with physical land characteristics, meteorological, and hydrologic data to identify areas likely affected. Certain areas along the eastern edge of the Yucatan peninsula were found to be more prone to experiencing wind and flood related hurricane hazards. Novel methodologies developed from this analysis can be adapted for further hurricane risk assessment on archeological sites.",

            "abstract": "Rapid and drastic environmental change has occurred frequently on Earth, posing a critical challenge to life. However, directional selection has overcome those challenges and driven life on our planet to ever increasing diversity and complexity. Based on our knowledge of the natural history of Earth, the effect of drastic environmental changes on a planet’s biosphere can be attributed to three main factors: (1) the nature and time scale of change, (2) the composition of the biosphere prior to change, and (3) the nature of the environment following the change. Mars has undergone even larger environmental changes than Earth, from habitable conditions under which the origin of life (or transfer of life from Earth) seem plausible, to a dry and cold planet punctuated by wetter conditions. Given its planetary history, life on Mars could have retreated to a psychrophilic lifestyle in the deep subsurface or to environmental near-surface niches, such as hydrothermal regions and caves. Further, strong directional selection could have pushed putative martian life to evolve alternating cycles between active and dormant forms, as well as the innovation of new traits adapted to challenging near-surface conditions (e.g., use of H2O2 or perchlorates as antifreeze compounds).",

            "abstract": "Recent field studies have confirmed the presence of soluble manganese(III), which along with Mn(II) passes through a 0.2 µm filter, in suboxic marine waters. Here we applied a spectrophotometric method using a soluble porphyrin as a competitive ligand to calculate the concentrations and kinetics of Mn(II) and Mn(III) recovery. Data will be presented from the suboxic porewaters of the Saint Lawrence estuary, the suboxic and anoxic waters of the Chesapeake Bay and the oxygenated surface waters of a coastal waterway bordered by wetlands and salt marshes in Delaware.\nSoluble Mn(III) accounts for up to 100% of the dissolved Mn pool with concentrations ranging from the detection limit of 50 nM to 80 µM at the oxic/anoxic interface of the non-sulfidic porewaters from the hemipelagic sediments of the St. Lawrence Estuary. Data indicate weak-ligand complexation of Mn(III) formed from Mn(II) oxidation as well as reduction of MnO2.\nComplexation of Mn(III) in the anoxic waters of Chesapeake Bay appears stronger as the porphyrin could not outcompete the natural ligands binding Mn(III). Mn(III) complexes were reduced in the presence of hydroxylamine or hydrogen sulfide and detected as Mn(II). Soluble Mn(III) comprised up to 52 % of total dissolved Mn. Profiles over the course of a five day cruise showed that high Mn(III) concentrations (7.3 μM) were observed at low H2S (4.9 μM) whereas low Mn(III) (1.1 μM) was detected at high H2S (40 μM). The presence of Mn(III) in sulfidic waters indicated that it is kinetically stabilized in situ by strong ligands so reduction to Mn(II) was incomplete. One electron reductive dissolution of solid MnO2 particles formed at the oxic-anoxic interface appear to be the source of Mn(III).\nLastly, soluble Mn(III) was detected in the oxygenated surface waters of a coastal waterway (salinity ranging from freshwater to 31) bordered by wetlands and salt marshes in Delaware. Soluble Mn(III) made up 0-49 % of the total dissolved Mn (maximum of 1.92 μM) with the highest concentrations and percentages coming from waters adjacent to salt marsh areas. The porphyrin competitive ligand could not outcompete the natural ligands, which appear to be humic material; thus, a reductant was again needed to convert the Mn(III) complexes to Mn(II) for measurement.",

This unique tectonic environment, which has never before been sampled in situ by ocean drilling, was characterized through riser drilling, logging while drilling (LWD), mud gas monitoring and sampling, and cuttings and core analysis. Shipboard physical properties measurements including moisture and density (MAD), electrical conductivity, P-wave, natural gamma ray, and magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed mainly on cuttings samples from 870.5 to 3058.5 mbsf, but also on core samples from 2163 and 2204 mbsf.\nMAD measurements were conducted on seawater-washed cuttings (“bulk cuttings”) in two size fractions of >4 mm and 1-4 mm from 870.5 to 3058.5 mbsf, and hand-picked intact cuttings from the >4 mm size fractions within 1222.5-3058.5 mbsf interval. The bulk cuttings show grain density of ~2.7 g/cm3, bulk density of 1.9 g/cm3 to 2.2 g/cm3, and porosity of 50% to 32%. Compared to the values on bulk cuttings, the intact cuttings show almost the same grain density, but higher bulk density and lower porosity, respectively. Combined with the MAD measurements on hand-picked intact cuttings and discrete core samples from previous expeditions, porosity generally decreases from ~60% to ~20% from the seafloor to 3000 mbsf at Site C0002.\nElectrical conductivity and P-wave velocity on discrete samples, which were prepared from both cuttings and core samples in the depth interval of 1745.5-3058.5 mbsf, range 0.15-0.9 S/m and 1.7-4.5 km/s, respectively. The electrical resistivity on discrete samples is higher than the LWD resistivity data but the overall depth trends are similar. The electrical conductivity and P-wave velocity on discrete samples corrected for in-situ pressure and temperature will be presented.\nThe shipboard physical properties measurements on cuttings are very limited but can be useful with careful treatment and observation.",

The NAME modelling results are compared with airborne measurements of VSLS taken during NASA ATTREX, NCAR CONTRAST and NERC CAST campaigns in January-March, 2014. In this work, the NAME model is used to link the aircraft measurements to examine the vertical distribution of VSLS in the West Pacific troposphere. The major focus will be on assessing vertical transport in deep convection which is one of the crucial factors in redistributing chemicals within the tropical troposphere.\nThe work presented shows the analysis of NAME runs made from the ATTREX flights over the East Pacific in January-February, 2013 and the ATTREX and CONTRAST flight tracks over the West Pacific in January-March, 2014. Each ATTREX 2013 and 2014 flight track is divided into segments, from which particles are released and followed backward to identify the low-level sources of air. Particles (10,000 per single point along the flight track) are released from the flight tracks and followed 12-days backwards. Fractions of trajectories are calculated according to particles which crossed below 5 and 1 km (corresponding to low troposphere and oceanic boundary layer, respectively). Then, initial concentrations for VSLS are assigned to particles which originated from below 5/1 km and final concentrations at flight altitudes are determined based on e-folding equations. Results, obtained by running NAME, are compared with ATTREX VSLS flight measurements.",

            "abstract": "Accurate characterization of uncertainties in precipitation estimates derived from space-borne measurements is critical for many applications including water budget studies or prediction of natural hazards caused by extreme rainfall events. GPM precipitation level II estimates are compared to the NEXRAD-based precipitation estimates derived from NOAA/NSSL’s Multi-Radar, Multisensor (MRMS) platform. The NEXRAD network has undergone an upgrade in technology with dual-polarization capabilities. These new polarimetric variables are being incorporated in MRMS to improve quality control of reflectivity data and to correct for partial beam blockages. The MRMS products, after having been adjusted by rain gauges and passing several quality controls and filtering procedures, are 1) accurate with known uncertainty bounds and 2) measured at a resolution below the pixel sizes of the GPM radar and radiometer observations. They are used by a number of NASA investigators to evaluate level II and level III satellite rainfall algorithms. The at-launch GPM Radiometer algorithm uses matches of coincident overpasses of various radiometers with surface rainfall from the MRMS database developed for the GPM project. Statistics from TRMM level II products serve as a benchmark to evaluate GPM precipitation estimates. Comparisons have been carried out at fine scale (e.g. instantaneous and 5 km for DPR) within a comparison framework developed to examine the consistency of the ground and space-based sensors in term of precipitation detection, characterization (e.g. convective, stratiform) and quantification. Specific error factors for passive (e.g. surface conditions for GMI) and active (e.g. attenuation of the radar signal, non uniform beam filling for DPR) sensors are investigated. Systematic biases and random errors quantified at the satellite estimation scale are useful for satellite-based Level III precipitation products. An online validation tool was designed to provide, for the first time, statistical evaluations and graphical representations of the uncertainties with GPM precipitation estimates over the CONUS. This cross-platform error characterization ultimately acts as a bridge to intercalibrate active and passive microwave measurements from the GPM core satellite to the constellation satellites.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a common component of air pollution and can act as a tracer for other constituents associated with combustion emissions. An approach to unify observations of NO2 tropospheric vertical column densities from three separate satellite instruments (GOME, SCIAMACHY, GOME-2) was used in combination with chemical transport modeling (GEOS-Chem) to produce a global 17-year record of ground-level NO2 at 0.1° x 0.1° resolution. This data set was combined with maps of population density at the same temporal and spatial resolution, allowing a novel exploration of changing human exposure to air pollution worldwide. Population-weighted mean concentrations (PWMC) were calculated by region, and cumulative distribution plots were used to illustrate the changing spatial allocation of NO2 extremes. The most significant decrease in PWMC occurred in North America, with a decline of 60% between 1996 and 2012. This is 1.5 times greater than the rate of decrease in reported total anthropogenic NOx emissions. PWMC have also decreased by 32% in Western Europe, but have increased by 128% in East Asia. Historically, the highest PWMC occurred in Asia Pacific, although levels have decreased by 36% since 1996. However, exposure to the most extreme concentrations has varied by region over time, moving from North America in 1996 to East Asia in 2012. This unique merging of satellite observations, modeled vertical profiles, and population data offers an innovative approach to investigating pollution trends globally and by region that could relate more directly to health cost expectations over other observational datasets alone.",

These new technologies are anticipated to improve measurement accuracies such that: dynamic relative gravimeters would be accurate to < 1 milliGal; static relative gravimeters would be accurate to < 1 microGal; and static absolute gravimeters would be accurate to < 10 nanoGal. With instruments that are sensitive to signals several magnitudes smaller than currently possible, the question arises about which dynamic effects of the natural and manmade environments will affect these more sensitive instruments.\nThis talk will attempt to summarize the current state of knowledge on forces that produce dynamic gravity effects and dynamic forces that could affect the ability to make gravity measurements with new instrumentation at nanoGal levels. Some examples of processes that produce dynamic gravity signals include: earth and ocean tides, fluid withdrawal in the subsurface, atmospheric density changes, earthquakes, and glacial isostatic adjustment. A separate set of dynamic environmental factors affect the ability to make accurate gravity measurements, including: movement of humans or other mass near sensitive instruments, vibrations, vehicle motion for kinematic measurements, environmental forcing on field absolute gravimeters, etc. These effects will be considered for not only their magnitudes, but also their spatial scales (from continental to within the immediate vicinity of the gravity instrument) and their uncertainties. The goal of this work is to provide guidance on which dynamic gravity effects are well known and which are not, as well as what corrections may needed for future gravity measurements.",

            "abstract": "Variograms are widely used in spatial statistics, as a way of examining correlations between points in space, but also have potential for application to temporal data. A variogram provides a robust and flexible way to quantify the temporal dependence (or autocorrelation, i.e. the dependence of flow on a given day with previous days) in daily river flow time series. There are, however, very few published examples of variogram techniques applied to hydrological datasets. The power of the variogram lies in its ability to characterise temporal dependence and, as such, describe the precipitation-to-flow relationship; as this is largely controlled by the catchment characteristics (e.g. elevation, soil type, rock type and land cover), it opens up a range of applications for characterising spatial patterns of streamflow regimes, as well as the dynamics of streamflow over time. This presentation describes a novel variogram-based method for investigating the influence that catchment characteristics have on moderating how streamflow responds to temporal changes in precipitation for a set of 116 catchments from across the UK. In the new approach, catchments are first classified based on the shape of streamflow variograms, with the classes being predictable based on catchment characteristics. The classification method therefore sheds light on how spatial variations in landscape properties influence the precipitation-to-flow relationship, and has significant potential for un-gauged site applications. Temporal variability is then assessed using a moving-window approach to index changes in variogram parameters over time, with a key benefit of the method being that different variogram parameters capture distinct aspects of the changing flow regime. Results demonstrate that precipitation alone cannot explain the variation in flow responses: catchment characteristics have a substantial role in moderating how a river responds to climatic variability, with the findings paving the way for assessments of the varying sensitivity of UK catchments to future streamflow change.",

Due to the critical role of glacier and snow melting as water supply for both food production and hydropower generation in the region (especially during the low flow season), it is important to evaluate the vulnerability of snow and glacier melting streamflow to different climate conditions. In this study, a distributed glacio-hydrologic model with high resolution climate input is developed and calibrated that explicitly simulates all major hydrological processes and the glacier and snow dynamics for area further discretized by elevation bands. The distributed modeling structure and the glacier and snow modules provide a better understanding about how temperature and precipitation alterations are likely to affect current glacier ice reserves. Climate stress test is used to explore changes in the total streamflow change, snow/glacier melting contribution and glacier accumulation and ablation under a variety of different temperature and precipitation conditions.

            "abstract": "Regional and global scale ecosystem models often rely on data from flux towers to simulate the surface-atmosphere exchange of CO2. Such data represent comparatively small source areas (~1 km2) and in many cases exhibit relatively homogeneous land use and surface characteristics. This approach assumes that the small-scale observations yield representative results for larger regions that can be more heterogeneous in terms of land cover, soil moisture, topography and climatology. To complement this data source, aircraft platforms can be used to provide snapshot views of land cover and meteorological properties. Moreover, aircraft provide access to essentially any environment including remote and heterogeneous regions.\nHere, we used an instrumented aircraft platform equipped with a 50 Hz wind probe, Global Navigation Satellite System/Inertial Measurement Unit and a 10 Hz Picarro CO2/H2O analyzer. Applying the eddy-covariance technique, this platform permits determining the surface-atmosphere exchange of heat and CO2 fluxes over larger (~101–102 km2) spatial scales. Specifically, thirty-eight flux measurement experiments were conducted as part of the Airborne Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMOSS) campaigns in July, 2012 and May-August, 2013. Each experiment targeted specific land cover types over and near Howland Forest, ME, Harvard Forest, MA and Duke Forest, NC.\nA footprint parameterization is used to determine the contribution of different surface sources to the flux measurements. The surface area contributing to the measured fluxes is typically on the order of 37 ± 17 km2, with 90% of the contributions being sourced from within an upwind distance of 1.9 ± 0.8 km. Combining the knowledge of these source areas with land cover and soil moisture data from the NASA G-III aircraft enables investigating the influence of surface heterogeneity on the measured fluxes. Lastly, the measured fluxes are compared to simulated CO2 fluxes from the Ecosystem Demography-2 model, which explicitly incorporates spatial variability in many variables including land cover and soil moisture.",

            "abstract": "Our recently proposed ‘multi-method paleointensity approach’ consists of at least IZZI-Thellier, MSP-DSC and pseudo-Thellier experiments, complemented with Microwave Thellier experiments for key flows or ages. All results are scrutinized by strict selection criteria to accept only the most reliable paleointensities. This approach yielded reliable estimates of the paleofield for ~70% of all cooling units sampled on Hawaii – an exceptionally high number for a paleointensity study on lavas. Furthermore the credibility of the obtained results is greatly enhanced if more methods mutually agree with in their experimental uncertainties.\nTo further assess the success rate of this new approach, we applied it to two collections of (sub-)recent lavas from Tenerife and Gran Canaria (20 cooling units), and Terceira (Azores, 18 cooling units). Although the mineralogy and rock-magnetic properties of much of these flows seemed less favorable for paleointensity techniques compared to the Hawaiian samples, again the multi-method paleointensity approach yielded reliable estimates for 60-70% of all cooling units.\nOne of the methods, the newly calibrated pseudo-Thellier method, proved to be an important element of our new paleointensity approach yielding reliable estimates for ~50% of the Hawaiian lavas sampled. Its applicability to other volcanic edifices, however, remained questionable. The results from the Canarian and Azorean volcanic edifices provide further constraints on this method’s potential. For lavas that are rock-magnetically (i.e. susceptibility-vs-temperature behavior) akin to Hawaiian lavas, the same selection criterion and calibration formula yielded successful results - testifying to the veracity of this new paleointensity method.\nBesides methodological advances our new record for the Canary Islands also has geomagnetic implications. It reveals a dramatic increase in the intensity of the Earth’s magnetic field from ~1250 to ~720 BC, reaching a maximum VADM of ~125 ZAm2. Although the maximum field intensity in our record is considerably lower than the maxima in the records reported for the coeval intensity high in the Levant, our new record provides some spatial and temporal constraints for this intriguing and still largely enigmatic geomagnetic phenomenon.",

Data were obtained during different surveys in 2004, 2006 and 2007 on board R/V Vizconde de Eza with a Simrad EM300 multibeam echo-sounder, as part of the CAPESME Project, a collaboration between the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO) and General Secretariat of Fisheries (SGP), aiming at creating maps of the fishing grounds of the Mediterranean continental margins of Spain. The edition of the maps has been carried out within the Complementary Action VALORPLAT (Scientific valorisation of multibeam bathymetry data from the Spanish continental shelf and slope), funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity. Multibeam bathymetry data from the continental shelf obtained within the ESPACE project, also in a cooperative frame between IEO and SGP, completes the whole picture from the coastline to the deep abyssal plain.\nThe map series is constituted by a general map at 1:400,000 scale and 14 detailed maps at 1:75,000 scale, which include inset maps on slope gradients and seafloor nature (rock or sediment type), the later obtained with rock dredges and Shipeck sediment dredges. Both the detailed maps and the general map are available in paper print, and the whole collection is also distributed in an edited USB.\nThe geological features displayed in the different maps include the continental shelf, with abundant geomorphic features indicative of past sea-level changes, the continental slope carved by a large number of submarine canyons and gullies, including Palos, Tiñoso, Cartagena Este, Cartagena Oeste, Águilas, Almanzora, Alias, Garrucha and Gata submarine canyons, the Mazarrón, Palomares and Al-Mansour escarpments of probable tectonic origin, the Abubácer, Maimonides and Yusuf ridges, the Águilas and Al-Mansour seamounts, and the Algero-Balearic abyssal plain where prominent halokinetic deformation structures have been observed.",

            "abstract": "One challenge in geomagnetic data assimilation is that the observational records are relatively short: they are approximately 6 times to the typical time scales of non-dipole geomagnetic field, and approximately 10 times to that of the dipole field. However, surface geomagnetic observations are made at time scales at least three orders of magnitude shorter than those of the geomagnetic secular variation. Therefore, the field and its secular variation (SV), i.e. the rate of changes in time, are “concurrently” measured, allowing us to assimilate both pieces of information into geodynamo modeling. This can be achieved via construction of a new observation operator for the velocity field beneath the CMB, and modification of the existing observation operator for the magnetic field.\nDetermination of the observation operator for the velocity field is very complex, as the constraints from the observed SV are two orders of magnitude less than the velocity field state variables in dynamo simulation. Therefore, it depends on appropriate understanding of the responses of the core flow to the observed SV.\nFor this purpose, we carried out several assimilation experiments with and without assimilation of SV. In particular, the observed SV is only utilized for correcting the model forecasts in the magnetic field, leaving the velocity field forecast unconstrained. Our experiment shows that, the large-scale axisymmetric toroidal velocity responds the strongest to the observed SV, following by a suite of small-scale velocity components (with the span from spherical harmonic degree 10 to 20). The non-axisymmetric part of the poloidal flow is also very sensitive to the SV constraints. However, such responses are more evenly spread out from large to small-scale flow patterns. These assimilation results will be used for construction of the velocity field observational operator, and can be also applied to core-flow inversion studies in general.",

            "abstract": "In the magnetotail, brief periods of fast plasma flow (``bursty bulk flows''--BBFs) provide much of the sunward transport of mass, energy, and magnetic flux. Although usually interpreted as resulting from magnetic reconnection acting in the mid- or more-distant tail, the precise generation mechanism for these flows has never been clearly established. Observationally, a key feature of these flow fronts or jets is that their full cross-tail width in the plasma sheet is of the order of 1--3\nR\nE\n. The present work examines the relative ability of reconnection and ballooning/interchange (BICI) processes to produce such finite-width fronts. 3D particle-in-cell simulations are used to initiate reconnection in finite-width regions of the plasma sheet and to generate BICI heads from regions of the plasma sheet containing a tailward-decreasing entropy profile. For the reconnection jets, the front is observed to expand duskward (in the ion diamagnetic drift direction) to form a structure some 15\nd\ni\nwider than the initial localization width. The BICI heads have a comparable extent. Both types of jets feature abrupt increases in the equatorial\nB\nz\nfield and both tend to break up in\ny\ndue to a secondary interchange instability on a scale of 1--2\nd\ni\n. A distinguishing feature between the two types of jets is that the BICI fronts are preceded by an off-equatorial signal involving wave activity near the ion cyclotron frequency that involves intense (30--50 mV/m) electric fields and magnetic perturbations of the order of 10\\% of the ambient main field. The possibility of producing repeated jets by these mechanisms will be discussed as well.",

            "abstract": "The seismic volcanostratigraphic distribution of breakup magmatic complexes and sub-basalt imaging around ODP Hole 642E provide new constrains on initial breakup processes and the subsequent Vøring Margin evolution. The recovered samples at Hole 642E where interpreted as two distinct volcanic series. The Upper Series, represents a seaward dipping reflector wedge (SDR), of transitional tholeiitic lava flows and thin volcaniclastic sediments. In contrast, the Lower Series is built of evolved dacitic/andicetic flows, some highly depleted sills and thicker interbedded sediments. Downhole geochemical variations based on recent analyses define a decreasing continental crustal influence from continental crustal anatectic melts in the Lower Series to purely MORB-like rocks in the Upper Series.\nThe deep imaging of the Lower Series on reprocessed seismic data allows the definition of a new seismic facies unit characterized by wavy to continuous subparallel reflections with an internal disrupted and hummocky shape. Some borehole samples from this seismic facies unit show hydrothermal alteration and devitrification. This unit is interpreted as subaqueous flows and sills intruded and extruded in wet sediment. The top boundary is defined as a negative polarity reflection interpreted as the K reflector and representing a transition between upper tholeiitic and lower dacitic/andesitic lavas. The base of the facies unit corresponds to the base of the breakup extrusive complexes with a thickness of up to 2 km toward the continent ocean boundary.\nA revised model is suggested, including (1) the pre-breakup Lower Series crustal anatectic melt volcanism, (2) widespread explosive, subaerial volcanism and pyroclastic rock deposits defining the K reflection, (3) the main volcanic breakup stage with intense MORB-like volcanism and large subsidence leading to the built of the SDR wedge, and (4) late breakup volcanism accompanied by jumping of the volcanic activity, the accretion of newly formed oceanic crust with decreasing subsidence. The thicker basaltic rocks correspond to the SDR with local depocenters of more than 6 km documenting spatial variations of melt accommodation. We suggest that the inherited rift geometry controls not only the accommodation space but also the growth of the SDR wedge.",

            "abstract": "The Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other water management agencies have an interest in developing reliable, science-based methods for incorporating climate change information into longer-term water resources planning. Such assessments must quantify projections of future climate and hydrology, typically relying on some form of spatial downscaling and bias correction to produce watershed-scale weather information that subsequently drives hydrology and other water resource management analyses (e.g., water demands, water quality, and environmental habitat). Water agencies continue to face challenging method decisions in these endeavors: (1) which downscaling method should be applied and at what resolution; (2) what observational dataset should be used to drive downscaling and hydrologic analysis; (3) what hydrologic model(s) should be used and how should these models be configured and calibrated? There is a critical need to understand the ramification of these method decisions, as they affect the signal and uncertainties produced by climate change assessments and, thus, adaptation planning.\nThis presentation summarizes results from a three-year effort to identify strengths and weaknesses of widely applied methods for downscaling climate projections and assessing hydrologic conditions. Methods were evaluated from two perspectives: historical fidelity, and tendency to modulate a global climate model’s climate change signal. On downscaling, four methods were applied at multiple resolutions: statistically using Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation, Bias Correction Constructed Analogs, and Asynchronous Regression; dynamically using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Downscaling results were then used to drive hydrologic analyses over the contiguous U.S. using multiple models (VIC, CLM, PRMS), with added focus placed on case study basins within the Colorado Headwaters. The presentation will identify which types of climate changes are expressed robustly across methods versus those that are sensitive to method choice; which method choices seem relatively more important; and where strategic investments in research and development can substantially improve guidance on climate change provided to water managers.",

            "abstract": "Inverse modeling using measurements of ozone (O3) and aerosol is a powerful tool for deriving pollutant emissions. Because they have relatively long lifetimes, O3 and aerosol are transported over large distances. Frequent and globally spaced vertical profiles rather than ground-based measurements alone are therefore highly desired. Three requirements necessary for a successful global monitoring program are: Low equipment cost, low operation cost, and reliable measurements of known uncertainty. Conventional profiling using aircraft provides excellent data, but is cost prohibitive on a large scale. Here we describe a new platform and instruments meeting all three global monitoring requirements. The platform consists of a small balloon and an auto-homing glider. The glider is released from the balloon at about 5 km altitude, returning the light instrument package to the launch location, and allowing for consistent recovery of the payload. Atmospheric profiling can be performed either during ascent or descent (or both) depending on measurement requirements. We will present the specifications for two instrument packages currently under development. The first measures O3, RH, p, T, dry aerosol particle number and size distribution, and aerosol optical depth. The second measures dry aerosol particle number and size distribution, and aerosol absorption coefficient. Other potential instrument packages and the desired spatial/temporal resolution for the GOA2HEAD monitoring initiative will also be discussed.",

One such example is the Lesser Antilles megathrust, which has not produced any large earthquakes in modern times and has been consequently considered largely aseismic. Recent GPS observations also suggest low coupling, but the scarcity of observations in the forearc leaves much of the strain accumulation poorly constrained. Additionally, recent studies elsewhere have revealed that geodetic rates measured over the short instrumental period are not necessarily representative of long-term deformation rates. Historical records of great earthquakes, which were almost certainly megathrust ruptures, demonstrate that the subduction is not entirely aseismic. Using the method of coral microatoll paleogeodesy developed in Sumatra, we examine century-timescale vertical deformation on the forearc islands of the Lesser Antilles and infer the underlying strain accumulation on the megathrust.",

At four study sites within the watershed, terraces were manually mapped to facilitate the comparison between fully and semi-automated DEM-based mapping procedures, including: (1) edge detection functions in Matlab, (2) feature classification algorithms developed by Wood (1996), (3) spatial relationships between interpreted terraces and surrounding topography (Walter et al., 2007), and (4) the TerEx terrace mapping toolbox developed by Stout and Belmont (2014). Each method was evaluated based on its accuracy and ease of implementation. The four study sites have varying longitudinal slope (0.1% – 5%), channel width (<5 m – 30 m), relief in surrounding landscape (15 m – 75 m), type and density of surrounding land use, and mapped surficial geologic units. In general, all methods overestimate terrace areas (average predicted area 136% of the manually defined area). Surrounding topographic relief appears to exert the greatest control on mapping accuracy, with the most accurate results (92% of terrace area mapped by Walter et al., 2007 method) achieved where the river valley was most confined by adjacent hillslopes. Accuracy decreased for study sites surrounded by a low-relief landscape, with the most accurate results achieved by the TerEx toolbox (Stout and Belmont, 2014; predicted areas were 45% and 89% of manual delineations). Our work informs future studies by highlighting the strengths and drawbacks of each method tested and by making recommendations for the types of geomorphic settings where each is most appropriate. The tested algorithms represent powerful new ways to analyze landscape history over large regions using high-resolution, lidar DEMs.",

DataStreme Atmosphere, Ocean, and Earth’s Climate System (ECS) are offered each fall and spring semester by Local Implementation Teams (LITs) across the country in coordination with a team of AMS Education Program scientists and educators who develop instructional materials, provide logistical support to the LITs, and administer the project. The 3-member LITs mentor about 8 teachers and in some instances an emergency manager, per semester through a given DataStreme course. Teachers may receive 3 tuition-free graduate credits through State University of New York’s The College at Brockport upon completion of each DataStreme course.\nDataStreme is in close alignment with A Framework for K-12 Science Education and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Investigating the scientific basis of the workings of Earth’s atmosphere, ocean, and climate system follows the cross-cutting theme of the Framework and the NGSS and is the cornerstone of the DataStreme courses.\nIn particular, DataStreme ECS explores the fundamental science of Earth’s climate system and addresses the societal impacts relevant to today’s teachers and students. The course utilizes resources from respected organizations, such as the IPCC and U.S. Global Change Research Program. Key to the NGSS is that students learn disciplinary core ideas in the context of science and engineering practices. In order for the students to learn in this way, the AMS believes that it is important to train the teachers in this context. DataStreme ECS emphasizes investigation of real-word and current NASA and NOAA data. Participants also are made aware of NASA’s EdGCM, a research-grade Global Climate Model where they can explore various future climate scenarios in the same way that actual research scientists do.\nThe AMS DataStreme Project has received support from the National Science Foundation, NASA, and NOAA. Since 1996, more than 18,000 teachers have completed a DataStreme course, directly impacting hundreds of thousands of additional teachers and more than 1 million students.",

            "abstract": "Toolik Field Station is built on spatially continuous permafrost on the north slope of Alaska. Seasonal surface subsidence and uplift occurs in permafrost regions due to thaw settlement and frost heave as the active layer thaws and refreezes.\nUsing L-band (23.6 cm wavelength) InSAR data from ALOS-PALSAR acquired between 2006 and 2010, we use a small-baseline subset (SBAS) method to estimate seasonal surface subsidence and retrieve fine-resolution maps of active layer thickness (ALT) for a ~25x25 km area surrounding Toolik Field Station (located at 68.63°N, -149.60°E). We compare these remotely sensed ALT (ReSALT) results with in situ data from: 1) the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network showing mean ALT of ~40-50 cm in the region surrounding Toolik Field Station, corresponding to seasonal subsidence of 1 to 2 cm, and 2) mechanical probing measurements of ALT, obtained during field work in the study area in August 2014.\nWe also solve for secular subsidence trends from the InSAR data. The trends are close to zero in most places, but larger subsidence trends in some isolated areas could be due to thermokarst processes (long-term thawing of ice-rich permafrost). We note, however, that downslope motion due to gelifluction cannot be separated from vertical thermokarst-related deformation without incorporating InSAR measurements from multiple look angles.\nTwo key limitations to our method are the spatial variability of volumetric soil moisture content and the accuracy of the DEM needed to correct for topographic effects. We investigate the use of bulk volumetric water content inferred from ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data to improve the ReSALT retrieval algorithm. We also quantify the effect of DEM accuracy on ReSALT uncertainties, leads to requirements for DEM accuracy in InSAR-based ALT retrieval.",

            "abstract": "Several recent studies have suggested that anthropogenic emissions enhance the production of biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Because Manaus, Brazil is an isolated large city within the Amazon rainforest, measurements collected within and outside of the downwind urban plume during the 2014 Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon) campaign (supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation and Measurement program) will provide valuable information needed by regional and global models to evaluate parameterizations of SOA. The isolated urban plume should also provide distinct patterns of mixing with biogenic emissions and eliminate complications of multiple anthropogenic sources found in most other regions of the world. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of preliminary simulations of the transport, mixing, and chemical evolution of the Manaus urban plume from the chemistry version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-Chem) using the available surface and aircraft measurements collected during the first intensive observation period (IOP) of GoAmazon. Simulations are performed using both a 10 km or 2 km grid spacing as well as a newly developed treatment that couples a sectional aerosol model and its parameterization of SOA using a volatility basis set approach with resolved clouds and a sub-grid scale cloud parameterization. Since the first IOP of GoAmazon was conducted during the wet season, shallow and deep convection were observed on most days and likely impacts the transport and vertical mixing of the Manaus plume. Therefore, we are using the available field campaign cloud measurements to evaluate the impact of sub-grid scale clouds on the horizontal and vertical distribution of aerosols. Satellite data is also used to assess the regional variability in simulated clouds and precipitation. Analyses of the simulations during the first IOP will be presented. Simulations with and without anthropogenic emissions will be compared with each other and with measurements to assess how well the current model treatment of SOA represents the observed evolution of organic aerosol within the mixed anthropogenic-biogenic plume downwind of Manaus and biogenic SOA over the pristine environment.",

            "abstract": "We conducted experiments on clay-rich sediments over the effective stress range of 0.1 MPa to 100 MPa and found that critical state friction angle and undrained strength vary systematically as a function of both stress level and sediment composition. We tested sediments from a diverse range of geologic backgrounds using a suite of triaxial systems specially designed for low, medium and high stresses. We used the resedimentation technique to prepare fully saturated samples of identical composition for testing. During the consolidation phase of triaxial tests specimens were subjected to one-dimensional compression, which produces a more realistic stress-strain response during shearing when compared to the more common approach of using isotropic compression. We measured friction angles as low as 12 degrees for a confining pressure of 63 MPa, and observed a decrease of undrained strength ratio by almost two-thirds when viewed over three orders of magnitude in stress. Clay-rich materials, particularly those with a large smectite fraction, display a more rapid decrease in both friction angle and undrained strength ratio with increasing effective stress when compared to more silty materials. We also observed similar trends for the horizontal-to-vertical effective stress ratio (Ko); Ko generally increases with effective stress level during normal compression, and this increase is most pronounced for smectite-rich sediments. We measured values of Ko as high as 0.90 at effective stresses approaching 100 MPa. This finding implies that high horizontal stresses can develop at depth solely due to normal mechanical compression, and that tectonic stresses, creep, or geologic unloading are not necessary to justify them. Furthermore, we establish, for the first time, a general relationship between Ko and the undrained strength of sediments. Higher values of Ko are associated with both lower friction angles and lower undrained strengths. Our experimental results reveal aspects of sediment behavior at high effective stress that have not previously been observed, and provide useful information on how both shear resistance and horizontal stress evolve within basins.",

Its aim is to support the local land use planning authorities through pre-selection of possible sites for thermal, electrical and substantial underground energy storages. Since the extension of renewable energies has become legal requirement in Germany, the underground storing of superfluously produced green energy (such as during a heavy wind event) in the form of compressed air, gas or heated water has become increasingly important. However, the selection of suitable sites is a complex task. The assistance system uses data of geological features such as rock layers, salt caverns and faults enriched with attribute data such as rock porosity and permeability. This information is combined with surface data of the existing energy infrastructure, such as locations of wind and biogas stations, power line arrangement and cable capacity, and energy distribution stations. Furthermore, legal obligations such as protected areas on the surface and current underground mining permissions are used for the decision finding process. Not only the current situation but also prospective scenarios, such as expected growth in produced amount of energy are incorporated in the system. The decision process is carried out via the 'Analytic Hierarchy Process' (AHP) methodology of the 'Multi Object Decision Making' (MODM) approach. While the process itself is completely automated, the user has full control of the weighting of the different factors via the web interface. The system is implemented as an online 3D server GIS environment, with no software needed to be installed on the user side. The results are visualized as interactive 3d graphics. The implementation of the assistance system is based exclusively on free and open source software, and utilizes the 'Python' programming language in combination with current web technologies, such as 'HTML5', 'CSS3' and 'JavaScript'. It is developed at Kiel University for the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany.

            "abstract": "In the western United States, water resource management is increasingly reliant on numerical modeling of hydrological processes, namely snow accumulation and ablation. We seek to advance a framework for providing model diagnostics for such systems by combining an improved understanding of model structural differences (i.e., conceptual vs. physically based) and parameter sensitivities. The two snow models used in this study are SNOW-17, a conceptual degree-day model, and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) snow model, which is physically based and solves the full water and energy balances. To better understand the performance of these models, several approaches will be used. For the conceptual model, global sensitivity analysis methods (e.g., Sobol’ and Method of Morris), and a multi-objective calibration will be applied to identify important parameters and show calibrated parameter values. For the physically based model, we will contribute a novel exploration of some parameters that can be adjusted within the model, including the liquid water holding capacity, the density of newly fallen snow, and the snow roughness. Additionally, the VIC model will be run with explicit radiation inputs at selected sites. For each model run, snow sensitivities and errors (i.e., snow water equivalent results) will be translated into estimated changes in annual water yield for the study areas. Accurately predicting water yield is essential for water management, and it is used here as a practical measure to determine the importance of model parameter sensitivity and calibration. The analysis will be conducted across a range of snow-dominated locations representing a variety of climates across the western United States (e.g. continental, maritime, alpine).",

            "abstract": "The Atacama Fault System (AFS) is an active trench-parallel fault, located above the down-dip end of coupling of the north Chilean subduction zone. About 3 M=7 Earthquakes in the past 10 ky have been documented in the paleoseismological record, demonstrating the potential of large events in the future. To investigate the current surface creep rate and to deduce the mode of strain accumulation, we deployed an array of 11 creepmeters along four branches of the AFS. This array monitors the interaction of earthquake activity on the subduction zone and a trench-parallel fault in the overriding forearc. The displacement across the fault is continuously monitored with 2 samples/min with a resolution of 1μm. Collocated seismometers record the seismicity at two of the creepmeters, whereas control of the regional seismicity is provided by the IPOC Seismological Networks.\nContinuous time series of the creepmeter stations since 2009 show that the shallow segments of the fault do not creep permanently. Instead the accumulation of permanent deformation occurs by triggered slip recorded as well-defined steps caused by local or remote earthquakes. The 2014 Mw=8.2 Pisagua Earthquake, located close to the creepmeter array, triggered large displacement events on all stations. Another event recorded on all stations was the 2010 Mw=8.8 Maule earthquake located 1500km south of the array. All of the stations showed a triggered displacement event 6-8 min after origin time of the main shock, at the same time as the arrival of the surface waves recorded at nearby IPOC stations. This points to a dynamic triggering process caused by transient stresses during passage of the surface wave. Investigation of seismic events with Magnitudes <6 show displacement events triggered during P and S wave passage, pointing to static as well as dynamic stress changes for proximal events.\nAnalyzing the causative earthquakes we find that the most effective way to trigger displacement events on the AFS are deep (>100km) earthquakes on the subduction zone interface up to 300 km east of the array. Earthquakes located to the west of the AFS on the locked part of the subduction zone interface rarely trigger displacement events on the AFS. Only if such events are as large as the Pisagua Earthquake or its Mw= 7,6 aftershock, they trigger large displacement events.",

This is not the first time this question has been asked of this particular system of irrigated agriculture? \"Insurmountable\" ecological barriers have been eyed down and promptly obliterated through magnificent features of physical and social engineering.\nBut lets us consider for a moment that we have at last reached some sort of edge, a threshold past which we experience a sudden socioecological regime shift.\nStaring out over this edge can we begin to come to terms with the fallacies of our stories, our ignorance, our foolishness?\nWe need an acknowledgement of the needs of the agriculture systems, it’s connections and dependencies. What desperate measures are we willing to take in order to sustain this system? How much further can we go? How far is too far? Is there another way to produce and distribute food?\nWe then turn to the past. We imagine the ecosystem as it once was. The pelagic fish species that formed the biological connection between this river system, the delta, the Ocean, the Mountains. What would it mean to restore this diversity and repair these relationships? What would it take to cede control to the non-human forces that sustain these connections?\nHow do we reconcile restraint and the cessation of control with the human needs of the system? How do we rewild our river in such a way that our needs are met in a way that is more resilient and equitable?\nWe will need systems of agriculture and flood control that serve multiple functions. We will need to seek the synergies between objectives which had previously been viewed as mutually exclusive or in conflict. We will fail. We will need to take a hard look at our failures, comparing them to those of past eras, seeking out novel pathways out of our conjunctures.",

            "abstract": "Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) waves - such as standing Alfven waves - are one mechanism for coupling the inner magnetosphere to the Earth’s ionosphere. For example, they transfer energy from the solar wind or ring current into the Earth's ionosphere via Joule heating. In this study, we use NASA Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) satellite data to investigate the spatial, frequency, and geomagnetic activity dependence of the ULF wave Poynting vector (electromagnetic energy flux) mapped to the ionosphere. We use these measurements to estimate Joule heating rates. We compare these rates to empirical models of Joule heating associated with large scale, static (on ULF wave timescales) current systems, finding that ULF waves usually contribute little to the global, integrated Joule heating rate. However, there are extreme cases when ULF waves make significant contributions to global Joule heating. Finally, we find ULF waves routinely make significant contributions to local Joule heating rates near the noon and midnight local time sectors, where static current systems nominally contribute less to Joule heating; the most important contributions come from lower frequency (<7 mHz) waves.",

            "abstract": "The onset of the Amazon rainy season shows a large temporal and spatial variability, delays on the date of the onset will have strong impacts on local agriculture, hydroelectric power generation as well as on the hydrology of large rivers. Two “once-in-a-century” droughts occurred in 2005 and 2010, and it was shown that in those events the rainy season started later than normal, and also that on the last 10 years the dry season has increased in length by about one month. These events highlight the urgency for improving our understanding and capability to model onset of the rainy season and drought variability, for the present and future. Most studies have attributed the variability of the rainy season onset over Amazonia to the variability of the tropical oceans whether other factors, such as climate change, land use and aerosols also contribute to the variability are not clear..\nGlobal climate models run on seasonal climate forecast mode still show large uncertainties on the prediction of onset of seasonal rains. As for climate change, the CMIP3 and CMIP5 appear to underestimate the past variability, and also project virtually no future change of the onset of rainy season over the Amazon even when they are forced by strong greenhouse forcing under the RCP8.5 emission scenario. Why these models underestimate the variability of the rainy season onset, and whether this bias implies an underestimate of sensitivity of their dry season length to anthropogenic radiative forcing remain unclear.\nThis FAPESP DOE grant 2013/50538 aims to explore use of the measurements provided by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facilities (AMF)-GoAmazon and the Cloud processes of the main precipitation systems in Brazil (CHUVA) Field Experiments, along with global and regional model experiments, to explore the sources of the above described uncertainty. The project will address several issues, i.e. the inadequate representation of the types of convection (i.e., maritime versus continental) and their relationships to aerosols, land surface and atmospheric circulation as represented in climate models We will present our initial results addressing the factors that control the variability of the wet season onset over Amazonia, the influence of convective types on atmospheric diabatic heating based on GoAmazon and CHUVA.",

Advanced Intensity-Modulated Continuous-Wave (IM-CW) lidar techniques are investigated as a means of facilitating CO2 measurements from space to meet the ASCENDS measurement requirements. In recent numerical, laboratory and flight experiments we have successfully used the Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation technique to uniquely discriminate surface lidar returns from intermediate aerosol and cloud contamination. We demonstrate the utility of BPSK to eliminate sidelobes in the range profile as a means of making Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) column CO2 measurements in the presence of optically thin clouds, thereby eliminating the need to correct for sidelobe bias errors caused by the clouds. Furthermore, high accuracy and precision ranging to the surface as well as to the top of intermediate cloud layers, which is a requirement for the inversion of column CO2 number density measurements to column CO2 mixing ratios, has been demonstrated using new hyperfine interpolation techniques that takes advantage of the periodicity of the modulation waveforms. This approach works well for both BPSK and linear swept-frequency modulation techniques. The BPSK technique under investigation has excellent auto-correlation properties while possessing a finite bandwidth. A comparison of BPSK and linear swept-frequency is also discussed in this paper.",

            "abstract": "The displacement of a fluid by another in porous media is affected by the wetting properties of the medium. While the wettability can vary significantly, its impact is poorly understood. Here, we study the effect of wettability on the invasion patterns via a pore-scale model. We simulate the invasion of an inviscid fluid into a medium saturated with a viscous fluid, for various contact angles and injection rates. We show that increasing the contact angle (making the invading fluid more wetting) stabilizes the invasion front. In particular, at low injection rates, the invasion pattern becomes compact despite of the large, unfavorable viscosity ratio. These results compare favorably with experiments, in which air is injected in a Hele-Shaw cell filled with chemically-treated glass beads and saturated with water/glycerol. Our simulations suggest that the stabilization of the invasion front is due to the increasing dominance of cooperative, non-local invasion mechanisms. For nonwetting invasion (small contact angles, or drainage), the dominant mechanism is Haines jumps, which are controlled by the local pressure drop across individual menisci, whereas for wetting invasion (large contact angles, or imbibition) the stability of individual menisci depends on adjacent parts of the interface.",

            "abstract": "Floodplains are extremely heterogeneous landscapes with respect to soil and sediment composition and can present an important source of carbon (C) during floods. For example, stream bank soils and sediments are zones of active erosion and deposition of sediment associated C. Due to the presence of plants, riparian soils contain high amounts of C that is exchanged between stream waters and banks. Abandoned channels and meander wetlands that remain hydrologically connected to the main channel contain high amounts of organic matter that can be flushed into the stream during high discharge.\nThis heterogeneity, result of floodplain geomorphology, land cover and use, can profoundly impact the amount and type of dissolved organic matter (DOM) introduced into streams. In order to assess DOM characteristics leached from heterogeneous floodplain soils, aqueous soil extracts were performed on soil samples representative of different land covers (n=20) at four depths. Extracts were analyzed for dissolved organic C and total dissolved nitrogen with a Shimadzu C analyzer. Colored dissolved organic matter characteristics was measured with the Aqualog Fluorescence Spectrometer and quantified with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC).\nPreliminary data from three floodplains in Vermont (Connecticut, Missisquoi and Mad River) show a 3D variability of longitudinal, lateral, and vertical extents on water-extractable, mobile C. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations in meander swamp samples were found up to 9 times higher than in those of soils from agricultural field indicative of an important C source. Although C concentrations in adjacent fields were low, high abundance of labile C (indicated by tryptophan-like fluorescence) in water extracts from fields indicates recent biological production of C. This labile C is easily processed by microbes and transformed to the greenhouse gas CO2. These results provide important information on the contribution and lability of different floodplain areas (banks, riparian areas and meander wetlands) to C export and can help to make predictions for their export during flooding.",

            "abstract": "Over the last 5 years, the Interstellar Boundary EXplorer (IBEX) has made continuous measurements of hydrogen energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) created by the solar wind-local interstellar medium (SW-LISM) interaction. In particular, this includes observations of the IBEX \"ribbon,\" a feature of enhanced flux encircling the sky. With a half solar cycle of observations, IBEX has shown the ribbon is a strong and dynamic feature of the measurements. This suggests a relatively local generation mechanism for the ribbon, such as the \"secondary ENA\" mechanism, where primary ENAs from inside the heliosphere undergo multiple charge-exchange events outside the heliopause, creating secondary ENAs that may be detected at 1 AU. We will present time-dependent simulation results of IBEX measurements, particularly the ribbon flux simulated using the secondary ENA mechanism. These results are computed by implementing a dynamic solar cycle in our 3D, time-dependent, MHD/kinetic code. We show results of the ribbon flux simulated between 2009 and 2017. While IBEX has provided us with key observations over the past 5 years, future measurements by the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) will allow us to look at the evolution of the ribbon over an extended period with higher resolution, which may finally enable us to determine the origin of the ribbon.",

This 8-week long program is designed for mid-career graduate students in related fields to come to LANL, receive lectures on space physics and space environment topics, and carry out a research project under the mentorship of LANL staff members. On average we have accepted ~10 students per year to the program, with a strong applicant pool to choose from. This type of summer school program is relatively unique in the space physics community—there are several other summer schools but they are of shorter duration and do not include the mentor-research project aspect which builds a strong one-on-one connection between the summer student and his/her LANL mentor(s). From the LANL perspective, this program was intended to have several benefits including building collaborations between LANL staff and universities and recruitment of potential postdocs. From the student perspective, this program is not only an educational opportunity but a strong networking opportunity and a chance to enhance their professional skills and publication record. Students are permitted to work on projects directly related to their thesis or on projects in areas that are completely new to them. At the end of the summer school, the students also develop their presentation skills by preparing and giving 20 min presentations on their research projects to the research group. Over the past four years the summer school has increased in popularity, and the feedback from the student participants has been very positive. Alumni of the program have continued collaborations with their mentors, resulting in publications and conference presentations, and one postdoc hire to date.",

While it is known that PDCs can surmount barriers by converting kinetic energy into potential energy, the signature of topography on PDC dynamics is unclear. To examine the interplay between PDCs and topography, we turbulently suspended heated and ambient-temperature 20 μm talc powder in air within an 8.5 x 6.1 x 2.6 m tank. Experimental parameters (Froude number, densimetric and thermal Richardson number, particle Stokes and Settling numbers) were scaled such that the experimental currents were dynamically similar to natural PCS. The Reynolds number, however, is much smaller than in natural currents, but still large enough for the flows to be turbulent. We placed cylindrical and ridge-like objects in the path of the currents, illuminated the currents with orthogonal laser sheets, and recorded each experiment with high definition cameras. We observed currents surmounting ridge-like barriers (barrier height = current height). Slanted ridges redirected the currents upward and parallel to the upstream face of the ridges (~45° from horizontal). Down stream of the slanted ridges, ambient-temperature currents reattached to the floor. By comparison, hot currents reversed buoyancy and lifted off. These observations suggest that obstacles enhance air entrainment, a process key to affecting runout distance and the depletion of fine particles in ignimbrites. Moreover, we observed vortex shedding in the wake of cylinders. Our experiments demonstrate that barriers of various shapes affect PDC dynamics and can shorten PDC runout distances. Understanding the effects of topography on PDCs is required for interpreting many deposits because processes such as vortex shedding and topographically-induced changes in turbulent length scales and entrainment likely leave depositional signatures.",

            "abstract": "We evaluate proxy reconstructions of Holocene records precipitation in the North American Monsoon region (SW US and northern Mexico) and regions to the south (southern Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean). Seventy-seven precipitation records are tabulated at 2-3 kyr increments for the past 12 kyr, with results displayed mainly on maps. Sites currently dominated by summer precipitation, coupled with proxy records that distinguish summer vs. winter vegetation are used to estimate summer precipitation. Resulting patterns of precipitation variability are evaluated against SST reconstructions from surrounding tropical seas -eastern tropical Pacific, Gulf of California (GoC), Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico (GoM), which are source areas for summer precipitation.\nDuring the Younger Dryas, ca. 12 ka, widespread drying in southern regions contrasted with evidence for wetter conditions in multiple records from the SW US. By 9 ka wetter conditions had spread to the southern regions, likely reflecting an increased Caribbean low-level jet associated with an enhanced Bermuda High. Pacific westerlies contributed significant winter precipitation to the southwestern US and northernmost Mexico at 9 ka. The modern geographical pattern of summer precipitation was established by 6 ka, as the Bermuda High moved northward following the demise of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. SSTs in the GoC and GoM increased, and the NAM strengthened. Increased regional precipitation differences are apparent by 4 ka, likely reflecting enhanced ENSO variability. Most of the southern region experienced increased precipitation during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), whereas winter drought dominated in the north. In contrast, much of the Little Ice Age (LIA) was characterized by generally drier conditions in Central America and Mexico, with wetter conditions in the SW US. Results are broadly supportive of enhanced La Niña-like conditions during the MCA vs. increased ENSO variability during the LIA.",

We reconstruct patterns of δ13C change in 1-kyr timeslices from 2-24 kyr ago. Principal component analysis reveals the primary modes of deep water circulation change and their links to millennial-scale climate change. 3D visualization tools assist in the interpretation of benthic δ13C spatial patterns with respect to complex basin geometry (e.g. East vs. West Atlantic).

            "abstract": "High wintertime ozone concentrations in rural areas associated with oil and gas development and high particulate concentrations in urban areas have become topics of increasing concern in the Western United States, as both primary and secondary pollutants become trapped within stable wintertime boundary layers. While persistent cold air pools that enable such poor wintertime air quality are typically associated with high pressure aloft and light winds, the complex physical processes that contribute to the formation, maintenance, and decay of persistent wintertime temperature inversions are only partially understood. In addition, obtaining sufficiently accurate numerical weather forecasts and meteorological simulations of cold air pools for input into chemical models remains a challenge.\nThis study examines the meteorological processes associated with several wintertime pollution episodes in Utah's Uintah and Salt Lake Basins using numerical Weather Research and Forecasting model simulations and observations collected from the Persistent Cold Air Pool and Uintah Basin Ozone Studies. The temperature, vertical structure, and winds within these cold air pools was found to vary as a function of snow cover, snow albedo, land use, cloud cover, large-scale synoptic flow, and episode duration. We evaluate the sensitivity of key atmospheric features such as stability, planetary boundary layer depth, local wind flow patterns and transport mechanisms to variations in surface forcing, clouds, and synoptic flow. Finally, noted deficiencies in the meteorological models of cold air pools and modifications to the model snow and microphysics treatment that have resulted in improved cold pool simulations will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Many of the periodic variations observed in Saturn’s magnetosphere can be linked directly to the presence of a rotating pattern of field-aligned currents that link the northern and southern ionospheres with each other and with the magnetosphere. Such a current system is incorporated in a magnetohydrodynamic simulation that has previously been shown to reproduce many of the observed periodic properties of the system (Jia et al., 2012; Jia and Kivelson, 2012). Here the simulation is used to investigate a range of phenomena that can be attributed to the effects of compressional waves launched from the rotating current sources. The compressional waves are found to drive the flapping of the plasma sheet and the expansion and contraction of the magnetopause in each rotation period. Because the compressional perturbations weaken as they rotate from morning to evening around the day side of the magnetosphere, the boundary develops a strong morning-evening asymmetry. A fit to the shape is provided that may be useful in further investigation of magnetopause properties, but there is already evidence of the proposed asymmetry in the Cassini observations of Clarke et al. [2010].",

Among the challenges we are facing are the difficulties incorporating differing resolution and quality surface measurements to adjust gridded estimates of precipitation. Another challenge is the type of adjustment technique. After assessing the bias and applying reduction or elimination techniques, we are investigating the kriging method and its variants such as simple kriging (SK), ordinary kriging (OK), and conditional bias-penalized Kriging (CBPK) among others. In addition we hope to generate estimates of uncertainty for the gridded estimate. In this work the methodology is presented as well as a comparison between the radar-only product and the final multi-sensor QPE product. The comparison is performed at various time scales from the sub-hourly, to annual.

            "abstract": "Melting of submerged marine glacier termini can impact the dynamics of ice flow, and hence provides a key control on the ocean forcing of ice sheets and potential sea-level rise. Melting rates are controlled by the supply of heat and salt to the ice-ocean interface, which depend on both the details of turbulence and the temperature and salinity conditions in the neighbouring ocean. One such feedback on ice melting comes from the buoyancy-driven flow of fresh meltwater rising along the ice face at a steep glacier terminus. The strength of this flow and resulting melting rates are sensitive to the vertical stratification of temperature and salinity in the neighbouring ocean. To build theoretical insight into the role of ocean stratification, we apply a plume model to describe buoyancy-driven flow along planar ice faces sitting in a stratified ocean. A range of background ocean temperature and salinity profiles are studied. Our plume model considers both persistent flows that rise to the ocean surface, or layered flows featuring multiple intrusions into the background ocean, with intrusions occurring after the plume density reaches a neutral buoyancy level compared to the background ocean density stratification. For flows with negligible subglacial discharge into a linear stratification, we theoretically derive approximate scaling laws for the dependence of melting rates on the temperature and salinity stratifications. The scaling laws are in good agreement with results from numerical simulations. Under appropriate conditions, these scaling laws may provide a computationally-efficient approximation to the rate of glacier terminus melting controlled by buoyancy-driven flows, in circumstances where the use of a more detailed ocean model proves impractical.",

While satellite-based remote sensing provides global coverage of falling snow events, the science is relatively new and retrievals are still undergoing development with challenges and uncertainties remaining. This work reports on the development and early post-launch testing of retrieval algorithms for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission Core Observatory satellite launched in February 2014. In particular, we will report on GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) radiometer instrument algorithm performance with respect to falling snow detection and estimation.\nThroughout 2014, the at-launch GMI precipitation algorithms, based on a Bayesian framework, have been used with the new GPM data. The Bayesian framework for GMI retrievals is dependent on the a priori database used in the algorithm and how profiles are selected from that database. Our work has shown that knowing if the land surface is snow-covered, or not, can improve the performance of the algorithm. Improvements were made to the algorithm that allow for daily inputs of ancillary snow cover values and also updated Bayesian channel weights for various surface types.\nWe will evaluate the algorithm that was released to the public in July 2014 and has already shown that it can detect and estimate falling snow. Performance factors to be investigated include the ability to detect falling snow at various rates, causes of errors, and performance for various surface types. A major source of ground validation data will be the NOAA NMQ dataset. We will also provide qualitative information on known uncertainties and errors associated with both the satellite retrievals and the ground validation measurements. We will report on the analysis of our falling snow validation completed by the time of the AGU conference.",

In the past several decades, numerous Re-Os data of magmatic iron meteorites have been published, but few for nonmagmatic iron meteorites. The nonmagmatic iron meteorites experienced incomplete melt, therefore they cannot represent the asteroidal core samples. It is ambiguous question for the origin and crystallization process of nonmagmatic iron meteorites. In this study, 10 iron meteorites have been analyzed by the high-precision NTIMS (TRITON) Faraday cup static measurement through using isotopic dilution method. Among 10 iron meteorites studied here, 3 samples of group ⅢAB and one sample of group ⅢE belong to magmatic iron meteorites. Another 3 samples of groupⅠAB and 3 samples of group ⅢCD are nonmagmatic iron meteorites. The precision is ≤ 20 ppm 2σ for 187Os/188Os and blank of Re and Os is < 80 pg.\nIn the 187Os/188Os, 187Re/188Os isochron diagram, the 3 ⅢAB and a ⅢE samples define a straight best-fit line corresponding to a slope of 0.07917±0.00062 and an intercept with the vertical axis of 0.09575±0.00038. The rang of 187Re/188Os ratios is from 0.460391 to 0.691148. Application of a λ for 187Re=1.666×10－11 yr－1 yields an age of 4590±37 Ma. In error rang, this age is consistent with reported Re-Os isochron age of 4558±12 Ma. The large uncertainty likely result from small number data.\n3 samples of groupⅠAB in this study produce a slope of 0.07904±0.00011, and initial 187Os/188Os of 0.09663±0.00005, corresponding to T=4582.6±6.4Ma, which is older than the published data for theⅠA, 4529±23Ma, and 4537±21 Ma. Another 3 samples of group ⅢCD also defined a slop of 0.07315±0.00073, and initial 187Os/188Os of 0.09873±0.00038, the age calculation is 4253±44 Ma. 187Os/188Os ratios vary rather narrow (the biggest difference is 0.087) in the 6 nonmagmatic iron meteorites, which lead to increase the uncertainty of the ages. But one thing can be known that the crystallization of ⅠAB is earlier than ⅢCD. The distribution of Re and Os concentration also shows same compositional feature. More Re-Os data of nonmagmatic iron are required in order to better understand their precision isochron and evolution history in future study.",

            "abstract": "Quick-clays are characterized by an highly unstable particle structure. This structure is usually caused by freshwater leaching of the original high salinity pore water generated by the former marine deposition environment. Given this instability, the clay structure can easily collapse leading to landslides of varying destructiveness. It is, therefore, of major importance to detect the presence of quick-clays. While resistivity based methodologies are commonly used to detect them (lower conductivity of the leached interstitial fluid in respect to the original one) there are also some evidences that leaching can result in a reduction of the undisturbed shear strength of these clays. Multiple integrated shear wave velocity based seismic methods (mainly SH seismic reflection and Love wave dispersion data) have been therefore applied in a case study to evaluate the potential of shear wave velocity imaging for detecting quick clays.\nAn area near the Göta River in southwest Sweden, which was the scene of a quick clay landslide about 40 years ago, was chosen as experimental site. High-resolution SH reflection data were acquired in the area, as part of a joint project studying clay-related landslides. Seismic reflection processing has evidenced several geologically interesting interfaces related to the presence of quick clays (locally confirmed by boreholes), and sand-gravelly layers strongly contributing to water circulation within them. Dispersion data have been extracted along one of the reflection arrays with a Gaussian windowing approach, and data have been inverted with a Laterally Constrained Inversion using a priori information coming from the seismic reflection imaging. The inversion of dispersion curves has evidenced, in some portion of the seismic line, the presence of a low velocity layer most probably correlatable with quick clays.\nEven given the limited dispersion information extracted from the dataset, and the not yet completely understood shear wave velocity properties of quick clays, our work has evidenced the potential of the proposed approach for a more comprehensive imaging of the shear wave velocity distribution. This could be a valuable approach in quick clay identification in general.",

            "abstract": "As the first large subduction thrust earthquake off the coast of western Guatemala in the past several decades, the 07 November 2012 Mw=7.4 earthquake offers the first opportunity for a geodetic study of coseismic and postseismic behavior for a segment of the Middle America trench where frictional coupling makes a transition from weak coupling off the coast of El Salvador to strong coupling in southern Mexico. We use measurements at 19 continuous GPS sites in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Mexico to estimate the coseismic slip and post-seismic deformation of the November 2012 Champerico (Guatemala) earthquake. Coseismic offsets range from ~47 mm near the epicenter to <1 mm at far-field sites in El Salvador. An inversion of the geodetic data indicate that that up to ~2 m of coseismic slip occurred on a ~30 km by 30 km rupture area between ~10 and 30 km depth, encouragingly close to the global CMT epicenter. The geodetic moment of 13 x 1019 N·m and corresponding magnitude of 7.4 both agree well with independent seismological estimates. An inversion for the postseismic fault afterslip shows that the transient postseismic motions recorded at 11 GPS sites are well fit with a logarithmically decaying function. More than 70 per cent of the postseismic slip occurred at the same depth or directly downdip from the main shock epicenter. At the upper limit, afterslip that occurred within 6 months of the earthquake released energy equivalent to only ~20 per cent of the coseismic moment. The seismologically derived slip solution from Ye et al. (2012), which features more highly concentrated slip than our own, fits our GPS offsets reasonably well provided that we translate their slip centroid ~51 km to the west to a position close to our own slip centroid. The geodetic and seismologic slip solutions thus suggest bounds of 2-5 m for the peak slip along a region of the interface no larger than 30 x 30 km and possibly much smaller.",

            "abstract": "The idea to use the radio waves to study the interiors of comets or asteroids appeared in the late eighties. The CONSERT experiment was accepted for the ROSETTA mission and it will provide information about the deep interior of the comet (Kofman et al, 1998, 2007). The CONSERT instrument is an original concept of the bistatic radar based on the propagation throughout the nucleus while the classical radars are based on the reflection. In this experiment, an electromagnetic signal is transmitted between the lander, located on the comet surface, and the orbiter. The transmitted signal will be measured as a function of time and as a function of the relative position of the orbiter and the lander for a number of orbits. Any signal that has propagated through the medium contains information concerning this medium. The CONSERT will start to operate in November 2014, we will show during this conference some preliminary results. On the CONSERT experiment example and on the Assert radar proposed for Marco-Polo mission (Herique, Agu 2011, IAA 2011) we discuss the main advantages and difficulties of the techniques using radio waves to study the interior of asteroids and comets. The capacity of radar technique to do the tomography of the interior of the asteroids and comets is emphasized.",

            "abstract": "For several decades Puerto Rico’s coastal and marine ecosystems (CMEs) have suffered the effects of anthropogenic stresses associated to population growth and varying land use. Coral reefs, for instance, have been impacted by sedimentation, increased eutrophication, and coastal water contamination. Here we present an overview of a new NASA project to study human impacts in two priority watersheds (Manatí and Guánica). The project uses an interdisciplinary approach that includes historic and recent remote sensing analysis and hydrological, ecological and socio-economic modeling to provide a multi-decadal assessment of change in coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves and sandy beaches. The project’s main goal is to evaluate the impacts of land use/land cover changes on the quality and extent of CMEs in priority watersheds in the north and south coasts of Puerto Rico. Methods include assessments of coral reefs benthic communities cover, monitoring of short- and long-term beach geomorphological changes associated with riverine and sediment input, calculation of the economical value of selected CMEs, establish permanent monitoring transects in never before studied coral reef areas, provide recommendations to enhance current coastal policy management practices, and disseminate the results to local stakeholders. This project will include imagery from the Operational Land Imager of Landsat 8 to assess coastal ecosystems extent. Habitat and species distribution maps will be created by incorporating field and remotely-sensed data into an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis. The social component will allow us to study the valuation of specific CMEs attributes from the stakeholder’s point of view. Our results and the generality of the methodology will provide for its application to other similar tropical locations.",

            "abstract": "The aqueous phase photochemical reactions of constituents present in atmospheric water like H2O2, NO3-, NO2- and Fe(III) aqua-complexes or organic complexes can form radicals such as the hydroxyl radical HO within the water drop. However, the literature lacks of data precising the rate of HO formation and the relative contribution of the photochemical sources of HO. The production of radicals in cloud aqueous phase drives the oxidative capacity of the cloud medium and the efficiency of organic matter oxidation. The oxidation of organic compounds is suspected to lead to oxygenated species that could contribute to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass (Ervens et al., 2011).\nIn current cloud chemistry models, HO concentrations strongly depend on the organic and iron amount. For high concentrations of organic compounds, this radical is efficiently consumed during the day due to the oxidation process. When iron concentrations are typical from continental cloud, the photolysis of Fe(III) complexes and the Fenton reaction drive the HO concentrations in the cloud models.\nThe concept of biocatalysed reactions contributing to atmospheric chemistry as an alternative route to photochemistry is quite new (Vaïtilingom et al., 2013); it emerged from the recent discovery of metabolically active microorganisms in clouds. Microorganisms are well-known to degrade organic matter but they could also interact with oxidant species such as H2O2 (or their precursors) thanks to their oxidative and nitrosative stress metabolism that will act directly on these species and on their interactions with iron (metalloproteins and siderophores).\nFor the moment, biological impact on radical chemistry within cloud has not been yet considered in cloud chemistry models. Bacterial activity will be introduced as catalysts in a multiphase cloud chemistry model using degradation rates measured in the laboratory. For example, biodegradation rates of the oxidants H2O2 by model bacteria will be tested in the model. Interactions of bacteria with iron through siderophore production will be also parameterized in the model. For this, we will perform idealistic scenarii to quantify the effect of bacteria on the aqueous budget of oxidants.\nErvens et al., ACP, 11, 11069-11102, 2011.\nVaïtilingom et al., PNAS, 110-2, 559-564, 2013.",

            "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown the enormous potential of the compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) for studying the biodegradation of organic compounds such as monoaromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), chlorinated solvents and other organic contaminants and environmental transformation mechanisms in groundwater. In addition, two-dimensional isotope analysis such as carbon and hydrogen have been successfully studied indicating the potential to also investigate site-specific reaction mechanisms. The main objective of the current study however is to quantify real effective in situ biodegradation rate constants in a coal-tar contaminated aquifer by combining compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) and tracer-based (3H-3He) ground-water dating (TGD). Hence, groundwater samples are used to determine groundwater residence times, and carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes are analyzed for selected BTEX and PAH. The results of the hydrogen stable isotopes surprisingly indicate no isotope fractionation and therefore no biodegradation. In contrast, for stable carbon isotopes of selected BTEX such as o-xylene and toluene, isotope shifts are detected indicating active biodegradation under sulfate-reducing conditions. These and previous results of stable carbon isotopes show that only for o-xylene a clear evidence for biodegradation is possible for the studied site. Nevertheless, in combining these results with the groundwater residence times, which range between 1 year for the shallow wells (20 m below surface) and 41 years for the deeper wells (40 m below surface), it is feasible to effectively determine in situ biodegradation rate constants for o-xylene. Conversely, the outcome also evidently demonstrate the major limitations of the novel combined isotope approach for a successful implementation of monitored natural attenuation (MNA) at such field sites.",

            "abstract": "Geologic carbon storage in deep saline reservoirs is a promising technology for reducing anthropogenic emissions into the atmosphere. Dissolution of injected CO2 into resident brines is one of the primary trapping mechanisms generally considered necessary to provide long-term storage security. Given that diffusion of CO2 in brine is woefully slow, convective dissolution, driven by a small increase in brine density with CO2 saturation, is considered to be the primary mechanism of dissolution trapping. Previous studies of convective dissolution have typically only considered the convective process in the single phase region below the gas-water contact (GWC) and have ignored the over-lying two-phase region where dissolution actually takes place. Our objective is to improve estimates of the long-term dissolution rate of CO2 into brine by including the two-phase region above the gas-water contact in model simulations. In the two-phase model, there is a capillary transition zone above the GWC over which the brine saturation decreases with increasing elevation. Our simulations show that when the capillary fringe height is small, which corresponds to very low entry pressure, assuming CO2-saturated brine in the two-phase region is well-motivated, as has been assumed in analyses of dissolution without the capillary transition. For typical finite entry pressures, the fringe thickness is finite and upwelling convection currents of fresh, un-carbonated brine must extend above the GWC to saturate the brine with CO2. Our results show the long-term dissolution rate can be enhanced by greater than 3 times the dissolution rates derived from ignoring the capillary transition zone. The single-phase, closed-top dissolution rate is recovered in the limit of vanishing entry pressure.\nThis material is based upon work supported as part of the Center for Frontiers of Subsurface Energy Security, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences under Award Number DE-SC0001114.

            "abstract": "The number of hydraulically active fractures serving as advective contaminant migration pathways facilitating plume migration in fractured rock aquifers cannot be determined with confidence from indirect means such as visual inspection of core, borehole geophysics, and is only inferred from hydraulic tests. However, the position of depth-discrete hydraulic activity may be determined using contaminants or heat as tracers yet spatially detailed profile measurement techniques are required without imparting measurement bias of an open borehole. Contaminant concentration profiles from numerous samples along continuous core from a site contaminated since the early 1980’s and heat injection in the sealed boreholes with high resolution profile monitoring are used to characterize the fracture network .\nHeat pulse tests using active distributed temperature sensing (DTS) were conducted in coreholes sealed with an impermeable flexible liner manufactured by FLUTe (Santa Fe, NM) to detect hydraulically active fracture zones. Using a Silixa ULTIMA-HSTM DTS, temperature data was acquired every 12.6 cm along an optic fiber cable with a spatial resolution of 29 cm. Temperature precision is on the order of 0.02°C for averaged measurements collected over 5 minute intervals. The test consisted of heating the measurement cable for 4 hours and monitoring the cooling process for over 8 hours. The resulting dataset consists of high-resolution temperature profiles at five-minute time steps during the test period. Dolostone rock composes most of the lithology units of the corehole, therefore it is unlikely that there are significant variations in rock thermal diffusivity.\nMultiple, successive temperature profiles were used to identify depth-discrete, hydraulically active flow zones with varying transmissivity based on different rates of heat dissipation. These variations were then compared with independent datasets including detected concentrations of contaminants in numerous rock core samples with depth, visual indication of staining on fracture surfaces in rock core logs, fracture size and intensity identified in the ATV log, and variability in borehole high hydraulic conductivity by continuous packer testing and T-profiling methods.",

            "abstract": "The extratropical jets moderate the connection between the tropics and mid-to-high latitudes by acting as waveguides and by influencing the development of transient and quasi-stationary Rossby waves. Tropical diabatic heating (thermal driving) helps set the mean strength and variability of the jets by driving the thermally direct Hadley circulation, which transports momentum out of the tropics. Understanding the relative importance of thermal driving and its relationship to the jets is challenging because of geographic differences from sector to sector, and variability over a wide range of time scales. Using the ERA-Interim reanalysis, we calculate a thermal driving index to quantify the relationship between diabatic heating and wintertime jet variability in the Northern Hemisphere. ERA-Interim is restricted to the satellite interval, which is an important consideration for accurately capturing tropical variability. We document clarified results relative to previous analyses based on the ERA-40 reanalysis.\nRegressions of zonal mean zonal wind anomalies onto the thermal driving index show a stronger relationship between diabatic heating and the jet in the North Pacific sector than in the North Atlantic sector on these time scales. We find evidence of the expected link via the Hadley cell: the tropical Pacific thermal driving index is associated with a stronger signature in the meridional overturning stream function than the tropical Atlantic thermal driving index. Absolute values of diabatic heating are stronger in the North Pacific than the North Atlantic in all winter months, and the seasonality of the Pacific thermal driving is much more prominent, such that the Pacific dominates the hemispheric zonal mean picture.\nOngoing work will better quantify the influence of thermal driving on the extratopical jets at subseasonal to interannual time scales, and investigate the robustness of these relationships in other reanalysis products and in global climate models.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes in southern Kansas were nearly unheard of until September 2013, when two M2 earthquakes occurred. Since then, the earthquake rate has risen dramatically. Between December 2013 and July 28, 2014, 14 M≥3 earthquakes were recorded in Harper and Sumner counties, the largest being a M3.8 earthquake in December 2013. Residents of the towns of Caldwell and Anthony have reported feeling even more earthquakes. In response to the surge in earthquakes, the USGS deployed a 10-station seismic network to monitor earthquakes in southeastern Harper and southwestern Sumner counties. We have identified over 200 earthquakes that occurred from mid-June to late-July, 2014. The locations of these earthquakes cluster within or near the seismic array, ranging in magnitude from 0.5 to 3.5.\nThe earthquakes we identified are occurring within the Mississippian Lime Play, an area of rapidly expanding oil and gas development stretching from central Oklahoma to northwestern Kansas. In Kansas, new development of the play is largely in the adjoining areas of Harper and Sumner counties. Even with the new development, production in Sumner County has largely remained constant. However, in Harper County, where production was fairly stable from 1995-2010, it began increasing rapidly in 2011. In 2013 the highest yearly production volumes to date were approximately five times larger than those in 2010.\nThe spatial and temporal correlation of the oil and gas development and seismicity in southern Kansas suggests a potential relationship between the two; some of the earthquake clusters lie within 1-2 kilometers of recent development. We examine the possibility that the earthquakes in southern Kansas are induced by wastewater injection and/or hydraulic fracturing. This involves using a refined earthquake catalog built upon cross-correlation detections and high-precision earthquake relocation techniques. We also compute first-motion focal mechanisms and compare them to the regional stress field.",

            "abstract": "Several recent studies have reported widespread increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and loads in streams and rivers worldwide, but few studies have focused on temporal patterns in large rivers that drain landscapes influenced by agriculture. We analyzed annual changes in flow-adjusted concentrations (FACs) of DOC between 1997 and 2013 at eight sites in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) using the Mann-Kendall Trend Test. The FACs represent the residuals of simple linear regression models evaluating the relationship between stream flow and DOC concentration. Our results indicate that statistically significant increases in DOC FACs occurred for only two of the eight sites, at Clinton, IA and Hermann, MO. Trends in DOC concentration were also determined using the Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) model, which is designed to examine the nature and extent of temporal trends in flow normalized (FN) concentrations but does not provide p-values for departure from the null hypothesis of stationary behavior. The results of the WRTDS model corroborate the results of the Mann-Kendall test, and the only considerable increases in FN DOC concentrations occurred at the sites near Clinton, IA and Hermann, MO, which had 26% and 15% increases in DOC FN concentrations during median to high flows, respectively. Changes for the six other sites were much lower, ranging from -4.9% to +6.9%, with the two most downstream sites at St. Francisville and Melville, Louisiana showing the decreasing changes. Since the WRTDS model eliminates the impact of variable hydrology, it allows us to focus on other factors that may drive changes in concentration over time. We couple the output from the WRTDS model with variables related to declining acid deposition, land management, and climate change in an attempt to explain the pattern in DOC concentration trends in the MRB.",

            "abstract": "The Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) on the MErcury, Surface, Space ENviorment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft has acquired high-resolution topographic measurements of Mercury’s northern hemisphere. These measurements permit the quantification of surface roughness on Mercury over baselines between 500 m and 200 km. In contrast to previous studies of Mercury’s surface roughness, which have employed median differential surface slope, we calculate surface roughness as the root mean square (RMS) deviation of the difference in height. If the topography is self-affine or fractal, a power law can be fit to the RMS deviation as a function of baseline length. The exponent of this fit is called the Hurst exponent. This Hurst exponent describes whether or not a surface is self-affine, which occurs when processes produce a surface roughness that is inherently random.\nThe surface roughness of Mercury’s northern hemisphere reflects the observed bimodal nature of Mercury: the northern smooth plains have lower roughness values than the rougher heavily cratered terrain and intercrater plains. The relationship between RMS height and baseline length on Mercury shows two fractal sections, one between lengths of 500 m and 1 km, and another between lengths of 1 km and 20 km. We also find that the northern rise is indistinguishable from the surrounding smooth plains across all measured baselines, implying that the rise did not alter its surface topography at the baselines used in this study. Craters that host radar-bright deposits have similar roughness values to craters that do not host such deposits. Finally, fresh crater ejecta within the smooth plains have similar roughness values (particularly at the 1 km baseline) to the intercrater plains, supporting the interpretation that the intercrater plains may result from the modification of volcanic plains via cratering.",

            "abstract": "Cosmogenic nuclides in stream sediment have been used to measure catchment-averaged erosion rates for nearly two decades. This has revolutionized understanding of mountain landscape evolution. To accurately reflect average erosion, sampled sediment must be representative of the entire landscape. However, mounting evidence suggests that the different grain sizes common in mountain streams often harbor different cosmogenic nuclide concentrations. This raises a fundamental challenge: what should we sample? A common practice is to sample sand, but this can lead to bias in inferred erosion rates. Overcoming the challenge of representative sampling requires understanding the source of the grain size bias. We demonstrate that variations in sediment sizes across slopes can produce large differences in nuclide concentrations in stream sediment. This emerges from both empirical observations from the Sierra Nevada and from a forward model of landscape erosion. We used the model to explore the kinds of catchments in which bias is likely to arise if we measured nuclides in sand alone. We found that in small or low-relief catchments, modeled nuclides in sand accurately reflect imposed erosion rates. Higher relief may produce a larger bias. For example, by sampling only sand in a catchment where both erosion rates and median grain size increase over 3 km of relief, we could underestimate average erosion rates by a factor of 4. Quantifying a signal of grain size bias in the real world is likely complicated by non-steady erosion processes (e.g. landslides) and other factors. Nevertheless, spatial variations in sediment size across slopes may partly explain observed differences in nuclide concentrations in streams. Using sediment tracing tools in conjunction with cosmogenic nuclides may improve sampling methods in landscapes susceptible to grain size bias. Our approach provides a way to quantify how grain size varies across landscapes and thus improve understanding of weathering and erosion in mountain settings.",

MODIS observations have significantly contributed to the studies of many geophysical parameters of the earth’s system and its changes over time. Dedicated effort made by the MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST) to constantly monitor instrument operation, to calibrate changes in sensor response, to derive and update sensor calibration parameters, and to maintain and improve calibration algorithms has played an extremely important role to assure the quality of MODIS data products. MODIS was developed with overall improvements over its heritage sensors. Its observations are made in 36 spectral bands, covering wavelengths from visible to long-wave infrared. The reflective solar bands (1-19 and 26) are calibrated on-orbit by a solar diffuser (SD) panel and regularly scheduled lunar observations. The thermal emissive bands (20-25 and 27-36) calibration is referenced to an on-board blackbody (BB) source. On-orbit changes in the sensor spectral and spatial characteristics are tracked by a spectroradiometric calibration assembly (SRCA). This paper provides an overview of Terra MODIS on-orbit operation and calibration activities implemented from launch to present and the status of instrument health and functions. It demonstrates sensor on-orbit performance derived from its telemetry, on-board calibrators (OBC), and lunar observations. Also discussed in this paper are changes in sensor characteristics, corrections applied to maintain level 1B data quality, various challenging issues, and future improvements.",

Buoy data are available from 2004 – 2012, though periods of missing data exist. Precipitation measurements are from rain gauges on the buoys, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). The goal of this work is to quantify the relative importance of wind induced surface fluxes, especially latent heat fluxes, to precipitation on intraseasonal timescales. Intraseasonal timescales are isolated in two ways: 1) 20 – 100 day bandpass filtering is applied to the surface flux and precipitation time series and 2) global MJO indices are assigned to each time series. Both methods show a positive relationship between latent heat fluxes and precipitation, where latent heat flux values are about 10% of precipitation values. Precipitation leads latent heat flux variability on the order of a few days. Sensitivity tests and linearization of the latent heat flux formula reveal that wind variability, as opposed to thermodynamic variability, explains most of the intraseasonal latent heat flux variability. This work supports previous studies that indicate wind induced surface fluxes are important to destabilize intraseasonal convection.",

To study the characteristics of these data and in support of pre-launch algorithm development, researchers at RIT have been generating simulated ATLAS point clouds using their DIRISG tool, a first-principles radiative transfer remote sensing data simulation package. Included in the simulated data are noise returns specified using pre-launch measurements of the flight detectors. These simulated data have been used to assess the accuracy of surface-finding algorithms and to study the anticipated elevation retrieval performance on complex snow and ice surfaces.

            "abstract": "Our understanding of the seasonal dynamics of fluvial dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations and fluxes in Arctic catchments has increased substantially during recent years, especially during the spring, which historically has been an under-sampled time period. While a number of studies have observed peaks in both DOM concentrations and fluxes during the spring snowmelt, our knowledge of the mechanisms that control these observations are still lacking. During the initial snowmelt period, frozen ground and the snow matrix act to constrain melt-water to the soil surface. We hypothesize that restriction of flow during this time facilitates leaching of DOM from senescent above ground vegetation and detritus contributing to the high DOM concentrations observed during the spring melt. This study focuses on the effect of freezing and drying on the leaching of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON) from above ground vascular plant material. Specifically, we examined the treatment effects of freezing, drying, and freeze-drying on three genera of common Alaskan Arctic vascular plants; Eriophorum (spp.), Carex (spp.), and Salix (spp.). Frozen and freeze-dried plant material released more DOC over the experimental 96 hour leaching period compared to plant material that was only dried. Qualitatively, these patterns were similar among the different plant types, while quantitatively Salix leached more DOC than either Eriophorum or Carex in all treatments. Similar patterns were also seen for DON between the different treatments and among the different plant types. Compositionally, DOM that was leached from frozen and freeze-dried material had higher C:N ratios than material that was only dried. Comparatively, DOM leached from Salix had much higher C:N ratios than either Eriophorum or Carex. During the first 24 hours of leaching, C:N ratios tended to increase followed by a subsequent leveling or decrease, suggesting that the composition of leached DOM varied during the 96 hour time period. Our findings suggest that the seasonal timing of freezing and drying conditions experienced by senesced plant material during the late summer, fall, and winter may impact DOM leaching dynamics on that same plant material the following spring during snowmelt.",

            "abstract": "The study of body size and its evolution is important to paleontological understanding of ecological niches that different organisms have occupied. Ostracods, with frequent occurrences throughout the geological record beginning in the Ordovician, are useful in analyzing how body size has changed. Therefore, understanding the impact of environmental variables is crucial to understanding patterns of body size evolution in extinct ostracods. In order to further investigate this question, ostracod populations in the Gulf of California and the Pacific Coast of North America were studied. By compiling data from Ostracoda from the Gulf of California (Swain, 1967), Marine Holocene Ostracoda from the Pacific Coast of North and Central America (Swain and Gilby, 1974), and the National Oceanographic Data Center, we compare environmental factors, including oxygen levels, temperature, salinity, and depth with anteroposterior length measurements of about 180 recent ostracod species in order to determine the impact of these variables. Using R, we constructed graphs of oxygen levels, temperature, and salinity versus average body size. Using a correlation test, the correlation coefficient for oxygen is -0.193, temperature is -0.398, and salinity is -0.322, with the corresponding p-values of 0.067, 9.196 x 10-5, and 0.002; only the latter two p-values are significant at the alpha = 0.05 level. The correlation test for depth was calculated but showed no trends. The statistically significant correlation coefficient between temperature and body size suggests a strong negative correlation. Because oxygen levels and salinity levels are, to some extent, dependent upon temperature, this may explain the smaller, yet still statistically significant, correlation between body size and salinity. Relationships between ostracod body size and temperature may be relevant to our understanding of the impacts on ecological structure as the ocean temperatures fluctuate in the future.",

            "abstract": "Late Pleistocene glacial periods exhibit abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) climatic oscillations, evidence of which is preserved in a variety of northern hemisphere (NH) palaeoclimatic archives. Ice cores show Antarctica is cooling during the warm phases of the Greenland DO cycle and vice versa, suggesting an interhemispheric redistribution of heat through a mechanism dubbed the bipolar seesaw. While it is generally accepted that variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength play an important role, great uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics and trigger of the abrupt events. Key information is contained in the relative phasing of hemispheric climate variations, yet the large and poorly constrained ice age-gas age difference (Dage) in Antarctic ice cores has precluded methane-based synchronization at the required sub-centennial precision. Here we present a new high accumulation deep Antarctic ice core, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS)-Divide core, that is used to resolve the timing of the bipolar seesaw at unprecedented temporal resolution. We find that the abrupt Greenland warming phase leads the corresponding Antarctic cooling by 195 ± 59 years for DO-events, including the Bølling period; Greenland cooling leads the corresponding Antarctic warming by 179 ± 61 years. The centennial NH lead time shows that the abrupt phases of the DO cycle are initiated in the NH, after which the temperature anomaly is propagated to the southern hemisphere (SH) high latitudes via an oceanic teleconnection. The similar phasing of warming and cooling events suggests that to first order the transfer time of the climatic signal is independent of the AMOC background state. Our findings confirm the central role ocean circulation plays in the seesaw, and provide a clear criterion for testing hypotheses and model simulations of DO dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Strong correlations between atmospheric CO2, Antarctic temperatures, and marine proxy records have hinted that ventilation of the deep Southern Ocean may have played a central role in the variations of CO2 over glacial-interglacial cycles. One proposition is that, in general, the Southern Ocean ventilates the deep more strongly under higher CO2, due to a change in winds and/or the dominance of thermal stratification in a warm ocean, which weakens ocean biological carbon storage. Here, we explore this idea with a suite of multi-millennial simulations using the GFDL CM2Mc global coupled model. The results are, indeed, consistent with increasing ventilation of the Southern Ocean as pCO2 increases above modern. However, they reveal a surprising twist under low pCO2: increased salinity of the Southern Ocean, due in part to weakening atmospheric moisture transport, actually increases ventilation rate of the deep ocean under low pCO2 as well. This implies that a nadir of Southern Ocean ventilation occurs at intermediate pCO2, which the model estimates as being close to that of the present-day. This is at odds with the interpretation that weak ventilation of the deep Southern Ocean was the unifying coupled mechanism for the glacial pCO2 cycles. Rather, it suggests that factors other than the ventilation rate of the deep Southern Ocean, such as iron fertilization, ecosystem changes, water mass distributions, and sea ice cover, were key players in the glacial-interglacial CO2 changes.",

            "abstract": "With ever increasing exploration and exploitation of ‘unconventional’ hydrocarbon resources, the drive to understand the origins, history and importance of these resources and their effects on the surrounding environment (i.e. ground waters) has never been more important. High-throughput, high-precision isotopic measurements are therefore a key tool in this industry to both understand the gas generated and monitor the development and stability of wells through time. With the advent of cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS) instrumentation, there has been a push in some applications – environmental & atmospheric – to gather more and more data directly at the location of collection or at dedicated field stations. Furthermore, CRDS has resulted in users seeking greater autonomy of instrumentation and so-called black box technology. Traditionally IRMS technology has not met any of these demands, requiring very specific and extensive footprint, power and environmental requirements. This has meant that the ‘Oil & Gas’ sector, which for natural gases measurements requires GC-IRMS technology – not possible via CRDS - loses time, money and manpower as samples get sent to central facility or contract labs with potentially long lee times. However, recent developments in technology mean that IRMS systems exist which are benchtop, have much lower power requirements, standard power connections and as long as housed in a temperature controlled field stations can be deployed anywhere. Furthermore, with advances in electronics and software IRMS systems are approaching the black box level of newer instrumentation while maintaining the flexibility and abilities of isotope ratio mass spectrometry. This presentation will outline changes in IRMS technology applicable to the Oil & Gas industry, discuss the feasibility of true ‘field’ deployability and present results from a range of Oil & Gas samples.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the wave forcing estimated from the ERA-40 and ERA-Interim reanalyses during northern winter. The discrepancies in the wave forcing are most significant at high latitudes and are marked by vertically alternating positive-negative anomalies of the Eliassen-Palm (E-P) flux divergence. In the stratosphere, the discrepancies intensify with altitude and expand equatorwards in the upper stratosphere. They are mainly associated with the vertical E-P fluxes and due primarily to differences in the climatology. The magnitude of discrepancies is about 20-40% of the climatology derived from ERA-Interim and can be greater than the interannual variability of the E-P flux divergence in certain regions. The dynamical implications of these discrepancies on the Brewer-Dobson circulation are also studied.\nA sudden drop in the 100hPa poleward eddy heat flux is detected in ERA-40 over subtropical oceans after the 1990/1991 northern winter. It is likely related to the bias corrections applied to the infrared radiances from the NOAA-12 High-resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder, which was known to be contaminated by volcanic aerosol from the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. A sudden increase in 10hPa poleward eddy heat flux is detected in ERA-Interim at high latitudes after the 1997/1998 winter, likely due in part to the use of uncorrected radiances from the NOAA-15 Advanced Microwave Sounding Units. These sudden changes induced artificial trends in stratospheric wave forcing in the affected reanalysis.",

            "abstract": "Although land use change (LUC) is an important driver of changes in climate, very limited field observations of atmosphere–landscape interactions exist in tropical montane zones to examine the extent to which LUCs affect climate locally and regionally. The lack of ground observations hampers the evaluation of satellite-derived datasets of land surface parameters as well as the validation of regional climate models. The first results of an ongoing study of the climate effects of a LUC trajectory in the lower montane region (1200 m a.s.l.) of central Veracruz, Mexico, are presented. The radiation balance, turbulent fluxes and soil heat flux were measured in order to obtain field-derived land surface parameters (albedo and Bowen ratio) of two contrasting land uses: shaded coffee (CO) and sugarcane (SU) plantations. Measurements were conducted on days representing different seasons and crop stages during 2014: cold-dry (January), warm-dry (March) and warm-wet (July). Average noon-time albedo was higher for SU than for CO (0.14 vs. 0.11). Soil heat flux was on average 13% and 12% of net radiation for SU and CO, respectively. Preliminary turbulent flux calculations indicate that noon-time Bowen ratio was higher for sugar cane (range: 1.0-1.5) compared to shaded coffee (range: 0.5-1.0). Seasonal (and crop-stage) changes affected the surface parameters of SU mostly. For example, the SU Bowen ratio increased with decreasing soil moisture, indicating soil moisture limitation for transpiration reducing latent heat flux. In contrast, the shaded coffee Bowen ratio remained relatively constant across measuring periods. The energy balance closure was 80% (pending complete eddy covariance data corrections). These results indicate that the conversion of shaded coffee to sugarcane result in a drier and hotter lower atmosphere. Next steps include examining the implications of these local changes for regional climate, with special attention to cloud formation, using a regional model validated with measured average cloud base height (ceilometer data) and boundary layer dynamics (balloon soundings).",

One belt runs off the coast following nearly its contour. Here the earthquakes are shallow depth and mostly show a reverse fault mechanism. This belt of seismicity begins at the Los Tuxtlas volcanic field. Another seismic belt is located inland 70 km to the west. Here most earthquakes are of intermediate-depth (108-154 km) focus and normal faulting mechanism.

In their day-to-day work, scientists struggle to respond to heated discussions about their research, whether from online commentators, opinion columnists, or special interest groups. Based on decades of experience and interviews with scientists, the Union of Concerned Scientists has developed a guide for communicating science amid heightened scrutiny. Building on the information contained in the UCS guide, this presentation will discuss best practices for climate researchers, including suggestions for when scrutiny can be ignored or when it deserves a response and methods for responding that can uphold scientific integrity while also protecting an individual researcher’s reputation and ability to publicly communicate. Examples include scientists who have responded to bloggers criticizing their research, advocacy groups demanding their personal emails and policymakers targeting them with personal attacks. In understanding how to respond to scrutiny, scientists can bolster their own ability to communicate and curtail the chilling effect that scrutiny can have on other scientists conducting public enegagement.",

            "abstract": "Current 3D models tend to underestimate the production of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere (Volkamer et al., 2006). Recent studies argue that aqueous chemistry in clouds could be responsible for a significant production of SOA (Ervens et al., 2011; Carlton and Turpin, 2013) through oxidative and non-oxidative processes. Aqueous phase reactivity of organic compounds needs to be thoroughly described in models to identify organic molecules available to contribute to SOA mass.\nRecently, new empirical methods have been developed to allow the estimate of HO·reaction rates in the aqueous phase (Doussin and Monod, 2013, Minakata et al., 2009). These methods provide global rate constants together with branching ratios for HO·abstraction and addition on organic compounds of atmospheric interests. Current cloud chemistry mechanisms do not take the different possible pathways into account. Based on these structure-activity relationships, a new detailed aqueous phase mechanism describing the oxidation of hydrosoluble organic compounds resulting from isoprene oxidation is proposed.\nThis new aqueous phase mechanism is coupled with the detailed gas phase mechanism MCM v3.2 (Jenkin et al., 1997; Saunders et al., 2003) through a kinetic of mass transfer parameterization for the exchange between gas phase and aqueous phase.

            "abstract": "The April 1, 2014 Mw8.1 Pisagua earthquake filled a relatively small part of the Iquique Gap, a segment of the the Nazca-South America plate boundary that had not experienced a great earthquake since 1877. The slip maximum for the event occurred south of the hypocenter offshore of the village of Pisagua. To document the permanent surface deformation, we measured more than 3,700 co- or post seismic cracks, spanning 220 km of coast length, during three field excursions 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months after the main shock. Thanks to the hyperarid climate of the region, many fresh cracks are still visible 3.5 months after the main event but eolian processes and sloughing of the side-walls are rapidly obscuring these fragile features.\nThe distribution of crack strikes is noisy for several reasons: (1) the vast majority of new cracks reactivated pre-existing cracks in many cases with less than ideal orientations; (2) both the April 1 main shock and the April 2 Mw7.7 aftershock 70 km to the south probably produced cracks; (3) several smaller crustal aftershocks occurred on EW reverse faults and may have enhanced cracking on EW scarps; and (4) cracking is locally enhanced along sharp topographic features. Nonetheless, there is a tendency for NNE striking cracks S of the slip maximum and NNW cracks to the north. We measured crack aperture and calculate strain in transects of 500-1000 m length at 3 localities along the earthquake rupture length. Those close to the slip maximum have permanent coseismic extensional strains on the order of 1e-4 and even a site 60 km S of the Mw7.7 event has crack strain of 5e-5. These strains are not homogenous, but diminish eastward.\nThese data indicate that surface cracking caused by any one event utilizes the most suitably pre-existing weaknesses, Presumably, over time earthquakes with similar slip characteristics will add constructively in the geological record to produce a crack population characteristic of the long term average earthquake in the region.",

            "abstract": "The mountainous Southern Andes and Antarctic Peninsula (SAAP) region is one of the most intense sources of Gravity Waves (GWs) on Earth. In austral winter, momentum deposition from orographic GWs into the lower stratosphere from this region can exert a strong drag effect on winds in the polar stratospheric jet. The exact nature of this drag effect is difficult to parameterise operationally in GCMs, and as a result such wave parameterisations are generally poorly constrained by observations.\nUsing COSMIC GPS-RO, we observe high Gravity Wave Potential Energy (GWPE) both directly over the SAAP region and downwind in a long leeward wake stretching more than half way around the globe, and comment on possible relationships between the two features. We also observe a vertical column of GWPE directly over the Southern Andes in both zonal and meridional cross-sections, the latter of which suggests a strong southward advection of orographic GWs into the polar stratospheric jet.\nWe investigate the observed difference in monthly GW climatologies when an approach using only COSMIC profiles in which GW signals have been clearly identified is applied in preference to the traditional all-measurement time-averaged approach, and use this to obtain an estimate of GW intermittency in the SAAP region.\nFinally, we take advantage of the deployment phase of the COSMIC constellation to obtain an estimate of momentum flux in the SAAP region, using the phase difference between pairs of closely spaced profiles to estimate the horizontal wavelengths of resolved GWs. We demonstrate that during the deployment phase, momentum flux estimates derived from COSMIC GPS-RO are comparable to those derived from HIRDLS.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, in coordination with other groups, has been collecting sea-ice data in the Arctic off the north coast of Alaska with an airborne system employing a radar altimeter, LiDAR and a photogrammetric camera in an effort to obtain wide swaths of measurements coincident with Cryosat-2 footprints. Because the satellite tracks traverse areas of moving pack ice, precise real-time estimates of the ice motion are needed to fly a survey grid that will yield complete data coverage. This requirement led us to develop a method to find the ice motion from the aircraft during the survey. With the advent of real-time orthographic photogrammetric systems, we developed a system that measures the sea ice motion in-flight, and also permits post-process modeling of sea ice velocities to correct the positioning of radar and LiDAR data.\nFor the 2013 and 2014 field seasons, we used this Real Time Ice Motion Estimation (RTIME) system to determine ice motion using Applanix’s Inflight Ortho software with an Applanix DSS439 system. Operationally, a series of photos were taken in the survey area. The aircraft then turned around and took more photos along the same line several minutes later. Orthophotos were generated within minutes of collection and evaluated by custom software to find photo footprints and potential overlap. Overlapping photos were passed to the correlation software, which selects a series of “chips” in the first photo and looks for the best matches in the second photo. The correlation results are then passed to a density-based clustering algorithm to determine the offset of the photo pair.\nTo investigate any systematic errors in the photogrammetry, we flew several flight lines over a fixed point on various headings, over an area of non-moving ice in 2013. The orthophotos were run through the correlation software to find any residual offsets, and run through additional software to measure chip positions and offsets relative to the aircraft heading. X- and Y-offsets in situations where one of the chips was near the center of its photo were plotted to find the along- and across-track errors vs. distance from the photo center. Corrections were determined and applied to the survey data, reducing the mean error by about 1 meter. The corrections were applied to all of the subsequent survey data.",

            "abstract": "Forest snow interception can account for large snow storage differences between open and forested areas. These differences also create large variations in sublimation, with estimates varying from 4% to 50% worldwide. This broad range highlights the need for accurate estimation of canopy interception.\nMost current interception models utilize canopy cover and leaf area index (LAI) to partition interception efficiency (interception / precipitation in the open) which is typically modelled as an exponential decrease with increasing precipitation. However, these models can show limited utility quantifying snow interception dynamics under heterogeneous canopy. This study paired large scale field measurements of snow interception to aerial LiDAR data in efforts to better estimate interception within a Norwegian spruce dominated forest.\nSeven field areas were equipped with precision geo-located sampling grids within various canopy density/gap fractionation regimes in three elevation bands surrounding Davos, Switzerland. Snow interception measurements were taken at each point for a series of storm events from 2012 to 2014 for a total of ~10,000 interception measurements and compared with further measurements at two open sites.\nExisting and novel canopy metrics at the field areas were developed using a high resolution airborne LiDAR data set. These include estimates of LAI, canopy closure, under canopy incoming solar radiation, distance to tree measurements, aerial gap fraction measurements and various tree size parameters. These estimates were validated from 112 hemispherical images of the canopy structure within the field sites.\nThe snow measurements and LiDAR derived canopy metrics were then integrated to formulate an improved representation of canopy interception and further compared to interception estimates from the use of standard canopy metrics.\nThe standard mechanistic framework utilized in many models was also modified based upon interception efficiency distributions seen from this dataset. This model approach gives more accurate estimates of interception within heterogeneous canopy cover at various scales.",

            "abstract": "While current models generally treat organic and mixed organic-inorganic aerosol particles as well-mixed liquids, these particles can exist in multiple phase states depending on their chemical composition and on ambient conditions such as relative humidity (RH). For example, multi-component particles can undergo phase separations in which an inorganic-electrolyte-rich phase and an organic-rich phase coexist within one particle. Organic aerosols have been shown to exist in an amorphous, highly viscous semi-solid state under atmospherically relevant conditions. Hygroscopic growth factors (GFs) of ten laboratory-generated, organic-inorganic aerosol systems with phase morphologies ranging from well-mixed liquids, to phase-separated particles, to viscous semi-solids were measured with the Differential Aerosol Sizing and Hygroscopicity Spectrometer Probe at RH values ranging from 30 – 90%. Measured GFs were compared to water-uptake calculations in which it was assumed that particles could be represented as thermodynamically ideal, well-mixed liquids, as well as those predicted by the Aerosol Inorganic-Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coefficients (AIOMFAC) model. Both ideal and AIOMFAC-predicted GFs were in good agreement with experimental GFs for aerosol systems that exist as well-mixed liquids across the range of RHs tested; however, substantial disagreement between experimental and ideal GFs was observed for phase-separated particles. This disagreement was greatest at low to moderate RHs, whereas experimental GFs approached the ideal curve at high RH as phase-separated particles merged to a single phase with increased water content. AIOMFAC, which offers the ability to predict liquid-liquid and liquid-solid phase separations within a thermodynamic equilibrium computation, was within 10% of experimental GFs at all RHs for all aerosol systems. The assumption that water uptake is driven by ideal, equilibrium partitioning leads to errors in calculated particle size and refractive index and has implications for predicted aerosol scattering efficiencies and radiative properties.",

            "abstract": "Investigation of marine sediment records can help elucidate recent changes in the Arctic Ocean circulation and sea ice conditions. We examine sediment cores from the western Arctic Ocean, representing Late to Early Quaternary age (potentially up to 1 Ma). Previous studies of Arctic sediment cores indicate that interglacial/interstadial periods with relatively high sea levels and reduced ice cover are characterized by vigorous bioturbation, while glacial intervals have little to no bioturbation. Traditional methods for studying bioturbation require physical dissection of the cores, effectively destroying them. To treat this limitation, we evaluate archival sections of the cores using an X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) scanner, which noninvasively images the sediment cores in three dimensions. The scanner produces density sensitive images suitable for quantitative analysis and for identification of bioturbation based on size, shape, and orientation. We use image processing software to isolate burrows from surrounding sediment, reconstruct them three-dimensionally, and then calculate their surface areas, volumes, and densities. Preliminary analysis of a core extending to the early Quaternary shows that bioturbation ranges from 0 to approximately 20% of the core’s volume. In future research, we will quantitatively define the relationship between bioturbation activity and glacial regimes. XCT examination of bioturbation and other sedimentary features has the potential to shed light on paleoceanographic conditions such as sedimentation patterns and food flux. XCT is an alternative, underexplored investigation method that bears implications not only for illustrating paleoclimate variations but also for preserving cores for future, more advanced technologies.",

            "abstract": "The Lovejoy Basalt is a distinctive Miocene (~16 Ma) unit that erupted from Thompson Peak in the northeast Sierra Nevada, flowed southwest across the Sierra Nevada into the Sacramento Valley. It crops out in a few places in Sacramento Valley: (1) near Chico and Oroville on the east side of the valley, (2) Orland Buttes on the west side, and (3) Putnam Peak, some 250 km southwest of Thompson Peak. The basalt is also encountered in drill holes, but its extent is not entirely known. The Lovejoy Basalt is strongly magnetic and, in general, reversely magnetized, making it an excellent target for aeromagnetic mapping. Recently acquired aeromagnetic data (flight line spacing 800 m at an altitude of 240 m) indicate a characteristic, sinuous, short-wavelength magnetic pattern associated with outcrops and known subcrops of Lovejoy Basalt. Filtering of these data to enhance negative, short-wavelength anomalies defines two large bands of negative anomalies that trend southwest of Chico and Oroville and appear to coalesce about 25 km north of Sutter Buttes. Another band of negative anomalies extends north of the junction roughly along the Sacramento River 40 km to Deer Creek. The anomalies become more subdued to the north, suggesting that the Lovejoy thins to the north. Aeromagnetic data also indicate a large subcrop of Lovejoy Basalt that extends 25 km north-northeast from exposures at Orland Buttes. Driller logs from gas and water wells confirm our mapping of Lovejoy within these areas. The sinuous magnetic lows are not continuous south of Sutter Buttes, but form isolated patches that are aligned in a north-south direction south of the concealed Colusa Dome to Putnam Peak and an east-west, 20-km-long band about 15 km south of Sutter Buttes. Other reversed anomalies in the Sacramento Valley coincide with volcanic necks in the Sutter Buttes and Colusa Dome; these produce semicircular anomalies that are distinct from those caused by the Lovejoy Basalt.",

            "abstract": "Recently, catastrophic landslides are getting considerable attentions not only from natural hazard but also from geo-material science. In the past century, the Daguangbao (DGB) landslide which triggered by the Wenchuan earthquake is one of the largest earthquake- triggered landslides. Our main goal is to characterize the geometry of DGB landslide to better determine the initiation mechanisms. Based on the remote sensing images analysis and field investigation, we proposed an atypical wedge model of DGB landslide compose of a folded strata and a zigzag stepping-out joint system, which outcropped at the south and north of the landslide site, respectively. The intersection line of wedge is curved, counterclockwise rotated and daylighted, which fit the pre- and post- position of the mining tent with 1.9 km displacements. The volume of sliding mass was evaluated to 10.51×108 m3 by the atypical wedge model. The identified slip zone of DGB landslide consists of the breccia and gouge layers in the dolomite strata. The rotary-shear tests were performed with the intact dolomite rocks near the slip zone and the gouges in the slip zone to determine the strength of slip surface. The peak and the steady-state friction coefficient of the tested dry dolomite discontinuities, wet gouges are 0.52~0.96, 0.73~0.86 and 0.1~0.57, 0.16~0.63, respectively. Although the result of static wedge stability analysis shows that the slope is quite stable (F.S. = 4), but the result of pseudo-static wedge stability analysis with seismic coefficient will trigger the gigantic wedge by the Wenchuan earthquake. Moreover, the friction coefficient of the tested gouges after long slip displacements as shear velocity exceeds 1.3 m/s will lower than 0.25 (=tan(14°); the intersection line plunged 14°). Therefore, the gigantic wedge can be accelerated by the inertial force and keep moving rapidly with long run-out. According to the calculations of simple one dimensional particle motion model, DGB landslide traveled 52~68 seconds with a maximum velocity of 58~75 m/sec.",

            "abstract": "Within the suite of SMAP’s standard data products is the Level 2 Passive Soil Moisture Product, which is derived primarily from SMAP’s brightness temperature (TB) observations. The baseline retrieval algorithm uses an established microwave emission model that had been extensively tested in many past field experiments.\nOne approach to applying the same model at a global scale with SMAP’s TB observations is to use the same calibration coefficients derived from past field experiments and apply them globally. Although this approach is a simplification of reality, it resulted in accurate retrieval in several geographically limited studies. Nevertheless, significant retrieval bias may occur in areas where land cover types had not been considered in past field experiments.\nIn this work, a time-series global model calibration approach is proposed and evaluated. One year of gridded L-band TB observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission were used as the primary input. At each land pixel on the SMAP grid, the observed TBs were compared with the simulated TBs according to the model with unknown calibration coefficients to be determined. Because of the time-series nature of the input, the above comparison could be repeated for successive revisit dates as a system of equations until the number of known variables (TBs) exceeds the number of unknown variables (calibration coefficients and/or geophysical retrieval). Global nonlinear optimization techniques were then applied to the equations to solve for the optimal model calibration coefficients for that pixel.\nFollowing global application of this approach, soil moisture estimates were extracted and compared with in-situ ground measurement. The resulting soil moisture estimates were shown to have an accuracy comparable to what was observed in past field experiments, confirming the versatility of this global model calibration approach.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies1,2 have shown that young accreting planets in the habitable zones (HZ) of pre-main sequence M-stars face major dynamical hurdles in both the retention and acquisition of volatiles. High collision rates with other bodies, short planetary formation timescales, and inefficient radial mixing are among the major problems encountered. However, another equally-important concern is the high temperatures predicted within the circumstellar disk, greatly hindering volatile delivery.\nWe use a 1-D radiative-convective climate model to demonstrate that the fluxes received by accreting planets orbiting late K-M stars exceed the runaway greenhouse threshold. Given that M-stars are disproportionately brighter in their pre main-sequence lifetimes as compared to Sun-like stars (i.e. G-class insolation), planets orbiting M-stars are especially susceptible to the runaway, with intensity and duration increasing for cooler M-stars. Thus, accreting planetesimals in the HZs of M-stars could be too hot to maintain liquid water on their surfaces. In contrast, accreting planets located at Earth’s distance (or farther) from a pre-main sequence solar analogue (i.e. G2 spectral class) receive stellar fluxes well below that of the runaway point. Our results suggest that future missions and surveys can improve their prospects of finding alien life by targeting HZ planets orbiting Sun-like stars. Moreover, our findings support recent claims that Venus may have lost its water during accretion3.\nREFERENCES\n1.

            "abstract": "We present data on growth of approximately 100 individual bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) trees situated at and near upper treeline in the White Mountains of California. Most trees growing at treeline show positive trends in growth in the 20th century and vary with temperature at both decadal and interannual timescales. However, many trees situated just 50 m or more below treeline have growth patterns that do not correlate strongly with the trees from the highest elevations. Some of these growth disparities can be explained by understanding the role of topography (including nighttime cold air pooling) at the scale of tens of meters. In particular, trees growing below treeline but in the coldest locations of the hillslope track temperature variations. Conversely, the fast growth of some of the highest trees in the warmest biophysical settings has declined since the mid-1980s. This might suggest that the climate response of trees has recently shifted from being positively to negatively associated with temperature.",

            "abstract": "The TIE-GCM was recently augmented to include helium and argon, two approximately inert species that can be used as tracers of dynamics in the thermosphere. The former species is treated as a major species due to its large abundance near the upper boundary. The effects of exospheric transport are also included in order to simulate realistic seasonal and latitudinal helium distributions. The latter species is treated as a classical minor species, imparting absolutely no forces on the background atmosphere. In this study, we examine the interplay of the various dynamical terms – i.e. background circulation, molecular and Eddy diffusion – as they drive departures from the distributions that would be expected under the assumption of diffusive equilibrium. As this has implications on the formulation of all empirical thermospheric models, we use this understanding to address the following questions: (1) how do errors caused by the assumption of diffusive equilibrium manifest within empirical models of the thermosphere? and (2) where and when does an empirical model’s output disagree with its underlying datasets due to the inherent limitations of said model’s formulation?",

            "abstract": "Models of aeolian sand transport generally assume wind momentum inputs and transport rates that are homogenous in space and steady in time. In contrast, field measurements indicate broad temporal and spatial variability in wind velocities and resulting transport fluxes. Poor agreement between field-measured and model-predicted sediment fluxes may therefore result from the problematic steady-state assumption in models. Here, we offer a new approach to modeling aeolian transport in unsteady natural systems. This approach depends on two components: (1) A stochastic description of variability in downward turbulent momentum flux immediately above the layer of saltating particles and (2) Adaptation of existing models for the saltation “saturation” process (spinup of saltation following an abrupt initiation of wind shear over the sediment bed) to treat the response of saltation to time-varying momentum inputs. Development of our new model framework is aided by high-frequency simultaneous measurements of wind velocity and saltation flux during natural aeolian sand transport.",

            "abstract": "We have extended a domain decomposition approach for modeling spontaneous (frictional) earthquake rupture in quasistatic and dynamic simulations of crustal deformation within our finite-element code, PyLith. This new approach greatly accelerates convergence in quasistatic simulations by incorporating the fault friction terms into the Jacobian for the system of equations. In the new approach the Lagrange multipliers correspond to the difference between the total fault traction and the friction traction on the fault. This replaces our original formulation [Aagaard, Knepley, Williams JGR, 118(6), 2013] in which the Lagrange multipliers correspond to the total fault traction and each iteration of the nonlinear solve required a separate solve to update the fault slip. For quasistatic simulations with a Krylov (iterative) solver, this new formulation remains compatible with our custom preconditioner for the Lagrange multiplier portion of the system of equations, which provides excellent scalability with problem size compared to conventional additive Schwarz methods. For dynamic simulations with explicit time stepping and a diagonal Jacobian for the system of equations, convergence still occurs in a single iteration.",

            "abstract": "Little is known about inorganic fertilizer or manure effects on organic carbon (OC) and inorganic C (IC) losses from a furrow irrigated field, particularly in the context of other system C gains or losses. In 2003 and 2004, we measured dissolved organic and inorganic C (DOC, DIC), particulate OC and IC (POC, PIC) concentrations in irrigation inflow, runoff, and percolation waters (6-7 irrigations/y); C inputs from soil amendments and crop biomass; harvested C; and gaseous C emissions from field plots cropped to silage corn (Zea mays L.) in southern Idaho. Annual treatments included: (M) 13 (y 1) and 34 Mg/ha (y 2) stockpiled dairy manure; (F) 78 (yr 1) and 195 kg N/ha (y 2) inorganic N fertilizer; or (NA) no amendment--control. The mean annual total C input into M plots averaged 16.1 Mg/ha, 1.4-times greater than that for NA (11.5 Mg/ha) or F (11.1 Mg/ha), while total C outputs for the three treatments were similar, averaging 11.8 Mg/ha. Thus, the manure plots ended each growing season with an average net gain of 3.8 Mg C/ha (a positive net C flux), while the control (-0.5 Mg C/ha) and fertilizer (-0.4 Mg C/ha) treatments finished the season with a net C loss. Atmospheric CO2 incorporated into the crop biomass contributed 96% of the mean annual C input to NA and F plots but only 68% to M plots. We conclude that nutrient amendments substantially influence the short-term carbon balance of our furrow-irrigated system. Amendments had both direct and indirect influences on individual C components, such as the losses of DIC and POC in runoff and DOC in percolation water, producing temporally complex outcomes which may depend on environmental conditions external to the field.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen oxide (NOx) abundances across the U.S. have fallen steadily over the last fifteen years. Patterns in anthropogenic sources result in 2-fold lower NOx on weekends than weekdays largely without co-occurring changes in other emissions. These trends taken together provide a near perfect NOx constraint on the nonlinear chemistry of ozone, on the key oxidants nitrate radical (NO3) and hydroxyl radical (OH), and on secondary aerosol formation. We use this NOx constraint to interpret trends in wintertime PM2.5 over the last decade in San Joaquin Valley, California, a location with severe aerosol pollution and where a large portion of the total aerosol mass is ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3). We combine the 12-year routine monitoring record and the air- and ground-based DISCOVER-AQ-2013 datasets to quantify the impact of NOx emission controls on the frequency of wintertime exceedances of the national PM2.5 standard. Nitrate ion (NO3–) is the oxidation product of NO2 and is formed by distinct daytime and nighttime pathways, both of which are nonlinear functions of the NO2 abundance. We present observationally derived decadal trends in both pathways and show that NOx reductions have worked to simultaneously increase daytime and decrease nighttime NH4NO3 production over the last 15 years. The net effect has been a substantial decrease in NH4NO3 via decreased NO3-radical initiated production in the nocturnal residual layer, a layer largely separated from nighttime emissions at the surface. Whereas NO3– production in the nocturnal residual layer drove NH4NO3 chemistry over the last decade, OH-initiated chemistry at the surface is poised to be the most important source of NH4NO3 in the next decade.",

            "abstract": "From a societal perspective, soil N follows only soil C in the importance of soil to 21st century environmental issues. Amundson et al (2003) developed a mass balance model for soil N and the ratio of 15N/14N, and provided the first global projections of the spatial patterns of soil and plant δ15N values. It was hypothesized that state factors, particularly climate, should drive broad patterns of soil and plant δ15N values in a manner analogous to the known patterns of total soil N (e.g. Post et al., 1984). At that time, the N isotope data available to explore the effect of individual factors was modest. In the past decade, numerous papers from a broad spectrum of locations have created a rich database that can be used to further refine the initial projections made more than a decade ago.\nIn this paper, hundreds of published measurements will be used to more deeply examine the climatic impacts on soil and plant δ15N values. Additionally, we will focus on the local controls of topography on ecosystem N cycling, which can create local isotopic variation that is similar in magnitude to the global effects of climate. The adoption of process-based models from the hillslope geomorphology community appears to be a powerful tool for explaining some existing data from toposequences, designing new studies of topographic controls on biogeochemistry, and particularly for parameterization in global models.\nAmundson, R., A.T.

            "abstract": "The Roaring Fork Valley (RFV) in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado is comprised of a diversity of ecosystems occurring within a single watershed. From one end of the valley to the other, the landscape undergoes an over 1500m gain in elevation, creating a unique opportunity for comparison of conditions in different habitats of close geographic proximity. Interested in comparing the ecological responses of these different habitats in the context of rising global temperatures, the Aspen Global Change Institute (AGCI) partnered with City of Aspen, Pitkin Country Open Space and Trails, and the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies to install soil monitoring stations at multiple elevations within the watershed. Soil moisture was identified as the primary indicator for monitoring because there is a dearth of local soil moisture data, and soil moisture plays a vital role in plant survival and correlates closely with precipitation and air temperature. Additionally, as precipitation regimes shift in the future, there is a need to better understand the interplay between vegetative water availability during the critical early growing season and timing, areal extent, and depth of snowpack. Two initial soil monitoring stations were installed in undeveloped, montane ecosystems of the Roaring Fork Watershed in 2012. Each station measures air temperature; relative humidity; rainfall; and soil moisture at 5, 20, and 52 cm depths. Two additional soil monitoring stations are being established over the summer of 2014, and additional stations within the Roaring Fork soil moisture network are planned for future years. Early data from the existing sites indicate the importance of timing of snowmelt in maintaining soil moisture through the early dry months of summer and dissimilarity between the impact of moderate and heavy rain events on soil moisture at different depths. These data have implications for restoration, management, and planning for local ecosystems and have significance for the broader scientific community in their potential to further understanding of soil moisture response to climate change in mountain ecosystems.",

The DOE ARM Program has operated an atmospheric measurement facility in Barrow, Alaska, since 1998. Major upgrades to this facility, including scanning radars, were added in 2010. Facilities and infrastructure to support operations of unmanned aerial systems for science missions in the Arctic and North Slope of Alaska were established at Oliktok Point Alaska in 2013. Tethered instrumented balloons will be used in the near future to make measurements of clouds in the boundary layer including mixed-phase clouds.\nThe Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility is implementing “mega-sites” at the Southern Great Plains and North Slope of Alaska sites. Two workshops were held to gather input from the scientific community on these mega-sites. The NSA workshop was held September 10 and 11 in the Washington DC area. The workshops included discussions of additional profiling remote sensors, detailed measurements of the land-atmosphere interface, aerial operations to link the Barrow and Oliktok sites, unmanned aerial system measurements, and routine large eddy simulation model runs. The “mega-sites” represent a significant new scientific and infrastructure investment by DOE Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research.\nThis poster will present information on plans for a North Slope “Megasite” as well as new opportunities for members of the arctic research community to make atmospheric measurements using unmanned aerial systems or tethered balloons in conjunction with the DOE ARM facilities on the North Slope of Alaska.",

            "abstract": "Scientists are often hesitant to engage in public dialogues about their work, especially when their research has bearing on contentious public policy issues. The Union of Concerned Scientists has conducted dozens of workshops to assist its members in communicating science fairly, accurately and effectively to audiences with mixed opinions about relevant public policy. While public polling indicates that people admire scientists and support scientific research, public understanding lags behind scientific understanding on a variety of issues, from climate change to evolution to vaccination. In many cases, people reject or discount scientific evidence when they perceive their ideology, beliefs or policy preferences as being in conflict with that evidence. These biases make it difficult for scientists to convey their research to many audiences. Based on reviews of social science literature and interactions with its members, the Union of Concerned Scientists has explored methods for surmounting public ideological biases while staying true to the science. In particular, scientists have found success with communicating based on shared values, asking audience members questions about their reactions to science, avoiding unintentional invocation of ideological biases and partnering with non-scientist speakers who can address contentious public policy questions. These methods can allow scientists to more effectively collaborate with stakeholders interested in their research and can build public support for science.",

            "abstract": "Recent field and remote sensing studies show that shrub expansion has been widespread in low-Arctic ecosystems. However, there are still uncertainties regarding the extent of these changes, the plant functional groups involved, and the relative importance of climate and disturbance as causes of observed changes. Some authors have suggested that shrub expansion may have caused declines in lichens important for caribou forage, but these changes have not been examined at regional scales. Our research on the Tuktoyaktuk Coastal Plain using 30m resolution Landsat satellite imagery from 1985-2011 and high resolution (1:2000) vertical aerial photographs from 1980 and 2013 shows that shrub expansion has been associated with widespread lichen decline . Our analysis shows that the most likely driver of shrub expansion is a 4°C winter temperature increase over the past 30 years, leading to warmer soils and enhanced supply of growth-limiting nutrients. Natural and human-caused disturbances also stimulated increases in shrub cover, but these effects were limited spatially. Our observations are consistent with plot-scale warming experiments showing reductions in lichen cover from shrub growth, and modeling studies predicting large-scale vegetation shifts in the low-Arctic from climate change. These vegetation changes have implications for caribou forage, wildfire regimes, and permafrost conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) south of Africa is a critical link in plate circuits between the Atlantic and Indian Ocean basins and between the Nubia and Somalia plates. Detailed reconstructions of its seafloor spreading history are challenging due to the low fidelity of its magnetic anomalies, which were mostly created at slow to ultraslow spreading rates, and gaps in data coverage for some areas of the ridge. Here, we describe the first high-resolution analysis of Quaternary/Neogene SWIR plate kinematics based on nearly 5000 identifications that we made of magnetic reversals C1n (0.78 Ma) to C6no (19.7 Ma) and ~6000 crossings of 21 fracture zones and transform faults that offset the ridge. We also outline the implications for estimates of motion between the Nubia and Somalia plates since 20 Ma across rifts in eastern Africa. Searches for the Nubia-Lwandle and Lwandle-Somalia plate boundaries north of the SWIR with our new data corroborate previous evidence for respective locations near the Andrew Bain transform fault at ~30°E and at ~50°E. Inversions of the abundant new data to find best-fitting rotations at ~1 Myr intervals since 20 Ma reveal a previously unknown, ~20% deceleration of seafloor spreading rates at 7.2±1 Ma everywhere along the SWIR. Motion since 7 Ma has remained remarkably steady and agrees within uncertainties with GPS estimates that are based on more than 100 continuous GPS sites on the Nubia, Somalia, and Antarctic plates. The consistency of the geodetic and geologic estimates validates both and also supports evidence we will describe for anomalously wide outward displacement west of ~30E. Nubia-Somalia rotations determined from our new model indicate that the two plates have undergone steady relative motion since at least 19 Ma. Our new rotation for C5n.2 predicts ~70% less opening across the East Africa rift since 11 Ma than the most recently published kinematic estimate, in better accord with at least one geologically-derived estimate for the total extension.",

            "abstract": "In order to fully interpret the chemistry occuring in aqueous aerosol, one must first explore how water influences the physical state of the condensed particle phase. Both the chemical dynamics and physical properties of aqueous aerosol are significantly influenced by the vapour-liquid partitioning of water. Furthermore, the rate of evaporation and condensation of water in atmospheric aerosol plays an important role in governing the size distribution and number concentration of aqueous particles and cloud droplets.\nWe present a study on single aerosol particles undergoing evaporation while confined in an electrodynamic balance. Precise time-resolved measurements of the particle radius allow us to elucidate the microphysical factors influencing water partitioning over a range of temperatures (248 - 330 K) and relative humidities (0 - 95 %).\nSpecifically, we explore the vapour pressure of pure water in supercooled conditions, establishing values over the widest range of supercooled temperatures assessed experimentally. We show that the mass accommodation and evaporation coefficients, analogous parameters describing the influence of the gas-liquid interface on mass transport, must be greater than 0.5 for uncontaminated water surfaces over the temperature range analysed. We go on to report the impact of insoluble organic monolayers at the gas / liquid interface in retarding the rate of evaporation of water, reducing the evaporation coefficient by up to five orders of magnitude. Such monolayers may also influence the uptake of reactive species from the gas phase, affecting the chemistry occuring at the droplet surface and in the bulk. Finally, we discuss how the water activity of aqueous organic solution droplets may be determined using the measured evaporation dynamics, allowing the hygroscopicity of aerosol at water activities approaching unity to be established with unprecedented accuracy. Compositional measurements under these conditions allow the chemistry occuring in dilute aerosol droplets to be interpreted more fully.",

Scientific investigations of these regions are challenged by extreme weather, limited and expensive logistics, and the physical conditions of the ice environment. We report on the next development of a new NSF MRI-supported community seismic capability for studying ice-covered regions– the Geophysical Earth Observatory for Ice Covered Environments (GEOICE). This project is fundamentally motivated by the need to densify and optimize the collection of high-quality data relevant to key solid Earth and cryosphere science questions. The instrument capability will include a hybrid seismograph pool of broadband and intermediate elements, for observation of both long-period (e.g., long-period surface waves and slow sources) and intermediate-to-short-period (e.g., teleseismic body waves local seismicity, impulsive or extended glaciogenic signals). The GEOICE instrument, and its power and other ancillary systems, will be specifically designed to both withstand conditions associated with icy environments, including cold/wet conditions and high-latitude solar limitations, and to require minimal installation time and logistical load (i.e., size and weight), while maximizing ease-of-use in the field, in data handling, and in telemetry compatibility. Key features will include a design that integrates the seismometer and data logger into a single environmentally and mechanically robust housing, very low power requirements (<~1 watt) for the intermediate-band systems, and advanced power/battery systems that optimize battery capacity and operational limits. The envisioned ~125 element GEOICE instruments will nearly double the current polar inventory of stations and will be maintained and supported at the IRIS PASSCAL Instrument Center to ensure full and flexible peer-reviewed community use.",

For stations having only temperature data (partial stations), the Hargreaves-Samani equation was used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration for a grass surface (ETo). The ETos and ETo results were different depending on the local climate, so two methods to estimate ETos from the ETo were tested. Substitution of missing solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity data from a nearby station within a similar microclimate was found to give better results than using a calibration factor that related ETos and ETo. Therefore, the substitution method was used to estimate ETos at “partial” stations having only temperature data.\nThe combination of 63 full and partial stations was sufficient to use GIS to map ETos for Sardinia. Three interpolation methods were studied, and the ordinary kriging model fitted the observed data better than a radial basis function or the inverse distance weighting method. Using station data points to create a regional map simplified the zonation of ETos when large scale computations were needed. Making a distinction based on ETos classes allows the simulation of crop water requirements for large areas and it can potentially lead to improved irrigation management and water savings. It also provides a baseline to investigate possible impact of climate change.",

To help resolve ET estimation accuracy with differing remote sensing models, a study was conducted over an irrigated crop in Central Arizona in 2009 and 2011. Using extensive ground moisture measurements over a 4.9 ha cotton field and seven airborne remote sensing flights, this study evaluated ET provided by two prominent approaches: the two-source energy balance model (TSEB) and the ‘Satellite-based energy balance for mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration’ model (METRIC). Both use thermal infrared data as essential inputs. However, TSEB is characterized by strong linkage to biophysics, while METRIC is distinguished by its use of contextual information. Based on soil moisture profile observations at 112 locations, and the same input remote sensing data, METRIC was found accurate to 2 mm/day in a majority of cases, while TSEB was similarly accurate at a 1.5 mm/day threshold. These accuracies were representative for emergent, full canopy, and late season cotton growth phases. TSEB and METRIC were similarly biased, ~ -0.7 mm/day. Considering similarity of results at field scale, model complexity, input data requirements, and ease of implementation, TSEB would be preferred for well-instrumented sites. In the case of data sparse sites, METRIC would be recommended as a robust ET approach. The role of land surface temperature uncertainty for modeling ET will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Reanalyses are often used to describe the state of the atmosphere over the tropical Eastern Pacific (EP) because of the lack of in situ observations. Vertical profiles of vertical motion, which can be used as a proxy for latent heating profiles, have been shown to have large variability between reanalyses in the EP intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), as well as a bottom heavy shape that contrasts with the top-heavy profile in the Western Pacific (WP) warm pool. At the same time, satellite-derived stratiform rain fractions are higher in convectively active portions of the EP than the WP, suggesting that a higher peak in latent heating (and thus vertical motion) should be seen in the EP. While the EP sees many more shallow precipitation systems than the WP, deep convection associated with synoptic waves still regularly occurs in the EP. The low-level peak in reanalysis vertical motion persists in the EP during El Niño, when precipitation systems become very similar to those in the WP. Additionally, comparison studies have shown a more top-heavy profile of heating derived from satellite retrieval algorithms than from reanalysis datasets, reinforcing the discrepancy.\nThe accuracy of vertical motion and heating profiles in the EP is important due to their relationship to large-scale circulations such as the Walker and Hadley cells, as well as the shallow meridional circulation that has been observed and modeled in the EP over the last decade and a half. Some implications for climate sensitivity have also been drawn from reanalysis vertical motion profiles in the EP, adding to the gravity of this issue. In order to determine why the variability in EP vertical motion and heating profiles is so large, as well as whether the bottom heavy profiles in reanalyses are accurate, we analyze and show results from a comparison of eight reanalysis datasets to ship borne radar observations from the Tropical Eastern Pacific Process Study (TEPPS) and satellite data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR) and the cloud profiling radar aboard CloudSat.",

To utilize the data in this system, it is necessary to examine the data carefully to discern its error characteristics and identify artifacts that can be removed by filtering. After filtering, a prognostic error model must be constructed to estimate the uncertainty in each observation. Then the data must be aggregated, and representativeness error estimated, to match the observations to the scale of feature that can be represented in the aerosol model. Finally, observations from multiple sources must be combined to optimize observation impact. This talk describes these steps for the VIIRS aerosol EDR data over ocean, including construction of the prognostic error model and evaluation of model skill, comparison of VIIRS and MODIS data to identify artifacts and evaluate data quality, and evaluation of NAAPS analysis skill using assimilated MODIS, VIIRS, and a combination of both sensors. Methods for combining observations from different sources, and the implications of these choices for data assimilation, are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Diamond, along with coesite, has been discovered recently in the continental crustal rocks of the European Variscan orogenic belt, namely the Bohemian Massif (BM). In addition to the garnet-phengite gneiss in Germany, western BM, microdiamond occurs in major rock forming minerals – garnet, kyanite – and in zircon in ultrahigh-pressure rocks overprinted under high-pressure granulite facies conditions (c. 16-20 kbar, c. 1000°C) in the northern and eastern BM. Well-preserved 10-30 μm-sized microdiamonds from northern BM exhibit diverse morphologies (SEM data) depending upon the host rock type. Octahedral diamond occurs in felsic garnet-kyanite-feldspar-quartz rock (metasediment), whereas intermediate garnet-clinopyroxene-feldspar-quartz rock contains a cubo-octahedral variety. Diamond morphology can be thus controlled by solid impurities available in the medium of crystallization (K- vs. Ca-bearing fluids or melts), as shown by experiments. Pointed-bottom negatively oriented trigonal etch pits on the octahedral diamond faces developed due to diamond resorption at CO2-dominated environment (less than 50 wt % of H2O, experimental data), possibly by action of a residual fluid. SIMS determined δ13C values range from -22 to -21 ‰ for the felsic rock and from – 26 to – 33 for the intermediate one, corresponding to the typical range of organic carbon δ13C and inconsistent with a significant mantle carbon (δ13C ~ - 5 ‰) input. Diamond-bearing domains in zircon, also analysed by SIMS, yielded a Variscan U-Pb age of c. 340 Ma. The present stage of knowledge allows us to conclude that (i) metamorphic diamonds in the BM occur in lithologies of metasedimentary character, and their carbon source was organic; (ii) crustal-derived CO2-rich fluids with impurities played an important role in diamond formation and dissolution; (iii) diamonds formed during the Variscan orogenic cycle and (iv) diamonds are best preserved in the external domain of the Variscan orogenic belt.",

The Rosetta spacecraft will follow Comet 67P/C-G along its trajectory through the inner solar system, giving us an unprecedented view of this dusty plasma environment. On board Rosetta is an Ion and Electron Sensor (IES) intended to measure plasma ions and electrons between ~4 eV/q and 22 keV/q. However, it is also speculated whether IES can measure charged dust grains with the correct energy-per-charge (E/q). Preliminary results [Skego et al., 2014] show that some dust grains originating from the comet and then becoming charged, likely possess the correct E/q for IES detection. However, until now, the question of microchannel plate (MCP) detection system effectiveness/efficiency in detecting these grains has been neglected. Lacking experimental results, we use current MCP models to explore the detection efficiencies of Rosetta IES to charged dust grains. We present our results, estimate fluxes, and provide a strong case for future experimental work in this field.",

Subduction of the thick delta strata has generated a large subaerial accretionary prism, up to 250 km wide, with multiple ranges of anticlines composed of the folded and faulted delta sediments. As the wedge has grown, the exposed anticlines have become subject to erosion by the rivers draining the Himalaya, a local Indo-Burman drainage network, and coastal processes. Multiple lines of geophysical, geologic, and geomorphologic evidence indicate anticline truncation as a result of interaction with the rivers of the delta and sea level. Seismic lines, geologic mapping, and geomorphology reveal truncated anticlines with angular unconformities that have been arched due to continued growth of the anticline. Buried, truncated anticlines have been identified by seismic lines, tube well logs, and resistivity measurements. The truncation of these anticlines also appears to provide a pathway for high-As Holocene groundwater into the generally low-As Pleistocene groundwater. Overall, the distribution of anticline erosion and elevation in the fold belt appears to be consistent with glacial-interglacial changes in river behavior in the delta. The anticline crests are eroded during sea level highstands as rivers and the coastline sweep across the region, and excavated by local drainage during lowstands. With continued growth, the anticlines are uplifted above the delta and “survive” as topographic features. As a result, the maximum elevations of the anticlines are clustered in a pattern suggesting continued growth since their last glacial highstand truncation. An uplift rate is calculated from this paced truncation and growth that is consistent with other measurements of Indo-Burman wedge advance. This rate, combined with the proposed method of truncation, give further evidence of dynamic fluvial changes in the delta between glacial and interglacial times.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the prospects of utilizing offshore freshwater in continental shelf oil production. Petroleum engineers have recently shown that tertiary water floods using freshwater can enhance oil recovery by as much as 18% (Morrow and Buckley, 2011). Hydrogeologists recently estimated that up to 5x105 km3of fresh to brackish water are sequestered in shallow ( < 500 m) permeable sands and carbonate reservoirs within 80 km of the present-day coastline around the world (Post et al., 2013). Most of the offshore freshwater was emplaced during the Pleistocene during periods of sea level low stands and when ice sheets over ran passive margins at high latitudes.\nWe have analyzed a series of continental shelf cross sections from around the world estimating the average freshwater volume emplaced with distance offshore. We compare the distribution of fresh-brackish water with distance from the coastline to oil platform locations in order to assess the economic viability of this energy-water nexus. We also discuss a project that is currently underway within the North Sea (Clair Ridge) to field validate this concept. We present a series of variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport simulations that are intended to assess how long freshwater resources could be produced in an offshore environment using horizontal drilling technologies before seawater invades the well. We considered a 100m thick freshwater reservoir sandwiched between two 200-300m thick confining units. We pumped the horizontal well at a rate of 5.4 m3/day (1 gpm per meter of well). The resulting drawdown was less than 5 m at the well head (r=0.15 m). For a 1000 m long horizontal well, this resulted in the production of 5455 m3/day of fresh water (over 34,000 barrels per day). Concentrations increased at the wellhead by about 5000 mg/l after 20 years of continuous pumping using a reservoir permeability of 10-13 m2. This simulation demonstrates that where freshwater is available it is likely that it can be produced in commercially viable quantities to support tertiary water floods.",

            "abstract": "We are mapping the topography of upper mantle seismic discontinuities beneath the North Atlantic and surrounding regions by using precursor arrivals to PP and SS seismic waves that reflect off the seismic discontinuities. Numerous source-receiver combinations have been used in order to collect a large dataset of reflection points beneath our investigation area. We analysed over 1700 seismograms from MW>5.8 events using array seismic methods to enhance the signal to noise ratio. The measured time lag between PP (SS) arrivals and their corresponding precursors on robust stacks are used to measure the depth of the transition zone boundaries. The reflectors’ depths show a correlation between the location of known hotspots and a significantly depressed 410 km discontinuity indicating a temperature increase of 50-300 K compared to the surrounding mantle. For the 660 km discontinuity three distinct behaviours are visible: i) normal depths beneath Greenland and at a distance of a few hundred kilometres away from known hotspots, ii) shallower 660 km discontinuity compared with the global average value near hotspots closer to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and iii) very few observations of a 660 km discontinuity at the hotspot locations. We interpret our observations as a large upwelling beneath the southern parts of our study region, possibly due to the South Atlantic convection cell. The thermal anomaly may be blocked by endothermic phase transformation and likely does not extend through the top of the transition zone except for those branches which appear as the Azores, Canaries and Cape Verde hotspots at the surface.",

            "abstract": "Solar wind plasmas have been observed to host a population of magnetic discontinuities associated with turbulent fluctuations and solar atmospheric processes. These thin current sheets, which may be subject to a tearing instability, can heat the plasma and accelerate particles via magnetic reconnection, and indeed have observed correlations with energetic particles. Further correlations of observations of thin, ion-scale current sheets with local temperature anisotropies invite an exploration of the role of ion kinetic instabilities in their evolution and associated heating processes, particularly when coupled with a turbulent medium such as the solar wind. Recent work has demonstrated that proton temperature anisotropy plays an important role in the growth and evolution of the two-dimensional, collisionless tearing instability, for example via the growth of background ion cyclotron and fire hose instabilities. Here, we present results of a three-dimensional extension of this investigation using three-dimensional hybrid simulations of current sheets in Harris equilibrium. We demonstrate the emergence of persistent three-dimensional structures and instabilities which significantly alter the development of the tearing instability, including i) patchy reconnection sites formed by break up of initially two-dimensional x-lines, and ii) narrow-band kink of the current sheet in the current-carrying direction by the growth of a drift-kink instability. We discuss the relative growth rates of tearing and drift-kink instabilities for a range of background and current sheet temperature anisotropies and guide fields, quantify local ion heating, and present potential observational signatures. We also examine the character of turbulence generated by the interaction of multiple ion-scale current sheets in three-dimensions.",

            "abstract": "Because of Mercury’s high eccentricity, nearly zero obliquity, and 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, the planet’s surface is characterized by an average insolation pattern resulting in longitudinal and latitudinal temperature variations that can be expressed in terms of the (2,0), (2,2) and (4,0) harmonics [Vasavada et al., 1999]. We show that the temperature anomalies that propagate from the surface into the deep mantle can be used to interpret the above harmonics of the geoid and topography spectra in terms of the elastic response of the lithosphere and mantle. Using 3D numerical simulations of thermal evolution constrained by MESSENGER observations [Tosi et al., 2013], we first demonstrate that mantle convection either ceased in the past or, at most, is very weak at present, implying that the mantle is in a conductive or nearly-conductive state. As a consequence, the power spectra of the geoid and topography due to present-day mantle convection only are orders of magnitude smaller than the observed ones. We assume therefore that present-day heat transport in the mantle occurs primarily via thermal conduction and numerically solve the diffusion equation in a 3D spherical shell with variable surface temperature and internal heat sources partitioned between the mantle and a crust of variable thickness according to different enrichment factors. We obtain a set of temperature distributions that are employed to calculate the deformation of a compressible elastic layer overlying a quasi-hydrostatic mantle in which shear stresses are assumed to be relaxed and deformation solely induced by thermal and mechanical compressibility. The surface displacements calculated with this model are then compared against the observed topography, while the internal density anomalies and the displacements of the surface and core-mantle boundary are used to calculate Mercury’s geoid. We thoroughly explore the parameter space by varying the thickness of the boundary between the elastic and quasi-hydrostatic layers, the lithosphere’s elastic parameters and the coefficient of thermal expansion. Our model can reproduce more than 90% of the observed low-degree geoid and topography thereby allowing us to constrain the effective thickness of Mercury’s elastic lithosphere.",

We use a modified Stommel box model to study the fundamental relationship between overturning decline and fluxes of heat and freshwater. The box model—calibrated with GCM outputs—is able to reproduce a positive connection between control AMOC and the change in AMOC under the conditions of heat flux forcing. In addition, previous studies have noted that GCMs with larger AMOC often reach quasi-equilibrium overturning values faster than those that do not. This is true in the box model representation as well, with the sensitivity being most pronounced in the cases of large surface temperature coupling. We discuss the box model results in the context of prior work supporting the dominance of heat flux relative to the freshwater flux forcing of the projected AMOC decline.",

To achieve this goal, the GMAO undertakes model and assimilation development, generates products to support NASA instrument teams and the NASA Earth science program. Currently Atmospheric Data Assimilation System (ADAS) in the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5(GEOS-5) system combines millions of observations and short-term forecasts to determine the best estimate, or analysis, of the instantaneous atmospheric state.\nHowever, ADAS has been geared towards utilization of observations in clear sky conditions and the majority of satellite channel data affected by clouds are discarded. Microwave imager data from satellites can be a significant source of information for clouds and precipitation but the data are presently underutilized, as only surface rain rates from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) are assimilated with small weight assigned in the analysis process. As clouds and precipitation often occur in regions with high forecast sensitivity, improvements in the temperature, moisture, wind and cloud analysis of these regions are likely to contribute to significant gains in numerical weather prediction accuracy.\nThis presentation is intended to give an overview of GMAO’s recent progress in assimilating the all-sky GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) radiance data in GEOS-5 system. This includes development of various new components to assimilate cloud and precipitation affected data in addition to data in clear sky condition. New observation operators, quality controls, moisture control variables, observation and background error models, and a methodology to incorporate the linearlized moisture physics in the assimilation system are described. In addition preliminary results showing impacts of assimilating all-sky GMI data on GEOS-5 forecasts are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Drilling operations and extraction of oil and gas (O&G) may lead to subsurface slumping or compression of sediments due to reduced vertical principal stress which may lead to small earthquakes at the drilling site. O&G extraction is common in the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGM) and only thirty-five earthquakes of magnitudes between 2.3 and 6.0 have been recorded in the area from 1974 to the present. The purpose of this research is to detect more earthquakes using stacks of seismic data from the EarthScope Transportable USArray (TA) from 2011 to 2013, and determine the spatiotemporal relationship between the detected earthquakes and O&G extraction. TA waveform records were retrieved from IRIS database and a narrow bandpass filter of 1 – 2 Hz was applied to remove background and high frequency noises and focus on the low energy part of the signal. The seismic record at all stations was plotted vertically with respect to distance from the Gulf. An Automatic Gain Control (AGC) using Root Mean Square was applied to boost the signals at farther stations. More than 1500 events have been detected, including teleseisms and local blasts from the area, especially from the three Walter Minerals coal mines in Alabama. No offshore earthquakes have been detected in the data, although data processing is still ongoing. Therefore, any earthquake activity, if present, associated with the offshore oil and gas production must be at a magnitude below the detection threshold of the algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Sensitivity analysis aims to characterize the impact that changes in model input factors (e.g. the parameters) have on the model output (e.g. simulated streamflow). It is a valuable diagnostic tool for model understanding and for model improvement, it enhances calibration efficiency, and it supports uncertainty and scenario analysis. It is of particular interest for environmental models because they are often complex, non-linear, non-monotonic and exhibit strong interactions between their parameters.\nHowever, sensitivity analysis has to be carefully implemented to produce reliable results at moderate computational cost. For example, sample size can have a strong impact on the results and has to be carefully chosen. Yet, there is little guidance available for this step in environmental modelling. The objective of the present study is to provide guidelines for a robust sensitivity analysis, in order to support modellers in making appropriate choices for its implementation and in interpreting its outcome.\nWe considered hydrological models with increasing level of complexity. We tested four sensitivity analysis methods, Regional Sensitivity Analysis, Method of Morris, a density-based (PAWN) and a variance-based (Sobol) method. The convergence and variability of sensitivity indices were investigated. We used bootstrapping to assess and improve the robustness of sensitivity indices even for limited sample sizes. Finally, we propose a quantitative validation approach for sensitivity analysis based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics.",

            "abstract": "Energetic particle injections in the near-Earth plasma sheet are critical for supplying particles and energy to the radiation belts and ring current. Their origin, however, has been elusive due to the lack of equatorial, multi-point observations. After the launch of NASA’s Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission in 2007, intense electric fields and elevated energetic particle fluxes have been observed to accompany localized (1-4 RE wide) bursty bulk flows and to propagate from the mid-tail regions (at geocentric radial distances R > 25RE) towards Earth, up to and at times inside of geosynchronous orbit (GEO, R=6.6RE). Motivated by these observations, we model simultaneous multi-point observations of electron injections using guiding center approximation in prescribed but realistic electric and magnetic fields to better understand the nature of their acceleration. Modeling of electron injections assuming a localized, impulsive, dipolarizing flux bundle and its accompanying electric field transported from mid-tail to near-Earth at bursty flow speeds successfully reproduces the observations at multiple spacecraft. The impulsive, localized nature of the earthward-propagating electromagnetic pulse with attending vortical/tailward flow is what makes this model particularly effective in reproducing both the injection and the dispersed decrease in energy flux often observed simultaneously with the injection but at lower energies (~10-30 keV). The results suggest that particle acceleration and transport towards the inner magnetosphere can be thought of as a superposition of individual bursts of varying intensity and cadence depending on global geomagnetic activity levels.",

            "abstract": "Floodplain storage of organic carbon is an important aspect of the global carbon cycle that is not well understood or quantified. Although it is understood that rivers transport organic carbon to the ocean, little is known about the quantity of stored carbon in boreal floodplains and the influence of fluvial processes on this storage. We present results on total organic carbon (TOC) content within the floodplains of two rivers, the Dall River and Preacher Creek, in the central Yukon River Basin in the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge of Alaska. The results indicate that organic carbon storage is influenced by fluvial disturbance and grain size. The Dall River, which contains a large amount of floodplain carbon, is meandering and incised, with well-developed floodplain soils, a greater percentage of relatively old floodplain surfaces and a slower floodplain turnover time, and finer grain sizes. Preacher Creek stores less TOC, transports coarser grain sizes, and has higher rates of avulsion and floodplain turnover time. Within the floodplain of a particular river, large spatial heterogeneity in TOC content also exists as a function of depositional environment and age and vegetation community of the site. In addition, saturated regions of the floodplains, such as abandoned channels and oxbow lakes, contain more TOC compared to drier floodplain environments. Frozen alluvial soils likely contain carbon that could be released into the environment with melting permafrost, and thus quantifying the organic carbon content in the active layer of floodplain soils could provide insight into the characteristics of the permafrost beneath. The hydrology in these regions is changing due to permafrost melt, and floodplain areas usually saturated could be dried out, causing breakdown and outgassing of carbon stored in previously saturated soils. Ongoing work will result in a first-order estimate of active-layer floodplain carbon storage for the central Yukon River Basin.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that salt application to roads and parking lots in winter is driving a rise in chloride concentrations in streams in the northeastern United States. Our research focuses specifically on salt dynamics in stormwater detention basins, which receive runoff directly from parking lots and detain it before it reaches the stream. The four study basins are located on the Cornell University campus in Ithaca, NY USA. Between summer 2012 and 2014, soil electrical conductivity was continuously monitored inside and outside the basins using Decagon 5TE sensors and dataloggers. In two basins which drain stormwater quickly, conductivity levels changed minimally over the year. However, in the other two basins which drain much slower and often are saturated, conductivity increased through the winter, peaking at 8-10 mS/cm, and then took several months to decrease to baseline levels; thus the basins served as a source of salt to outflowing water even into the summer. This annual variation in soil salinity has implications for plant and microbial communities living in these basins. Research by colleagues has indicated that changing salinity can alter microbial communities and impact biogeochemical processes that play a role in water quality remediation. Thus we are also investigating the impact of salinity on denitrification rates in these basins. All of this information will help us understand what role stormwater detention basins are playing in controlling fluxes of road salt in watersheds, as well as how changing salinity influences the ecosystem services provided by these basins.",

            "abstract": "The potential impact of climate variability and change on the spread of infectious disease is of increasingly critical concern to public health. Newly-available remote sensing datasets may be combined with predictive modeling to develop new capabilities to mitigate risks of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, leishmaniasis, and rift valley fever. We have developed improved remote sensing-based products for monitoring water bodies and inundation dynamics that have potential utility for improving risk forecasts of vector-borne disease epidemics. These products include daily and seasonal surface inundation based on the global mappings of inundated area fraction derived at the 25-km scale from active and passive microwave instruments ERS, QuikSCAT, ASCAT, and SSM/I data – the Satellite Water Microwave Product Series (SWAMPS). Focusing on the East African region, we present validation of this product using multi-temporal classification of inundated areas in this region derived from high resolution PALSAR (100m) and Landsat (30m) observations. We assess historical occurrence of malaria in the east African country of Eritrea with respect to the time series SWAMPS datasets, and we aim to construct a framework for use of these new datasets to improve prediction of future malaria risk in this region.\nThis work is supported through funding from the NASA Applied Sciences Program, the NASA Terrestrial Ecology Program, and the NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Program.

            "abstract": "We present a database of all 10-Be ages dating Greenland ice-sheet (GIS) retreat, enabling (1) better understanding of late deglacial through mid-Holocene behavior of the GIS and (2) independent verification of a prominent ice-sheet model. Several regions in southern and southeastern Greenland show instantaneous deglaciation within uncertainty, suggesting retreat from the coast to the present ice margin occurred over several centuries or less. Regions in western Greenland indicate slower deglaciation, with retreat taking up to several millennia. In three locations (Scoresby Sund, Johannes Jensen Land, and Kangerlussuaq), early deglaciation to the coast (by 15 ka) is observed. This variability may result from regional variation in climate or bedrock topography, leading to different rates of ice retreat. A comparison of the overall distribution of 10-Be ages with temperature records from ice cores and the ocean reveals deglaciation in Greenland is particularly sensitive to ocean warming from 15-8 ka, although atmospheric warming at the time also contributed to ice retreat. Peak deglaciation occurred at 12-11 ka during peak ocean warmth, with a secondary peak at 8-7 ka. The Huy2 ice-sheet model of the last deglaciation of the GIS shows deglacial peaks at similar times (10.5 ka and 7.5 ka) as the 10-Be ages. However, the earlier deglaciation in 10-Be ages is not reflected in the model, and nearly all 10-Be ages are older than their respective ice-sheet model ages. This may be due to systematic inheritance within 10-Be samples, but tight clustering of 10-Be ages suggests these represent actual deglaciation ages instead of random inheritance. Alternately, the model may under-predict deglaciation age due to its relatively coarse resolution, preventing it from including finer-scale topography which may significantly influence ice sheet behavior. The model also does not include ocean temperature forcing, which may have been an important forcing in driving GIS retreat when the ice margins were marine terminating. Future ice-sheet modeling should include oceanic effects to test this hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "North Africa is the world’s largest dust source region influencing regional and global climate, human health, and even the local economy. However North Africa as a dust source is not uniform but it consists of the arid region (Sahara) and the semi-arid region (Sahel) with emission rates depending on meteorological and surface conditions. Several recent studies have shown that dust from North Africa seems to have a decreasing trend in the past three decades. The goal of this study is to better understand the controlling factors that determine the change of dust in North Africa using observational data and model simulations. First we analyze surface bareness conditions determined from a long-term satellite observed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for 1980-2008. Then we examine the key meteorological variables of precipitation and surface winds. Modeling experiments were conducted using the NASA Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model, which has been recently updated with a dynamic dust source function. Using the method we separate the dust originating from the Sahel from that of the Sahara desert. We find that the surface wind speed is the most dominant factor affecting Sahelian dust emission while vegetation has a modulating effect. We will show regional differences in meteorological variables, surface conditions, dust emission, and dust distribution and address the relationships among meteorology, surface conditions, and dust emission/loading in the past three decades (1980-2008).",

Changing boundary conditions in erosional catchments transmit signals down system to be encoded in stratigraphy as variation in cosmogenic isotope concentrations and, potentially, patterns in depositional architecture. We examine a linked catchment-fan system on the western flank of the Panamint Mountains, California, using cosmogenic nuclides to quantify modern and paleo-sediment flux from catchment to fan in order to test coupling between sediment supply rates and preserved stratigraphic patterns.\nWe measure 26Al/10Be in quartz from: 1) modern sediment in active channels at two drainage basin outlets, and 2) vertical transects through outcrops of mid-Pleistocene alluvial fan sediments. 10Be concentrations in modern sediment establish baseline catchment-averaged denudation rates, and allow comparison of contemporary rates to published late Quaternary denudation rates. 26Al/10Be ratios from mid-Pleistocene outcrops provide an age model, while 10Be concentrations yield a record of paleodenudation. Isotope concentration variability/contribution from modern production is assessed with paired samples from equivalent stratigraphic intervals and paired shielded-unshielded samples.\nWe constrain the areal extent of the paleo-Pleasant Canyon fan complex using empirical relationships from modern catchment-fan systems in the region. These fan-area estimates were combined with sedimentologic facies and process interpretations derived from high-resolution characterization of the outcrop to reconstruct stacking patterns and a baselevel history utilized in a depositional model helping to contextualize paleodenudation rates.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes occurring in oblique tectonic settings often partition between several faults that accommodate different components of the total motion. The 2002 Mw 7.9 Denali strike-slip earthquake, which azimuth varies by more than 50° over the 341 km total rupture length, offers a unique opportunity to look at partitioning in details, thanks to a large seismological dataset. Using a kinematic model that incorporates the obliquity of the plate-motion direction relative to the local fault azimuth, we show that the co-seismic deformation is consistent with the general northwestward displacement of the Wrangell block relative to stable North America. Hence we quantify the efficiency of the Denali fault to accommodate such oblique far field tectonic conditions by defining a coefficient of accommodation Ca, and we evaluate how much remains to be accommodated by distributed deformation off the strike-slip fault. We represent the distributed deformation using strain rosette for a catalog of 735 focal mechanisms between 1987 and 2011. We show that in oblique settings, such as in the Denali case, the aftershocks and the background seismicity are organized to accommodate the deformation that is not localized on the Denali strike-slip fault during the main earthquakes. Actually the westward increase of the obliquity increases the amount of such deformation accommodated through distributed thrust faults, leading to the westward widening of the Alaska Range.\nIn addition we use a simple 2D boundary element elastic model to investigate the difference between geodetic data, showing a rotation of the block south of the fault, and our oblique boundary conditions. We show that it is possible to reproduce the rotation of such block while it is subjected to a northwestward oblique displacement applied on the curved Denali fault system.",

While gaps in in situ data coverage are expected to continue in the foreseeable future, satellite data are available over these regions, and some studies have shown the potential usefulness of satellite data to mitigate the impact of these gaps in in situdata. Thus it is important to systematically evaluate the potential utility of satellite data in gap filling, such as using the NOAA NCDC’s 2-m air temperature dataset retrieved from NOAA POES satellite’s HIRS measurements.\nComparisons of monthly gridded HIRS T2m to NOAATemp will be presented.

            "abstract": "Accurate prediction of lightning flash rate is essential to successfully parameterize the production of nitrogen oxides by lightning (LNOx). In this study, new flash rate parameterization schemes are developed using observations of 10 Colorado thunderstorms from the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) and the CHILL Microphysical Investigation of Electrification (CHILL-MIE) field projects. Storm total flash rates were determined by automated clustering of lightning mapping array (LMA)-detected radiation sources. Storm parameters, including hydrometeor and reflectivity echo volumes, ice masses, and measurements of updraft strength were obtained from polarimetric radar retrievals and dual-Doppler derived wind fields. Echo volumes exhibited a particularly strong correlation to flash rate (R2 = 0.78 for 30-dBZ echo volume).\nIt is shown that existing flash rate schemes tend to underestimate flash rate for the storms in this study. New parameterizations developed based on the graupel echo volume, the precipitating ice mass (graupel and hail), and the 30-dBZ echo volume within the mixed-phase region of storms predicted flash rate trends reasonably well. However, there were sometimes large errors in the prediction of flash rate magnitudes, possibly due to fluctuations in storm updraft intensity. Updraft-based flash schemes were developed but significantly underestimated flash rate for the storms studied. It is shown that very high flash rates correlate differently to updraft strength than low flash rates. We hypothesize why this behavior is observed. The use of multiple storm parameters to predict flash rate was also investigated, and the results are improved somewhat compared to single-parameter schemes. New flash schemes were tested for storms outside of Colorado to examine their potential regional dependence. Finally, observations of the relationship between flash rate and flash size are discussed, with implications for the improved prediction of LNOx.",

Interpreted LULC maps were produced for three points in time (1975, 2000, 2013), and LULC change statistics extracted from them. (2) The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used as a proxy for bioproductivity and temporal trends of annual mean, maximum and minimum NDVI extracted at the sampling dots of known LULC for the period 2000-2013. The trends were analyzed with respect to the most prominent LULC classes and transitions, in particular from agriculture to natural vegetation and vice versa, and stratified by regions of similar mean annual precipitation.\nThe most important LULC change over the almost 40-year period is a progressive expansion of agricultural lands, which has been responsible for major incursions into the region's remaining savannas and woodlands. To a lesser extent, abandonment of agriculture has given rise to long term fallow and eventually reversion to steppe or savanna. Another important change observed is the expansion of open steppe at the expense of savanna in the Sahel region. In terms of bioproductivity, while no significant trends in NDVI predominate overall, there are more instances of positive than of negative significant trends across the region. Contrary to our initial expectations, preliminary results show little systematic association between LULC change and direction and magnitude of trends in NDVI over the same time period 2000-2013. Though drastically altering vegetation composition and biodiversity, the expansion of agriculture into savanna is not found to be associated with a widespread loss of bioproductivity.",

In order to examine the relationship between nitrogen dry deposition and wildfire, we applied regression analysis to the annual dry deposition of an Alaska boreal forest and annual burned area in Alaska for the 1999-2013 period. Furthermore, we estimated long-term nitrogen dry deposition for the past 54 years (1950-2013) at the same Alaska boreal forest, using an obtained regression equation and annual burned area. We used the data for annual nitrogen dry deposition (nitric acid, particulate nitrate, and particulate ammonium) measured at the CASTNET station (DEN417) in Denali National Park, available for 1999-2013. The annual burned area data for Alaska were referred to in previous reports (Todd and Jewkes, 2006; AICC, 2013). Nitrogen dry depositions at DEN417 were strongly correlated with the annual burned area in Alaska, where that area explained more than 68 % of the variation in annual nitrogen dry deposition. The background dry depositions defined as intercepts in the regression equations were 4.70, 0.24, and 2.15 mg m-2 year-1 for nitric acid, particulate nitrate, and particulate ammonium, respectively. Assuming that the increase in observed dry deposition above the background level (7.09 mg N m-2 year-1) was equal to nitrogen dry deposition originated from wildfire, we estimated that wildfire contributions to nitrogen dry deposition were 14 ± 20 % in 1999-2013. The long-term reproduction of nitrogen dry deposition revealed an increase in wildfire enhanced nitrogen dry deposition of up to 20 % for the 2000s, compared to the previous decadal age. The regression analysis and long-term reproduction in this study showed that the increase of wildfires in Alaska since 2000 has significantly enhanced the nitrogen dry deposition at DEN417.",

In this presentation we use the high-resolution heliospheric version of the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model (LFM-helio) driven by the latest generation of Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) coronal solutions. We investigate the radial development of a number of major structures in observations and in our model. We compare the strength of magnetic field compressions as a function of the coronal boundary variables (solar wind speed, density and temperature) and study the complexity of sector boundary crossings at different heliospheric distances. In many cases the crossings become more complex (multiple crossings within a few hours to days) between MESSENGER and L1; in other cases, the crossings are already complex at MESSENGER. In addition, in some cases short periods (a few hours to a day) of predominantly radial field magnetic field are observed. In many of these cases there is a question as to whether the observed structures exist in the corona (and if so whether they are reproduced by WSA) or are produced as the solar wind progresses toward Earth. We attempt to investigate these issues by imposing additional perturbations on top of the WSA coronal solutions, track their evolution and consider whether the observations can be reproduced.",

            "abstract": "Climate and hydrology models are regularly applied to assess potential changes in water resources and to inform adaptation decisions. An increasingly common question is, “What if we are wrong?” While climate models show substantial agreement on metrics such as pressure, temperature, and wind, they are notoriously uncertain in projecting precipitation change. The response to that uncertainty varies depending on the water management context and the nature of the uncertainty. In the southwestern U.S., large storage reservoirs (relative to annual supply) and general expectations of decreasing precipitation have guided extensive discussion on water management towards uncertainties in annual-scale water balances, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. In contrast, smaller reservoirs and little expectation for change in annual precipitation have focused discussions of Pacific Northwest water management toward shifts in runoff seasonality. The relative certainty of temperature impacts on snowpacks compared to the substantial uncertainty in precipitation has yielded a consistent narrative on earlier snowmelt. This narrative has been reinforced by a perception of essentially the same behavior in the historical record. This perception has led to calls in the political arena for more reservoir storage to replace snowpack storage for water supplies. Recent findings on differences in trends in precipitation at high versus low elevations, however, has recalled the uncertainty in precipitation futures and generated questions about alternative water management strategies. An important question with respect to snowpacks is whether the precipitation changes matter in the context of such substantial projections for temperature change. Here we apply an empirical snowpack model to analyze spatial differences in the uncertainty of snowpack responses to temperature and precipitation forcing across the Pacific Northwest U.S. The analysis reveals a strong geographic gradient in uncertainty of snowpack response to future climate, from the coastal regions, where precipitation uncertainty is relatively inconsequential for snowpack changes, to interior mountains where minor uncertainties in precipitation are on par with expected changes relative to temperature.",

            "abstract": "The application of a recently developed proton-reflection magnetometry technique to MESSENGER spacecraft observations at Mercury has yielded two significant findings. First, loss-cone observations directly confirm particle precipitation to Mercury’s surface and indicate that solar wind plasma persistently bombards the planet not only in the magnetic cusp regions but over a large fraction of the southern hemisphere. Second, the inferred surface field strengths independently confirm the north-south asymmetry in Mercury’s global magnetic field structure first documented from observations of magnetic equator crossings. Here we extend this work with 1.5 additional years of observations (i.e., to 2.5 years in all) to further probe Mercury’s surface magnetic field and better resolve proton flux precipitation to the planet's surface. We map regions where proton loss cones are observed; these maps indicate regions where protons precipitate directly onto the surface. The augmentation of our data set over that used in our original study allows us to examine the proton loss cones in cells of dimension 10° latitude by 20° longitude in Mercury body-fixed coordinates. We observe a transition from double-sided to single-sided loss cones in the pitch-angle distributions; this transition marks the boundary between open and closed field lines. At the surface this boundary lies between 60° and 70°N. Our observations allow the estimation of surface magnetic field strengths in the northern cusp region and the calculation of incident proton fluxes to both hemispheres. In the northern cusp, our regional-scale observations are consistent with an offset dipole field and a dipole moment of 190 nT RM3, where RM is Mercury’s radius, implying that any regional-scale variations in surface magnetic field strengths are either weak relative to the dipole field or occur at length scales smaller than the resolution of our observations (~300 km). From the global proton flux map (north of 40° S) derived from proton loss-cone measurements, we find an increase in proton flux near 0° and 180° planetary longitudes. This pattern is consistent with that expected from the combined effects of increased incident solar wind density at these longitudes at local noon (given the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance of Mercury) and phasing of MESSENGER’s orbit.",

Changing land surfaces repartitions latent and sensible energy surface fluxes and inadvertently results in changes to the regional climate. In this study, we examined the impacts of land-use change on the meteorology and climate in the South Platte River Basin, a region sensitive to water-use management.\nWRF-ARW v3.4.1 was used to downscale the reanalysis of a climatologically normal summer (2010) to 0.5 km horizontal resolution over the SPRB. To analyze meteorological and climatological effects of land-use changes in northeastern Colorado, a control run where no changes to the input data was compared with a run which changed land-use index from anthropogenic-influenced landscapes back to their original vegetative land cover. Notable changes in the Bowen ratio around urban and irrigated lands as well as an enhancement of the mountain-valley circulation east of the Rocky Mountains were observed due to land-use changes. Output from the control run of the WRF simulation were used as a baseline for running a simulation to 2100 using a newly-developed multi-scale modeling framework based on the Community Earth System Model, which explicitly resolves convection in global climate model grid cells. Results of changing IDF curves over the 21st century can be compared with results shown in national and international documents such as the National Climate Assessment and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports and used as planning tools for optimizing the balance of water management between agriculture communities and municipalities in Colorado.",

            "abstract": "The National Archive of Marine Seismic Surveys (NAMSS) was established by the USGS in 2004 in an effort to rescue marine seismic reflection profile data acquired largely by the oil exploration industry throughout the US outer continental shelf (OCS). It features a Web interface for easy on-line geographic search and download. The commercial value of these data had decreased significantly because of drilling moratoria and newer acquisition technology, and large quantities were at risk of disposal. But, the data still had tremendous value for scientific research and education purposes, and an effort was undertaken to ensure that the data were preserved and publicly available.\nMore recently, the USGS and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) have developed a partnership to make similarly available a much larger quantity of 2D and 3D seismic data acquired by the U.S. government for assessment of resources in the OCS. Under Federal regulation, BOEM is required to publicly release all processed geophysical data, including seismic profiles, acquired under an exploration permit, purchased and retained by BOEM, no sooner than 25 years after issuance of the permit. Data acquired prior to 1989 are now eligible for release. Currently these data are distributed on CD or DVD, but data discovery can be tedious. Inclusion of these data within NAMSS vastly increases the amount of seismic data available for research purposes.\nA new NAMSS geographical interface provides easy and intuitive access to the data library. The interface utilizes OpenLayers, Mapnik, and the Django web framework. In addition, metadata capabilities have been greatly increased using a PostgresSQL/PostGIS database incorporating a community-developed ISO-compliant XML template. The NAMSS database currently contains 452 2D seismic surveys comprising 1,645,956 line km and nine 3D seismic surveys covering 9,385 square km. The 2D data holdings consist of stack, migrated and depth sections, most in SEG-Y format.",

            "abstract": "The core idea behind rainfall retrievals from commercial microwave link networks is to measure the decrease in power due to attenuation of the electromagnetic signal by raindrops along the link path. Accurate rainfall measurements are of vital importance in hydrological applications, for instance, flash-flood early-warning systems, agriculture, and climate modeling. Hence, such an alternative technique fulfills the need for measurements with higher resolution in time and space, especially in places where standard rain gauge-networks are scarce or poorly maintained.\nRainfall estimation via commercial microwave link networks, at country-wide scales, has recently been demonstrated. Despite their potential applicability in rainfall estimation at higher spatiotemporal resolutions, the uncertainties present in link-based rainfall maps are not yet fully comprehended. Now we attempt to quantify the inherent sources of uncertainty present in interpolated maps computed from commercial microwave link rainfall retrievals. In order to disentangle these sources of uncertainty we identified four main sources of error: 1) microwave link measurements, 2) availability of microwave link measurements, 3) spatial distribution of the network, and 4) interpolation methodology.\nWe computed more than 1000 rainfall fields, for The Netherlands, from real and simulated microwave link data. These rainfall fields were compared to quality-controlled gauge-adjusted radar rainfall maps considered as ground-truth. Thus we were able to quantify the contribution of errors in microwave link measurements to the overall uncertainty. The actual performance of the commercial microwave link network is affected by the intermittent availability of the links, not only in time but also in space. We simulated a fully-operational network in time and space, and thus we quantified the role of the availability of microwave link measurements to the overall uncertainty.\nThis research showed that the largest source of uncertainty is related to the microwave link measurements themselves (~55%). The second largest source of uncertainty (~20%) is attributed to the intermittence in the availability of microwave link data.",

            "abstract": "Channel morphology and irregularities in stream boundaries can create zones of flow separation, where lower velocities trap fine sediment and organic matter and increase opportunities for nutrient processing and biological uptake. This effect is most pronounced with channel-spanning structures such as logjams. Humans have changed the spatial and temporal characteristics of wood distribution in streams, with lasting effects on instream wood recruitment, wood loads, logjam distribution, and hydraulic roughness.\nPrevious studies in the Colorado Front Range show that contemporary headwater streams flowing through old-growth, unmanaged forests have more wood than streams flowing through younger-growth, managed forests, but do not evaluate the effects of wood on channel complexity. ‘Managed’ versus ‘unmanaged’ refers to whether forests were or are currently exposed to human alteration. Although some alteration has long since ceased, reduced wood loads in managed streams persist.\nOur primary objective was to quantify differences in logjams, wood volumes, stream complexity, and organic carbon storage on streams with different management and disturbance histories in order to examine legacy effects across a gradient of stream management. Data were collected during the summers of 2013 and 2014 in the Southern Rocky Mountains. The 25 stream reaches studied are 2nd to 3rd order, subalpine streams that are categorized into: old-growth unmanaged forests; younger, naturally disturbed unmanaged forests; and younger managed forests.\nWe assessed instream and floodplain wood loads and logjams and evaluated the role that large wood plays in local channel complexity, pool volume, and storage of organic carbon. Preliminary results show that greatest wood and carbon storage in sediments, as well as channel complexity, occurs in streams in old-growth, unmanaged forests and the least wood and carbon storage and channel complexity occurs in younger-growth, managed forests.",

            "abstract": "In regulated rivers such as the Lower San Joaquin River (LSJR) in California, environmental policy requires releasing adequate flows to maintain habitat quality for flora and fauna. The prescribed reservoir releases on the LSJR are tied to water year classifications in order to help satisfy competing water demands in dry years. The question remains as to whether relatively low releases will be adequate to maintain habitat quality for key aquatic species under current and projected climate conditions. This work examines one critical determinant of anadromous fish habitat suitability, water temperature, as a function of reservoir release conditions. More specifically, we study idealized pools subject to the conditions of the LSJR using an established 2D (longitudinal and vertical) flow and heat transport model (CE-QUAL-W2). We assessed the releases in the context of the spring run Chinook salmon (Onchorhynchus tshawytscha) life cycle (the key species in an ongoing restoration effort), focusing on summer holding conditions. Our objective was to determine the conditions under which pools provide sufficiently cool havens for the holding salmon under current and projected climate conditions. Using river bathymetry from measured cross-sections and a high-resolution DEM lidar product, we created a range of ideal pool size representative of LSJR conditions. After calibrating hydraulic and heat transfer parameters using available temperature profiles, we simulated temperature profiles in the pools for scheduled flow releases, at different downstream locations from the reservoir. Results include modeled temperature profiles in holding pools, and derived estimates of suitable holding capacity under a range of pool, releases and climate conditions. Potential engineering modifications are explored as potential mitigation strategies, such as modified flow schedules, riparian shading, pool sizes and pool relocations.",

            "abstract": "Various climate agencies are pursuing concepts of space-based atmospheric monitoring based on ideas of empirically verifiable accuracy in observations. Anticipating that atmospheric monitoring systems based in observing the emitted longwave spectrum, the reflected shortwave spectrum, and radio occultation are implemented, we seek to discover how long-term records in these quantities might be used to improve our ability to predict climate change. This is a follow-up to a previous study that found that climate monitoring by remote sensing better informs climate prediction than does climate monitoring in situ. We have used the output of a CMIP5 historical scenario to hind-cast observation types being considered for space-based atmospheric monitoring to modify ensemble prediction of multi-decadal climate change produced by a CMIP5 future scenario. Specifically, we have considered spatial fingerprints of 1970­–2005 averages and trends in hind-cast observations to improve global average surface air temperature change from 2005 to 2100. Correlations between hind-cast observations at individual locations on the globe and multi-decadal change are generally consistent with a null-correlation distribution. We have found that the modes in inter-model differences in hind-casts are clearly identified with tropical clouds, but only Arctic warming as can be identified in radio occultation observations correlates with multi-decadal change, but only with 80% confidence.

GCPI is designed to measure, several times every day, high-resolution spectra of reflected sunlight with a moderate signal to noise ratio in near-infrared (NIR) bands, that can then be used to obtain simultaneous retrievals of column averaged CO2, CH4, CO, and H2O. The aim of this project is to explore the potential of retrieving vertical profiles of CO2, CH4, CO, and H2O from high-resolution NIR spectra. We perform radiative transfer simulations over clear-sky conditions (as expected to be observed by GCPI) and estimate prospective performance of retrievals based on results from Bayesian error analysis and characterization. Through Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs), we demonstrate the feasibility of retrieving vertical profiles of CO2 and CH4 and partial columns of CO and H2O with high accuracies and precisions. GCPI’s unprecedented observations with high temporal and spatial coverage could be used to drive and constrain Earth system models, improve our understanding of the underlying carbon cycle and water cycle processes, and evaluate model forecasting capabilities.",

            "abstract": "The twin Voyager spacecraft were launched in 1977 and continue to be on a remarkable journey of exploration. Both spacecraft have crossed the termination shock of the solar wind and Voyager 1 (V1) crossed into interstellar space in ~mid-2012. At that crossing of the heliopause, the particles of heliospheric origin that had dominated the energy spectrum of most cosmic ray nuclei below approximately 50 MeV/nucleon disappeared, revealing for the first time the energy spectra of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) down to about 3 MeV/nucleon. The intensity of GCRs has not shown any significant long-term gradient since the crossing, suggesting that V1 is observing the energy spectra of GCRs in the local interstellar medium unaffected by solar modulation. The energy spectra of H, He, C, and O have rather broad peaks in the ~20-100 MeV/nucleon energy range. The H/He ratio in this energy range is ~12 and that of C/O is ~1. We are also observing the local interstellar electron spectrum and find that a power-law energy dependence with spectral index approximately -1.5 from ~5-70 MeV is consistent with the data. We will report on the latest observations at the meeting. This work was supported by NASA under contract NNN12AA012.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the multiple types of land-use changes that can occur within an ecosystem provides a comprehensive picture of the human’s impact on natural systems. We use the Cerrado (savanna) of Brazil to examine the primary and secondary impacts of land-use change on greenhouse gas emissions. The primary land-use changes include fires for land-clearing, conversions to pasture and row-crop agriculture, and shifting management practices of agricultural lands. Secondary land-use changes include savanna degradation due to fires that escape from intended burn areas. These escape fires typically have a lower combustion completion coefficient than clearing fires, so it is important to distinguish them to correctly estimate the regional greenhouse gas budget. We have created a first-order spatio-temporal model of greenhouse gas emissions that can be easily modified for other savanna regions using globally available data products as inputs. Our data inputs are derived from publically available remote sensing imagery. Initial biomass is estimated by Baccini et al. 2012, which is derived from LiDAR and MODIS imagery. All other input data sets give annual estimates. Clearing of the savanna is documented by LAPIG of Universidade Federal de Goias using MODIS (MOD13Q1), LANDSAT and CBERS images. MODIS burned area products delineate annual fires; in combination with the savanna clearing database we determine primary and escape fires. Pastures and row-crop agriculture are documented by LAPIG and Spera et al. 2014, respectively. The row-crop agriculture dataset enables us to estimate greenhouse gas emissions associated with specific crops (e.g., soy or maize) and management (e.g., fertilizer use). Recent contributions to the literature have provided many in situ measurements from the land-use changes of interest needed to estimate a regional greenhouse gas budget, including combustion coefficients of savanna sub-types, carbon emission soil stocks, nitrogen emissions from fertilizer, and carbon storage in pastures. With this wealth of information, we present a complete greenhouse gas portfolio including a sensitivity analysis for this dynamic region with an eye to applications for other savanna regions.",

            "abstract": "“It was really fun to get down and dirty in the wetlands. I learned a lot.” “It was informational towards different careers in this field.” In summer 2014, the University of Florida (UF) Wetlands Club developed a program that exposed rural high school students to different approaches and STEM career paths in earth sciences: hydrology, ecology, soil assessment, and environmental engineering. In total 90 students “got their feet wet” in an ecologically enhanced stormwater basin on UF’s campus. Students learned about wetland STEM careers at four stations that were led by Wetlands Club graduate students and STEM professionals. Students “felt a close interaction with the environment” and got “to learn a lot through hands-on experience”. At each one hour station, students performed field measurements in the wetland and discussed career opportunities with the instructors. Students at the hydrology station “enjoyed checking the water levels and seeing how rain affected the wetlands”. Students “liked how we were able to interact and identify species from duck weed to water bugs” at the ecology station. At the soils station, students “enjoyed taking samples and analyzing the soils texture and pigment”. Students at the engineering station “got to see all the math behind wetlands…and learn what it takes to become a hydrologist”. This pop up talk will share our instructional design for the wetland STEM career program. An accessible video will detail activities at each station. We will explain the successful aspects of the program and suggested improvements based on student feedback. We are excited to share how a to get a student to say that an earth science STEM career can be “really quite interesting for something I thought I had no interest in“!",

            "abstract": "The Boring volcanic field (BVF) in western Oregon and Washington has been the subject of a recently completed investigation that included detailed geologic mapping, petrographic and geochemical analyses, and 40Ar/39Ar geochronologic and paleomagnetic studies. At least 80 monogenetic volcanic centers compose the BVF, each of which erupted small volumes of magma ranging from basalt to mafic andesite over short intervals of time. More than 140 40Ar/39Ar determinations for lava flows and intrusions in the BVF range in age from ~3100 ka to ~60 ka. Oriented samples for paleomagnetic analysis were collected at an equivalent number of localities (>160) coincident with, or within the same unit proximal to, the geochronologic sampling sites. Based on the frequency distribution of ages, the most significant episodes of Boring volcanism occurred between 2700 and 2200 ka, 1700 and 500 ka, and 350 and 60 ka. A systematic determination of the BVF’s eruptive history was undertaken mainly to assess its anomalous neotectonic setting west of the Cascade arc axis, as well as the magnitude of its concomitant volcanic hazards within the greater Portland and Vancouver metropolitan areas. Our paleomagnetic and geochronologic data, however, also have significant implications for the timing of geomagnetic field reversals and excursions during the Late Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs. The BVF data are more numerous higher in the section, and they capture transitional fields at two polarity boundaries allowing precise age determinations to be made for these reversals: the Brunhes-Matuyama transition is thus dated at 773±5 ka, and the upper Jaramillo-Matuyama transition at 973±6 ka. The lower Jaramillo-Matuyama transition occurred prior to 1068±8 ka, and the normal Cobb subchron must have occurred between reversed-polarity Matuyama flows dated at 1159±14 ka and 1207±6 ka. The lower Olduvai-Matuyama transition occurred prior to 1927±4 ka, and the Matuyama-Gauss transition prior to 2616±18 ka. In addition, our data indicate that boundaries of the reversed Kaena subchron occurred between 3105±41 ka and 3088±9 ka (lower) and after 3055±29 ka (upper).",

            "abstract": "We report dissolved (glass) CO2 concentrations, plus vesicle He and C isotope compositions and He and CO2 abundances, for a suite of 23 basalt glasses from the 2005-2006 eruption on the East Pacific Rise. This sample suite provides a unique opportunity to study magma recharge along the mid-ocean ridge, to quantify degassing prior to and during eruption, and to evaluate the extent to which mantle carbon is incorporated into hydrothermal fluids and ultimately into seafloor ecosystems. Our work covers the full spatial and temporal extent of the months-long eruption (ages from 210Po-210Pb dating), and is complementary to a previous study of volatile changes with distance from the vent during part of the eruptive episode (Soule et al. 2013; EPSL). Vesicle 3He/4He is uniform at 8.56±0.04(1σ) RA. Vesicle He and CO2 abundances vary by factors of 17 and 230, respectively. The variability in CO2/He ratio is evidence for kinetic fractionation of He from CO2 during vesiculation, and reveals the potential for using vesicle CO2/He as a relative geo-speedometer for the rate of magma ascent and lava emplacement. Nearly all samples lie in a narrow range of 280-370 ppm for total CO2 (vesicles+glass) suggesting saturation at a depth of ~1.5 km in the crust, similar to the depth of the seismically imaged magma lens. Vesicle CO2/He co-varies positively with the fraction of CO2 contained in vesicles (r2=0.94) and negatively with vesicle δ13C (r2=0.83). The δ13C ranges from -2.6 to -5 per mil, and straddles the value for CO2 in EPR vent fluids (M. Lilley, pers. comm.). The C isotope results are consistent with vapor phase 13C-enrichment during CO2 exsolution from a basaltic melt, as determined experimentally (Javoy et al. 1978; Contrib Mineral Petrol). Collectively the observations are explained by quasi-closed-system degassing, where melt ascent from the magma lens was sufficiently rapid that minimal bubble loss occurred during the eruption and flow of lava onto the seafloor.",

            "abstract": "In May 2013, The, record of atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa, popularly known as “The Keeling Curve” reached 400 ppm for the first time in human history. Among the most sobering consequences of rising CO2 is Ocean Acidification, caused when the excess CO2 emitted from the burning of fossil fuels is absorbed by the surface oceans. The resulting reduction in pH harms stony corals (Scleractinia), and many other calcareous organisms. If civilization continues along the current trajectory of fossil fuel emissions, most coral reef ecosystems are expected to suffer extreme stress or mortality within the lifetime of the next generation. “If we do not reverse current trends in carbon dioxide emissions soon, we will cause the biggest and most rapid change in ocean chemistry since the extinction of the dinosaurs.” (www.seaweb.org/getinvolved/oceanvoices/KenCaldeira.php). This looming tragedy is topical among marine scientists, but less appreciated or unknown to the general public, particularly among communities in the tropics where impacts to coral reef ecosystems will be severe.\nThe Coral Reef Mosaic Project grew from my experiences leading education outreach in local schools. Making mosaics is an engaging way to enlighten educators and scholars on the pressing issues of climate change.\nWhen taking part in a mural project, students find mosaic art is a fun and rewarding experience that results in a beautiful depiction of a coral reef. Students explore the ecosystem diversity of coral reef inhabitants as they design the mural and piece together a representative environment. They work together as a team to learn the mosaic techniques and then build their own chosen creatures to inhabit the reef. The result is a beautiful and lasting mural for their school or community that provides an important message for the future.\nIn a cooperative project with Dr. Pauline Chin at UH Manoa we traveled to Hawaii to train teachers on the Big Island in the art of mosaic and to convey the consequences of climate change and ocean acidification through field trips to NOAA research stations where the Keeling Curve and other climate change studies are conducted. This combination of field trips and mosaic workshops was sponsored in part by Christopher Sloop and Earth Networks (www.earthnetworks.com/OurNetworks/GreenhouseGasNetwork.aspx) .\nFig.1",

Here we characterize variations in aerial LiDAR derived forest structure at individual tree scale in Arizona and New Mexico. Differences in structure result from both topographic and climatological variations and from natural and human related disturbances. We chose a priori undisturbed and disturbed sites that included preservation, development, logging and wildfire as exemplars. We compare two topographic indices, the topographic position index (TPI) and topographic wetness index (TWI), to two local indicators of spatial association (LISA): the Getis-Ord Gi and Anselin’s Moran I. We found TPI and TWI correlate well to positive z-scores (tall trees in tall neighborhoods) in undisturbed areas and that disturbed areas are clearly defined by negative z-scores, in some cases better than what is visible from traditional orthophotography and existing GIS maps. These LISA methods also serve as a robust technique for creating like-clustered stands, i.e. common stands used in forest inventory monitoring. This research provides a significant advancement in the ability to (1) quantity variation in forest structure across topographically complex landscapes, (2) identify and map previously unrecorded disturbance locations, and (3) quantify the different impacts of disturbance within the perimeter of a stand or event at ecologically relevant scale.",

The resulting charged dust and gas can be picked up by the solar wind, resulting in a large magnetic structure containing over 106kg of mass, accelerated to almost the solar wind speed. This dust is invisible to our Earth-based detectors as are the impactors and targets but they can be detected by our interplanetary spacecraft and they do create ground-level magnetospheric disturbances when they impact the Earth. Moreover we can identify the parent bodies for these impacting bolides by determining which asteroids cross the ecliptic plane along the path of these disturbances carried by the solar wind. Hence, these structures can be used in a planetary defense strategy. Since they have a very practical application we need to understand their formation and evolution better. We apply our multi-fluid code to model this interaction, to show how the field is affected by charged dust. We assume a cloud of charged dust moving close to the solar wind speed, but a small velocity difference exists between the dust and ions. Gravity pulls horizontally opposite to the solar wind plasma, maintaining the concentration of dust cloud.",

            "abstract": "Beginning shortly after the launch of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) in late 1997, an increased emphasis was placed upon the development and evaluation of multi-satellite or “blended” techniques, that attempted to marry the best features of the precipitation estimates from the multiple, intermittently spaced passive (or active) microwave sensors, with the fine spatial and temporal sampling provided by the global operational geostationary imagers. These collective efforts have largely converged to the “motion-based” methodologies inherent in the designs of the current Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) merged product (IMERG) and the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) produced by the Japanese Space Agency JAXA. At their core, the performance of the multi-satellite techniques hinges upon the quality of the input precipitation data that is inherited from the various passive microwave (PMW) radiometers, such as the TRMM Microwave Imager, and the most recent GPM Microwave Imager (GMI). Typically, the radiometrically warm land surface background and its highly variable surface characteristics have limited the use of these sensors to the higher-frequency channels, which perform poorly for lighter rainfall and over complex, cold surfaces. This has limited the use of these data for hydrological modeling in watersheds where much of the streamflow originates from runoff of cold-season precipitation and snow. In this presentation, we will discuss some of the more recent changes to satellite-based precipitation techniques to account for land surface properties, including techniques that have been (or are under consideration for) the GPM over-land precipitation products.",

            "abstract": "After almost two decades of little exploratory effort in the Parnaiba Basin, recent gas discoveries have revived the economic interest in this region. A new exploratory play was successfully tested, confirming the efficiency of the igneous sills triggering the thermal effect on source rocks maturation, and also playing an important role as unconventional trap and seal. Parnaiba Basin was affected by two magmatic events: the Mosquito Formation (Average Age: 178 Ma) and the Sardinha Formation (Average Age: 124 Ma), both characterized by basic magmatic rocks. Ten 2D seismic lines, located in the southeastern Parnaiba Basin, were systematically interpreted in order to identify the main diabase sills geometry, some possible emplacement controls and further implications for an unconventional petroleum system. The identified sills were classified in three types: A, B, and C, according to their dominant geometries and the stratigraphic position of their host rocks. From base to top, Type A sills intrude the Pre-Silurian Sequence, that fills in graben structures of the basement. They have short lateral continuity and saucer-shaped geometry. The main graben faults seem to control the steeper sills, which seem to feed upper sills. Type B sills intrude mainly the Silurian Sequence and have a very long lateral continuity when intruding the shales of Tiangua Formation, in which they are mainly horizontal tabular. Type C sills intrude the top of the Devonian Sequence and have two main geometries: saucer-shaped and horizontal tabular. By correlation to the surface geology of the area, Type C sills are interpreted as Sardinha Formation (Lower Cretaceous). Considering an unconventional hydrocarbon play in the area, some potential trap features associated with sill geometry, were identified, using analogous plays successfully tested in recent discoveries. These traps are associated to a specific sill geometry locally known as “inverted saucer-shaped sill”. This shape consists into a horizontal sill placed on the top of a potential reservoir formation, acting also as a seal. On their two tips, this geometry is limited by two steeper sills that may be connected to a lower horizontal sill, which normally intrudes a potential source rock.",

            "abstract": "Rock salt is a potential medium for the underground disposal of nuclear waste because it has several assets, in particular its water and gas tightness in the undisturbed state, its ability to heal induced fractures and its high thermal conductivity as compared to other shallow-crustal rocks. In addition, the run-of-mine, granular salt, may be used to backfill the mined open spaces.\nWe present simulation results associated with coupled thermal, hydraulic and mechanical processes in the TSDE (Thermal Simulation for Drift Emplacement) experiment, conducted in the Asse salt mine in Germany [1]. During this unique test, conceived to simulate reference repository conditions for spent nuclear fuel, a significant amount of data (temperature, stress changes and displacements, among others) was measured at 20 cross-sections, distributed in two drifts in which a total of six electrical heaters were emplaced. The drifts were subsequently backfilled with crushed salt. This test has been modeled in three-dimensions, using two sequential simulators for flow (mass and heat) and geomechanics, TOUGH-FLAC and FLAC-TOUGH [2]. These simulators have recently been updated to accommodate large strains and time-dependent rheology. The numerical predictions obtained by the two simulators are compared within the framework of an international benchmark exercise, and also with experimental data. Subsequently, a re-calibration of some parameters has been performed. Modeling coupled processes in saliniferous media for nuclear waste disposal is a novel approach, and in this study it has led to the determination of some creep parameters that are very difficult to assess at the laboratory-scale because they require extremely low strain rates. Moreover, the results from the benchmark are very satisfactory and validate the capabilities of the two simulators used to study coupled thermal, mechanical and hydraulic (multi-component, multi-phase) processes relative to the underground disposal of high-level nuclear waste in rock salt.\n",

Quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) from geostationary satellites offer the advantage of full coverage and spatiotemporal resolution comparable to ground-based radars, particularly with the upcoming launch of GOES-R.\nA multisensor (NEXRAD+GPM+GOES-R) QPE product is under development that will capitalize on the complementary scales of NEXRAD and GOES-R measurements to provide high-resolution rainfall estimates in areas within and just outside the United States where ground radar coverage is not sufficient for flash flood detection and monitoring.\nAs a first step, a multi-year database was developed over the continental United States of Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor (MRMS) NEXRAD mosaics of surface precipitation types, rainfall rates, vertical profiles of reflectivity (VPRs), and the radar quality index (RQI), TRMM PR VPRs from 2A25 Version 7, and derived cloud properties from the GOES-R ABI proxy dataset. A Bayesian approach was then employed to match the cloud top observations to probability distributions of MRMS Q3 surface rain rates, using VPRs and precipitation types derived from MRMS as constraints. A description of the prototype QPE product and initial results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) has revealed abundant wind ripples on sand dunes across Mars. Ripple orientations have been documented using HiRISE images of sand dunes at 24 widely distributed sites across Mars, in order to identify the last significant wind directions at these locations. Howard (GSAB, 1977) gives a mathematical expression for how surface slopes on a sand dune can affect the orientation of ripples with respect to the formative winds. In order to evaluate this mechanism for measured ripple orientations on Mars, quantitative data for surface slopes on the sand dunes is required. Stereo pairs of HiRISE images are used to generate Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) with postings of one meter. In June 2014 we produced a DTM of sand dunes in the Terra Tyrrhena region of Mars (14.55° S, 97.77° E) using SOCET SET at the Astrogeology Branch, USGS-Flagstaff. Typically it is difficult for feature matching software to work well on sand dunes, but our stereo images (ESP_022609_1655 and ESP_026675_1655) were obtained only six Earth days apart under excellent illumination conditions. The Terra Tyrrhena DTM had remarkably few artifacts on the sand dunes (except at slip faces, where the average slope between slip face crest and base was interpolated) and excellent control from irregular terrain exposed in interdune areas. Slopes on the stoss sides of sand dunes are generally <10°; the Howard equation indicates ripple deflection angles should be <17° with respect to the actual surface wind direction. We are adjusting documented ripple orientations to account for surface slopes utilizing the DTM data, and so far we do not see major changes to inferred surface wind directions that would be derived directly from the ripple orientations.",

            "abstract": "The co-occurrence of brittle and ductile deformation underlies many large-scale tectonic processes, geodetically and seismologically monitored strain transients, and even several applied geoscience problems in hydrocarbon production and CO2 sequestration. Evidence for such mixed-deformation is preserved in the rock record, such as in mid-crustal shear zones where, depending on the temperature and pressure conditions, some mineral phases undergo brittle and others ductile deformation during the same overall bulk deformation.\nHere we combine physical experiments with an analytical approach to investigate the impact of the semi-brittle material on the deformation localization and on stick-slip and creep events. Two sets of experiments are performed: 1) shear of a mixture of elastic-frictional grains within a viscously deforming media, and 2) propagation of wetted fractures in a visco-elasto-plastic interlinked polymer gel during shear. We measure the force and displacement while imaging the shear cell. In both cases the rock analogues show a semi-brittle behavior where the deformation localization is enhanced and slip events get damped leading to creep. Several parameters were then extracted from the experiments and directly used as input parameters in an analytical solution for semi-brittle flow. In the analytical model localization and slip is modeled as a damped oscillator mimicking the behavior of discrete fractures originating in a strong material that get viscously damped in a surrounding continuous weaker material. That the measured and calculated decay times of slip events lead to comparable results is supportive of the models physical premise. This study suggest that in a mixed brittle-ductile system, localization can be efficient, frictional responses can be dampened but still present, and basic rheological descriptions may apply, all of which has implications for understanding strain transients and coseismic release.",

This includes a land surface model fully coupled to a river routing model and generic water management model applicable globally at 1/2o resolution and regionally at 1/8o resolution. A global integrated assessment model and its regionalized version for the U.S. are used to simulate water demand consistent with the energy technology and socio-economics scenarios. Human influence on the hydrologic cycle includes regulation and storage, consumptive use and overall redistribution of water resources in space and time. As groundwater provides an important source of water supply for irrigation and other uses worldwide, the integrated modeling framework has been extended to represent groundwater as an additional supply source, and to account for the return flow generated from the groundwater and surface water withdrawals.\nIn this presentation, we evaluate the groundwater supply and return flow modules by analyzing the simulated regulated flow, reservoir storage and supply deficit for irrigation and non irrigation sectors over major hydrologic regions of the conterminous U.S. The modeling framework is then used to provide insights on the resilience of future water resources in the U.S. ensured specifically by the return flow and groundwater dependence.",

            "abstract": "In the giant impact hypothesis, the Moon accretes from a disk around the proto-Earth. In the canonical model, the impact also sets the present-day angular momentum (AM). Alternatively, the Moon may form via a high AM giant impact and the present-day AM was established by a lunar orbital resonance.\nHere we examine the dynamics of disks formed by high AM impacts. Initially, the Earth’s extended atmosphere and the inner region of the rotationally-supported disk do not intersect the liquid-vapor phase boundary and form a continuous vapor. The atmosphere has a higher angular velocity than the partially pressure-supported disk; as a result, shear instabilities lead to mixing between the atmosphere and disk and net transfer of AM from the planet to the disk. The pressure-supported atmosphere’s continuity with the inner disk limits the accretion rate onto the planet, even when the planet’s rotation rate is below the spin stability limit.\nWhile the inner disk remains vapor, the disk’s surface cools radiatively. In the outer disk, droplets settle to the midplane and form moonlets via gravitational instabilities. We find that the potential energy reduction of the system by lunar accretion is primarily converted to heating the inner disk and atmosphere. Moonlets in the outer disk are not heated sufficiently to vaporize. Because net accretion onto the planet is limited, droplet formation in the outer disk is resupplied by pressure gradients between the inner and outer disk.\nIn the canonical case, the atmosphere and disk intersect the liquid-vapor boundary and do not form a continuous fluid. Also, the planet has a lower angular velocity than the disk. Then, condensates from the disk may fall freely to Earth. Thus, compared to the canonical model, high AM disks have enhanced lunar accretion efficiency. Furthermore, if mixing between the atmosphere and inner disk is efficient, then a wide range of high AM giant impacts may produce the isotopic similarity between the Earth and Moon.",

Often, paleontologists use the holotypes of type species to represent genera in global analyses, but they rarely test how representative the type species are of the genus of a whole. Through my analyses, I compared genus and species-level compilations through time by comparing the mean metabolic rate of each genus to the metabolic rate of the type species to see if using this representative provided effective data when conducting genus-level analyses. To achieve these objectives, I used sizes collected from Catalogue of Ostracoda and Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. The range of the type species’ metabolic rate varied, but there is no systematic bias towards higher or lower metabolic rates. Therefore, using type species in genus-level analyses is effective when looking for general trends, but the absolute values based on the holotype of type species have some bias to them and are not as accurate.",

Filter-collected aerosol during summer 2012 was analyzed for organic and elemental carbon, and inorganic ions. The average ambient concentration of aerosol was 0.9 μg m-3. Organic aerosol contributed the majority of mass (57%), followed by sulfate (21%) and nitrate (17%). Filter-collected aerosol was positively correlated with continuous aerosol measurements of black carbon, light scattering and number concentration. Water-soluble organic compounds (WSOC) from 9/24 and 9/25 aerosol samples collected during a pollution event were analyzed using ultrahigh-resolution FT-ICR MS. FLEXPART retroplume analysis shows the air masses were very aged (> 12 days). About 4000 molecular formulas were assigned to each of the mass spectra between m/z 100-1000. The majority of the assigned molecular formulas have unsaturated structures with CHO and CHNO elemental compositions. WSOC have an average O/C ratio of ~0.45, relatively low compared to O/C ratios of other aged aerosol which might be the result of evaporation and fragmentation during long-range transport. The increase in aerosol loading during 9/24 was linked to biomass burning emissions from North America by FLEXPART retroplumes and MODIS fire counts. This was confirmed with WSOC biomass burning markers and with the morphology and mixing state of particles as determined by scanning electron microscopy. The presence of markers characteristic of aqueous-phase reactions of biomass burning phenolic species suggests that the aerosol collected at Pico had undergone cloud processing. The air masses on 9/25 were more aged (~15 days) and influenced by marine emissions, as indicated by organosulfates and species characteristic for marine aerosol (e.g. fatty acids). The change in air masses for the two samples was corroborated by the changes in ozone, ethane, propane, morphology of particles, as well as by the FLEXPART retroplumes. In this presentation we will report the first detailed molecular characterization of free tropospheric aged aerosol intercepted at the Pico Mountain Observatory.",

            "abstract": "Flow in fractured shale is a topic of interest for both production from non-traditional fractured shale reservoirs and for estimating the leakage potential of sealing formations above geologic carbon dioxide repositories. The hydraulic aperture of a fracture quantifies how much fluid can be transported through a fracture, similarly to how permeability describes fluid flow through porous media. The advantage of defining the fracture hydraulic aperture as opposed to permeability, is that this property can be easily scaled up to fracture reservoir simulators. Many parameters affect the hydraulic aperture, however, including the fracture roughness, the physical aperture distribution, and the tortuosity of flow paths within the fracture.\nThe computed tomography (CT) and flow facility at NETL has conducted an analysis of the changes in both physical and hydraulic aperture as fractures were subjected to varying external confining stresses. Changes in fracture geometry were tracked through the use of non-destructive CT imaging, allowing the determination of the physical aperture distribution, while hydraulic fracture apertures were derived from experimental fracture flow measurements. In order to evaluate the effects of fracture roughness and geometry, two fractures with different degrees of roughness were used. Tests were conducted with locally sourced shale.\nExperimental results show that the volume change in the fracture is a non-linear function of the confining pressure, and both physical and hydraulic apertures decrease rapidly as the fracture is first compressed.",

            "abstract": "Warm epochs of the past, from the Cretaceous to the Eocene to the Pliocene, are believed to have had generally wetter climate conditions than cold epochs. In particular, vast subtropical regions had enough precipitation to support rich vegetation and fauna. Only with global cooling and the onset of glacial cycles some 3 million years ago did the broad pattern of arid and semi-arid subtropical regions become fully established. However, current projections for future global warming caused by CO2 rise suggest the strengthening of such dry conditions over subtropical regions, rather than the return to a wetter state. What makes these past warm climates so different from future projections? Here, we investigate this question by comparing a typical quadrupling-of-CO2 experiment with an early Pliocene simulation that closely reproduces the available observations. We argue that different cloud properties, maintaining low-latitude ocean temperature patterns with reduced zonal and meridional temperature gradients and hence weaker atmospheric circulation, could explain this puzzle.",

            "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST), a key ingredient for physically-based retrieval algorithms of hydrological states and fluxes, remains a poorly constrained parameter for global scale studies. The main two observational methods to remotely measure T are based on thermal infrared (TIR) observations and passive microwave observations (MW). TIR is the most commonly used approach and the method of choice to provide standard LST products for various satellite missions. MW-based LST retrievals on the other hand are not as widely adopted for land applications; currently their principle use is in soil moisture retrieval algorithms.\nMW and TIR technologies present two highly complementary and independent means of measuring LST. MW observations have a high tolerance to clouds but a low spatial resolution, and TIR has a high spatial resolution with temporal sampling restricted to clear skies. The nature of the temperature at the very surface layer of the land makes it difficult to combine temperature estimates between different methods. The skin temperature is characterized by a strong diurnal cycle that is dependant in timing and amplitude on the exact sensing depth and thermal properties of the vegetation.\nThis paper builds on recent progress in characterizing the main structural components of the DTC that explain differences in TIR and MW estimates of LST. Spatial patterns in DTC timing (phase lag with solar noon) and DTC amplitude have been calculated for TIR, MW and compared to weather prediction estimates. Based on these comparisons MW LST can be matched to the TIR record. This paper will compare in situ measurements of LST with satellite estimates from (downscaled) TIR and (reconciled) MW products. By contrasting the validation results of clear sky days with those of cloudy days the expected tolerance to clouds of the MW observations will be tested. The goal of this study is to determine the weather conditions in which MW can supplement the TIR LST record.",

            "abstract": "As part of a U. S. Geological Survey effort to (1) estimate river discharge in ungaged basins, (2) understand runoff quantity and timing for watersheds between gaging stations, and (3) estimate potential future streamflow, a national scale precipitation runoff model is in development. The effort uses the USGS Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) model. The model development strategy includes methods to assign hydrologic routing coefficients a priori from national scale GIS data bases. Once developed, the model can serve as an initial baseline for more detailed and locally/regionally calibrated models designed for specific projects and purposes.\nOne of the key hydrologic routing coefficients is the groundwater coefficient (gw_coef). This study estimates the gw_coef from continental US GIS data, including geology, drainage density, aquifer type, vegetation type, and baseflow index information. The gw_coef is applied in regional PRMS models and is estimated using two methods. The first method uses a statistical model to predict the gw_coef from weighted average values of surficial geologic materials, dominant aquifer type, baseflow index, vegetation type, and the drainage density. The second method computes the gw_coef directly from the physical conditions in the watershed including the percentage geologic material and the drainage density. The two methods are compared against the gw_coef derived from streamflow records, and tested for selected rivers in different regions of the country. To address the often weak correlation between geology and baseflow, the existence of groundwater sinks, and complexities of groundwater flow paths, the spatial characteristics of the gw_coef prediction error were evaluated, and a correction factor developed from the spatial error distribution. This provides a consistent and improved method to estimate the gw_coef for regional PRMS models that is derived from available GIS data and physical information for watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Theoretical calculation of seismoelectric conversion coefficients is difficult because it requires a large number of parameters that are hard to obtain. Much laboratory data are needed to validate the theoretical results. The most critical issue is determining independently the effect of porosity and permeability on seismoelectric coefficients. In general, when the rock porosity increases, the permeability increases too, and vice versa. In this study, we make measurements on both synthetic sandstone and two Berea (500 and 100) samples. We built a man-made “sandstone” sample with round cracks which are distributed in a horizontal plane. Thus the small cube (1.7 cm^3 ) only has one value of porosity and different permeabilities in the three directions. It is a sample with anisotropy in permeability. Laboratory experiments in a water tank show that the seismoelectric conversion coefficient is related to permeabilities in the three directions. The seismoelectric coefficient is highest in the direction of maximum permeability and lowest in the direction of minimum permeability. The measurements with the isotropic Berea samples show that seismoelectric coefficient increases with both porosity and permeability. Application of the result to borehole logging measurements requires analysis of the data from P, S, and Stoneley waves. P and Stoneley waves give large seismoelectric signals in the presence of fractures or high permeability zones. Shear waves, that do not induce fluid flow, provide very small seismoelectric signals. If the fracture strike in the formation is along the borehole axis, the P-wave induces stronger seismoelectric signal. Seismoelectric well logging might prove help for exploring the fractures or micro fractures in a borehole wall.",

            "abstract": "Over the past few years many Data Providers have implemented services that allow for web based (HTTP) interfaces to manipulate, organize, modify, and deliver Earth Science Data. This web architecture provides the foundation for streamlining of Earth Science Users utilization of and interaction with the Data. However, critical components are missing and need to be developed in order to increase the capabilities, potential, and reach of these services. Middleware services represent a class of Data Services that are able to communicate their capabilities more clearly and effectively with Science Data Users while also leveraging the more raw web services on the back end. A Middleware layer of a services architecture functions to coordinate the interactions of the users with the core web services. This simplifies execution, parameter selection, data integration, data delivery, and data analysis activities. This presentation will outline how the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) has utilized core services to provide basic access to data, data manipulation, and processing. Beyond that, the presentation will also detail the enhancement of those efforts through the development and implementation of Middleware to augment capabilities and create workflows necessary to enable Science Users to perform meaningful science activities and analysis faster than before. The Middleware layer acts as the “glue” that allows all these separate services to work together. By moving the algorithms that process and organize data closer to the Data Archive and enabling access to them via web services fronted by Middleware services, the LP DAAC helps Science users to do better, less expensive, and more expansive science much faster than they ever could before.",

            "abstract": "In November 2013, a series of earthquakes began along a mapped ancient fault system near Azle, Texas. The Azle events are the third felt earthquake sequence in the Fort Worth (Barnett Shale) Basin since 2008, and several production and injection wells in the area are drilled to depths near the recent seismic activity. Understanding if and/or how injection and removal of fluids in the crystalline crust reactivates faults have important implications for seismology, the energy industry, and society. We assessed whether the Azle earthquakes were induced using a joint analysis of the earthquake data, subsurface geology and fault structure, and 3D pore pressure modeling. Using a 12-station temporary seismic deployment, we have recorded and located >300 events large enough to be recorded on multiple stations and 1000s of events during periods of swarm activity. High-resolution locations and focal mechanisms indicate that events occurred on NE-SW trending, steeply dipping normal faults associated with the southern end of the Newark East Fault Zone with hypocenters between 2-8 km depth. We considered multiple causes that might have changed stress along this system. Earthquakes resulting from natural processes, though perhaps unlikely in this historically inactive region, can be neither ruled out nor confirmed due to lack of information on the natural stress state of these faults. Analysis of lake and groundwater variations near Azle showed that no significant stress changes occurred prior to or during the earthquake sequence. In contrast, analysis of pore-pressure models shows that the combination of formation water production and wastewater injection near the fault could have caused pressure increases that induced earthquakes on near-critically stressed faults.",

            "abstract": "Nearly continuous, heavy rainfall occurred during 9-13 September 2013 causing flooding and widespread landslides and debris flows in the northern Colorado Front Range. Whereas many recent studies have identified erosion as the most common process leading to debris flows in the mountains of Colorado, nearly all of the debris flows mapped in this event began as small, shallow landslides. We mapped the boundaries of 415 September 2013 debris flows in the Eldorado Springs and Boulder 7.5-minute quadrangles using 0.5-m-resolution satellite imagery. We characterized the landslide source areas of six debris flows in the field as part of an effort to identify what factors controlled their locations. Four were on a dip slope in sedimentary rocks in the Pinebrook Hills area, near Boulder, and the other two were in granitic rocks near Gross Reservoir. Although we observed no obvious geomorphic differences between the source areas and surrounding non-landslide areas, we noted several characteristics that the source areas all had in common. Slopes of the source areas ranged from 28° to 35° and most occurred on planar or slightly concave slopes that were vegetated with grass, small shrubs, and sparse trees. The source areas were shallow, irregularly shaped, and elongated downslope: widths ranged from 4 to 9 m, lengths from 6 to 40 m and depths ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 m. Colluvium was the source material for all of the debris flows and bedrock was exposed in the basal surface of all of the source areas. We observed no evidence for concentrated surface runoff upslope from the sources. Local curvature and roughness of bedrock and surface topography, and depth distribution and heterogeneity of the colluvium appear to have controlled the specific locations of these shallow debris-flow source areas. The observed distribution and characteristics of the source areas help guide ongoing efforts to model initiation of the debris flows.",

            "abstract": "Mid-ocean ridges are subject to episodic disturbances in the form of magmatic intrusions and earthquakes. Following these events, the temperature of associated hydrothermal vent fluids is observed to increase within a few days. In this paper, we aim to understand the rapid thermal response of hydrothermal systems to such disturbances. We construct a classic single-pass numerical model and use the examples of the 1995 and 1999 non-eruptive events at East Pacific Rise 9⁰50’ N and Main Endeavour Field, respectively. We model both the thermal effects of dikes and permeability changes that might be attributed to diking and/or earthquake swarms. We find that the rapid response of vent temperatures results from steep thermal gradients close to the surface. When the perturbations are accompanied by an increase in permeability, the response on the surface is enhanced further. For East Pacific Rise 9⁰50’ N, the observed ~7°C rise can be obtained for a ~ 50% increase in permeability in the diking zone. The mass flow rate increases as a result of change in permeability deeper in the system, and, therefore, the amount of hot fluid in the diffused flow also increases. Using a thermal energy balance, we show that the ~ 10 ⁰C increase in diffuse flow temperatures recorded for MEF after the 1999 event may result from a 3-4 times increase in permeability. The rapid thermal response of the system resulting from a change in permeability also occurs for cases in which there is no additional heat input, indicating that hydrothermal systems may respond similarly to purely seismic and non-eruptive magmatic events.",

            "abstract": "Percolation theory is used to describe the behavior of a large number of disordered systems including the passage of fluid through porous materials, the spread of forest fires, and the mechanical behavior of granular materials. By virtue of both variations in elastic and plastic properties between different rock forming minerals as well as the plastic and elastic anisotropy of individual mineral grains, polycrystalline rocks are elastically and plastically disordered systems. Using 2D finite element models I have shown that stress transmission in rocks can also be described as a percolation problem and that the modulation of stress states within a rock can in some cases, reach levels comparable to the differential load on the rock. The presence of such modulations in the internal stress state of a rock has many implications for understanding how the rock’s rheology arises from the rheology of its constituent crystals. A first order result of stress percolation is the formation of shear localization. Depending on the degree of mechanical heterogeneity of the rock’s mechanical components (including grain interiors and grain boundaries), the nature of the shear localization may be highly concentrated – and therefore observable or widely distributed and “cryptic” in nature. The modulations in stress states created by stress percolation create small regions (yield nuclei) distributed throughout the rock that yield well before the bulk of the rock has reached the yield criterion. Local yielding leads to percolation of yielded regions and shear localization. Whether the shear localization remains cryptic or is observable by virtue of the development of large offsets, is a function of the density and distribution of yield nuclei. The spatial distribution of yield nuclei is a function of the nature of the stress percolation pattern, the variation in yield strength of the mechanical components and their spatial distribution. The presence of shear localization changes the relationship between single-crystal rheology and bulk rock rheology and therefore must be taken into account when modelling bulk rheology based on single-crystal rheology.\nFigure: a) FE model mesh b)-e) Plastic strain b) Young’s modulus, E = 500 to 0 GPa with v=0.1 to 0.4, c) E= 500 to 0 GPa with v=0.3 d) E= 200 to 20 GPa with v=0.3 and e) E =120 to 100 GPa with v=0.3.",

For example, during the first half of October 2011 when the ITCZ was located between 3°S and 8°S, TRMM 3B42 3-h rainfall averaged over the SSA exhibited a prominent diurnal cycle with a late night/early morning maximum and an early evening minimum. The rainfall diurnal range during this period over the SSA was 4.8 mm which was ~50% of the daily mean (10.1 mm). Mean rainfall over the northern sounding array was much lighter (0.9 mm) during this period with a diurnal cycle nearly out of phase with that over the SSA. Using primarily sounding and satellite data, we will explore the characteristics of this diurnally varying convection and what, if any, influence it may have had on the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) signal.",

            "abstract": "Eastern North America is an excellent region to test hypotheses about the evolution through time of tectonic processes, the growth of continental crust and the assembly of continents. Over a spatial scale of just a few hundred kilometres, the surface geology records almost 3 billion years of Earth history, with a transition from the Archean Superior craton through the Proterozoic Grenville orogenic belt to the Phanerozoic Appalachian terranes and the edge of the North American continent.\nThe boundaries between these major tectonic provinces have been mapped at the surface, and crustal-scale geophysical studies (e.g. LITHOPROBE) have been able to trace their complex signatures to the Moho and below in some parts of eastern Canada. Nevertheless, the nature of the boundaries across the region, and their continuation into the lithospheric mantle, remains enigmatic. The high wavespeed lithospheric keel of the Canadian Shield extends beneath the Proterozoic terranes; however it is still unclear whether this material represents a continuation of Archean lithosphere over which the Grenville terranes have been thrust, or whether the Grenville can be associated with its own thick keel. The transition from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic lithosphere beneath the Appalachian Front is likewise ambiguous.\nTo shed new light on the tectonic evolution of the region, and the nature of the major tectonic boundaries, a broadband seismograph network was installed in eastern Canada in 2012-2013 through the QM-III (Quebec-Maine Across Three Sutures) experiment; stations will remain in place for 2-3 years. The network consists of a dense NW-SE profile from the southern tip of Hudson Bay to coastal Maine, supplemented by existing more sparsely-distributed stations, and a 2D deployment across Maritime Canada.\nData acquisition is ongoing, but preliminary results from receiver function analysis, travel-time tomography and surface-wave dispersion are already showing some intriguing variations in structure across the region. Here we present an overview of the experiment, our initial analyses and our long-term goals.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that present-day greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols can produce remarkably similar patterns of climate response in fully coupled general circulation model (GCM) simulations, despite having significantly different spatial patterns of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) forcing. However, there is little understanding of the mechanisms of ocean-atmosphere interaction that could lead to the response pattern formation. Surface flux perturbations are a crucial pathway by which TOA forcing is communicated to the ocean, and may be a vital link in explaining the spatial similarities in the fully coupled responses to disparate TOA forcing patterns—a phenomenon with implications for detection and attribution, as well as the climate sensitivity to different forcers. We analyze the surface energy budget response to present-day aerosols versus GHGs in single forcing, fixed SST, atmospheric GCM experiments to identify mechanisms for response pattern formation via surface flux perturbations. We find that, although the TOA forcing spatial patterns of GHGs and aerosols are largely uncorrelated, their surface radiative and heat flux patterns are significantly anti-correlated. Furthermore, this anti-correlation is largely explained by similar (but sign-reversed) spatial patterns of surface latent and sensible heat flux response to the two forcers, particularly over the winter-hemisphere extratropical oceans. These are, in turn, driven by spatially similar perturbations in surface winds from changes in mean tropical and midlatitude circulation. These results suggest that the mean atmospheric circulation, which has many anti-symmetric responses to GHG and aerosol forcings, is an efficient homogenizer of spatial patterns in the surface heat flux response to heterogeneous TOA forcings, creating an atmosphere-only pathway for similarities in the fully coupled response.",

            "abstract": "In the planetary foreshock, solar wind electrons reflected from the bow shock form upstream electron beams, which can generate electrostatic Langmuir waves at frequencies close to the local plasma frequency fp. Langmuir waves can be subsequently converted to radio waves at fp and 2fp. Observed spectra often have the form of a superposition of two or more spectral peaks. It is believed that these spectra might be the result of the electrostatic (ES) decay and the coalescence of two Langmuir waves. To identify a possible signature of these nonlinear processes, bicoherence analysis can be applied. Bicoherence analysis can be used to estimate the phase coupling between interacting waves. However, it has been recently shown that electric fields produced by nonlinear currents and sheath rectification can be phase coherent with observed Langmuir waves that can result in multi-peak spectra similar to those expected for ES decay or coalescence. We present a systematic study using data from the Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) instrument onboard the Cassini spacecraft. We analyze all Saturn's foreshock crossings from 2004 to 2013 using an automated method of identification of Langmuir waves. Bicoherence analysis is used to study possible nonlinear wave interaction. Statistical significance of the results and robustness of the technique was evaluated using synthetic signals.",

Both types of energization include resonant interactions of the electrons with low-frequency waves. Spectra of such waves are often assumed to be broadband and to have a typical range of negative spectral indices (similar to 1/f), however recent studies show that power spectra of ground geomagnetic pulsations are significantly more complex. We use particle tracing simulations in a realistic magnetospheric field configuration to determine the effects of the spectral parameters.

            "abstract": "Greenland's recent trend of record-breaking melt seasons (2012, 2010, 2007, 2002, et al.) have substantially increased the amount of melt water generated in the ice sheet's lower accumulation area. Due to this enhanced refreezing in the firn, regions with low accumulation rates have formed multi-annual ice layers 5-10+ meters thick in the thermally active shallow firn that overlies porous firn at depth. The loss of pore space in the firn prevents the majority of melt water from percolating to depth and results in surface runoff where water previously would have refrozen. Here we present evidence from in situ ground-penetrating radar, firn cores and airborne radar from NASA's Operation IceBridge, collected both before and after Greenland's 2012 melt season, to illustrate the mechanism by which southwest Greenland's runoff zone in 2012 extended 20 kilometers inland from the long-term saturation line. Additional evidence from satellite imagery, firn temperature profiles and modeling support the notion that these layers blocked percolation and contributed to Greenland's record runoff in 2012. Should Greenland's trend of anomalously warm summers persist, these massive lenses are likely to grow thicker and extend further inland, resulting in enhanced runoff and rapid upslope migration of the equilibrium line. These results illustrate the vital importance of understanding subsurface firn changes in order to accurately predict Greenland's future runoff in a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "The link between climate variability and change, especially extreme conditions, is well documented in both environmental and health literature. The focus of research in the recent past, and current studies, is to understand causal relationships between the disease agents and environmental conditions, based on post-hoc analysis of observed cases to develop predictive models for advance warning of public by health authorities. A combination of the isolated examination of individual diseases and routes of infection (e.g. respiratory system, skin, digestive tract, etc.) and reliance mostly on correlative evidence from past occurrences have restricted public health progress (e.g. compared to experimental evidence of the quantitative balance of different transmission routes) and the utility of knowledge gained from such studies (e.g. reliably predicting seasonal outbreaks is no longer an advance). We propose a shift from focusing on the prediction of individual disease pattern(s) to a more holistic identification and mitigation of broader vulnerabilities within the provision of public health. Such an approach has the potential to account for and reveal health vulnerabilities common to a broader range of health stresses, thus facilitating a more holistic response to health challenges. The human health fragilities associated with respiratory diseases caused by a combination of natural (i.e dust, pollen, etc.) and industrial particulates (i.e. soot, aerosols, etc.) and other infectious airborne agents, for example, and their adverse impact on human health such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, etc. is an ideal candidate for such a holistic approach to environment and health research.",

The analysis of the laboratory data collected confirms that solitary waves indeed tend to break earlier in the presence of random waves-fields, and suggests that the effect is the result of radiation-stresses induced by the random wave fields. A theoretical approach based on the forced KdV equation is shown to successfully predict the shoaling process of the solitary wave. A statistical ensemble simulated using a state of the art non-hydrostatic model (NHWAVE) is used to test the significance of the process. The results of this study point to a potentially significant oceanographic process that has so far been ignored, and suggest that systematic research into the interaction between tsunami waves and the swell background could increase the accuracy of tsunami forecasting.",

Here we use physical experiments to unravel the mechanics of river avulsions caused by backwater hydrodynamics where low water discharges cause flow deceleration and sediment deposition and high water discharges result in flow acceleration and erosion in the lowest reaches of alluvial river near its shoreline, i.e., the backwater zone. We performed two experiments in the river-ocean facility at Caltech, where a 7 cm wide, 7 m long alluvial river feeds into a 6 m by 3 m “ocean” basin, building its own delta under subcritical flow and constant sea level conditions. The first experiment was conducted under constant sediment and water discharge, where backwater hydrodynamics are muted, while in the second experiment, we alternated between a low flow and high flow such that the erosion caused by the high flow is not balanced by the deposition caused by the low flow in the backwater zone, thus, allowing for the persistence of backwater hydrodynamics. In the first experiment, avulsions occur at the imposed change in flow confinement and are driven by a loss in sediment transport capacity, which are akin to avulsions near a canyon-fan transition on alluvial fans. In the second experiment, however, avulsions occur further downstream of the imposed change in flow confinement, and the avulsion length (distance of the avulsion location from the shoreline) scales with the backwater length. Thus, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that backwater hydrodynamics exert a primary control on avulsion location thereby setting the delta-lobe size. Further, we document key differences in development of shoreline rugosity, channel migration and avulsion frequency between the two experimental deltas.",

            "abstract": "Páramo ecosystems are widely recognized for their high water regulation capacity and as the main source of runoff generation in the Andean region. Understanding the hydrological functioning of the fragile wet Andean páramo ecosystems is critical in the mountainous regions of South America given their high susceptibility to global and local stressors such as land use change and climate change and variability . Despite this, most of the basins in the Andean mountain range are still ungauged, resulting in a currently hindered hydrologic analysis of the water sources contributing to runoff generation in the high-elevation páramo ecosystems. To improve this situation and provide a baseline for future tracer-based hydrologic studies, the isotopic signature of water samples collected within the Zhurucay River experimental basin (7.53 km2) was analyzed. The study area is located in the southern Ecuador and stretches over an altitudinal range of 3200 and 3900 m a.s.l. Water samples in rainfall, streamflow, and soils were collected between May 2011 and May 2013. Streamflow hydrometric and isotopic information within the study site was collected using a nested monitoring system. The main soils in the study site are the Andosols mainly located in the steep slopes, and the Histosols (Andean páramo wetlands) predominantly located at the bottom of the valley. Results reveal that the Andosols drain the infiltrated rainfall water to the Histosols. The Histosols on their turn feed creeks and small rivers. Pre-event water stored in the Histosols is the primary source of runoff generation throughout the year. Defining the water sources contributing to runoff generation is the first step towards the establishment of scientifically-based programs of management and conservation of water resources in the Andean region; and the monitoring of isotopic information has proven useful to improve the understanding of the ecosystem’s hydrologic behavior.",

            "abstract": "Seismological and cosmochemical studies suggest Earth's core is primarily composed of iron with ~5 to 10 wt% nickel and some light elements [e.g. 1]. To date, the concentration of nickel and the amount and identity of light elements remain poorly constrained due in part to the difficulty of conducting experimental measurements at core conditions. The vibrational properties of a variety iron alloys paired with seismic observations can help better constrain the composition of the core.\nWe directly measured the partial phonon density of states of bcc- and hcp-structured Fe0.9Ni0.1 and Fe0.85Ni0.1Si0.05 at high pressures. The samples were compressed using a panoramic diamond anvil cell. A subset of the experiments were conducted using neon as a pressure transmitting medium. Measurements of high statistical quality were performed with nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (NRIXS) at sector 3-ID-B of the Advanced Photon Source [2, 3, 4]. The unit cell volume of each sample was determined at each compression point with in-situ x-ray diffraction at sector 3-ID-B before and after each NRIXS measurement. The Debye, compressional, and shear sound velocities were determined from the low energy region of the partial phonon density of states paired with the volume measurements. We will present partial phonon density of states and sound velocities for Fe0.9Ni0.1 and Fe0.85Ni0.1Si0.05 at high-pressure and compare with those of pure iron.\n",

Observations were analyzed in the context of numerical techniques ranging from simple empirical equations to a coupled hydro-morphodynamic model. To create the dataset, the water surface and the bed were imaged simultaneously using optical remote sensing techniques to create a synoptic, time-dependent map of the water surface velocities and the bed elevations around the meander bend. Bedforms reversed their plan form orientation from concave upstream to concave downstream around the meander bend as a result of cross-stream variation in the downstream sediment flux. Mean bedform wavelength was 0.73 m and mean crest height was 0.07 m but varied with distance around the meander bend. Simple equations for bedform characteristics and sediment transport rates successfully reproduced observations above of the bend apex, while the coupled hydro-morphodynamic model was required at and below the bend apex.",

            "abstract": "Waveform cross correlation, or template matching as it is sometimes called, has long been known to be an effective method for finding occurrences of a known repeating signal within a waveform. Because seismic signals are rarely known a priori, waveform cross correlation is not often used as a detection method for seismic networks. However, past studies (e.g. Gibbons and Ringdal, 2006) have shown that cross correlation can be effective in identifying events with similar locations and focal mechanisms (and thus waveforms) to a pre-existing template. Because induced seismicity often satisfies these requirements the method is well-suited to induced seismicity monitoring. We apply the method of waveform cross correlation to a sequence of events between Nov. 29, 2013 and Dec. 13, 2013 occurring at Crooked Lake near Fox Creek, Alberta. These events are believed to be attributable to injection activities in the area. A total of 24 events were detected using traditional STA/LTA triggering methods. The largest event, measured at local magnitude 3.9, is used as a template to identify other events. We compare the effectiveness of the traditional STA/LTA detection method to the cross correlation technique. With a modest correlation threshold we identify all 24 of the original events and an additional 89 new events for a total of 113 events identified by waveform cross correlation. We estimate the magnitude of completeness using the maximum curvature method (Wiemer and Wyss, 2000) and compare the result for the STA/LTA catalogue and the cross correlation catalogue. We find that the magnitude of completeness is about 0.8 magnitude units lower for the cross correlation catalogue. We explore the possibility of determining a probability density function to describe the values of observed correlation between a template and a seismic signal and reconcile theoretical expectations with empirical data. We further suggest a trigger threshold for cross correlation detection algorithms based on the probability density function. Finally, we discuss the practicality of implementing waveform cross correlation detection methods to monitor induced seismicity.",

The scale and concept of such a mission has been revised at intervals since that time, yet the core has always been a close encounter with the Sun. The primary science goal of the Solar Probe Plus mission is to determine the structure and dynamics of the Sun’s coronal magnetic field, understand how the solar corona and wind are heated and accelerated, and determine what mechanisms accelerate and transport energetic particles. The SPP mission will achieve this by identifying and quantifying the basic plasma physical processes at the heart of the Heliosphere. SPP uses an innovative mission design, significant technology development and a risk-reducing engineering development to meet the SPP science objectives: 1) Trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the solar corona and solar wind; 2) Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind; and 3) Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. In this presentation, we present Solar Probe Plus and examine how the mission will address the science questions that have remained unanswered for over 5 decades.",

The fractal scaling exponents (τ), the slopes of the log-log relation between soil moisture moments and scales, have the potential to predict the parameters for soil moisture distribution at higher grid-resolution. We demonstrate here that the magnitude and temporal development of τ is related to basin water storage, seasonal mode of wetting and drying, and topography. We used PAWS + CLM, a physically-based surface-subsurface process model, to explore soil moisture spatial and temporal fractal patterns by running several scenarios in two Midwest basins of the United States. We applied homogenous meteorological forcing to focus on the control from heterogeneity of watershed static properties and examined the temporal evolution of τ in different soil depths and in non-freezing days. We found that τ in the top 10cm layer is approximately linearly related to basin-average water storage. In non-freezing seasons, τ shows strong hysteretic patterns. Wetting and drying dominated processes weakens previous organization, and reorganization process is linked to the hydrologic characteristics of the basin. We explained the difference between the seasonal and event dynamic of the fractal exponents.",

Drag forces have been measured in a flume for simple cylindrical obstructions of the same shape and size but with different flexibility under several flow conditions. This data set is used to fit drag parameters and to relate their value to flexibility, Cauchy Number, and elastic modulus. A formulation is presented where the drag coefficient is evaluated as a function of the relative velocity and the elastic modulus of the obstruction. While a Vogel exponent and reference velocity can be used to provide a similar predicted response, the new formulation provides more insight to the physical behaviour occurring in the element.",

Our model computed cloud fraction shows reasonable agreement with cloud frequency observed by HIRDLS and CALIOP in the tropical troposphere layer (TTL). Our results suggest that ~64% of the cirrus formed in the TTL are due convection. Overall we find that inclusion of cloud microphysical processes increases stratospheric water vapor by 0.5 ppmv. Adding anvil ice increases stratospheric water vapor by an additional 0.5-0.6 ppmv but has a bigger impact on cloud formation with an increase of ~20-30% in TTL cloud fraction. With convection and cloud dehydration global 18-30 km average water vapor is ~5-7% higher than MLS water vapor observations. Adding waves to the MERRA temperature fields reduces stratospheric water vapor bringing our estimates to within 3% of MLS.",

            "abstract": "Hydrodynamic processes on coral reefs are important for nutrient cycling, larval dispersal, temperature variability, and understanding the impacts of terrestrial sediment, nutrients, and contaminants from adjacent impaired watersheds on coral reef ecosystems. Our goal was to understand the spatial and temporal variability in flow velocities and the associated residence time of water in the fringing coral reef flat-lined embayment of Faga’alu, on the island of Tutuila in American Samoa. To accomplish this, data from three bottom-mounted acoustic current profilers and 102 individual Lagrangian ocean surface current drifter deployments (5 drifters x 21 deployments) were combined with meteorologic data and numerical wave model results. These data and model results, collected over nine days, made it possible to evaluate the relative contribution of tidal, wind, and wave forcing on the flow patterns. The high number of drifter deployments made it possible for the velocity data to be binned into 100 m x 100 m grid cells and the resulting residence times computed for the different sets of forcing conditions. Cumulative progressive vectors calculated from the acoustic current profilers closely matched the tracks from concurrently deployed surface current drifters, showing the applicability of this hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian measurement scheme to understand flow patterns in this geomorphically complex embayment. The bay-wide man current speeds (residence times) varied from 1-37 cm/s (2.78-0.08 hr), 1-36 cm/s (2.78-0.08 hr), and 5-64 cm/s (0.56-0.04 hr) under tidal, wind, and wave forcing, respectively; the highest speeds (shortest residence times) were measured on the outer reef flat closest to where waves were breaking on the reef crest and were slowest (longest) over the inner reef flat close to shore and deep in the embayment.",

Thawed transects associated with varying stages of permafrost thaw: from palsas with intact permafrost (P), through edge of palsa (EP), dry lawn (DL), wet lawn (WL), edge of thawed pond (ET), pond sedges (PS), to several thawed ponds (TP) in a subarctic peatland in northern Quebec were sampled in the snow free seasons of 2013 and 2014. The exchange of CO2 and CH4, vegetation, dissolved organic C (DOC) concentration and biodegradability, active layer depth, air and peat temperatures, water table depth (WT), pH, and conductivity were measured. Peat temperatures were quite similar among different locations, but the WT decreased significantly along the transect creating varied environmental conditions that supporting different plant communities. From dry to wet area, vegetation abundance and biomass showed reductions of shrubs and lichens, and increases of Sphagnum, grasses and sedges. Pore water pH increased from dry to wet area, and conductivity slightly decreased. Wet thaw area WL, ET and PS had relatively higher season gross ecosystem production (GEP) and higher season ecosystem respiration (ER), but relative similar net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). Only TP had a significant higher positive season NEE. Palsa was the only CH4 sink, and quite high CH4 emissions were found after it thawed. CH4-C release significantly increased from dry to wet in thawed area, which even several times bigger than total C exchange in ET and PS. Generally, wet area had higher DOC concentration and higher DOC biodegradability indicated by lower SUVA254 (except PS which received great influence from pond). All components in the NECB (GEP, ER, CH4, DOC) increased significantly in magnitude from palsa to wet thawed area, and ecosystem C sink turned into source as palsa thawed into PS and TP. These results demonstrated WT and vegetation change lead the changes in peatland NECB with permafrost thaw. Large amount and more labile DOC produced in thawed area may indicate a ‘fast’ C uptake–decomposition loop was adapted in thawed peatland, and associated with the high CO2 and CH4 efflux.",

To investigate the cycling of lithogenic particles in the central North Pacific Ocean, surface and vertical profile samples of marine suspended particulate matter (SPM) were collected July-August 2012 during the HOE-DYLAN cruises at Station ALOHA. In the late summer, atmospheric dust inputs from the Gobi desert (which peak during the spring, April-May) were sparse, as indicated by low surface particulate Ti (pTi) concentrations. In contrast, surface pAl concentrations did not follow pTi trends as expected, but appear to be dominated by scavenging/uptake of dissolved Al during diatom blooms. Surface pMn concentrations were low, but vertical profiles of pMn and pMn/pTi reveal a strong sedimentary source at 200 m, originating from the Hawaiian continental shelf through a combination of redox mobilization and resuspension processes. The redox active elements Ce and Co can have chemistries similar to that of Mn, but in these samples the pCe and pCo distributions were distinct from Mn and each other in both surface trends and vertical profiles. Surface pREE (e.g., La, Ce, Pr) were highest during the earliest sampling events and quickly decreased to consistently low concentrations, while vertical distributions were characterized by scavenging onto biotic particles and mid-depth inputs. The surface particulate Co trend is similar to those of pAl and pP, while the pCo vertical profiles reflect surface enrichment but low concentrations and little variability at depth.\nA second, complementary poster is also being presented which examines the biological influence over particulate trace element cycling (Weisend et al., \"Particulate Trace Element Cycling in a Diatom Bloom at Station ALOHA\").",

            "abstract": "Phytoplankton in oligotrophic marine deserts depend on remote sources to supply trace nutrients. To examine these sources, marine particulate matter samples from the central North Pacific (Station ALOHA) were collected during the July-August 2012 HOE-DYLAN cruises and analyzed for a suite of trace (e.g., Fe, Mn) and major (e.g. Al, P) elements. Daily surface SPM samples were examined for evidence of atmospheric deposition and biological uptake, while five vertical profiles were examined for evidence of surface vertical export and subsurface horizontal transport from nearby sources (e.g., margin sediments, hydrothermal plumes). Maxima in surface particulate P (a biological tracer) corresponded with a diatom bloom, and surprisingly also coincided with maxima in particulate Al (typically a tracer for lithogenic inputs). The surface particulate Al distributions likely result from the adsorption of dissolved Al onto diatom silica frustules, not from atmospheric dust deposition. In addition, a subsurface maximum in particulate Al and P was observed four days later at 75m, possibly resulting from vertical export of the surface diatom bloom. The distributions of other bioactive trace elements (e.g. Cd, Co, Cu) will be presented in the context of the diatom bloom and other biological, chemical and physical features.\nA second, complementary poster is also being presented which examines the cycling of trace elements in lithogenic particles (Morton et al., \"Trace Element Cycling in Lithogenic Particles at Station ALOHA\").",

            "abstract": "Parameterizations of physical processes in climate models are highly dependent on the spatial and temporal resolution and must be tuned for each resolution under consideration. At high spatial resolutions, objective methods for parameter tuning are computationally prohibitive. Our work has focused on calibrating parameters in the Community Atmosphere Model 5 (CAM5) for three spatial resolutions: 1, 2, and 4 degrees. Using perturbed-parameter ensembles and uncertainty quantification methodology, we have identified input parameters that minimize discrepancies of energy fluxes simulated by CAM5 across the three resolutions and with respect to satellite observations. We are also beginning to exploit the parameter-resolution relationships to objectively tune parameters in a high-resolution version of CAM5 by leveraging cheaper, low-resolution simulations and statistical models. We will present our approach to multi-resolution climate model parameter tuning, as well as the key findings.

            "abstract": "Studies with idealized climate models often make simplifying decisions to average solar radiation over space and time. But clear-sky and cloud albedo are increasing functions of the solar zenith angle, so the choice of average solar zenith angle is important and can lead to significant climate biases. Here, I use radiative transfer calculations for a pure scattering atmosphere and with a more detailed radiative transfer model to argue that one should in general choose the insolation-weighted zenith angle, rather than the simpler daytime-average zenith angle. The insolation-weighted zenith angle is especially superior if clouds are responsible for much of the shortwave reflection. Use of the daytime-average zenith angle may lead to a high bias in planetary albedo of ~3%, equivalent to a deficit in shortwave absorption of 10 W m-2 in the global energy budget (comparable to the radiative forcing of a roughly sixfold change in CO2 concentration). Other studies that have used general circulation models with spatially constant insolation have underestimated the global-mean zenith angle, with a consequent low bias in planetary albedo of ~2-6%, or a surplus in shortwave absorption of ~7-20 W m-2 in the global energy budget. I also discuss how a simple time-varying solar zenith angle could be used to minimize zenith angle-related biases in albedo for models of global climate that choose to spatially homogenize insolation.",

            "abstract": "The chemical aspects of hydrofracturing might seem straight forward: Inject a fluid with sand and some chemicals, recover the injected water now contaminated with chemicals from the shale, and produce gas. But there are some complications that turn out to be very interesting. First of all, it is possible to recover only about 20% of the injected water. Secondly, the fresh injected water (1-5 kppm) has been turned into a very saline bine (~200 kppm). It’s easy to say the water has just been imbibed into the gas-filled dry shale, like water into a dry sponge, except the organic parts of the shale which host nearly all the porosity are hydrophobic. The shale is strongly oil wet; nevertheless it imbibes water. It’s easy to say the water just mixed with water in the shale and became salty, but there is almost no water in the shale, and no salt either. How the water becomes salty begs easy explanation. The talk will quantitatively discuss these issues in light of experiments we have carried out, concluding that powerful capillary and osmotic forces draw fracking water into the shale while making the return waters salty. How this is achieved will certainly tell us something about the fracture network and its connections. The practical implication is that hydrofracture fluids will be locked into the same “permeability jail” that sequestered overpressured gas for over 200 million years. If one wants to dispose of fracking waters, one could probably not choose a safer way to do so that to inject them into a gas shale.",

These observations were made as part of the Naval Research Laboratory research program titled “The Effects of Bay of Bengal Freshwater Flux on Indian Ocean Monsoon (EBOB)” and the Office of Naval Research (ONR) DRI titled “The Air-Sea Interaction in the Northern Indian Ocean (ASIRI)”. A major objective of ASIRI-EBOB program is to understand and to quantify dynamical processes and boundary transports that control fresh and salt water exchanges between the BoB and the Arabian Sea. The transects of currents collected from shipboard ADCPs in the southern BoB, southeast of Sri Lanka, along 5.25°N in December show a southeastward flowing, surface intensified boundary current (referred to as the East India Coastal Current (EICC)) in the upper 75 m with speeds as large as 1.6 m/s at 21 m depth. Outside the EICC, a sub-surface intensified, northward moving, 300 km wide current with strongest velocities as high as 1 m/s near 50-75 m depth was observed. The near surface currents derived from AVISO altimeter and drifter records show quantitatively similar flow patterns. Numerical models produce qualitatively similar flow fields. The combined observations and model results indicate that the EICC moves low-salinity water out of the BoB while the sub-surface current carries high-salinity water into the BoB.",

Magnetic reconnection signatures accompany them. Satellite-drag/density enhancements of 20-100% are commonly seen by CHAMP (Luhr et al, 2004). We calculate these to correspond to transient energy deposition rates at the feet of freshly reconnected open flux tubes, equaling 5-30 times solar EUV rates above 150 km altitude. That these density enhancements are observed all seasons, darkness or sunlight, IMF north or south (Kervalishvili and Luhr, 2013), is powerful evidence for ubiquitous and substantial dayside polar cap energy injection. Frictional drag heating is closest to the physical cause (Strangeway, 2011); we find response times ~ ¼ hour above 200 km. Altitude is key, Poynting flux measurements without coincident electron density profiles, can yield order of magnitude energy deposition rate errors (Richmond, 2010, Carlson et al, 2012).",

These implementations help specify physically self-consistent initial conditions for more computationally intensive 3D GCM runs, and provide insight into the results of those simulations. The 2D surface volatile exchange model provides predictions of surface conditions (surface pressure, ground temperature, ice coverage, etc.) with easy variation of input parameters (thermal inertia, ice albedo, volatile inventory, etc.) and the 1D radiative-convective model provides predictions of global-average air temperature with easy variation of input parameters (atmospheric composition, etc.) We compare our 2D surface volatile exchange model with others’ work, and highlight the important role that ice sublimation and deposition play in the atmospheric dynamics.",

Ocean to ocean dissimilarities are evident in the dry subtropical climate belt, marked by deserts on land and salty surface ocean water. The subtropical sea surface salinity maximum (SSS-max) patterns of 5 the subtropical regimes (the North and South Atlantic, North and South Pacific, and the southern Indian Ocean) display significant dissimilarities in their relative position within their ocean basin, in the structure and seasonality of the SSS-max pattern. The near synoptic coverage of Aquarius and Argo profilers are further defining interannual variability. The South Atlantic SSS-max is pressed against the western boundary, whereas in the other regimes the SSS-max falls within the eastern half of the ocean basin, though the western South Pacific displays a secondary SSS-max.

A new generation of microbe-explicit soil decomposition models (MEMs) are being developed that represent soil biological complexity, but only a few take into account detailed biotic and abiotic components and competitive interactions in the complex soil system. In view of this, we have developed a thermodynamically based MEM with a detailed component network (polymeric organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, microbes, extracellular enzymes, and mineral surfaces), in which competitive interactions and microbial metabolism are modeled using Equilibrium Chemistry Approximation kinetics and Dynamic Energy Budget theory, respectively. The model behavior has been tested and is qualitatively consistent with many empirical studies, but further evaluation of the model with field or lab experimental data in specific ecosystems is needed. Stable carbon isotope (13C) tracer experiments provide a means to directly evaluate soil carbon dynamics simulated by MEMs. In this study, we further develop the model to explicitly account for different carbon isotopes, including 13C and 14C. Isotopic fractionations in soil decomposition processes, including soil organic matter transformations and microbial metabolism, are considered. The 13C signals of different soil components derived from a 13C tracer experiment in Arctic tundra soils are used to test the model behavior and identify needed parametric and structural improvements. Our modeling and data comparison identify several key mechanisms that need to be included in MEMs. Finally, we present an analysis of the relative benefits and costs of additional complexity in MEMs compared to traditional pool-based modeling structures.",

            "abstract": "In this experimental study, we investigated the influence of solution chemistry on the boron abundance in synthetic calcite using a pH-stat system. We systematically varied solution pH as well as the concentration of total dissolved boron (BT), inorganic carbon (DIC) and calcium ion. We found robust positive correlations between boron abundance in calcite (measured as the boron to calcium ratio, B/Ca) and solution pH, [BT], [DIC] as well as [Ca2+], when a given parameter was solely manipulated while keeping the others constant. Except for [BT], raising these parameters also caused simultaneous increase in calcite saturation and precipitation rate. We found that much of the B/Ca variability as a results of the chemical manipulations tested here can be essentially explained by just precipitation rate and the [BT]/[DIC] ratio in the solution, which was particularly the case for relatively rapidly precipitated calcite samples. On the contrary, for relatively slowly precipitated samples, the [B(OH)4-]/[DIC] and [BT]/[DIC] ratios are equally effective in explaining the B/Ca variability (along with precipitation rate). This observation suggests the possibility of a hitherto unrecognized and apparently kinetically-controlled mechanism that promotes B(OH)3 incorporation for rapidly forming calcite.\nIn recent years both the abundance and isotopic composition of boron in marine biogenic CaCO3 (B/Ca and δ11B, respectively) has been increasingly utilized to constrain past ocean carbonate chemistry. But these boron-based proxies crucially rely on the first order assumption that B(OH)4- is predominantly incorporated. Thus, the possibility of kinetically-controlled B(OH)3 incorporation presented here raises a concern for the reliability of the B/Ca and δ11B proxy. If it is similarly applicable to foraminifers, shell B/Ca and δ11B may be prone to significant uncertainties due to long-term changes in seawater chemistry. Our results further suggest that future calibrations of these proxies clearly need to take calcification rates into consideration.",

Its predecessor ICESat, which operated from 2003 to 2009, pioneered the use of laser altimeters in space to study the elevation of the Earth’s surface and its changes. Among other contributions to the cryospheric sciences, ICESat proved adept at making centimeter-level elevation measurements over both ice sheets and sea ice. Since ICESat stopped collecting data in October 2009, the IceBridge and CryoSat-2 missions continue these important observations. The well-documented and ongoing dramatic and rapid changes in the Earth’s ice cover have strengthened the need for sustained observations beyond what CryoSat-2 and IceBridge are expected to provide. Lessons learned from ICESat are the need for cross-track slope information (realized through ICESat-2’s multiple beams), a smaller footprint size, and gapless along-track data collection. These needs resulted in a different measurement concept for ICESat-2.\nThe talk will provide a brief summary of the measurement concept, the status of hardware development (instrument Integration and Testing has started in May 2014), and progress on geophysical algorithm development.",

            "abstract": "Data assimilation applications require characterization of the errors in the products being assimilated. When true data are not available to explicitly compute these errors, triple collocation (TC) provides a methodology to estimate the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) and correlations by combining three simultaneous co-located estimates. Triple collocation assumes that for each of the three products, the errors are independent of each other. In many cases, however, one may expect correlations between errors to be significant. Among others, they are likely to occur when there is a representativeness error between some of the products (e.g. if one of the products is based on in situ measurements) or if two out of the three products have a similar source – for example both coming from microwave remote sensing estimates or both originating in land surface models. Indeed, previous studies have shown that this assumption can induce significant inaccuracies in the error estimates. For classical TC, the assumption is needed for the system to be fully determined - only six independent equations are available for estimating 6 unknowns: 3 scale parameters and 3 error variances (i.e. RMSEs). In this presentation, we propose obtaining additional information from the triplet of observations by using errors-in-variables-based regressions between pairs of noisy observations to estimate the scale parameters. The introduction of additional equations allows for the derivation of additional unknowns, such that non-zero correlations between the errors of the different products can be derived. This significantly increases the accuracy of the estimated errors compared to classical triple collocation, as will be shown using both simulation studies with known errors and an application to soil moisture data.",

            "abstract": "A newly-designed Microwave Temperature Profiler (MTP) was developed at JPL for the NSF-NCAR Gulfstream-V aircraft. The MTP is a scanning microwave radiometer that measures thermal emission in the 50-60 GHz oxygen complex. It scans from near-zenith to near-nadir, measuring brightness temperatures forward, above, and below the aircraft at 17 s intervals. A statistical retrieval method derives temperature profiles from the measurements, using proximate radiosonde profiles as a priori information. MTP data examples from recent experiments, comparisons with simultaneous temperature profiles from the Airborne Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System (AVAPS), and a method for blending MTP and AVAPS temperature profiles will be presented.\nThe Mesoscale Predictability Experiment (MPEX; May-June, 2013) investigated the utility of sub-synoptic observations to extend convective-scale predictability and otherwise enhance skill in regional numerical weather prediction over short forecast periods. This project relied on MTP and AVAPS profiles to characterize atmospheric structure on fine spatial scales. Comparison of MTP profiles with AVAPS profiles confirms uncertainty specifications of MTP. A profile blending process takes advantage of the high resolution of AVAPS profiles below the aircraft while utilizing MTP profiles above the aircraft. Ongoing research with these data sets examines double tropopause structure in association with the sub-tropical jet, mountain lee waves, and fluxes at the tropopause. The attached figure shows a mountain lee wave signature in the MTP-derived isentrope field along the flight track during an east-west segment over the Rocky Mountains. A vertically propagating wave with westward tilt is evident on the leeward side of the mountains at around 38 ksec.\nThe Deep Propagating Gravity Wave Experiment over New Zealand (DEEPWAVE; June-July, 2014) investigated the dynamics of gravity waves from the surface to the lower thermosphere. MTP and AVAPS measurements during DEEPWAVE will contribute to the understanding of gravity waves generation and propagation across the tropopause into the stratosphere. Comparison of MTP and AVAPS temperature profiles will be presented at the meeting, along with preliminary examples of gravity wave signatures in the data.",

            "abstract": "The quantitative detection of clouds in satellite imagery has a number of important applications in weather analysis. The proper interpretation of satellite imagery for improved situational awareness depends on knowing where the clouds are at all times of the day. Additionally, many products derived from infrared measurements need accurate cloud information to mask out regions where retrieval of geophysical parameters in the atmosphere or on the surface are not possible. Thus, the accurate detection of the presence of clouds in satellite imagery on a global basis is important to the product developers and the operational weather community to support their decision-making process. This abstract describes an application of a two-channel bispectral composite threshold (BCT) approach applied to VIIRS imagery. The simplified BCT approach uses only the 10.76 and 3.75 micrometer spectral channels in two spectral tests; a straight-forward infrared threshold test with the longwave channel and a shortwave minus longwave channel difference test. The key to the success of this approach as demonstrated in past applications to GOES and MODIS data is the generation of temporally and spatially dependent thresholds used in the tests from a previous number of days at similar observations to the current data. The presentation will present an overview of the approach and intercomparison results with other satellites, methods, and against verification data.",

            "abstract": "Heat stress is the leading cause of weather-related human mortality in the United States and in many countries world-wide. Heat stress is usually enhanced by the urban heat island effect. Here, we investigate the ability to use remotely sensed atmospheric profiles to detect and monitor heat stress in the urban environment. MODIS atmospheric profiles at 5 km are used to quantify the spatial distribution of heat stress across Chicago during summer periods from 2003-2013. Four heat stress indices are investigated (Discomfort Index (DI), NWS Heat Index (HI), Humidex, and Simplified Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (SWBGT)) from the near-surface temperature and humidity observed at ground sites and retrieved from satellite atmospheric profiles. The heat stress climatology indicates that the urban effects are similar to the heat stress in top 5% hot days and 11 summers during the daytime. There is a lack of relationship between urban fraction and the heat stress on the warmest nights. The nighttime heat stress in the hottest 5% suggests a larger stress compared to the normal conditions during 11 summers. A case study of the heat wave in 2012 is assessed to identify the key pre-heat wave spatial patterns, which may potentially apply to predict future high heat-stress events. In addition, the role of the temporal persistence on the spatial dynamics of the heat wave is also examined. This research illustrates the spatial heat pattern under normal and heat wave conditions, which may help to make public heat health protection strategies. Also, the remotely sensed temperature and humidity information are invaluable to assess urban heat island impact spatially and temporally.",

            "abstract": "Analysis of borehole temperature data have contributed significantly to estimating the last millennium surface temperature changes. Additionally, recent analysis have contributed to evaluate the Earth’s energy balance by providing a quantitative value for the energy absorbed by the continents in the later part of the 20th century. Knowledge of the surface energy flux is important for understanding the solid Earth – atmosphere boundary condition, land cover changes, and their impact on regional and global climate models.\nWe present data and analysis of 19 borehole temperature versus depth profiles from South America. The dataset includes 10 new borehole logs measured during 2012 at three sites in northern Chile (Vallenar, Sierra Gorda and Sierra Limon Verde). These new measurements complement six temperature logs measured during 1994 in the same region (sites near Michilla and Sierra Limon Verde; Springer et al., Tectonophysics, 1998) and four logs obtained from the NOAA Paleoclimatology Borehole Database located in Villa Staff, Toquepala and Talara in Peru.\nThese data were analyzed for climate variability signals of the surface temperature and changes in the Earth’s surface energy balance. The analysis suggests a cooling trend during the 19th century of approximately -0.5ºK. Furthermore, results show regionalized temperature changes in ground surface temperatures during the last 50 years with estimates of -0.4ºK in Vallenar, and approximately +1ºK in the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile. We place the results within the context of surface air temperature yearly means obtained from existing meteorological and proxy paleoclimatic data between Peru and Northern Chile. The use of geothermal measurements for climate variability studies provides a further understanding of the climatic and energy cycles of the Southern Hemisphere, where meteorological data can be scarce to non-existent.",

            "abstract": "A common question by users to NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) local offices is how significant is global climate change in their local area. The scientific community provides copious information on global climate change, including assessments, for large regions. However, most decisions are made at the local level, where little or no information typically exists.\nTo address this need, NOAA NWS released operationally the Local Climate Analysis Tool (LCAT) in 2013 and specifically incorporated a capability into the tool to determine the local Rate of Change (ROC). Although ROC provides answers to some questions, we have seen an additional need for clarification on the significance of the ROC, such as whether or not it differentiates natural variability from a real signal of longer-term climate change. This question becomes very important for decision makers in consideration of their long term planning efforts to build local resilience to changes in climate.\nLCAT uses three trend adjustment methods in computing ROC: Hinge, Optimal Climate Normals (OCN), and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA). The Hinge tracks changes in climate time series, and OCN and EWMS track changes in climate normals. ROC is the slope of the straight line fit of the trend. Standard statistical methodology in use provides guidance for confidence intervals of the slope parameter (von Storch and Zwiers, 1999), which works well for a linear regression fit and can be used for ROCs of OCN and EWMA. However the Hinge, which is a linear fit anchored on one end, needs some additional adjustments and most likely will have smaller confidence intervals than those estimated by the statistical method.\nAn additional way to look at the problem is to assess how the climate change signal compares to climate variability in the local time series. Livezey et al. (2007) suggested the use of the signal to noise ratio to estimate the significance of the rate of climate change. The signal to noise ratio of 0.05 means that in 20 years, the local climate change signal will be as large as the standard measure of the noise, computed as the variance of the departure of the trend from the climate time series. This intuitively allows assessment of whether or not the local climate change is within the range of natural variability.",

The primary objective of CPS is to integrate plasma density and drift measurements from C/NOFS with ground-based observations of disturbances within magnetic flux tubes to address outstanding scientific questions regarding relationships between plasma fluctuations in the topside ionosphere and wave-like structures generated at bottomside altitudes where satellites have little or no direct access. This project has the potential to generate new insights into the dynamics of ionosphere-neutral atmosphere interactions known to affect operational systems. This could prove particularly valuable in areas where there are no ground stations. Initial results are quite promising, but there is still much work to be done in understanding the mechanisms that couple the topside and bottomside of the ionosphere. ",

            "abstract": "The NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) has recently developed a new set of archiving standards based on a rigorously defined information model. An important part of the new PDS information model is the model for geometry metadata, which includes, for example, attributes of the lighting and viewing angles of observations, position and velocity vectors of a spacecraft relative to Sun and observing body at the time of observation and the location and orientation of an observation on the target. The PDS geometry model is based on requirements gathered from the planetary research community, data producers, and software engineers who build search tools. A key requirement for the model is that it fully supports the breadth of PDS archives that include a wide range of data types from missions and instruments observing many types of solar system bodies such as planets, ring systems, and smaller bodies (moons, comets, and asteroids). Thus, important design aspects of the geometry model are that it standardizes the definition of the geometry attributes and provides consistency of geometry metadata across planetary science disciplines. The model specification also includes parameters so that the context of values can be unambiguously interpreted. For example, the reference frame used for specifying geographic locations on a planetary body is explicitly included with the other geometry metadata parameters. The structure and content of the new PDS geometry model is designed to enable both science analysis and efficient development of search tools. The geometry model is implemented in XML, as is the main PDS information model, and uses XML schema for validation. The initial version of the geometry model is focused on geometry for remote sensing observations conducted by flyby and orbiting spacecraft. Future releases of the PDS geometry model will be expanded to include metadata for landed and rover spacecraft.",

            "abstract": "As Terra marks its 15th anniversary, the Students’ Cloud Observations On-Line (S’COOL) Project celebrates an 18 year milestone. S’COOL is the education and public outreach arm of the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project, which has two instruments on Terra. It developed from an initial conversation between scientists and educators in December 1996 before the launch of the first CERES instrument on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Since January 1997, S’COOL has engaged students and citizen scientists with this NASA research by inviting them to make ground truth observations of clouds and related Earth system parameters.\nSince the project began, more than 127,000 cloud observations have been reported from more than 70 countries around the world. While observations are accepted at any time, more than half of those reported correspond to a CERES satellite retrieval matched in time (+/-15 minutes) and space. Nearly 1% of the reports, from locations at higher latitudes, can be compared to both Terra and Aqua to shed light on view angle effects. More than 3% of observations are for Terra night-time overpasses. About 10% of reports are for locations with snow on the ground – an ongoing challenge for cloud detection from space.\nS’COOL draws very loyal and unique participants: a school in Pennsylvania alone has reported more than 11,000 observations (including more than 2,500 night-time reports for Terra). In Central and South America, 3 schools in Colombia and one in Nicaragua have each reported more than 2,500 observations. The addition of the S’COOL Rover program, added in 2007 to simplify participation for citizen scientists, enabled reports from the Around the Americas sailing ship that circumnavigated North and South America in 2009-10, Roz Savage, a UK woman who has rowed solo across all the world’s oceans, and a few observations from the MAGIC campaign of instrumented cargo ships transiting from Long Beach to Hawaii. A middle school in Connecticut is credited with more than 2,500 observations, including a large number made from the students’ homes, which provides dense spatial sampling at certain time periods.\nThis poster will update and summarize the achievements of the first 18 years of this project, and share some lessons learned through its operation.",

            "abstract": "The global carbon cycle determines the distribution of carbon between the atmosphere, ocean, and solid earth. Carbon from the mantle enters the Earth's surficial environment as CO2 by volcanic outgassing, and carbon is buried in the oceanic crust as carbonate rocks during silicate rock weathering. The subduction of carbonate-rich oceanic plates returns carbon to the mantle, closing the cycle. Subtle adjustments in continental silicate weathering, widely held to consume atmospheric CO2 at a rate controlled by climate, are believed to have maintained habitable conditions throughout Earth's history. This long term climate regulation mechanism is known as a climate-weathering feedback. Seafloor weathering, low-temperature basalt alteration and carbonate precipitation in the permeable upper oceanic crust, has been proposed as a climate-weathering feedback as well, but the link to climate is presently poorly understood. Such a climate regulation mechanism would be particularly important on waterworld planets where continental silicate weathering cannot regulate climate. ",

            "abstract": "The Middle Miocene Climate Transition (MMCT) at ~13.8 Ma marks the point when Earth made its final transition to the icehouse conditions of the Pleistocene (see Tian et al., 2013). Prior to the MMCT, the Middle Miocene Climate Optimum (MCO) is characterized by relatively high levels of pCO2 in the atmosphere (350-400 ppm; Foster et al., 2012). Across the MMCT, there is rapid cooling and a decrease in pCO2 levels (down to 260-200 ppm; Foster et al., 2012). As present day atmospheric pCO2 reaches levels similar to those in the MCO, understanding the sensitivity of the climate system to external forcing during times of high pCO2 becomes even more crucial. Accordingly, a high resolution (<5 kyr) record of export production in the eastern equatorial Pacific at IODP Site U1337 was produced spanning 14.1-13.5 Ma using marine barite accumulation rates (BAR) following Paytan et el. (1993). This site is estimated to have been at ~3900 m depth at 15 Ma and was within the paleoequatorial band throughout the middle Miocene (Expedition 320/321 Scientists, 2010). The age model was created by Tian et al. (2013) from the spliced section by tuning the benthic δ18O from U1337 to the obliquity of the astronomical solution of Laskar et al. (2004). Using this age model, ~200 samples were selected from Site U1337 and a record of export production was constructed. BAR fluctuates dramatically across this interval, from peaks of over 20 mg/cm2·kyr to less than 1 mg/cm2·kyr. The results from this study are compared with previously published δ18O and δ13C records (Tian et al., 2013) from the same core at a similar temporal resolution. This data will give us valuable insight into controls on the carbon cycle, including relationships with orbital parameters over intervals of rapidly changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Climate Field Reconstructions (CFRs) of past climate help expand our knowledge of climate variability beyond the limited instrumental records, allowing for a fuller characterization of natural variability and the investigation of the role of climate forcings. In this study, we do so via a new global temperature reconstruction using a refined CFR method and the latest compilation of high-resolution proxy records.\nThe CFRs use GraphEM, which leverages Gaussian graphical models to improve estimates of the spatial dependencies of the climate field [1]. The method was found to outperform competing regression-based CFR methods [2]. The input data are primarily based on the PAGES 2k[3] and Ocean 2k community efforts, and are screened based on correlations to the HadCRUT4 target [4]. Uncertainty estimates, derived from a non-parametric block bootstrap method, provide an ensemble of reconstructions for probabilistic assessments.\nPreliminary results show that the 20thcentury was 85% likely to be the warmest period within at least the past 1500 years. The Medieval Climate Anomaly is found to be warmer than the Little Ice Age almost everywhere on land, with an El Niño-like pattern identified in the tropical Pacific. A pattern of high-latitude amplification is found in Eurasia and North America. It may correspond to a purely forced solar mode or an eigenmode excited by solar forcing (Fig. 1), but our analysis cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. In contrast to [3], where little synchronization is found among different regions, inter-hemispheric similarities are found over several periods in last millennium, indicating strong spatial coherence. Finally, we will characterize the continuum of temperature variability [5] via a regional analysis of the spectral properties of reconstructed temperature.\n",

            "abstract": "The Asian monsoon system influences the lives of over 60% of the planet's population, with widespread socioeconomic effects resulting from weakening or failure of monsoon rains. Spatially broad and temporally extended drought episodes have been known to dramatically influence human history, including the Strange Parallels Drought in the mid-18th century. Here, we explore the dynamics of sustained monsoon failure using the Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas – a high-resolution network of hydro-climatically sensitive tree-ring records – and a 1300-year pre-industrial control run of the Community Earth System Model (CESM).\nSpatial drought patterns in the instrumental and model-based Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) during years with extremely weakened South Asian monsoon are similar to those reconstructed during the Strange Parallels Drought in the MADA. We further explore how the large-scale Indo-Pacific climate during weakened South Asian monsoon differs between interannual and decadal timescales. The Strange Parallels Drought pattern is observed during March-April-May primarily over Southeast Asia, with decreased precipitation and reduced moisture fluxes, while anomalies in June-July-August are confined to the Indian subcontinent during both individual and decadal events. Individual years with anomalous drying exhibit canonical El Niño conditions over the eastern equatorial Pacific and associated shifts in the Walker circulation, while decadal events appear to be related to anomalous warming around the dateline in the equatorial Pacific, typical of El Niño Modoki events. The results suggest different dynamical processes influence drought at different time scales through distinct remote ocean influences.",

            "abstract": "Waves and currents on the continental shelf interact to produce time-varying complex ripple patterns on the seafloor. While high-resolution, two-phase models can provide details on the physics of sediment transport in the bottom boundary layer, time-varying ripple models can predict the seafloor topography spectrum providing estimates of ripple height, length, orientation and ultimately, seafloor roughness. Roughness is an important characteristic of the bottom boundary layer that affects waves and currents as well as acoustic scattering and penetration into the seabed. A one-dimensional spectral ripple model is used to predict the time-dependent seafloor spectra given a time series of observed or forecasted wave conditions. The model allows each wave number component of the seafloor spectra to evolve independently and treats the temporal evolution of the components as a relaxation process. The approach allows for an adjustment timescale that is dependent on the previous bed state, includes a wash out criteria for strong wave conditions, and is forced with robust equilibrium ripple predictors. We compare the spatial and temporal seafloor spectra predictions from the model to ripples observed during an experiment at the O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory at Oregon State University. Ripple lengths were estimated from data collected by a high-frequency sector scanning sonar throughout the 6-day experiment. Wave heights and periods ranged from 0.25 m to 1 m and 2 s to 5 s, respectively. The observed data is used to validate the timescale of ripple evolution and ripple lengths predicted by the model.",

            "abstract": "The disturbance regime in temperate zone forests is a function of both human interventions ─ such as thinning and harvesting ─ and background events, including wildfire and outbreaks of pests and pathogens. Forest management requires a good understanding of the relative magnitude and trends in these disturbances, but the inherent spatial heterogeneity in their distribution and the large size of the relevant domains makes monitoring a challenge. Satellite remote sensing offers various tools to address this challenge, and in this study we employed 25 years of Landsat data (1986-2010) to characterize the disturbance regime over forested areas in the state of Oregon, U.S.A. Segmentation of the temporal trajectory of a spectral vegetation index over the study interval was used to specify the year, duration, and intensity of disturbances for each Landsat pixel. Attribution was to Harvest/Thinning, Fire, and Other (mostly pests and pathogens). The western side of the state had a larger proportion of its area disturbed over the study interval (29% vs. 23% for Eastern Oregon). The incidence of Harvest/Thinning there greatly exceeded the incidence of Fire and Other disturbance. In the more xeric eastern OR, the incidence of Fire was greater than the incidence of Harvest/Thinning or Other. The annual area harvested or thinned increased from the 1990s to the 2000s in western Oregon, but decreased in eastern Oregon. In both cases, the area burned increased. These observed patterns in disturbance will be input to a spatially-distributed biogeochemistry model to evaluate related impacts on the carbon and hydrologic cycles.",

            "abstract": "Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh) is among the most ecologically, economically and culturally important trees in North America, but has experienced a decline disease across much of its range. We investigated the climatic and edaphic factors associated with A. saccharum growth in the Adirondack Mountains (USA) using a well-replicated tree-ring network incorporating a range of soil fertility (base cation availability). We found that nearly 3 in 4 A. saccharum trees exhibited declining growth rates during the last several decades, regardless of tree age or size. Although diameter growth was consistently higher on base-rich soils, the negative trends in growth were largely consistent across the soil chemistry gradient. Sensitivity of sugar maple growth to climatic variability was overall weaker than expected, but were also non-stationary during the 20th century. We observed increasingly positive responses to late-winter precipitation, increasingly negative responses to growing season temperatures, and strong positive responses to moisture availability during the 1960s drought that became much weaker during the recent pluvial. Further study is needed of these factors and their interactions as potential mechanisms for sugar maple growth decline.",

            "abstract": "Effects of environmental stresses on deep-diving marine mammal populations have not been studied systematically. Long-term regional passive acoustic monitoring of phonating marine mammals opens opportunities for such studies. This paper presents a unique multi-year study conducted by the Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center (LADC) in the Northern Gulf of Mexico to understand short-term and long-term effects of anthropogenic stresses on resident populations of endangered sperm and elusive beaked whales. Both species spend many hours each day in deep dives which last about one hour each, so any visual observations for population estimates and behavioral responses are very limited. However, much more cost-efficient acoustic recordings of the phonations during dives on bottom-mounted hydrophones are not skewed by weather conditions or daylight requirements. Broadband passive acoustic data were collected by LADC in 2007 and 2010 at three ranges, 15, 40, and 80 km away from the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill site. Pre-spill and post-spill data processing and comparison allow observing responses of both species to local short–term environmental condition changes and long-term responses to the spill. The short-term effects are studied by correlating daily activity cycles with anthropogenic noise curve daily and weekly cycles at different sites. The strong correlation between the decrease in overall daily activity and the increase in anthropogenic noise level associated with seismic exploration signals can be seen. After streaming raw acoustic data through detection algorithms and detailed assessment of false detection rates, the temporal densities of acoustic phonations are passed into statistical algorithms for resident population estimations. The statistically significant results have shown different regional abundance trends, associated with long-term responses to environmental stresses, for these two species.",

            "abstract": "The Rustenberg Layered Suite of the Bushveld Complex, South Africa is the world’s largest exposed mafic magma chamber. The uppermost ~2.5 km of the 8-9 km thick intrusion are represented by the Upper and Upper Main Zones (UUMZ) and are thought to denote the final pulse of magma into the chamber. The basaltic-basaltic andesite parent magma to the UUMZ produced orthopyroxenites and gabbronorites at the base of the UUMZ. ~800 m above the base, the rocks contain cumulus magnetite (5-10 modal%), and magnetite layers occur throughout the remaining stratigraphy. Fa-olivine joins the cumulus mineral assemblage ~1300 m above the base, and cumulus apatite joins ~1800 m above the base. Mineral compositions evolve systematically from the base to the roof, making the UUMZ the best place to investigate extreme magmatic fractionation.\nWe report Fe isotope data (δ56Fe) throughout the UUMZ in the eastern Bushveld in order to investigate differentiation processes and geochemical evolution during crystallization. Preliminary measurements of magnetite (δ56Femt = 0.16 to 0.47‰) show two important features: (1) In the lower part of the UUMZ (0 – ~1800 m above the base), δ56Femt decreases with increasing stratigraphic height, such that samples prior to cumulus magnetite saturation show high δ56Fe, and samples above magnetite saturation show lower δ56Fe. (2) In the top 600 m of the UUMZ, however, we observe an increase in δ56Femt that is inconsistent with the fractional crystallization trend below, suggesting this section formed by silicate liquid immiscibility, consistent with the previous conclusions for this interval on the basis of apatite REEs. Our ongoing work on the δ56Fe of whole rock and mineral separates throughout the UUMZ stratigraphy will provide an important benchmark for Fe isotope fractionation during magmatic differentiation.",

            "abstract": "Robust inferences of controls on aquatic processes necessitate data that capture temporal variations in multiple solutes that result from drivers acting at different scales. Emerging in situ sensors provide powerful tools to enumerate seasonal to sub-daily variation in water chemistry and flow. We employed a novel suite of such sensors in two coastal plain blackwater streams to collect high resolution data (sub-hourly to sub-daily) on flow, nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), turbidity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and specific conductance. Together these data are documenting baseline behavior (e.g., nutrient loading, metabolism) in a paired watershed study to isolate forest fertilization effects from natural variation. Baseline data clearly point to natural controls ranging from weather patterns to diurnal processes. Strong relationships between daily concentration and flow (C-Q) exist for most parameters and identify natural enrichment (e.g., CDOM) and dilution (e.g., SRP) processes controlling different solutes. Sub-daily, event-driven C-Q relationships are also evident; these relationships can markedly deviate from those at coarser time scales and often exhibit clear hysteresis. The forms of hysteresis loops vary across solutes, storm characteristics, and antecedent conditions, and can be used to characterize spatial (e.g., vadose vs. groundwater) and temporal (e.g., antecedent watershed wetness) drivers of solute source dynamics. These data provide information across a suite of parameters and at temporal scales otherwise not possible, which together can better elucidate stream responses (water chemistry, metabolism, hydrology) to natural and anthropogenic drivers.",

            "abstract": "Observations show that traveling waves with zonal wavenumber k = 3 correlate closely with the development of frontal / flushing dust storms which are important in the Martian dust cycle. Previous modeling work suggests that both the polar hood [Barnes et al., 2014] and the cap edge dust storms [Wang et al., 2013] have the potential to enhance these waves. In this presentation, we investigate the case of cap edge dust further, focusing on the following results.\nWe will show that the relative strength of the traveling waves depends not only on the time, geolocation, height and variable under consideration, but also on the analysis method. For near surface temperature which is observable by spacecraft, the spectral and time averaged wave power can lead to a different answer than the monochromatic wave power. In particular, in the presence of cap edge dust, the modeled zonal wavenumber k = 3 can dominate the traveling wave spectra at times.\nIn the presence of cap edge dust in the model, the enhancement of the k = 3 traveling waves is accompanied by pronounced increase of the diurnal tide. To test the effect of thermal tides on traveling waves, we have performed sensitivity runs where the insolation is replaced by the diurnally averaged value. We find that the amplitude of the k = 3 traveling waves are greatly reduced without thermal tides. Detailed analyses of the relationship between the waves will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Thermokarst lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska are closely coupled with the regional climate through energy, water and carbon budgets. These lakes exhibit striking elongated shapes perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction. This has led to the hypothesis that the expansion of lakes is caused by thermomechanical processes induced by wind-driven water circulation. The predominant bimodal wind regime in the region (easterly and westerly wind) redistributes lake sediment towards the west and east shores to form protective littoral shelves while the north and south shores are preferentially eroded. Previous research on wind-driven circulation in thermokarst lakes was mainly based on in situ studies which can only collect sparse measurements and is time-consuming. Examination of satellite imagery clearly reveals the wide-spread presence of gyres in thermokarst lakes. It allows the study of gyres and other circulation patterns at both lake and regional scales. This study examines the movement (speed, direction) of a 10-km-wide gyre using a Landsat-7 and an ASTER scene taken about 40 minutes apart. These two images are matched using a robust image matching technique based on cross-correlation. Flow speed and direction for the gyre are extracted from the images and are compared with the in situ measurements collected during previous field work. This study provides insight into the evolution of thermokarst lakes and their interaction with the local climate by quantifying gyre circulation rates over entire lakes.",

            "abstract": "Approximately 45 million Americans rely on private wells or small systems for their domestic water supply1. With the exception of a few states (e.g., WA and NJ), private wells or systems serving fewer than 15 connections are not required by the Safe Drinking Water Act to regularly monitor water quality1. This is a public health concern as a lack of monitoring/information can lead to prolonged exposure to levels of contaminants that pose health risks such as arsenic and uranium. Based on data from the United States Geologic Survey’s National Water Information System (NWIS), arsenic and uranium exceeded their respective maximum contaminant levels (MCL), set by the Environmental Protection Agency, in 11% and 4% of the wells tested, respectively. As monitoring is not required, but the presence of contamination is possible, it is important to be able to estimate the likelihood of an unmonitored well to be contaminated with arsenic or uranium. A national model was developed using NWIS data from ~260,000 wells across the United States and PMPE data (Precipitation minus evapotranspiration). CART analysis was used to determine the likelihood of a well to have arsenic based on geochemical and hydrometerological parameters. PMPE was the most important determiner of arsenic mobility, followed by pH and pe. Of the two, pH was primary in driest environments, and dissolved iron (proxy for pe) was primary in wetter environments. Uranium analysis on CART is still pending. It is expected that PMPE will also be the primary determiner of uranium mobility followed by pe for all environments. Using this information, the national model can predict the likelihood of a well to have arsenic or uranium based on location and other geochemical parameters previously measured. To estimate arsenic and uranium in wells that have never been monitored requires use of geospatial statistical tools like kriging to fill in the areas where no information is known. In these areas it is impossible to have certainty of contamination, however it aids decision makers in guiding areas of future testing and monitoring.\n1.

However, the required soil and surficial geology maps in the North are coarse, and projected climate scenarios vary widely. Considering these uncertainties, we propose a new approach to mapping permafrost distribution and change by integrating remote sensing data, field measurements, and a process-based model. Land-cover types from satellite imagery are used to capture the general land conditions and to improve the resolution of existing permafrost maps. For each land-cover type, field observations are used to estimate the probability of different ground conditions. A process-based model is used to quantify the evolution of permafrost for each ground condition under three representative climate scenarios (low, medium and high warming). From the model results, the probability of permafrost occurrence and the most likely permafrost conditions are determined (Fig. 1). We apply this approach at 20 m resolution to a large area in Northwest Territories, Canada. Mapped permafrost conditions are in agreement with field observations and other studies. The data requirements, model robustness and computation time are reasonable, and this approach may serve as a practical means to mapping permafrost and changes at high resolution in other regions.",

            "abstract": "Thermokarst topography forms whenever ice-rich permafrost thaws and the ground subsides due to the volume loss when excess ground ice transitions to water. The Alaska Thermokarst Model (ATM) is a large-scale, state-and-transition model designed to simulate transitions between [non-]thermokarst landscape units, or cohorts. The ATM uses a frame-based methodology to track transitions and proportion of cohorts within a 1-km2 grid cell. In the arctic tundra environment, the ATM tracks thermokarst-related transitions between wetland tundra, graminoid tundra, shrub tundra, and thermokarst lakes. The transition from one cohort to another due to thermokarst processes can take place if thaw reaches ice-rich ground layers either due to pulse disturbance events such as a large precipitation event or fires or due to gradual active layer deepening that eventually results in penetration of the protective layer. The protective layer buffers the ice-rich soils from the land surface and is critical to determine how susceptible an area is to thermokarst degradation. The rate of terrain transition in our model is determined by the ice-content of the soil, the drainage efficiency (or ability of the landscape to store or transport water), and a cumulative probability of thermokarst initiation. Tundra types are allowed to transition from one type to another (ie wetland tundra to a graminoid tundra) under favorable climatic conditions.\nIn this study, we present our conceptualization and initial simulation results from the ATM model for an 1792 km2 area on the Barrow Peninsula, Alaska. The area selected for simulation is located in a polygonal tundra landscape under varying degrees of thermokarst degradation. The goal of this modeling study is to simulate landscape evolution in response to thermokarst disturbance as a result of climate change. The ATM will eventually be incorporated into the Integrated Ecosystem Model (IEM) for Alaska and Northwest Canada for use in management decisions that are influenced by thermokarst dynamics.",

We show here that this reaction may depend on conditions in the IMF and in the magnetosphere/ionosphere system. The typical response of the low-latitude northward magnetic field is a simultaneous global increase, generally call a SI (sudden impulse) or SSC (storm sudden commencement) if a geomagnetic storm follows. We have found several atypical cases, however, for which the largest positive disturbances are observed on the night side and little or no field increase is registered near local noon. For some of these cases the solar wind pressure change is simultaneous with a northward turning of the IMF from near zero Bz . Another case is shown where the pressure change follows a period of increasing negative IMF Bz. We propose that the magnetic response for the atypical cases can be accounted for by a transition current system where the ionospheric closure of the current system depends upon the auroral conductivity established by previous activity.",

            "abstract": "The Reservoir Sedimentation Database (ResSed), a catalogue of reservoirs and depositional data that has recently become publically available, allows for rapid calculation of sedimentation rates and rates of capacity loss over short (annual to decadal) timescales. This study is a statistical investigation of factors controlling watershed average erosion rates (E) in eastern United States watersheds. We develop an ArcGIS-based model that delineates watersheds upstream of ResSed dams and calculate drainage areas to determine E for 191 eastern US watersheds. Geomorphic, geologic, regional, climatic, and land use variables are quantified within study watersheds using GIS. Erosion rates exhibit a large amount of scatter, ranging from 0.001 to 1.25 mm/yr. A weak inverse power law relationship between drainage area (A) and E (R2 = 0.09) is evident, similar to other studies (e.g. Milliman and Syvitski, 1992; Koppes and Montgomery, 2009). Linear regressions reveal no relationship between mean watershed slope (S) and E, possibly due to the relatively low relief of the region (mean S for all watersheds is 6°). Analysis of Variance shows that watersheds in formerly glaciated regions exhibit a statistically significant lower mean E (0.06 mm/year) than watersheds in unglaciated regions (0.12 mm/year), but that watersheds with different dam purposes show no significant differences in mean E. Linear regressions reveal no relationships between E and land use parameters like percent agricultural land and percent impervious surfaces (I), but classification and regression trees indicate that watersheds in highly developed regions (I > 34%) exhibit mean E (0.36 mm/year) that is four times higher than watersheds in less developed (I < 34%) regions (0.09 mm/year). Further, interactions between land use variables emerge in formerly glaciated regions, where increased agricultural land results in higher rates of annual capacity loss in reservoirs (R2 = 0.56). Plots of E versus timescale of measurement (e.g., Sadler and Jerolmack, 2014) show that nearly the full range of observed E, including the highest values, are seen over short survey intervals (< 20 years), suggesting that whether or not large sedimentation events (such as floods) occur between two surveys may explain the high degree of variability in measured rates.",

            "abstract": "The diurnal cycle is a fundamental mode of tropical rainfall variability, and its accurate portrayal remains a challenging issue for numerical weather and climate prediction. The purpose of this study is to better understand the diurnal cycle of warm season (June-September) rainfall over West Africa and its underlying physical processes. We use rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and atmospheric dynamics fields from reanalyses to explore the rainfall diurnal cycle in the climatology (1998-2013) and a case study of 2006. In addition, a simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at a convection-permitting resolution of 3 km resolution is analyzed to evaluate the model’s ability to capture the rainfall diurnal cycle in the warm season of 2006.\nThe rainfall in the warm season of 2006 shows a mixture of afternoon and nocturnal peaks over West Africa, which is similar to the climatology. Further examination of the 2006 case is focused on three domains: (1) the AF domain (3°W-0°W, 9°N-11.5°N) with late afternoon peaks (2) the SN domain (2°E-5°E, 9°N-11.5°N) with nocturnal peaks, and (3) the NN domain (2°E-5°E, 13.5°N-16.5°N) with nocturnal peaks. For each domain, the rainfall diurnal cycle is more related to the diurnal cycle of rainfall frequency than of the intensity, and it is largely shaped by the diurnal cycle of the frequency of extreme rainfall events. The afternoon rainfall peaks over the AF domain are associated with unstable atmospheric profiles below 850 hPa. The nocturnal rainfall peaks over the NN and SN domains are associated with westward-propagating rainfall systems initiated on the previous afternoon around the complex topography to the east (about 5-15°E).\nThe rainfall produced by the convection-permitting simulation shows similar westward-propagating features. The model realistically captures the nocturnal rainfall peaks over the SN domain, because it reproduces the westward-propagating rainfall systems originated from the Jos Plateau located just east of the domain. However, the model fails to simulate the rainfall peaks over the northern part of the NN domain due to a dry bias, and over the AF domain due to an overestimation of nocturnal peaks.",

As an altimeter, the quantity of light removed from a laser beam by scattering or absorption during the roundtrip to the surface may be calculated knowing the energy returned, the surface geometric albedo and the instrument parameters for each laser shot. These opacity measurements indicate the combined effects of dust and condensates, particularly those seen during during the night. The measure of opacity, to optical depths exceeding unity, correlates well with daytime measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope and with the broadband Thermal Emission Spectrometer. Applying a simple phase function to passive radiometric observations obtained at emission angles varying from 0 to 80 degrees, upper and lower limits are obtained for atmospheric opacity as a function of season and time of day. The implications for the effects of nocturnal water ice clouds on radiative transfer, and for future applications to the detection of icy plumes from moons of the outer solar system will be discussed.",

In this study, we will show characteristics of dust particles derived from Cassini RPWS observations in Saturn’s magnetosphere, especially during Enceladus flybys and E-ring crossings. We will present dust density profiles of the E-ring and Enceladus plume based on the impact rates measured by the RPWS wideband receiver. The electron density measurement based on plasma oscillations induced by dust impacts will also be shown.

            "abstract": "The geodynamo has persisted for at least 3.5 Gyr because of core convection driven by cooling and inner core solidification [1]. Recent measurements of core thermal conductivity [2-4] imply that driving core convection prior to inner core solidification requires heat flows in excess of 15 TW [1-3]. This high heat flow implies rapid cooling and an inner core inescapably less than 1 Gyr old (i.e. Neoproterozoic). The onset of inner core growth is expected to increase the magnetic field intensity by a factor of ~3, and also to alter the field geometry and rate of reversals [5]. No sudden increase in paleointensity has yet been reported during the Neoproterozoic interval, although observations are limited. Some anomalous paleomagnetic directions have been reported, and inferred to represent an episode of true polar wander [6,7].\nIntrusive rocks suggest a more strongly dipolar field at 2-3 Ga compared to 1-2 Ga [8]. Theory suggests that the ancient lower core was stably stratified [1-3]; the inferred change in dipolarity could provide a constraint on the evolution of core stratification with time. The sparse paleointensity data spanning the period from 1 Ga to 3.5 Ga suggest a field intensity constant to within better than a factor of 2 [9]. That in turn implies that the rate of core cooling stayed roughly constant, implying a pervasively molten lower mantle prior to about 3 Ga. When combined with petrological constraints on the rate of upper mantle cooling, these results imply that the surface heat flux changed by only a factor of ~2 over this interval. This change is less than expected for standard convection but consistent with some models of plate tectonics [10], and is also consistent with the apparent ~Gyr mixing timescales of ancient mantle isotopic heterogeneities [11].\n[1] Nimmo, Treatise Geophys.

The toolkit will provide access to tools and products useful for climate-sensitive decision making. To optimize the user experience, the toolkit will also provide access to training materials.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been building a climate training capability for 15 years. The target audience for the training has historically been mainly NOAA staff with some modified training programs for external users and stakeholders. NOAA is now using this climate training capacity for the CRT.\nTo organize the CRT training section, we collaborated with the Association of Climate Change Officers to determine the best strategy and identified four additional complimentary skills needed for successful decision making: climate literacy, environmental literacy, risk assessment and management, and strategic execution and monitoring. Developing the climate literacy skills requires knowledge of climate variability and change, as well as an introduction to the suite of available products and services. For the development of an environmental literacy category, specific topics needed include knowledge of climate impacts on specific environmental systems. Climate risk assessment and management introduces a process for decision making and provides knowledge on communication of climate information and integration of climate information in planning processes. The strategic execution and monitoring category provides information on use of NOAA climate products, services, and partnership opportunities for decision making.\nIn order to use the existing training modules, it was necessary to assess their level of complexity, catalog them, and develop guidance for users on a curriculum to take advantage of the training resources to enhance their learning experience. With the development of this CRT training section, NOAA has made significant progress in sharing resources with the external community.",

            "abstract": "Ice-mass loss in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica has nearly doubled in the past four decades and continues to increase at an accelerating pace. Mass loss from Thwaites Glacier (TG) now rivals that from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) and modeling and observational studies indicate that TG may have begun an irreversible retreat into a deep marine basin. This retreat may initiate the disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet sometime in the next several hundred years. However, models cannot yet provide accurate prognostic estimates of ice-sheet mass loss and the resulting sea-level rise. One large unknown in modeling studies is the role of geologic controls on ice dynamics in the TG basin. In the past decade, a series of ground-based and airborne geophysical campaigns were conducted to collect data needed to address this issue. Here we use a combination of active-source seismic, ice-penetrating radar and aerogravity data collected on TG to investigate whether subglacial geology can extert a fundamental control on TG’s ice dynamics. We focus especially on the distribution of sediment pockets or basins and their association with variability in the ice basal rheology and/or variations in basal-shear stress inferred from modeling studies.\nPreliminary analysis of seismic-reflection profiling data collected along the main trunk of TG ~250 km inland of the current grounding line indicates the presence of a ~10-km wide sedimentary basin. The Bouguer gravity anomaly, derived from aerogravity data collected by NASA’s Operation IceBridge, shows a local gravity-anomaly low that approximately matches the location of this seismically-inferred sedimentary basin. Moreover, this sedimentary basin roughly corresponds to a region of low basal-shear stress inferred from ice-sheet modeling. Thus, in at least this location, available geophysical observations suggest geologic controls on the basal properties of TG.",

            "abstract": "The University of the Fraser Valley has been researching the water chemistry of the Fraser River since 2009 as a member of the Global Rivers Observatory coordinated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Woods Hole Research Center. The Global Rivers Observatory is advancing our understanding of how climate change, deforestation, and other disturbances are impacting river chemistry and land-ocean linkages. This knowledge is vital for tracking the health of Earth’s watersheds and predicting how Earth’s water and chemical cycles will change in the future. The Global Rivers Observatory also promotes the communication of science to the general public. In September 2013, the My River My Home art and science exhibit opened at the Fraser River Discovery Centre, New Westminster, BC. The exhibit is a global exchange of artwork created by children living along the rivers being studied by the Global Rivers Observatory scientists. The exhibit is intended to inspire young students to develop an awareness of the environment and the importance of rivers. Scientists from UFV, WHOI, and WHRC worked together with the Fraser River Discovery Centre on the science communication aspects of the display and to develop hands-on science activities looking at different aspects of river water quality. The exhibition has led to the creation of My River My Home, An Activity Kit for Educators about the sustainability of the Fraser River. The kit is being offered through the Fraser River Discovery Centre and deals with issues such as the importance of water, water quality, and encouraging a global perspective. The resource kit was classroom tested by several teachers, and four UBC teacher candidates worked on incorporating teacher suggestions into the kit. The resource kit will be available on-line at the end of September 2014 and contains inquiry based activities suitable for a variety of educational levels.",

            "abstract": "The USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN;\nwww.usanpn.org\n) is a national-scale science and monitoring initiative focused on phenology – the study of seasonal life-cycle events such as leafing, flowering, reproduction, and migration – as a tool to understand the response of biodiversity to environmental variation and change. USA-NPN provides a hierarchical, national monitoring framework that enables other organizations to leverage the capacity of the Network for their own applications - minimizing investment and duplication of effort - while promoting interoperability. Network participants can leverage: (1) Standardized monitoring protocols that have been broadly vetted, tested and published; (2) A centralized National Phenology Database (NPDb) for maintaining, archiving and replicating data, with standard metadata, terms-of-use, web-services, and documentation of QA/QC, plus tools for discovery, visualization and download of raw data and derived data products; and/or (3) A national in-situ, multi-taxa phenological monitoring system, Nature’s Notebook, which enables participants to observe and record phenology of plants and animals - based on the protocols and information management system (IMS) described above - via either web or mobile applications. The protocols, NPDb and IMS, and Nature’s Notebook represent a hierarchy of opportunities for involvement by a broad range of interested stakeholders, from individuals to agencies. For example, some organizations have adopted (e.g., the National Ecological Observatory Network or NEON) -- or are considering adopting (e.g., the Long-Term Agroecosystems Network or LTAR) -- the USA-NPN standardized protocols, but will develop their own database and IMS with web services to promote sharing of data with the NPDb. Other organizations (e.g., the Inventory and Monitoring Programs of the National Wildlife Refuge System and the National Park Service) have elected to use Nature’s Notebook to support their phenological monitoring programs. We highlight the challenges and benefits of integrating phenology monitoring within existing and emerging national monitoring networks, and showcase opportunities that exist when standardized protocols are adopted and implemented to promote data interoperability and sharing.",

            "abstract": "NOAA & NASA are acquiring the next-generation civilian operational weather satellite: Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). Contributing the afternoon orbit & ground system (GS) to replace current NOAA POES Satellites, its sensors will collect meteorological, oceanographic, climatological & solar-geophysical data. The JPSS Common Ground System (CGS), consisting of C3 and IDP segments, is developed by Raytheon. It now flies the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite, transferring data between ground facilities, processing them into Environmental Data Records for NOAA & DoD weather centers, and expanding to support JPSS-1 in 2017.\nCGS now does data processing (DP) for S-NPP, creating many TBs/day across >2 dozen environmental data products (EDPs). This doubles after JPSS-1 launch. But CGS goes well beyond this by providing data routing support to other global missions.\nThose other missions are: GCOM-W1, Coriolis/Windsat, EOS, NSF’s McMurdo Station, Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), and POES & MetOp satellites. Each system orbits 14 times/day, downlinking data 1-2 times/orbit at up to 100s of MBs/sec, to support the creation of 10s of TBs of data/day across 100s of EDPs.\nCGS’s flexible, multimission capabilities offer major chances for cost reduction & improved information integration across the missions. Raytheon has a unique ability to provide complex, highly-secure, multi-mission GSs. A flexible, expandable and virtualized modern GS architecture is vital -- CGS offers the solution.\nCGS supports 5 global ground stations receiving S-NPP & JPSS-1 mission data. These, linked with high-bandwidth commercial fiber, quickly transport data to the IDP for EDP creation & delivery. CGS data latency will be < 80 minutes. CGS leverages the fiber network to provide added support to many other missions.\nThe JPSS CGS is a mature, tested solution for support to operational weather forecasting for civil, military and international partners and climate research. It features a flexible design handling order-of-magnitude increases in data over legacy systems and meets demanding science accuracy needs. The Raytheon-built JPSS CGS gives the full GS capability, from design & development through operations & sustainment, laying the foundation for future evolution to support more missions.",

            "abstract": "Space weather is a major concern for modern day society because of its adverse impacts on technological infrastructure such as power grids, oil pipelines, and global navigation systems. Particularly, earth directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the main drivers of the most extreme geomagnetic storms in the near-Earth space environment. On 23 July 2012, NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) spacecraft observed in situ an extremely fast CME that traveled 0.96 astronomical units (~1 AU) in about 19 h. In our study, we use the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), a 3-D MHD based code, to perform simulations of this rare CME by considering STEREO-A in situ observations to represent the upstream L1 solar wind boundary conditions. The goal of the study is to investigate what would have happened if this Rare-type CME was Earth-bound. Global SWMF-generated ground geomagnetic field perturbations are used to compute the simulated induced geoelectric field at specific ground-based active magnetometer sites. Simulation results show that the July 23 CME would have produced ground effects comparable to previously observed extreme geomagnetic storms such as the Halloween 2003 storm. In addition, we discuss how this study compares to other independent studies on this same event.",

            "abstract": "Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) work by providing bacteria in anaerobic sediments with an electron acceptor (anode) that stimulates metabolism of organic matter. The buried anode is connected via control circuitry to a cathode exposed to oxygen in the overlying water. During metabolism, bacteria release hydrogen ions into the sediment and transfer electrons extra-cellularly to the anode, which eventually reduce dissolved oxygen at the cathode, forming water. The open circuit voltage is approximately 0.8 v. The voltage between electrodes is operationally kept at 0.4 v with a potentiastat. The current is chiefly limited by the rate of microbial metabolism at the anode. The Office of Naval Research has encouraged development of microbial fuel cells in the marine environment at a number of academic and naval institutions.\nEarlier work in shallow sediments of San Diego Bay showed that the most important environmental parameters that control fuel cell power output in San Diego Bay were total organic carbon in the sediment and seasonal water temperature. Current MFC work at SPAWAR includes extension of microbial fuel cell tests to the deep sea environment (>1000 m) and, in parallel, testing microbial fuel cells in the laboratory under deep sea conditions. One question we are asking is whether MFC power output from deep water sediments repressurized and chilled in the laboratory comparable to those measured in situ. If yes, mapping the power potential of deep sea sediments may be made much easier, requiring sediment grabs and lab tests rather than deployment and retrieval of fuel cells. Another question we are asking is whether in situ temperature and total organic carbon in the deep sea sediment can predict MFC power. If yes, then we can make use of the large collection of publicly available, deep sea oceanographic measurements to make these predictions, foregoing expensive work at sea. These regressions will be compared to those derived from shallow water measurements.",

            "abstract": "The involvement of prokaryotes in the redox reactions of arsenic occurring between this element’s +5 [arsenate; As(V)] and + 3 [arsenite; As(III)] oxidation states has been well established. Most research has focused upon circum-neutral pH environments, such as freshwater lake and aquifer sediments, and extreme environments like hot springs and hypersaline soda lakes have also been well investigated. In contrast, little work has been conducted on acidic environments. The azure-hued, clear waters of the Herman Pit are acidic (pH 2-4), and overlie oxidized sediments that have a distinctive red/orange coloration indicative of the presence of ferrihydrites and other Fe(III) minerals. There is extensive ebullitive release of geothermal gases from the lake bottom in the form of numerous continuous-flow seeps which are composed primarily of mixtures of CO2, CH4, and H2S. We collected near-shore surface sediments with an Eckman grab, and stored the “soupy” material in filled mason jars kept at 4˚C. Initial experiments were conducted using 3:1 mixtures of lake water: sediment so as to generate dilute slurries which were amended with mM levels of electron acceptors (arsenate, nitrate, oxygen), electron donors (arsenite, acetate, lactate, hydrogen), and incubated under N2, air, or H2. Owing to the large adsorptive capacity of the Fe(III)-rich slurries, we were unable to detect As(V) or As(III) in the aqueous phase of either live or autoclaved controls, although the former consumed lactate, acetate, nitrate, or hydrogen, while the latter did not. This prompted us to conduct a series of further diluted slurry experiments using the live materials from the first as a 10 % addition to lakewater. In these experiments we observed reduction of As(V) to As(III) in anoxic slurries and that rates were enhanced by addition of electron donors (H2, acetate, or lactate). We also observed oxidation of As(III) to As(V) in oxic slurries and in anoxic slurries amended with nitrate. These results indicate the presence of a viable microbial As(V)/As(III) redox cycle in the sediments of this extreme environment. Further investigations using culture-independent protocols to identify participant prokaryotes and their functional arsenic genes (e.g., aioA, arrA, arxA) are underway at this time.",

            "abstract": "The regional Pn and Sn phases, which are typically described as headwaves that propagate in the uppermost mantle, are sensitive to heterogeneities in the mantle lid and complement other seismic studies with poorer vertical resolution at this depth. We have experimented with a variety of approaches to image the velocity structure and anisotropy in the western U.S., starting with separate Pn and Sn time-term tomographies, but also localized cross-correlation and stacking approaches that benefit from the regular USArray station arrangement. Later we combined the data sets for joint Pn-Sn inversions and the resulting Vp/Vs maps provide further insight into the nature of the seismic anomalies. Now that USArray has reached the east coast, we are updating our models to include the cumulative station footprint. The sparser source distribution in the eastern U.S., and the resulting longer ray paths, provide new challenges and justify the inclusion of additional parameters that account for the velocity gradient in the mantle lid. Our results show generally higher Pn velocities in the eastern U.S., but we observe patches of lower velocities around the New Madrid seismic zone and below the eastern Appalachians. We find that the Pn fast axes generally do not agree with SKS splitting orientations, suggesting significant vertical changes in anisotropy in the upper mantle. For example, the circular pattern of the fast polarization direction of SKS in the western U.S. is much less pronounced in the Pn results, and in the eastern U.S. the dominant Pn fast direction is approximately north-south, whereas the SKS fast polarizations are oriented roughly parallel to the absolute plate motion direction. Since Pn and Sn travel through the crust, they can provide additional information on crustal thickness. In several regions our results and estimates from receiver function studies are inconsistent. For example, beneath the Colorado Plateau our crustal thickness estimates are about 35-40 km, ~10 km smaller than several receiver function studies, even though the crust appears generally undeformed and seismic tomographies show mostly laterally-uniform crustal velocities throughout the Plateau. We are attempting to resolve some of these discrepancies as a first step toward combining different data sets for a joint analysis.",

Because most prominent ULFEM anomalies have thus far only been observed on individual stations, some authors have argued that some of these anomalies have an instrumental cause, rather than being earthquake precursors.\nTwo independent ULFEM networks are presently operating in the greater San Francisco Bay Area; one managed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Stanford University and the other by QuakeFinder (QF).The case that these anomalies are not instrumental would be strengthened by a demonstration that identical anomalies are seen on the two networks, despite their different components (magnetometers, digitizers and telemetry). A detailed comparison of the two systems will allow data from each of the two networks to be used to confirm anomalies and to evaluate potential precursor signals.\nTo provide this comparison, the USGS-Stanford and QF acquired data on two independent ULFEM systems at the USGS-Stanford ULFEM station located at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, CA, from March 31–May 13, 2014. The two systems were set up~50m from each other and away from potential sources of noise. Both systems recorded the magnetic field with induction coils oriented along the three cardinal directions aligned with magnetic north.\nThe results of this experiment reveal that the two systems have very similar response functions and comparable noise and drift characteristics. Both complex “noise” (a, b) and single discrete pulses (c, d) were recorded with essentially identical characteristics by the two systems. We also found, in a few instances, where the signals were observed on one system but were absent on the other, clearly indicating either internal system noise or reflecting extremely local site phenomena affecting a single system.\nFuture efforts will involve analyses of pulses, spectral characteristics, correlation coefficients and noise.",

            "abstract": "The Iranian and Tibetan plateaus are both part of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt and both formed as a result of the continental collision (between Arabian plate, Indian plate and Eurasia plates). The two plateaus illustrate many of the same processes but at different stages of development. The Iranian plateau is a much less mature continental plateau than the Tibetan plateau with about half the elevation and a much thinner crust. In order to better understand the nature of the lithosphere mantle and origin of the measure seismic velocity anomalies we have made detailed measurements of the uppermost mantle attenuation using the high frequency regional phase Sn.\nIn order to measure Sn attenuation. We have collected a large data set consisting of 18 years (1995-2012) of waveforms recorded by 305 permanent and temporary stations in Iran and 3 years (2007-2009) of waveforms recorded by 136 permanent and temporary stations in Tibet separately. We used a bandpass filter (0.1-0.5Hz) to identify efficient longer period Sn phases. In order to determine Sn Q we applied a Two Station Method (TSM) and Reverse Two Station Method (RTM) to eliminate the source effects. We have used the LSQR algorithm to tomographically map Sn attenuation tomography across the Iranian plateau.\nOur results show moderately low Q values beneath the Iranian plateau (~250) and high Q values beneath the south Caspian sea (~400) and Arabian shield (~400). The pattern we observe is roughly consistent with previous studies. We also observe high Q values beneath the Zagros mountains (~450) that is consistent with the Arabian plate underthrusting beneath the Eurasia plate. In Tibet we find high Q values beneath the Qaidam basin (~500) and low Q values beneath much of the Kunlun fault (~200). We also observe high Q values beneath the Bangong-Nujiang suture (~400) which can be explained that the Indian plate is underthrusting beneath the Eurasia plate. Comparing the Sn Q values beneath the Iranian and Tibetan plateaus, we find they are about the same.",

            "abstract": "Observational and model evidence has been mounting that mesoscale eddies play an important role in air-sea interaction in the vicinity of Western Boundary Currents. What has been less clear is the interplay between oceanic and atmospheric meridional eddy heat transport (MEHT). It is first shown using a high-resolution fully-coupled climate simulation of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) that variability in the North Pacific, particularly in the Kuroshio Extension region, matches observations with similar mechanisms; the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) leads Kuroshio Extension variability with a ~3-4 year lag. It is then shown that there is a compensation of ~0.1 PW between wintertime atmospheric and oceanic MEHT on decadal time scales in the North Pacific. This compensation has characteristics of Bjerknes compensation and is tied to the mesoscale eddy activity in Kuroshio Extension region. During weakly meandering (\"stable\") states there is the persistence of equatorward oceanic MEHT south of the jet and enhanced wintertime surface heat fluxes (SHFs). The atmospheric vertically-integrated meridional eddy heat flux is 22% larger compared to the mean with a maximum increase in MEHT of 0.11+/-0.03 PW. When the Kuroshio Extension is in a strongly meandering (\"unstable\") state oceanic MEHT is enhanced by a maximum of 0.07+/-0.02 PW with a subsequent reduction in wintertime ocean-to-atmosphere SHFs and atmospheric MEHT.",

            "abstract": "South East Asia is one of the fastest developing regions on Earth and has experienced a recent large increase in atmospheric pollution. Glaciers of the nearby Himalayan mountains represent a unique archive that provides the potential to be used to determine the strength and timing of the onset of anthropogenic atmospheric pollution in the region.\nWithin the Third Pole Project several ice cores from the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalaya are analyzed for their trace element concentrations. Here we present results of a new trace element record from the Dasuopu ice core spanning 1790 - 1993 AD. The Dasuopu ice core was drilled in 1997 at 7200 m altitude in the Himalaya and provides the highest elevation ice core record ever obtained. Due to the high altitude this site has the potential to archive not only contamination records of regional significance, but possibly also long distant pollution from, for example, Europe and climatic signals influenced by the North Atlantic. This area is heavily influenced by the monsoon regime providing seasonally and highly variable snow accumulation rates.\nThe upper 50 m of the core covering the time interval from 1950 to 1997 consist of Firn and is sampled non-continuously in a resolution of approximately one sample/year. The time interval between 1790 and 1950 is presented by a continuous record in subannual resolution. Crustal enrichment factors are used to discriminate between the terrigenous and the anthropogenic contributions. In this study we focus two research topics: (1) determine the onset of the earliest anthropogenic contamination from trace elements at this elevation (7200 m) Himalayan site and (2) determine intra-annual variations of atmospheric trace elements, with a focus on discriminating between pre-monsoon season (when the aerosol input is governed by the high dust input in spring) and the monsoon and dry season.\nWe find trace element concentrations to be very low and very variable throughout the year with concentration changes of up to 2-3 orders of magnitude (e.g. Pb concentrations range from 0.1 ppt to 1000 ppt). Average concentration levels are comparable to those recorded at some polar sites. We find an increase in elements of crustal origin in the second half of the 20th century.",

            "abstract": "Ocean bottom seismometer deployments along the Gofar, Quebrada and Discovery transform faults on the East Pacific Rise (EPR) have revealed strong along-strike variation in M6 earthquake rupture extents and earthquake swarm activity. An active-source refraction survey along the ~ 100-km-long western segment of Gofar found a ~ 10-km-long zone of ~ 10-20% P wave velocity reduction, which extends from the surface to the Moho and acted as a “barrier” to previous cycles of M6 ruptures [McGuire et al., 2012; Roland et al., 2012]. The low velocity zone is interpreted to result primarily from enhanced fault zone porosity. That this region appears to behave as a rupture barrier is interesting from a fault frictional point of view because it nucleates intense microseismicity and hence has velocity-weakening (unstable slip) characteristics. In this study, we use a 3D strike-slip fault model with rate-state friction to investigate how the presence of a high-porosity, strong dilatancy zone embedded in a velocity-weakening transform fault could lead to a persistent earthquake rupture barrier. Rate-state frictional parameters are based on experimental results on gabbro gouge under hydrothermal conditions, and constrained by the tomoDD relocation of seismicity on Gofar [Froment et al., 2014]. Our modeling results reproduce the ~ 5 year recurrence interval of M6 earthquakes on two ~ 20-km-long fault segments separated by a ~ 10 km zone with effective dilatancy strengthening. A stronger dilatancy effect leads to a lower seismic coupling coefficient in the barrier zone. The release of energy in the barrier zone is manifested in various forms of aseismic deformation, including postseismic slip and interseismic slow slip events. The modeled slow slip migration speed and equivalent stress drop are comparable to those estimated from earthquake swarms on transform faults [Roland and McGuire, 2009], and suggests that such swarm activity is primarily driven by aseismic transient slip events.",

            "abstract": "The utility and reliability of standard meteorological drought indices based on measurements of precipitation is limited by the spatial distribution and quality of currently available rainfall data. Furthermore, precipitation-based indices only reflect one component of the surface hydrologic cycle, and cannot readily capture non-precipitation based moisture inputs to the land-surface system (e.g., irrigation, shallow groundwater tables) that may temper drought impacts or variable rates of water consumption across a landscape. As global drought monitoring exercises, such as the Global Drought Information System, continue to expand, a need for tools that complement precipitation-based indicators will also grow. Here we describe a global implementation of the remotely sensed Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) based on anomalies in actual-to-reference evapotranspiration (ET) ratio. For ESI implementations to date, actual ET has been derived via energy balance using the morning land-surface temperature (LST) rise observed with geostationary satellites. In comparison with vegetation indices, LST is a fast-response variable, with the potential for providing early warning of crop stress reflected in increasing canopy temperatures. Our initial work has mainly focused on regional implementations of ESI (e.g., North America, Brazil, Africa) and a global ESI product has not been yet been evaluated. As the global constellation of geostationary sensors continue to mature, some limitations still exist which hamper an implementation of ESI using only geostationary LST. Therefore, a new regression-based methodology which uses twice-daily observations of LST from polar orbiting sensors (such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer - MODIS and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite - VIIRS) has been developed to estimate mid-morning LST needed for ESI from a single sensor. This new global ESI dataset will be evaluated over the 2000-2014 time period against currently used global drought indicators, with a special focus on evolution of ESI during significant droughts in the period of record.",

NIM is designed to utilize the state-of-art computing architecture such as Graphic Processing Units (GPU) processors to run globally at kilometer scale resolution to explicitly resolve convective storms and complex terrains. The novel features of NIM numerical design include:\n 1.1. A local coordinate system upon which finite-volume integrations are undertaken. The use of a local Cartesian coordinate greatly simplifies the mathematic formulation of the finite-volume operators and leads to the finite-volume integration along straight lines on the plane, rather than along curved lines on the spherical surface.\n1.2. A general indirect addressing scheme developed for modeling on irregular grid. It arranges the icosahedral grid with a one-dimensional vector loop structure, table specified memory order, and an indirect addressing scheme that yields very compact code despite the complexities of this grid.\n1.3. Use of three-dimensional finite-volume integration over control volumes constructed on the height coordinates. Three-dimensional finite-volume integration accurately represents the Newton Third Law over terrain and improves pressure gradient force over complex terrain.\n1.4.

As one of the potential candidates for NWS next generation models, NIM dynamical core has been successfully verified with various benchmark test cases including those proposed by DCMIP. Physical parameterizations such as those used by GFS have been incorporated into NIM dynamic core and successfully tested with multi-months aqua-planet simulations as well as real data simulations.

            "abstract": "In the framework of the Corinth Rift Laboratory, the seismic activity in the western part of the rift is monitored since 2000 by a network of 15 three-component stations (CRLNET). It is characterized by several instrumental and historical large earthquakes with magnitude larger than 5.5, and numerous active swarms. More than 12 years of seismicity (about 100,000 events) that covers seven orders of magnitude of seismic moment Mo (1010 – 1017 Nm) is available. The detailed analysis of the whole seismicity brings insights into the geometry of faults at depth, the nature and the structure of the active zone at 6-8 km depth previously interpreted as a possible detachment, and more generally into the rifting process and mechanical processes at various space-time scales. For this purpose, we identified multiplets and precisely relocated the seismicity using double difference techniques. The seismicity exhibits a complex structure, strongly varying along the rift axis. We will present some specific structures of the seismicity and swarms. The spatio-temporal evolution of earthquake sequences, which repeatedly occur in specific sub-areas of the fault segments, and the relationship with the distribution of the elastic/anelastic structure, the VP/VS ratio and physical properties of the micro-earthquakes (such as seismic moment, static stress-drop, corner frequency and source size) provide important insights on the presence and the role of fluids during the generation of fractures. The variability of the stress release would suggest, in fact, the presence of heterogeneities in the friction distribution and fluid pressure, and normal stress and elastic properties variability in the fault zone. Finally, according with seismic and geodetic observations, we proposed a new mechanical model for the rifting process in this region, implying a non-elastic, mostly aseismic uniform NS opening below the rift axis, coupled with the downwards growth of a yet unmature detachment.",

Chemical reactions between wellbore cements, the shale formation, formation fluids, and fracturing fluids could affect the ability for cement to form an adequate seal. This study focuses on experimental investigations to evaluate how cement, rock, brines, and fracturing fluids react under conditions similar to the perforated zone associated with the Marcellus shale (Greene County, Pennsylvania). Two pressure/temperature regimes were investigated- moderate (25 MPa, 50oC) and high (27.5 MPa, 90oC). Shale collected from the Lower Marcellus section was encased in Class A cement, cured for 24 hours, and then exposed to simulated conditions in experimental autoclave reactors. The simulated formation fluid was a synthetic brine, modeled after a flowback fluid contained 187,000 mg/l total dissolved solids and had a pH of 7.6. The effect of pH was probed to evaluate the potential for cement reactivity under different pH conditions, and the potential for contaminant or geochemical tracer release from the shale (e.g. arsenic and rare earth elements). In addition to dissolution reactions, sorption and precipitation reactions between solutes and the cement are being evaluated, as the cement could bond with solute-phase species during continued hydration. The cements are expected to show different reactivity under the two temperature conditions because the primary cement hydration product, calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) is heavily influenced by temperature. Results from these experimental studies will be used both to inform the potential changes in cement chemistry that may occur along a wellbore in the hydraulically-fractured portion of a reservoir, and the types of geochemical tracers that may be useful in tracking these reactions.",

We describe and present preliminary findings from Growing Community Roots for the Geosciences in Miami, FL, a 2-year, NSF funded project run by the Department of Earth and Environment at FIU which aims to inform students enrolled in the local middle and high schools to educational and career opportunities in the geosciences.\nThe project takes a multi-faceted approach which includes direct outreach through social media platforms and school visits, a 1-week workshop for middle school teachers and a 2-week summer camp aimed at high school students. An outreach team of undergraduate geoscience majors were recruited to build and maintain informational resources on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google Plus and to accompany FIU faculty on visits to local middle schools and high schools. Both the teacher workshop and the summer camp included lectures on geoscience careers, fundamental concepts of solid earth and atmospheric science, hands on exercises with earth materials, fossils and microscopy, exercises with Google Earth imagery and GIS, and field trips to local geological sites and government facilities. Participants were surveyed at the beginning of the programs on their general educational background in math and science and their general attitudes of and interest in geoscience careers. Post program surveys showed significant increases in the comfort of teaching topics in geoscience among teachers and an increased interest in majoring in geoscience among students. On the final day of the programs, participants were queried on better ways of interesting high school to major in geoscience.

Deformation is predominantly concentrated within the caldera, but a small amplitude spatially-coherent deformation extends northward to Mono Lake, suggesting the influence of multiple deformation sources. Small deviations from the nearly steady inflation are observed during the winter months. The frequency of earthquake swarms has also increased during the renewed inflation, with earthquakes occurring at about 8 km depth. While the majority of the increased seismicity occurring during the inflation can be explained by a single earthquake triggering model (e.g., Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence), swarms occurring during the seasonal deviations observed by GPS are not well fit by this model. To study the renewed inflation, we analyze long term trends and transient deformation in GPS and InSAR data in the context of seismic and meteorological observations. InSAR data are from X-band (3.11 cm wavelength) radar satellites Terrasar-X and Tandem-X. We process initial interferograms using GAMMA, and process persistent scatterers (PS) using DORIS and StaMPS with both the multi-temporal and small baseline pair methods. PS coverage is very good and StaMPS identifies over 5 million PS, which we downsample to a spacing of 200 m for efficiency. The extension rate of the dome-crossing baseline (CA99 to KRAC) is ~1 cm/yr, similar to rates observed in previous inflation episodes (1990-95 and 2002-03), which is about a tenth of the peak rate observed during the late 1997 unrest. The current deformation can be explained by the inflation of a nearly spherical magma reservoir at ~6 km deep beneath the resurgent dome, with a volume change of ~4.5(±1)x106 m3/yr. This source appears to be in a region that was used to model previous inflation episodes. A deeper source at 12 km, used to help model the 1997 inflation may contribute to the current deformation.",

            "abstract": "In the spring and early summer of 2011, the Assiniboine River Basin in Canada experienced an extreme flood that was unprecedented in terms of duration and volume of water. The flood had significant socioeconomic impacts and caused over one billion dollars in damage. Contrary to what one might expect for such an extreme flood, individual precipitation events before and during the 2011 flood were not extreme; instead, it was the cumulative impact and timing of precipitation events going back to the summer of 2010 that played a key role in the 2011 flood. The summer and fall of 2010 were exceptionally wet, resulting in soil moisture levels being much above normal at the time of freeze up. This was followed by above-average precipitation during the winter of 2010–2011, and record-breaking basin-averaged snow-water equivalent values in March and April 2011. Abnormally cold temperatures in March delayed the spring melt by about two weeks, with the result that the above-average seasonal melt freshet occurred close to the onset of abnormally heavy rains in May and June. The large-scale atmospheric flow during May and June 2011 favoured increased cyclone activity over the central and northern U.S., which produced an anomalously large number of heavy rainfall events over the basin. All of these factors combined to generate extreme surface runoff and flooding. We used JRA-55 reanalysis data to quantify the relative importance of snowmelt, soil moisture and spring precipitation in contributing to the unprecedented flood and to demonstrate how the 2011 flood was unique compared to previous floods in the basin. Data and research from this study can be used to validate and improve flood forecasting techniques over this important basin; our findings also raise important questions regarding the impact of climate change on basins that experience pluvial and nival flooding.",

            "abstract": "In addition to aerosol optical depth (AOD), aerosol type is required globally for climate-forcing calculations, constraining aerosol transport models, and other applications. However, validating satellite aerosol type retrievals is much more challenging than testing AOD results, because aerosol type is a more complex quantity, and ground-truth data are far less numerous and generally not as robust. We employ a combination of assessment relative to climatological expectation, statistical comparisons with surface-based observations, and near-coincident field campaign measurements, to evaluate MISR aerosol-type retrieval results. Although the retrievals are not constrained by a priori expectations, there is general regional coherence in the dominant retrieved aerosol types, indicating consistency in the retrieval process. Comparisons with expectation, on a regional, seasonal basis, demonstrate qualitative consistency with regard to particle size (three-to-five bins), shape (spherical vs. non-spherical), and single-scattering albedo (SSA; two-to-four bins) when mid-visible AOD exceeds about 0.15 or 0.2. Statistical comparisons with surface-based sun and sky-scanning photometer retrievals provide both qualitative and quantitative illustration of retrieval sensitivity, identifying strengths and limitations of the MISR Standard Version 22 aerosol product, and pointing to specific areas where improvements could be made. Field campaign results offer the most detailed and robust aerosol-type constraints. They allow us, with the help of the MISR Research aerosol retrieval algorithm, to test the limits of the MISR data information content, which in specific cases substantially exceeds the general sensitivity. This presentation will briefly review the statistical techniques employed and summarize the key MISR aerosol-type retrieval validation results of this work.",

            "abstract": "The last time atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration approached present day levels was likely during the mid-Pliocene climate optimum 3.3-3.0 Ma. Estimates of sea level from the mid-Pliocene optimum vary widely and contain a significant component of glacial isostasy and dynamic topography, precluding a firm estimate of global ice volume. Here we present new data constraining the southern Greenland ice sheet (GIS) across the mid-Pliocene optimum from IODP Site U1307 located on the Eirik Ridge south of Greenland. Magnetic susceptibility dramatically decreases at ~3.3 Ma, recovering at ~3.05 Ma. Magnetic parameters on silt-size grains (Mrs/Ms) show this decrease likely reflects the loss of silt sourced from the Precambrian terranes of south Greenland, which would suggest the loss of the south GIS. The sand fraction reflects the degree of iceberg rafting with increases at an ~40 ka period. Planktic oxygen isotopes decrease during iceberg rafting events to values lower than the Holocene. An extended interval of low sand occurs from ~3.3 Ma to ~3.2 Ma, which suggests cessation of iceberg rafting. Planktic oxygen isotopes increase during this interval. Assuming a relatively warm climate, this increase could reflect the incursion of high 18-O subtropical waters into the Labrador Sea. The return of iceberg rafted sediments after ~3.2 Ma suggests the regrowth of the GIS with marine-terminating margins. Our new preliminary record points to a GIS collapse during the mid-Pliocene climatic optimum, but that ice-free conditions only lasted for ~100 ka before the return of a volatile ice sheet for the remainder of the mid-Pliocene climatic optimum.",

Taking advantage of the high spatial resolution multiangle observations uniquely available from MISR, we utilized the retrieved cloud albedo, cloud top height, and cloud motion vectors to examine the cloud property responses in ship-polluted and nearby unpolluted clouds. The strength of cloud albedo response to increased aerosol level is primarily dependent on cloud cell structure, dryness of the free troposphere, and boundary layer depth, corroborating a previous study by Chen et al. (2012) where A-Train satellite data were applied. Under open cell cloud structure, the cloud properties are more susceptible to aerosol perturbations as compared to closed cells. Aerosol plumes caused an increase in liquid water amount (+27%), cloud top height (+11%), and cloud albedo (+40%) for open cell clouds, whereas under closed cell clouds, little changes in cloud properties were observed. Further capitalizing on MISR's unique capabilities, the MISR cross-track cloud speed has been used to derive cloud top divergence. Statistically averaging the results from many plume segments to reduce random noise, we have found that in ship-polluted clouds there is stronger cloud top divergence, and in nearby unpolluted clouds, convergence occurs and leads to downdrafts, providing observational evidence for cloud top entrainment feedback. These results suggest that detailed cloud responses, classified by cloud type and environmental conditions, must be accounted for in global climate modeling studies to reduce uncertainties of aerosol indirect forcing.\n",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic landscape modification, such as the emplacement of highways and railroads, has altered the natural hydrologic system by influencing surface-water flow paths, as well as the composition and distribution of biotic communities within the Mojave National Preserve, California, USA. Infiltration experiments were conducted at two alluvial fan sites, one impacted by railroad emplacement and one not impacted, to evaluate changes in hydrology as related to plant water availability and use. Previous studies have shown that plants on alluvial fans are more abundant near undisturbed ephemeral channels compared to channels where upslope catchments have been diverted by transportation corridor construction. During 30 single-ring infiltration experiments, water was applied along a transect in one active channel upslope and another abandoned channel down slope from a railroad built <100 years ago. The abandoned channel is still evident, but has been disconnected from major runoff derived from higher elevations. Excavation at both sites showed weak soil development with fewer plant roots present beneath the abandoned channel. Infiltration test results show that water infiltrates faster in the active channels above the railroad. Observations of weakly developed crusts within the abandoned channels suggest that early microbial succession is responsible for the changes in surface hydraulic properties. We also observed lower plant densities along the abandoned channel compared to the active channel. We infer that plants do not preferentially root toward abandoned stream channels to exploit the enhanced infiltration as extensively as they do above the railroad where flow in ephemeral channels is an additional water source.",

            "abstract": "The Archean North China Craton has undergone significant reactivation since the Mesozoic in its eastern part, the East North China Craton (ENCC). In contrast, the West North China Craton (WNCC), which is largely composed of the Ordos Block, has maintained its stability as a cratonic block.\nOrdos, as expected for a craton, has a much thicker lithosphere (~200 km) than ENCC (~80 km), and traditional receiver functions (RF) suggested average crustal thickness of ~40 km beneath Ordos, albeit 10 km thicker than the ~30km beneath the ENCC. In contrast, VDSS applied to an E-W linear Peking University seismic array across middle Ordos (latitude 37.5°N) found the Moho much deeper at ~60 km (Yu et al., EPSL, 2012). To better understand the lithospheric structure of Ordos, we applied VDSS to two E-W linear Chinese Academy of Sciences arrays across north (39.5°N) and south (36°N) Ordos. We applied wave mode-separation and deconvolution techniques that significantly removed the influence of the source wavelet and improved the resolution in VDSS. We show that beneath the southern array the Moho (from VDSS) is generally flat within Ordos at ~51 km, but rapidly shallows eastward to ~28 km from 110.5°E to 112.5°E, very similar to the Moho shape of the middle profile. The rapid change in Moho depth on the two profiles may be due to the influence of the Shanxi Graben from 36°N to 37.5°N. Beneath the northern array a continuously west-dipping Moho is found from ~26 km at 112°E to ~45km at 107.5°E. Our VDSS result for both the southern and northern arrays is clearly different from the conventional RF results given by Zheng et al. (JGR, 2012), which show an almost flat Moho at ~40 km with a trough at 110.5°E beneath the northern array and a Moho gently dipping westward from ~30 km at 114°E to ~40 km at 108°E beneath the southern array.\nThe Moho found by RF is the interface with the largest S velocity contrast within the lithosphere, whereas the Moho found by VDSS is the boundary causing total reflection of down-going P Wave. While it is not surprising that RF and VDSS identify different interfaces in the crust-mantle transition zone, their large separation is unusual and implies a complex crust-mantle transition zone structure beneath Ordos that might shed light on the evolution of the NCC.",

            "abstract": "The San Francisco Bay Area is impacted by ambient particulate matter (PM) from a variety of sources including motor vehicles, biomass burning, off-road vehicles, industry, and meat cooking. Ambient PM, especially fine PM (diameter less than 2.5µm, PM2.5), is known to negatively impact health. Elemental Carbon (EC) is one of the major constituents of PM2.5. It not only negatively affects health but is also a powerful short-lived climate forcer. The State of California and Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) have made efforts in regulating contribution of EC from diesel trucks and wood burning, respectively. These and other efforts have assisted in significantly reducing the annual average PM2.5 concentrations approximately 30% since 2005 and 70% since 1990. Despite these improvements, to better determine the relative contribution of contemporary vs. fossil carbon, radiocarbon source apportionment of EC was conducted on PM2.5 collected in the Bay Area. Measurements of the abundance of 14C in the EC fractions are used to quantify the relative contributions of fossil carbon (fossil fuel combustion, including motor vehicle exhaust) and contemporary carbon (biomass combustion and meat cooking). This comprehensive study included seven sites in the Bay Area and 12 months of sampling starting November 2011 through October 2012. The samples were composited to represent winter (November-February) and non-winter (March-October). In addition to radiocarbon analysis, Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) analysis using bulk PM2.5 composition and selected trace gases was used to understand the split among gasoline, natural gas, and diesel exhaust. Preliminary apportionment of the seven sites shows roughly equal contributions of fossil fuel and biomass burning/cooking for both winter and non-winter samples. There is evidence that the diesel contribution to EC, in particular, has decreased substantially over the last decade.",

            "abstract": "The role of cumulus congestus (shallow and congestus convection) in tropical cyclone (TC) formation is examined in a high-resolution simulation of Tropical Cyclone Fay (2008). It is found that cumulus congestus plays a dominant role in moistening the lower to middle troposphere and spinning up the near-surface circulation before genesis, while deep convection plays a key role in moistening the upper troposphere and intensifying the cyclonic circulation over a deep layer. The transition from the tropical wave stage to the TC stage is marked by a substantial increase in net condensation and potential vorticity generation by deep convection in the inner wave pouch region.\nThis study suggests that TC formation can be regarded as a two-stage process. The first stage is a gradual process of moisture preconditioning and the low-level spinup, in which cumulus congestus plays a dominant role. The second stage commences with the rapid development of deep convection in the inner pouch region after the air column is moistened sufficiently, whereupon the concentrated convective heating near the pouch center strengthens the transverse circulation and leads to the amplification of the cyclonic circulation over a deep layer. The rapid development of deep convection can be explained by the power-law increase of precipitation rate with column water vapor (CWV) above a critical value. The high CWV near the pouch center thus plays an important role in convective organization. It is also shown that cumulus congestus can effectively drive the low-level convergence and provides a direct and simple pathway for the development of the TC proto-vortex near the surface.",

            "abstract": "Integrating renewable energy sources into electricity grids requires advances in bulk and thermal energy storage technologies, which are currently expensive and have limited capacity. We present an approach that uses the huge fluid and thermal storage capacity of the subsurface to harvest, store, and dispatch energy from subsurface (geothermal) and surface (solar, nuclear, fossil) thermal resources. CO2 captured from fossil-energy systems and N2 separated from air are injected into permeable formations to store pressure, generate artesian flow of brine, and provide additional working fluids. These enable efficient fluid recirculation, heat extraction, and power conversion, while adding operational flexibility. Our approach can also store and dispatch thermal energy, which can be used to levelize concentrating solar power and mitigate variability of wind and solar power. This may allow low-carbon, base-load power to operate at full capacity, with the stored excess energy being available to addresss diurnal and seasonal mismatches between supply and demand. Concentric rings of horizontal injection and production wells are used to create a hydraulic divide to store pressure, CO2, N2, and thermal energy. Such storage can take excess power from the grid and excess thermal energy, and dispatch that energy when it is demanded. The system is pressurized and/or heated when power supply exceeds demand and depressurized when demand exceeds supply. Supercritical CO2 and N2 function as cushion gases to provide enormous pressure-storage capacity. Injecting CO2 and N2 displaces large quantities of brine, reducing the use of fresh water.\nGeologic CO2 storage is a crucial option for reducing CO2 emissions, but valuable uses for CO2 are needed to justify capture costs. The initial \"charging\" of our system requires permanently isolating large volumes of CO2 from the atmosphere and thus creates a market for its disposal. Our approach is designed for locations where a permeable geologic formation is overlain by an impermeable formation that constrains migration of buoyant CO2 and/or N2, and heated brine. Such geologic conditions exist over nearly half of the contiguous United States.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. DOE by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

            "abstract": "The Sierra Nevada is experiencing changes in hydrologic regimes, such as decreases in snowmelt and peak runoff, which affect forest health and the availability of water resources. Currently, the USDA Forest Service Region 5 is undergoing Forest Plan revisions to include climate change impacts into mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, there are few processes in place to conduct quantitative assessments of forest conditions in relation to mountain hydrology, while easily and effectively delivering that information to forest managers. To assist the USDA Forest Service, this study is the final phase of a three-term project to create a Decision Support System (DSS) to allow ease of access to historical and forecasted hydrologic, climatic, and terrestrial conditions for the entire Sierra Nevada. This data is featured within three components of the DSS: the Mapping Viewer, Statistical Analysis Portal, and Geospatial Data Gateway. Utilizing ArcGIS Online, the Sierra DSS Mapping Viewer enables users to visually analyze and locate areas of interest. Once the areas of interest are targeted, the Statistical Analysis Portal provides subbasin level statistics for each variable over time by utilizing a recently developed web-based data analysis and visualization tool called Plotly. This tool allows users to generate graphs and conduct statistical analyses for the Sierra Nevada without the need to download the dataset of interest. For more comprehensive analysis, users are also able to download datasets via the Geospatial Data Gateway. The third phase of this project focused on Python-based data processing, the adaptation of the multiple capabilities of ArcGIS Online and Plotly, and the integration of the three Sierra DSS components within a website designed specifically for the USDA Forest Service.",

            "abstract": "Biomass-burning aerosols contribute to aerosol radiative forcing on the climate system. The magnitude of this effect is partially determined by aerosol size distributions, which are strong functions of source fire characteristics (e.g. fuel type, MCE) and in-plume microphysical processing. The uncertainties in biomass-burning emission number size-distributions in climate model inventories lead to uncertainties in the CCN concentrations and forcing estimates derived from these models.\nThe BORTAS-B measurement campaign was designed to sample boreal biomass-burning outflow over Eastern Canada in the summer of 2011. Using these BORTAS-B data, we implement plume criteria to isolate the characteristic size-distribution of aged biomass-burning emissions (aged ~ 1.5 – 2 days) from boreal wildfires in Northwestern Ontario. The composite median size-distribution yields a single dominant accumulation mode with Dpm = 232 nm, σ = 1.7, which are comparable to literature values of other aged plumes of a similar type. The organic aerosol enhancement ratios (ΔOA/ΔCO) along the path of Flight b622 show values of 0.08-0.18 μg m-3 ppbv-1 with no significant trend with distance from the source. This lack of enhancement ratio increase/decrease with distance suggests no detectable net OA production/evaporation within the aged plume over the sampling period.\nA Lagrangian microphysical model was used to determine an estimate of the freshly emitted size distribution and flux corresponding to the BORTAS-B aged size-distributions. The model was restricted to coagulation and dilution processes only based on the insignificant net OA production/evaporation derived from the ΔOA/ΔCO enhancement ratios. Depending on the, we estimate that the fresh-plume median diameter was in the range of 59-94 nm with modal widths in the range of 1.7-2.8. Thus, the size of the freshly emitted particles is somewhat unconstrained due to the uncertainties in the plume dilution rates.",

At the same time, web browsers have become far more capable and open source libraries have grown to take advantage of these capabilities. Earthdata Search is a web application which combines modern browser features with the latest Earthdata services from NASA to produce a cutting-edge search and access client with features far beyond what was possible only a couple of years ago. Earthdata Search provides data discovery through the Common Metadata Repository (CMR), which provides a high-speed REST API for searching across hundreds of millions of data granules using temporal, spatial, and other constraints. It produces data visualizations by combining CMR data with Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) image tiles. Earthdata Search renders its visualizations using custom plugins built on Leaflet.js, a lightweight mobile-friendly open source web mapping library. The client further features an SVG-based interactive timeline view of search results. For data access, Earthdata Search provides easy temporal and spatial subsetting as well as format conversion by making use of OPeNDAP. While the client hopes to drive adoption of these services and standards, it provides fallback behavior for working with data that has not yet adopted them. This allows the client to remain on the cutting-edge of service offerings while still boasting a catalog containing thousands of data collections. In this session, we will walk through Earthdata Search and explain how it incorporates these new technologies and service offerings.",

These uncertainties, along with studies using climate models and observations of tropospheric ozone and the sensitivity of TOA (top of atmosphere) flux to the vertical distribution of ozone from the Aura-TES instrument, provide motivation to benchmark the model-to-satellite differences in TOA ozone band flux and flux sensitivity. The TOA flux for the 9.6 micron ozone band is a fundamental quantity which is predicted by IPCC chemistry-climate models but has never been tested directly against satellite measurements.

            "abstract": "Evidence for relaxation of impact crater topography has been observed on many icy satellites, including those of Saturn, and the magnitude of relaxation can be related to past heat flow. We have used stereo- and photoclinometry-derived global digital elevation models (DEMs) of the surfaces of eight Saturnian satellites that we have generated from Cassini data to obtain depth and diameter measurements for more than 500 craters. We have previously performed relaxation simulations to determine what heat flow magnitudes and durations are necessary to achieve the current morphologies of certain relaxed and unrelaxed craters on Rhea and Iapetus (White et al., 2013). Combined with age estimates based on crater counting, we found that Iapetus has not experienced heat flows above radiogenic levels since formation of its basins, but that Rhea appears to have undergone a period of global elevated heat flow reaching 20-30 mW m-2that caused the relaxation of its largest impact basins.\nWe have since turned our attention to Dione and Tethys, two satellites that show a more complex history of relaxation across their surfaces than either Rhea or Iapetus, with some areas showing extensive relaxation across a wide range of crater diameters, and other areas showing relatively little relaxation. Such a distribution would indicate a history of strongly differential heat flow across these satellites. New simulations of crater relaxation and associated heat flow on these satellites using crater profiles measured from our DEMs, in conjunction with new crater age estimates for the basins, allow us to map the history of heat flow variation across their surfaces. The results suggest that Tethys and especially Dione have been geologically active in their pasts, and that both may represent geologically less evolved cousins of Enceladus.\nWe also consider these results in the context of the upcoming New Horizons encounter with Pluto and Charon in 2015. These worlds are comparable to the icy satellites of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune with respect to their size, ice-rock ratio and degree of differentiation, but different in that they do not orbit, and therefore are not gravitationally influenced by, a giant planet. These factors must be considered when interpreting the morphologies and thermal histories of impact craters on Pluto and Charon.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic melting of the base of the floating Antarctic ice shelves is now thought to be a more significant cause of mass loss for the Antarctic ice sheet than iceberg calving. In this study, we use a 10 km horizontal resolution circum-Antarctic ocean/sea ice/ice shelf model (based on ROMS) to study the delivery of ocean heat to the base of the ice shelves. The atmospheric forcing comes from the ERA-Interim reanalysis (~80 km resolution) and from simulations using the Polar-optimized WRF model (30 km resolution) where the upper atmosphere was relaxed to the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Total basal ice shelf melt increases by 14% with the higher resolution winds but only 3% with both the higher resolution winds and atmospheric surface temperatures. The higher resolution winds lead to more heat being delivered to the ice shelf cavities from the adjacent ocean and an increase in the efficiency of heat transfer between the water and the ice. The higher resolution winds also lead to changes in the heat delivered from the open ocean to the continental shelves as well as changes in the heat lost to the atmosphere over the shelves and the sign of these changes varies regionally. Addition of the higher resolution temperatures to the winds results in lowering, primarily during summer, the wind driven increase in heat advected into the ice shelf cavities due to colder summer air temperatures near the coast.",

            "abstract": "In Hammerling et al., 2014 (H14) the authors demonstrated a geostatistical method for mapping satellite estimates of column integrated CO2 mixing ratio, denoted XCO2, that incorporates the spatial variability in satellite-measured XCO2 as well as measurement precision. The goal of the study was to determine whether the Active Sensing of CO2 over Nights, Days and Seasons (ASCENDS) mission would be able to detect changes in XCO2 given changes in the underlying fluxes for different levels of instrument precision. Three scenarios were proposed: a flux-neutral shift in fossil fuel emissions from Europe to China (shown in the figure); a permafrost melting event; interannual variability in the Southern Oceans. The conclusions of H14 were modest but favorable for detectability in each case by ASCENDS given enough observations and sufficient precision. These signal detection experiments suggest that ASCENDS observations, together with a chemical transport model and data assimilation methodology, would be sufficient to provide quality estimates of the underlying surface fluxes, so long as the ASCENDS observations are precise enough.\nIn this work, we present results that bridge the gap between the previous signal detection work by [Hammerling et al., 2014] and the ability of transport models to recover flux perturbations from ASCENDS observations utilizing the TM5-4DVAR data assimilation system. In particular, we will explore the space of model and observational uncertainties that will yield useful scientific information in each of the flux perturbation scenarios. This work will give a sense of the ability of ASCENDS to answer key questions about some of the foremost questions in carbon cycle science today.\n",

            "abstract": "Seismic investigations of permafrost are essential in cold-region applications including static corrections for seismic exploration and site characterization for infrastructure development. Surface-wave methods are advantageous because their applicability does not require regular velocity gradients. But distinct challenges also exist: The irregular velocity variations in permafrost, combined with the marked velocity contrasts between frozen and unfrozen ground, often yield complicated dispersion spectra in which higher-order and leaky modes are dominant. Owing to the difficulties in retrieving dispersion curves from such spectra, dispersion-curved-based inversion methods become inapplicable.\nHere we present a case study of using wavefield inversion of surface waves to infer the permafrost structure on the Barrow Peninsula of the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain. In May of 2014, we conducted an active multichannel surface-wave survey along a 4300-m (2.7-mi) NE-SW trending transect that extended from the coastal to the interior areas of the peninsula. We acquired surface-wave supergathers—each covering a distance of 147 meters—from four nearly equidistantly distributed subsections of the transect. The dispersion spectra show dominant higher-order and leaky modes, as well as inversely dispersive trends (i.e., phase velocities increase with increasing frequencies). Preliminary results reveal a “sandwich” velocity structure, in which a pronounced low-velocity layer (with S-wave velocity reductions up to ~45%–60%; tens of meters thick; overlain by 3–4 m of high-velocity strata) is embedded within high-velocity strata, and the low-velocity layer itself contains irregular velocity gradients. Considering the low ground temperatures of –10 °C to –8 °C, this low-velocity feature is likely to be an embedded saline layer that is only partially frozen due to freezing-point depression of dissolved salts. Because saline permafrost is particularly sensitive to thermal disturbances, its extensive presence on the Barrow Peninsula may impact the stability of the permafrost system in a warming climate. This case study exemplifies the complexity of permafrost structures, and the surface-wave-based wavefield inversion is effective for delineating seismic structures of permafrost.",

Recent progress in coupled whole-atmosphere/ionosphere modeling has just enabled forecasting of the coupled system from first principles. In this talk, we present some results of the coupled atmosphere-ionosphere prediction during several recent SSW events. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility for the coupled atmosphere-ionosphere prediction using a prototype IDEA model, i.e., the whole atmosphere model (WAM) coupled with an ionospheric model, in conjunction with the WAM data assimilation system (WDAS). The coupled IDEA model has been recently updated to a new version of the WAM model and data assimilation system.\nThe IDEA model has produced a successful medium-range prediction of the January 2009 SSW during solar minimum and quiet geomagnetic conditions. Recent SSWs in January 2012 and January 2013 occurred during different levels of solar activity and geomagnetic conditions. This study tests the predictive capability of the coupled system for different SSWs and during different solar and geomagnetic conditions.",

            "abstract": "The inactive Sulfur Bank Mercury Mine is located in a volcanic region having geothermal flow and gas inputs into the Herman Pit impoundment. The acidic (pH 2 – 4) waters of the Herman Pit are permeated by hundreds of continuous flow gas seeps that contain CO2, H2S and CH4. We sampled one seep and found it to be composed of 95 % CO2 and 5 % CH4, in agreement with earlier measurements. Only a trace of ethane (10 – 20 ppm) was found and propane was below detection, resulting in a high CH4/C2H6 + C3H8 ratio of > 5,000, while the δ13CH4 and the δ13CO2 were respectively – 24 and – 11 per mil. Collectively, these results suggested a complex origin for the methane, being made up of a thermogenic component resulting from pyrolysis of buried organics, along with an active methanogenic portion. The relatively 12C-enriched value for the CO2 suggested a reworking of the ebullitive methane by methanotrophic bacteria. We found that dissolved methane in the collected water from 2-4 m depth was high (~ 400 µM), which would support methanotrophy in the lake's aerobic biomes. We therefore tested the ability of bottom sediments to consume methane by conducting aerobic incubations of slurried bottom sediments. Methane was removed from the headspace of live slurries, and subsequent additions of methane to the headspace over the course of 2-3 months resulted in faster removal rates suggesting a buildup of the population of methanotrophs. This activity could be transferred to an artificial medium originally devised for the cultivation of acidophilic iron oxidizing bacteria (Silverman and Lundgren, 1959; J. Bacteriol. 77: 642 – 647), suggesting the possibility of future cultivation of acidophilic methanotrophs. A successful extraction of some hopanoid compounds from the sediments was achieved, although the results were too preliminary at the time of this writing to identify any hopanoids specifically linked to methanotrophic bacteria. Further efforts to amplify functional genes for methane oxidizing bacteria (e.g., pMMO) from extracted sediment DNA are underway.",

            "abstract": "We have obtained a 3-D model of seismic attenuation covering all of New Zealand, where regional structure ranges from strong, relatively undeformed crust to thin rift zones with active volcanism. This New Zealand-wide model will be useful for modeling tectonic deformation and coseismic motion at regional distances. Using local earthquakes, Qp (1/attenuation) is derived from path attenuation t* observations. The New Zealand model is primarily based on merged results from existing studies. These are supplemented with data in areas that were not previously analyzed for Qp, then using additional iterations with the merged model to ensure consistency. There is large heterogeneity in Qp both within some regions and along the length of the country. This suggests potential for greater variation in modeled ground motion compared to that estimated with uniform attenuation relations.\n Along the Hikurangi subduction zone, the subducted slab forms a prominent high Qp feature in the North Island and northern South Island. In the forearc, zones of low Qp above the plate interface suggest thick subducted sediment, and high Qp features represent blocks of Cretaceous volcanics in the overlying plate. The Taupo Volcanic Zone, with extension and geothermal activity, is delineated by low Qp in the upper crust. The underlying mantle wedge has very low Qp from 50-85 km depth below the rhyolite section. In contrast, the Fiordland subduction zone, southwestern South Island, lacks a mantle wedge and instead has the young slab steeply bending against a broad high Qp feature in the Pacific mantle which may represent mantle shortening or relic oceanic slab material.\n The South Island crust exhibits relatively high Qp, which is related to the Otago schist, igneous terranes, and mafic lower crust. Between the subduction zones, the Alpine fault and Marlborough fault zones accommodate plate motion. These fault zones show low Qp in their high-strain ductile roots, related to grain-size reduction and metamorphic fluid release. In the brittle crust, low Qp is imaged along fault zones which have the most recent large earthquakes and may be related to distributed microfractures.",

            "abstract": "To identify the existence and cause of recent lake area changes in the Yukon Flats, a region of discontinuous permafrost in north central Alaska, we evaluate lake water isotope compositions with remotely sensed imagery and hydroclimatic parameters. Estimates of the ratio of water lost by evaporation to that gained by inflow (E/I) were derived from an isotope-based water balance model. The isotope labels are also used to identify the dominant sources for lakes such as rainfall and snowfall, groundwater, rivers, or thawed permafrost. These parameters are then used in conjunction with climatic data and remotely sensed imagery to identify the patterns and causes of recent lake area changes and for evaluation with lake sediment oxygen isotope records of late Holocene lake water isotope variations.\nLake water isotope samples from 83 lakes were acquired in July, August or September between 2007 and 2010 by fixed wing aircraft. An additional set of smaller lakes (n = 33) was sampled by helicopter in September 2009. In July 2011 59 lakes were sampled on foot within five distinct 11.2-km2 areas. River water data used here are previously collected during the months of June through October between 2006 and 2008. Isotope compositions indicate that mixtures of precipitation, river water, and groundwater source ~95% of the studied lakes. The remaining minority are more dominantly sourced by snowmelt and/or permafrost thaw. Isotope-based water balance estimates indicate 58% of lakes lose more than half of inflow by evaporation. For 26% of the lakes studied, evaporative losses exceeded supply.\nSurface area trend analysis indicates that most lakes were near their maximum extent in the early 1980s during a relatively cool and wet period. Subsequent reductions can be explained by moisture deficits and greater evaporation. Comparison with late Holocene isotope values and trends indicates recent changes are within the range of late Holocene variability. The records indicate a drier and warmer than present climate prior to 4000 years ago, whereas it was wetter and cooler between 4000 and 2000 years ago. These findings indicate that attempts to project future high-latitude lake change will benefit from considering the effects of decade to multi-decadal scale hydroclimatic variations.",

            "abstract": "As pollutant emissions from motor vehicles have vastly decreased over the last decades, the relative contribution from non-road sources has increased. There is a serious lack of real-world emissions measurements for many non-road sources including locomotives. As such, uncertainties in emissions from these sources is high. Locomotives contribute to human exposure of diesel pollutants near ports, railyards, and rail lines. Reducing uncertainty in current estimates of locomotive emissions is needed for enhancing the accuracy of emission inventories with corresponding improvements in health risk, air pollution, and climate assessments.\nParticulate matter emissions from a large sample (N=88) of in-use freight locomotives were measured in the Alameda Corridor, located near the port of Los Angeles. Emission factors for black carbon (BC), particle number (PN), fine particulate mass (PM2.5), and lung-deposited surface area (LDSA) were computed based on 1 Hz measurements of the rise and fall of particulate emissions and CO2 concentrations as the locomotives passed the sampling location. Mean emission factors ± standard deviations were 0.9 ± 0.5 g kg-1 of fuel consumed for BC, (2.1 ± 1.5)x1016 # kg-1 for PN, 1.6 ± 1.3 g kg-1 for PM2.5, and (2.2 ± 1.7)x1013 µm2 kg-1 for LDSA. Emission factors for individual trains were slightly skewed, with the dirtiest 10% of locomotives responsible for 20%, 24%, 28%, and 27% of total BC, PN, PM2.5, and LDSA emissions, respectively. BC versus LDSA emissions from individual locomotives were found to be anti-correlated, suggesting that the highest emitters of black carbon may in fact result in less particle lung-deposited surface area than lower BC emitters. Using results presented here along with previous measurements, we compare for freight trains versus diesel trucks the amount of BC emissions associated with pulling an intermodal freight container over a given distance.\nEmission factors for locomotives presented here establish a baseline prior to reductions that are anticipated as a result of Federal regulation and state control efforts in 2015.",

The pixel analysis sought to assess the probability of a flood occurring in a particular area by comparing the spatial extent of flood mapping products to the local elevation. The method was developed to determine if the physical relationship between elevation and floods as shown in satellite images is accurately represented in a flood mapping product. The data incorporated in this study are raster digital elevation model (DEM) tiles, a scene from Landsat 5 during a flood period, and a scene from the NASA DEVELOP Flood Disasters Team Flood Product. Pixels representing flooded areas were compared to the elevation height pixels using horizontal transect lines to create pixel value profiles across a 727 km transect of Vietnam and Cambodia. The elevation model comparison validates the Flood Product by depicting water presence in alignment with areas of low elevation. Initial findings indicate that the technique can be used to improve the assessment of flood mapping products in transects less than 10 km. Future research will focus on streamlining the pixel analysis process to yield comprehensive results for larger areas.",

            "abstract": "Marine-terminating outlet glaciers are highly sensitive to changes at the ice-ocean boundary. Changes at the ice-ocean boundary (calving events, submarine melting) can alter the terminus position and thereby the stress balance. If the terminus retreats into deeper water, more of the driving stress must then be balanced by longitudinal stress gradients, which cause the glacier to speed up. This study combines satellite observations and modeling (Elmer/Ice) to investigate the relationship between glacier dynamics and terminus position at Helheim Glacier, southeast Greenland, from 2000-2014. Helheim Glacier retreated about 7 km from 2001-2005 as warm ocean water entered the nearby fjord. From 2005-2006, the glacier re-advanced by 3 km as a floating or near-floating ice tongue formed over the basal overdeepening in front of the glacier terminus. Since then, Helheim’s terminus position has remained relatively stable, with terminus fluctuations of < 2 km. Our model experiments consider both large terminus fluctuations (> 2 km) associated with rapid retreat and small terminus fluctuations (< 500 m) associated with individual calving events. We run the model simulations with both a flowline and three-dimensional model to better constrain our uncertainties. Our results show that Helheim Glacier responds rapidly to changes in terminus position of more than a few hundred meters. Small terminus fluctuations can cause velocity variations that extend up to 30 km inland, which roughly corresponds with the spatial extent of the weak bed (20-40 kPa) underneath Helheim Glacier.",

            "abstract": "Effective collaboration starts with the ability to easily and reliably access data across data center holdings regardless of data format. Incorporating a seamless data format conversion system with multiple organizational views of the data presents a formidable challenge given the many different file formats and variable ways data is organized by different data centers for data discovery and file retrieval. We will present results on how the Multi-View Lightweight Virtual File System (MLVFS) can be used by a broad range of machines to seamlessly access data from multiple data centers in client requested formats and views.\nWe consider two aspects for effective collaboration: first, seeing what data are available, and second, accessing and converting the data on the fly. There are many tools which address these problems. For example, protocols such as OGC-WCS and OPeNDAP allow for standardized methods of data discovery, retrieval, and format conversions. Custom tools developed in-house are used to provide multiple views of available data. These solutions, however, require separate data search, retrieval, or conversion stages, and usually require local storage to hold the converted data. Additionally, these solutions require custom tools to be developed specifically for accessing a particular data center.\nWith MLVFS, we take a radically different approach to this problem. Data centers can provide their data sets in any desired format or organized in any organizational view using well established protocols. Collaborators will see all datasets of interest to them appear on their local desktops without having to retrieve the data prior to using it. Additionally, MLVFS will perform on the fly conversion of the datasets stored at the data center to the desired format. MLVFS will free the users from unnecessary tasks, such as data retrieval and conversion, and will allow them to concentrate on tasks related to using the datasets. MLVFS will also free up available resources for users, as they will not have to store local copies of the data, and no data will get transferred unless accessed. MLVFS will do this without requiring the user to learn a new protocol or rewrite any code.\nWe will use MODAPS datasets as a case study for this approach converting the native HDF4 dataset to HDF5 for processing.",

Previous studies have reported rapid enhancements tropospheric BrO (so called “BrO explosion”) connected to near-surface ozone depletion events during springtime in the Arctic. Space-based observation of BrO through Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is an excellent tool for studying bromine chemistry particularly for the Arctic due to its frequent observations at high latitudes.

            "abstract": "Convecting fluids under rapid rotation play an important role in many geophysical systems. In such such systems, the dominant force balance is geostrophic, between the Coriolis term and the pressure gradient, and the resulting motion exhibits strongly 2D columnar structures which are mostly invariant parallel to the axis of rotation. To exploit this rigidity, quasigeostrophic (QG) models of convection have been developed by integrating the equations of motion in the axial direction, averaging over small departures from two dimensionality. Evolving these axially averaged 2D variables, rather than the full 3D variables, enables these models to reproduce the mean dynamics of the system at a lower computational cost, and hence more aggressive parameters than are accessible to direct 3D simulations can be explored. Traditionally, these QG models have only been devised for the region of a convection shell outside the tangent cylinder, which circumscribes the inner boundary of the convection shell. In the present work we have extended the QG framework to the region inside the tangent cylinder where axial convection, transporting heat from the inner to the outer boundary of the shell, is the dominant mode. Thus, in addition to the traditional QG equations, we must also solve the axial flow equation. Numerical results from our 2D QG model applied to a Jovian-like system of thermal convection in a thin spherical shell will be presented which demonstrate that it is capable of capturing the major features of the dynamics of such a system. In particular, our model successfully reproduces the atmospheric zonal jets produced by full 3D models and observed on the gas giant.",

            "abstract": "NASA's LEARN Project is an innovative program that provides long-term immersion in the practice of atmospheric science for middle and high school in-service teachers. Working alongside NASA scientists and using authentic NASA Science Mission Directorate research data, teachers develop individual research topics of interest during two weeks in the summer while on-site at NASA Langley. With continued, intensive mentoring by NASA scientists, the teachers further develop their research throughout the academic year through virtual group meetings and data team meetings mirroring scientific collaborations. At the end of the first year, LEARN teachers present scientific posters. The LEARN experience has had such an impact that multiple teachers from the first two cohorts have elected to continue their research. The LEARN project evaluation has provided insights into particularly effective elements of this new approach. Findings indicate that teachers’ perceptions of the scientific enterprise have changed, and that LEARN provided substantial resources to help them take real-world research to their students. This presentation will focus on key factors from LEARN’s implementation that inform best practices for the incorporation of authentic scientific research into teacher professional development experiences. We suggest that these factors should be considered in the development of other such experiences, including: (1) The involvement of a single scientist as both the project leader/manager and the project scientist, to ensure that the project can meet teachers’ needs. (2) An emphasis on framing and approaching scientific research questions, so that teachers can learn to evaluate the feasibility of studies based on scope, scale, and availability of data. (3) Long term, ongoing relationships where teachers and scientists work as collaborators, beyond the workshop “mold.” (4) A focus on meeting the needs of individual teachers, whether their needs relate to elements of research and analysis, or to their tight professional schedules. (5) Above all, flexibility and patience. LEARN builds relationships with teachers slowly, over a long period of time. In the middle, life often intervenes. LEARN has emphasized that teachers’ success is more important than deadlines or following a rigid protocol.",

            "abstract": "The optical properties of black carbon (BC) are significantly affected by its aging process in the atmosphere. We have built a conceptual model defining three BC aging stages, including freshly emitted BC aggregates, coating by soluble material and hygroscopic growth. We apply an improved geometric-optics surface-wave approach (Liou et al., 2011; Takano et al., 2013) to calculate the absorption and scattering properties of BC at each stage and compare the theoretical results with those obtained from laboratory experiments (Zhang et al., 2008; Khalizov et al., 2009). Preliminary results show a general agreement between calculated and measured BC absorption cross sections (bias < 10%) and scattering cross sections (bias < 30%) for BC aerosols with mobility diameters of 155, 245 and 320 nm at Stages 1 and 2, where BC is coated by sulfuric acid and its water solution, respectively. We find that the calculated scattering and absorption cross sections for fresh BC aggregates (Stage 0) with different sizes are invariably larger than experimental results partly because of the uncertainty in theoretical calculations for BC with size parameters less than 1. It appears that the uncertainty in the experiment could also contribute to the discrepancy, considering that the measuring instrument missed some scattering in certain angles (0-7° and 170-180°). Finally, we will apply the conceptual model and the single-scattering results to assess the effects of BC aging processes on direct radiative forcing using observed BC vertical profiles.",

            "abstract": "Codes of Ethics (Conduct) for geoscientists are formulated primarily by professional societies and the codes must be viewed in the context of the Goals (Missions, Values) of the societies. Our survey of the codes of approximately twenty-five societies reveals that most codes enumerate principles centered on practical issues regarding professional conduct of individuals such as plagiarism, fabrication, and falsification, and the obligation of individuals to the profession and society at large. With the exception of statements regarding the ethics of peer review, there is relatively little regarding the ethical obligations of the societies themselves. In essence, the codes call for traditionally honorable behavior of individual members. It is striking, given that the geosciences are largely relevant to the future of Earth, most current codes of societies fail to address our immediate obligations to the environment and Earth itself. We challenge professional organizations to consider the ethical obligations to Earth in both their statements of goals and in their codes of ethics. Actions by societies could enhance the efforts of individual geoscientists to serve society, especially in matters related to hazards, resources and planetary stewardship. Actions we suggest to be considered include: (1) Issue timely position statements on topics in which there is expertise and consensus (some professional societies such as AGU, GSA, AAAS, and the AMS, do this regularly, yet others not at all.); (2) Build databases of case studies regarding geoethics that can be used in university classes; (3) Hold interdisciplinary panel discussions with ethicists, scientists, and policy makers at annual meetings; (4) Foster publication in society journals of contributions relating to ethical questions; and (5) Aggressively pursue the incorporation of geoethical issues in undergraduate and graduate curricula and in continuing professional development.",

The Initiative forges commitments and partnerships from the private, NGO, academic, and public sectors to create data-driven tools. Open data from Federal agencies to support this innovation is available on Climate.Data.gov, initially focusing on coastal flooding but soon to expand to topics including food, energy, water, energy, transportation, and health.\nThe Climate Resilience Toolkit (CRT) will facilitate access to data-driven resilience tools, services, and best practices, including those accessible through the CDI. The CRT will also include access to training and tutorials, case studies, engagement forums, and other information sources.\nThe Climate Action Plan also calls for a public-private partnership on extreme weather risk, with the goal of generating improved assessments of risk from different types of extreme weather events, using methods and data that are transparent and accessible.\nFinally, the U.S. Global Change Research Program and associated agencies work to advance the science necessary to inform decisions and sustain assessments.\nCollectively, these efforts represent increased emphasis across the Federal Government on the importance of information to support climate resilience.",

            "abstract": "Large magnetic storms, as quantified by the Dst index, can produce geoelectric fields that are hazardous for the operation of electric power grids. The great storm of March 1989, for example, had the highest –Dst value of the 20th century. During the main phase of this storm, rapid magnetic variation induced geoelectric fields in the Earth’s lithosphere that caused the complete collapse of the Canadian Hydro-Québec electric-power grid. In this study, we focus specifically on how sudden impulses in geomagnetic activity, those that occur during large storms, can induce geoelectric fields. These impulses can be seen during storm main phases, but they are most usually recognized as storm sudden commencements corresponding to the arrival, at Earth, of coronal mass ejections. We use a newly developed algorithm for estimating induced geoelectric fields from magnetic field variation recorded at ground-based observatories. We train the algorithm on 1-sec geomagnetic and geoelectric field data collected at Japanese observatories during the October 2003 Halloween storm. We then postdict geoelectric fields that would have been realized (but not directly measured at 1-sec resolution) in Japan during the 1989 Québec storm and during another intense storm that occurred in March 1991. The later storm is noteworthy, not because of its intense main phase, but because it commenced with a sudden impulse of enormous magnitude. For the first half minute of the 1991 storm, induced geoelectric fields far exceeded those realized during the 1989 storm. Recognizing the potential hazard, we also analyze a scenario geomagnetic time series of an extreme event sudden commencement, and we calculate the geoelectric fields that this scenario event might plausibly induce. Results show that substantial geoelectric field induction, possibly hazardous for electric power grids, can occur briefly but very abruptly as soon as a magnetic storm commences.",

We developed a climatology of downwelling shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiative fluxes, cloud populations, and cloud radiative effects by partitioning the data by cloud type, time of day, and as a function of large scale modes of variability such as ENSO phase and wet/dry seasons. The Nauru cloud populations are impacted by ENSO variability whereas the cloud populations over Manus only shift slightly in response to changes in ENSO phase. Most of the variability in SW and LW cloud radiative effects among the three sites and across ENSO/monsoon phases at a given site is driven by changes in cloud frequency rather than variations in cloud properties. Similarly, the contribution of each cloud type to the total SW cloud radiative effect is strongly conditioned on frequency. Low clouds have the largest impact on total SW cloud radiative effect. We performed a sensitivity analysis that showed that missing the absolute frequency of deep convective clouds by +10% can change the total SW cloud radiative effect by -20 W m-2. Timing errors of the diurnal cycle of cloud frequency, such as having a particular cloud type peak too early or too late in model simulations, have a smaller impact on the total SW cloud radiative effect compared to biases in absolute frequency.",

However, the contributions of various factors to SOC changes are not well understood and quantified. This study was to investigate the impacts of changing farming practices, initial SOC levels, and biological enhancement of grain production on SOC dynamics and to attribute the relative contributions of major driving forces (CO2 enrichment and farming practices) using a fractional factorial modeling design. The case study using a crop site in Iowa in the United States demonstrated that the traditional corn-soybean (CS) rotation had the potential of accumulating SOC over this century under the current condition; whereas the continuous-corn (CC) system might have a higher SOC sequestration potential than CS. In either case, however, straw removal could reverse the sink potential to carbon neutral or a weak sink/source. Our results also suggested that the equilibrium SOC level may vary greatly depending on cropping systems and management practices. Importantly, the factorial design analysis indicated that residue management had the most significant impact on SOC changes, followed by CO2 enrichment. In brief, this study is valuable for understanding the major forces driving SOC dynamics of agro-ecosystems and informative for decision-makers when seeking the enhancement of SOC sequestration potential and sustainability of biofuel production, especially in the Corn Belt region.",

            "abstract": "The ocean is a major global source of aerosols and the seawater from which they are derived is a complex mixture of organic molecules from organisms including phytoplankton, bacteria, and viruses. Marine aerosols consist of any combination of these components and in different mixing states. The mixing state affects absorption and scattering efficiency as well as their ability to uptake water and form ice. Therefore, there is a need to spatially resolve the chemical composition of individual marine aerosols in order to study their potential effects on the climate.\nScanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy coupled with Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy (SXTM-NEXAFS) gives both spatial resolution as well as the sensitivity to molecular transitions that is necessary to correlate a position on an aerosol with a functional group or inorganic constituent. The morphology, mixing state, and chemical composition from STXM-NEXAFS can be used in conjunction with collocated measurements (light scattering, ice nucleation, etc.) to correlate the spatially resolved chemical composition of aerosols with their physical properties.\nThe goal of this project is to determine if there is a difference in the organic fraction between particles with clearly different morphology and mixing states. Three major classes of marine aerosols have been classified as sea salt, marine gels, and cell fragments. Sea salt is classified by having an inorganic core consisting of NaCl and a thin layer of organic coating on the outside. Marine gels consist of organic material in the form of lipids, polysaccharides, and proteins distributed throughout the aerosol alongside inorganic compounds, such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+, that help to stabilize the negative charge of the organic material. Cell fragments include fragments from phytoplankton and bacteria. Efforts are currently underway to quantitatively evaluate differences in NEXAFS spectra for these particle types using nonlinear least squares.",

            "abstract": "Geysers are features that produce episodic eruptions of water, steam and sometimes non-condensable gases. Natural geysers are rare, with fewer than 1,000 worldwide. They are more than curiosities and popular tourist attractions: they offer a direct window into geothermal processes, and may serve as a natural small-scale laboratory to study larger-scale eruptive process such as those at volcanoes, and other self-organized, intermittent processes that result from phase separation and localized input of energy and mass.\nDespite > 200 years of scientific study, basic questions remain: Do eruptions begin from the bottom or top of the geyser? What controls eruption duration? Why do eruptions end? What are the required special subsurface geometries? Why are some geysers periodic, and others irregular? How and why do they respond to external influences such as weather, tides, and earthquakes?\nThis presentation will review new insights from field studies at Lone Star geyser, Yellowstone National Park, geysers in the El Tatio geyser field, Chile, and laboratory models. At Lone Star we infer that dynamics are controlled by thermal and mechanical coupling between the conduit and a deeper, laterally-offset reservoir (called a “bubble trap” in previous studies). At El Tatio, we measured pressure and temperature within geysers over multiple eruption cycles: this data document the heating of liquid water by steam delivered from below. The laboratory experiments reveal how episodic release of steam from a bubble trap prepares a conduit for eruption and can generate a range of eruption intensities. In all cases, the eruption initiation, duration and termination are controlled by the interaction between the accumulation and transport of steam and liquid, and modulated by the geometry of the geyser’s plumbing. Time series of thousands of eruptions confirm that internal processes control eruptions, with only pool geysers showing a sensitivity to air temperature; only very large stress changes influence eruptions.",

            "abstract": "Oscillations in stress, such as those created by earthquakes, can increase permeability and fluid mobility in geologic media. In natural systems, strain amplitudes as small as 10-6 can increase discharge in streams and springs, change the water level of wells, and enhance production from petroleum reservoirs. Enhanced permeability typically recovers to pre-stimulated values over a period of months to years.\nThis presentation will review some of the observations that indicate that dynamic stresses produced by seismic waves change permeability. We use the response of a set of wells distributed throughout China to multiple large earthquakes to probe the relationship between earthquake-generated stresses and water-level changes in wells. We find that dynamic stresses dominate the responses at distances more than 1 fault length from the earthquake and that permeability changes may explain the water level changes. Regions with high deformation rates are most sensitive to seismic waves. We also consider the response of a large alluvial fan in Taiwan to the 1999 M7.5 Chi-Chi earthquake where there were sustained changes in groundwater temperature after the earthquake. Using groundwater flow models, we infer that permeability increased by an order of magnitude over horizontal scales of tens of km, and vertical scales of several km. Permeability returned to the pre-earthquake value over many months. As much as half the total transport in the fan occurs during the short time periods with enhanced permeability.",

            "abstract": "The efficiencies of aggregation between colliding ice particles (sticking efficiencies) are highly uncertain. Within model schemes, temperature and size dependence may or may not be included and electrostatic forces are generally neglected. Sticking efficiencies across ice types (e.g., graupel, snow or cloud ice) may differ by an order of magnitude or more from one scheme to another. Here we assess the degree to which a combination of S-band profiler and in situ ice size distribution measurements can provide constraints on sticking efficiencies within quasi-steady-state stratiform rain columns. We select two cases of extended stratiform rain, one observed over Oklahoma and a second observed over Darwin, Australia, which appear remarkably similar in mean reflectivity and Doppler velocity profiles. Both cases exhibit an extended period over which mid-tropospheric mean Doppler velocities are uncorrelated with radar reflectivity, consistent with a stability of normalized mass size distribution shape observed in situ. Using these observations and best estimates of associated measurement uncertainties, a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo framework is used to probabilistically estimate sticking efficiency parameters. This method provides estimates of non-linear model sensitivity to multivariate parameter perturbation as well as non-Gaussian uncertainty in the estimated parameter values.",

            "abstract": "The calcium carbonate (CaCO3) minerals calcite and aragonite are the primary reservoir for oxidized carbon in the continental crust and upper mantle, and are the dominant carriers of carbon into the Earth’s interior. Their solubility in subduction zone fluids strongly influences the amount of carbon retained in downgoing lithosphere. Previous work suggests modest solubility in pure H2O, but high solubility in NaCl-H2O solutions; however, natural solutions may contain additional cations such as KCl. We evaluated the role of salt on calcite solubility in salt-H2O solutions involving NaCl, KCl, LiCl and CsCl. All experiments were conducted in a piston-cylinder apparatus at 700 °C and 8 kbar. These conditions were used because pressure is not expected to have a large effect on the nature of calcite dissolution in saline fluids. Results show that increasing the concentration of any salt exponentially increases calcite solubility for all salt-H2O and mixed salt-H2O solutions. At a given salt mole fraction in one-salt solutions, calcite solubility increases with decreasing salt cation size: CsCl<KCl<NaCl<LiCl. Experiments in mixed salt solutions revealed that calcite solubility varied systematically with salt components and their concentrations. The data were used to derive a simple empirical model for calcite solubility in any H2O-KCl-NaCl-LiCl solution. The model reproduces the data in two-salt and three-salt solutions with an average deviation of 6% and 1% respectively. This study shows that aqueous fluids with high concentrations of halide salts have the potential to promote substantial carbon mass transfer. With the growing evidence for highly saline brines in a range of high pressure geologic environments, these fluids may play an important role in the deep carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Akumal, Mexico, was the first tourist resort in the Mexican Caribbean mainland, its highly developed coastal zone lies directly above the phreatic, and it is directly connected to the sub-littoral waters. Akumal is also known as a well-developed fringing coral reef, now in a critical condition. The main objective of this study was to explore the relationship between two of the main indicators of human pressure (nutrients and sedimentation, linked to coastal development and water run-offs) and the condition of the reef benthos, during a year. The sampling design used four transects perpendicular to shore, associated to different tourist and water run-off exposure, for a total of 12 stations distributed in three different reef zones (transition zone, shallow and deep spurs and grooves). Monthly samples were collected: water samples close to the reef lagoon drain channels and at bottom depth at each station, and sediment traps were recovered and replaced also at each station. Reef Benthos videotransects were recorded bi-monthly at each station to assess its condition. Macroalgae and filamentous algae dominate benthic cover (up to 50%), hard-coral cover ranges from 5-9%. Five coral-diseases were recorded, affecting 10.16% of the coral colonies: Caribbean Ciliate Infection, White Band, Purple Spots, White Spots and Yellow Band. The sedimentation rate -sr- ranged from 0.13 to 83.7 mg/cm2/day during the year; 86% of the samples had a sr ≤ 10 mg/cm2/day (reefs not stressed); 13% of the samples had a sr ranging from 10 to 50 mg/cm2/day (stressed reefs); and 1% of the samples were over the critical threshold (>50 mg/cm2/day). Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen concentrations during the year were above those recorded previously in Caribbean reefs. The most abundant fraction was ammonium, surpassing both Mexican norms: For protection of aquatic life in coastal zones (0.01 mg/L), and the critical threshold for aquatic life (0.4 mg/L). These concentration limits are considered as drivers of eutrophication, one of the main established causes of reef degradation globally. High concentrations of ammonium and other nutrients have been linked to increases in algae cover and coral diseases incidence, and to decreases in rates of coral calcification, fertility, production and viability of coral larvae, and the associated diversity loss.",

SST patterns representing the 1950s and 1980s are obtained based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) between Sahel rainfall and global SST distribution, and prescribed for 7-year simulations for each period. Results show that the subtropical high is strengthened and expanded southwestward associated with colder northern Atlantic Ocean SST in 1980s. As a result, the rain band in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Sahel moves southward and rainfall is reduced over the Sahel. Stronger surface winds associated with strong surface temperature gradients increase dust emission in the southern Saharan desert and northern Sahel. Combined with circulation changes induced by strengthening the subtropical high and reduced wet deposition, dust transport is increased in the deep tropics (10-20N), but reduced in the northern path (20-30N)\nTo examine the effect of aerosol radiative forcing, additional experiments are conducted after dust radiative feedback is turned off. Without aerosol radiative feedback, model still simulate aforementioned contrast between 1980s and 1950s, but the anomalies of Sahel drought and dust transports are a lot weaker. Preliminary results indicate that atmospheric heating due to shortwave absorption by dust provides additional buoyance and lifts dust particles to higher altitudes. Dust radiative forcing also increases meridional temperature gradients and strengthens the African Easterly Jet, resulting in an increased residence time of dust and farther westward transport.",

            "abstract": "The ever-burgeoning satellite remote sensing era has significantly improved our understanding of the role aerosol particles play in the earth-atmosphere system. Instruments such as MODIS, MISR, OMI, AVHRR, and now VIIRS, among others, are meeting a growing number of observational demands necessary for characterizing aerosol particle influence, on processes such as surface air quality, direct and semi-direct forcing and cloud indirect effects. While these passive sensors have grown to represent the community’s fundamental global aerosol observing core, their datasets represent, almost exclusively, a column-integrated view of atmospheric aerosols. In contrast, however, aerosol-climate interaction is inherently sensitive to the vertical distribution of aerosol particle presence.\nThough the CALIOP instrument, with its relatively limited profiling swath, offers a much smaller observational scale compared with passive imagers, active-sensor aerosol profiling is increasingly adding the necessary vertical perspective required to challenge and fully characterize what has become a predominant two-dimensional global perception of aerosols. In this talk, we highlight the impact of CALIOP-based profiling, and describe how the critical third dimension is contributing to this knowledge. We introduce aerosol scale-heights and the contribution of near-surface particle presence relative to column-integrated aerosol optical depths. We describe the impact of particle profile diffusivity relative to passive-based estimates of surface air quality. The impact of accurate vertical profiling in global modeling systems is conceptualized, through benefits to downwind forecasting from accurate initialization. Sensitivities in semi-direct regional heating rate estimates are shown as a function of model-constrained aerosol vertical profiling. Finally, we highlight perhaps the most important CALIOP observation of all, relative to the passive sensors: the presence of optically-thin cirrus clouds. We describe the sensitivity in passive estimates of direct aerosol forcing based on active cloud-clearing.",

            "abstract": "Early warning of the timing and locations of malaria epidemics can facilitate the targeting of resources for prevention and emergency response. In response to this need, we are developing the Epidemic Prognosis Incorporating Disease and Environmental Monitoring for Integrated Assessment (EPIDEMIA) computer system. The system incorporates software for capturing, processing, and integrating environmental and epidemiological data from multiple sources; data assimilation techniques that continually update models and forecasts; and a web-based interface that makes the resulting information available to public health decision makers. This technology will enable forecasts based on lagged responses to environmental risk factors as well as information about recent trends in malaria cases. Environmental driving variables will include a variety of remote-sensed hydrological indicators. EPIDEMIA will be implemented and tested in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia in collaboration with local stakeholders. We conducted an initial co-design workshop in July 2014 that included environmental scientists, software engineers, and participants from the NGO, academic, and public health sectors in Ethiopia. A prototype of the EPIDEMIA web interface was presented and a requirements analysis was conducted to characterize the main use cases for the public health community, identify the critical data requirements for malaria risk modeling, and develop of a list of baseline features for the public health interface. Several critical system features were identified, including a secure web-based interface for uploading and validating surveillance data; a flexible query system to allow retrieval of environmental and epidemiological data summaries as tables, charts, and maps; and an alert system to provide automatic warnings in response to environmental and epidemiological risk factors for malaria. Future system development will involve a cycle of implementation, training, usability testing, and upgrading. This innovative translational bioinformatics approach will allow us to assess the practical effectiveness of these tools as we continually improve the technologies.",

            "abstract": "Salinity is an indicator of the interaction between ocean circulation and the global water cycle, which in turn affects the regulation of the Earth's climate. Due to its fine spatial and temporal coverage, Aquarius presents an ideal measurement system for fully characterizing the distribution and properties of sea surface salinity. This leads to the need for the proper validation of the Aquarius salinity product with independent salinity measurements. Using the first two years of Aquarius 3.0 Level 2 sea surface salinity data we investigate time and space scales of variability and trends. We conduct a statistical validation of Aquarius measurements with Argo in situ observations. Several aspects are considered, including spatial characteristics and temporal agreement, as well as seasonal differences by ocean basin and hemisphere. An exploration of ascending/descending path differences for the Aquarius salinity product is also explored. Regional studies examine the time and space scales of variability through time series comparisons and spatial variogram analysis. Results show that Aquarius validates well with Argo overall, while each metric captures slightly different characteristics of sea surface salinty by region and by considerations over time and space.",

            "abstract": "Glaciers along the Amundsen Coast are changing rapidly, which has drawn substantial scientific and public attention. Modeling and observation suggest warm-water intrusion and consequent melting as the cause of observed changes, and that unstoppable retreat may have already been triggered in some drainages. While Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers are losing the most mass and have been the predominant objects study, other systems, particularly Smith, Pope and Kohler Glaciers and the corresponding Dotson and Crosson Shelves, are changing more rapidly relative to their size. Though smaller, these glaciers still have potentially large implications for overall regional dynamics as their beds connect below sea level to surrounding basins. In particular, the long, deep trough of Smith Glacier nearly links to the large eastern tributary of Thwaites, potentially causing rapid changes of Smith to have significant impact on the continuing retreat of Thwaites.\nWe implemented a numerical model in Elmer/Ice, an open-source, full-Stokes, finite-element software package, to investigate the response of the Smith/Pope/Kohler system to different initial conditions. We use various parameterizations of sub-shelf melting with constant magnitude to examine the sensitivity of overall dynamics to melt distribution. Because melt distribution affects lateral buttressing and upstream grounded areas, it is potentially an important control on ice shelf and outlet glacier dynamics. Through comparison to the most recent velocity data, we evaluate the ability of differing melt parameterizations to reproduce the behavior currently seen in Smith/Pope/Kohler glaciers. In addition, we investigate the effect of using different years of velocity data with constant elevation input when initiating model runs. By comparing results over the satellite record to initiation with synchronous observations, we assess the accuracy of the often necessary practice of using differently timestamped datasets.",

            "abstract": "The goal of this project, which is part of the EARTHCHEM initiative, is to compile the existing experimental trace element partitioning data, and to develop a transparent, accessible resource for the community. The primary goal of experimental trace element partitioning studies is to create a database that can be used to develop models of how trace elements behave in natural geochemical systems. The range of approaches as to how this is accomplished and how the data are reported differs dramatically from one system to another and one investigator to another. This provides serious challenges to the creation of a coherent database – and suggests the need for a standard format for data presentation and reporting.\nThe driving force for this compilation is to provide community access to the complete database for trace element experiments. Our new effort includes all the published analytical results from experimental determinations. In compiling the data, we have set a minimum standard for the data to be included. The threshold criteria include:\nExperimental conditions (temperature, pressure, device, container, time, etc.)\nMajor element composition of the phases\nTrace element analyses of the phases\nData sources that did not report these minimum components were not included. The rationale for not including such data is that the degree of equilibration is unknown, and more important, no rigorous approach to modeling the behavior of trace elements is possible without a knowledge of the actual concentrations or the temperature and pressure of formation.\nThe data are stored using a schema derived from that of the Library of Experimental Phase Relations (LEPR), modified to account for additional metadata, and restructured to permit multiple analytical entries for various element/technique/standard combinations.\nOur ultimate goal is to produce a database together with a flexible user interface that will be useful for experimentalists to set up their work and to build calibration datasets, for petrologists to find appropriate partition coefficients, and to help reviewers evaluate models submitted for publication. As an additional benefit, we hope that this investigation will help to set new publication standards for experimental data.\nThe database will be assessable at the portal lepr.ofm-research.org.",

            "abstract": "We jointly invert body wave travel times for anisotropy and velocity variations within the Woodlark Rift, Papua New Guinea, one of the youngest (≤6Ma) and most highly-extended (≤190km) continental rifts known. We use data from the CDPapua passive seismic array deployed around the D’Entrecasteaux Islands; these islands lie within the maximally-thinned continental crust at the centre of the rift and host the world’s youngest (5 - 7 Ma) UHP rocks. We have previously used SK(K)S splitting to identify strong anisotropy within this rift, with fast axis orientated parallel to extension, roughly N-S. Consistency of splitting direction across station, back azimuth and method of analysis indicates a simple anisotropic fabric beneath much of this region. Consequently, we simplify the anisotropic inversion by solving for perturbations to N-S and E-W shear velocities at each node. This work builds on our previous isotropic tomographic study by resolving tradeoffs between anisotropy and velocity heterogeneities. We cross-correlate shear wave arrivals separately on N-S and E-W components, using the Christoffel equations to show that the travel times of these orthogonal quasi-shear pulses distinctly record the fast and slow velocities within our model. We invert these data for velocities on an irregular mesh, using a finite frequency approach with a first fresnel zone approximation. Preliminary results identify the locus of the rift beneath the D’Entrecasteaux Islands, and demonstrate that substantial anisotropy is present beneath the region of major extension. This anisotropy is co-located with low seismic velocities that indicate almost total removal of lithosphere, consistent with gravity fitting. Therefore, we ascribe the anisotropy within the rift to LPO of highly sheared asthenospheric mantle as a result of the large magnitude of extension. ",

Model simulated maximum daily 8 h averaged (MAD8) O3 are within ± 2 ppb of the observations at 12 sites from the Clean Air Status and Trend Network (CASTNet) and the Mt. Bachelor Observatory (MBO). Sensitivity simulations show maximum surface O3 enhancement of ~9 ppb on average due to biomass burning during July-September and ~2 ppb on average caused by lightning NOx during NAM. The adjoint model computes the sensitivity of surface O3 concentrations to both O3 production rates and different emission sources over the history of the air parcel reaching the observation sites. We use the adjoint model to identify the source regions and transport paths for the five fire plumes measured at MBO during the summer of 2008 and the results are consistent with the HYSPLIT back trajectories. We find during these fire plumes at MBO, contributions to surface O3 from biomass burning emitted NOx are more than three times higher than those from anthropogenic emitted NOx, indicating significant enhancement of O3 due to fire emissions. At CASTNet sites in the southwestern U.S., contributions to surface O3 from lightning emitted NOx are about one fifth of those from anthropogenic emitted NOx during NAM.",

            "abstract": "Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) reverse buoyancy to form buoyant plumes after sufficient entrainment and heating of ambient atmosphere and deposition of suspended sediment. The deposits associated with buoyancy reversal depend on input from the feeding flow. It is expected that fines are swept away by the buoyant plume, and coarse sediment might be deposited preferentially during reversal; in an extreme case, one might expect deposit thickening at the point of buoyancy reversal as the coarse sediment rains out of the lofting plume. Alternatively, a thinner, finer grained deposit would be expected from a flow that deposited the bulk of its coarse sediment load prior to buoyancy reversal. The PDC associated with the 18 May 1980 Mt. St. Helens lateral blast downed trees as it traversed the ground (blowdown zone); at the distal extent of the blowdown zone, trees were burned, yet remained standing, in an area thought to represent a well-constrained case of PDC buoyancy reversal (singe zone). We present a sedimentological analysis of preserved deposits from the blowdown and singe zones to investigate this transition. The PDC deposit is poorly sorted, gray, sandy ash, generally <15 cm thick, and is locally normally graded. The unit includes lapilli sized clasts, with fragments of pumice, lithics, and, locally, wood fragments. Flow velocities at the blowdown/singe zone transition varied by a factor of ~2, and, where the flow velocities were slower, deceleration occurred within the blowdown zone prior to lift-off. In the singe zone, the deposit is structureless, and thins from <10 cm to <5 cm thick over a distance of 0.5-1 km. The grain-size distribution and sorting of the unit within the singe zone is broadly similar to deposits in the blowdown zone, but either become better sorted where deceleration in the blowdown zone preceded lift-off, or fine at the point of lift-off before becoming fines poor further downstream. These data indicate that the flow experienced only partial buoyancy reversal, and a dense undercurrent continued to move through the singe zone. However, in areas where tree blowdown orientations indicate that the buoyant plume was fed from multiple directions, the singe zone deposits fine towards the center of the area of focusing, and the <63 μm size fraction increases to as much as ~20 wt. % of the deposit.",

            "abstract": "There are many reasons why “Dark Data” needs to be brought into the light. Sometimes a scientist embarking on a research project in a particular area needs access to any and all data (ecological and environmental) that have been recorded from that area previously. This is especially true for studies of the impact of climate change on ocean community biogeography and biodiversity. Recent work in the Slope Water south of New England and in the Red Sea to study the distribution and abundance of euphausiids (krill) in these distinctly different habitats stimulated the need to “rescue” data collected in the 1970’s and 1980’s during multidisciplinary projects to study Gulf Stream rings in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean.\nA number of volumes of papers resulted from those studies, but the original biological and ecological data about which the papers were written are unavailable digitally online. Residing primarily in notebooks in a back room and on Commodore computer disks in a box, these data can be truly considered 'dark'. Digitizing them is a massive data rescue effort that has initially involved zooplankton tow metadata, animal counts, and biomass from 312 tows (most with multiple sample depths) deployed during 35 cruises in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe data are being uncovered and extracted from cruise and laboratory notebooks and related documents, and, working closely with data managers from the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO), they are being transcribed by hand into a spreadsheet in a format that will be easily servable online. Associated data, like volumes filtered that enable the raw animal count data to be useful, and other biological data derived from the samples such as biovolumes, are also being digitized. This data rescue will expand to include a compilation of the associated environmental and ecological data, including temperature, salinity, and nutrients (CTDs and bottle samples) from the cruises as well. The final product will be one or more data publications, complete with digital object identifiers (doi).\nThe vast majority of this rescue effort is being done by one of the original projects' Principal Investigators (always a bonus), and we will present details of the recovery project, including successful strategies that have accomplished the results to date.",

            "abstract": "Dehydration reactions are linked to shallow subduction zone deformation through excess pore pressures and their effect on mechanical properties. Two reactions, the transformation of smectite to illite and of opal-A to opal-CT and then to quartz, can occur relatively early in the subduction process and may affect the propagation of the plate boundary fault, the updip limit of velocity-weakening frictional paper, and tsunamigenesis. Due to large variations between subduction zones in heat flow, sedimentation rates, and geometries, dehydration location may peak prior to subduction to as much as 100 km landward of the deformation front. The location of the dehydration reaction peak relative to when compaction occurs, causes significant differences in pore pressure generation. As a result, a key element to modeling excess pore pressures due to dehydration reactions is the assumed relationship between permeability and porosity. Data from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) drilling of subduction zone reference sites were combined with previously collected results to develop relationships for porosity-permeability behavior for various sediment types. Comparison with measurements of deeper analog data show that porosity-permeability trends are maintained through burial and diagenesis to porosities <10%, suggesting that behavior observed in shallow samples is informative for predicting behavior at depth following subduction. We integrate these permeability-porosity relationships, compaction behavior, predictions of temperature distribution, kinetic expressions for smectite and opal-A dehydration, into fluid flow models to examine the role of dehydration reactions in pore pressure generation.",

Filled with information about weather, Earth science, and satellite meteorology, it has always been a helpful resource for students and educators in and outside of the classroom. Geared toward upper middle school and early high school students, we replace around 20% of our audience each year. That means it is imperative to keep the site properly geared toward the needs of a rapidly changing group of students. Our team has recently redesigned SciJinks.gov to be mobile-friendly, modern looking, and teen-friendly.

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of crop gross primary productivity (GPP) is important. We have recently developed an algorithm to derive fAPAR of chlorophyll (fAPARchl), fAPAR of foliage (fAPARfoliage) and chlorophyll LAI (LAIchl) with PROSAIL2. The MODIS surface reflectance produced with MAIAC were utilized to retrieve fAPARchl, fAPARfoliage and LAIchl for three AmeriFlux sites of maize and soybean. MOD15A2 FPAR and the retrieved fAPARchl were compared with field fAPARcanopy and the fraction of PAR absorbed by green leaves of the vegetation (fAPARgreen). MOD15A2 FPAR overestimated field fAPARcanopy in spring and in fall, and underestimated field fAPARcanopy in midsummer whereas fAPARchl correctly captured the seasonal phenology. The retrieved fAPARchl agreed well with field fAPARgreen at early crop growth stage in June, and was less than field fAPARgreen in late July, August and September, which is consistent with crop physiology theory. GPP estimates with fAPARchl and with MOD15A2 FPAR were compared to tower flux GPP. GPP simulated with fAPARchl was corroborated with tower flux GPP. Improvements in crop GPP estimation were achieved by replacing MOD15A2 FPAR with fAPARchl which also reduced uncertainties of crop GPP estimates by 1.12 – 2.37 g C m-2 d-1.\nNDVI, EVI, WDRVIgreen, and CIgreen have also been employed to estimate GPP by other scientific teams. We investigated the scaling factors and offsets (i.e., regression slopes and offsets) between fAPARchl and the VIs. The results showed that the scaled EVI obtained the best performance. The performance of the scaled NDVI, EVI and WDRVIgreen was improved across sites, crop types and soil/background wetness conditions, compared to the original un-scaled VIs. The scaled green band indices (WDRVIgreen, CIgreen) did not exhibit superior performance to either the scaled EVI or NDVI in estimating crop daily GPP at these agricultural fields.\nMOD15A2 LAI and the retrieved LAIchl were implemented into CLM to simulate GPP, respectively. Simulated GPP series with both MOD15A2 LAI and LAIchl were compared to tower flux GPP. GPP simulation with LAIchl was significantly improved, compared to GPP simulation with MOD15A2 LAI. Our results show that the fAPARchl/LAIchl products significantly improve the accuracy and reduce the uncertainty of GPP estimates, compared to MOD15A2 FPAR/LAI.",

            "abstract": "Concrete ways to adapt to climate change are needed to help natural resource managers take the first steps to incorporate climate change into management and take advantage of opportunities to balance the negative effects of climate change. We recently initiated two science-management climate change adaptation partnerships, one with three national forests and other key stakeholders in the Blue Mountains region of northeastern Oregon, and the other with 16 national forests, three national parks and other stakeholders in the northern Rockies region. Goals of both partnerships were to: (1) synthesize published information and data to assess the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of key resource areas, including water use, infrastructure, fisheries, and vegetation and disturbance; (2) develop science-based adaptation strategies and tactics that will help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change and assist the transition of biological systems and management to a warmer climate; (3) ensure adaptation strategies and tactics are incorporated into relevant planning documents; and (4) foster an enduring partnership to facilitate ongoing dialogue and activities related to climate change in the partnerships regions. After an initial vulnerability assessment by agency and university scientists and local resource specialists, adaptation strategies and tactics were developed in a series of scientist-manager workshops. The final vulnerability assessments and adaptation actions are incorporated in technical reports. The partnerships produced concrete adaptation options for national forest and other natural resource managers and illustrated the utility of place-based vulnerability assessments and scientist-manager workshops in adapting to climate change.",

            "abstract": "A probabilistic method to assess the hazard from meteotsunamis is developed from both probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis (PTHA) and probabilistic storm-surge forecasting. Meteotsunamis are unusual sea level events, generated when the speed of an atmospheric pressure or wind disturbance is comparable to the phase speed of long waves in the ocean. A general aggregation equation, similar to that used in PTHA, incorporates different meteotsunami sources. A historical record of 116 pressure disturbances recorded between 2000 and 2013 by the U.S. Automated Surface Observing Stations (ASOS) along the U.S. East Coast is used to establish a continuous analytic distribution of each source parameter as well as the overall Poisson rate of occurrence. Initially, atmospheric parameters are considered independently such that the joint probability distribution is given by the product of each marginal distribution. The probabilistic equations are implemented using a Monte Carlo scheme, where a synthetic catalog of pressure disturbances is compiled by sampling the parameter distributions. For each entry in the catalog, ocean wave amplitudes are computed using a finite-difference hydrodynamic model that solves for the linearized long-wave equations. Aggregation of the results from the Monte Carlo scheme results in a meteotsunami hazard curve that plots the annualized rate of exceedance with respect to maximum event amplitude for a particular location along the coast. Results from using 20 synthetic catalogs of 116 events each, resampled from the parent parameter distributions, yield mean and quantile hazard curves. An example is presented for four Mid-Atlantic sites using ASOS data in which only atmospheric pressure disturbances from squall lines and derechos are considered. Results indicate that site-to-site variations among meteotsunami hazard curves are related to the geometry and width of the adjacent continental shelf. The new hazard analysis of meteotsunamis is important for a comprehensive assessment of coastal hazards associated with long-period ocean waves.",

            "abstract": "3D GPR surveys in the covered karst terrain of west-central Florida, USA, reveal surprising geometries of surficial sediments. Several meters of surficial sands overlie progressively more clay-rich sediments, which in turn overlie weathered limestone. The top of a clay-rich horizon produces an exceptionally clear GPR reflector visible from depths between 0.5 and ~8 meters. On length scales of 10-20 meters, the geometry of this horizon as it drapes over underlying weathered limestone suggests that depressions are not conical, but instead more complex troughs that surround domed stratigraphic highs. Azimuthal semi-variograms of the clay horizon depth show greatest correlation in directions that are aligned with the direction of elevated resistivities at depths to 10-14 meters. One possible interpretation is that dissolution in underlying limestone is concentrated in elongated zones rather than in columnar or spherical voids. Elongated sand-filled depressions in the clay layer produce azimuthal resistivity highs in the direction of the elongation. This direction in turn corresponds to the major axis of depressions in the clay-rich GPR reflecting horizon. Groundwater recharge in this area is concentrated into conduits that breach the clay-rich units that overlie the limestone aquifer. This study suggests that the conduits themselves may be elongated features rather than cylindrical in form. Recharge flow paths may be more complex than previously recognized. The high-resolution GPR images require 3D surveys with 250 MHz and 500 MHz antennas, with 10-cm line spacings, careful corrections for antenna positions and 3D migrations of the data.",

            "abstract": "Recent estimates have identified streams as important conduits in the global carbon budget. Stream waters are typically super-saturated with CO2. This CO2 is assumed to come from carbon fixed in the upland terrestrial environment and then transported to the stream via soil water or groundwater. Evasion of CO2 occurs at the stream surface, which usually comprises less than 2% of the watershed area, yet this flux might account for as much as 30% of the net ecosystem exchange in a watershed. This view does not consider the role of hyporheic exchange, despite the fact that hyporheic exchange fluxes can be very large in headwater streams, which drain the majority of the landscape. Using continuously recording probes, we show that pCO2 averages 890 ppmv in stream water and 7,680 ppmv in hyporheic water in a 96-ha watershed. Independent estimates show that stream water turn-over lengths through the hyporheic zone are less than 100 m at baseflow, which suggests that stream water is continuously recharged with CO2 every time it is cycled through the hyporheic zone. We monitored DIC and DOC in a co-located well network and show that DOC decreases, and DIC increases, with travel time through the hyporheic zone. However, respiration of stream-source DOC can only account for approximately 10% of the increase in DIC. Previous hydrologic studies suggest that lateral inputs of soil water or groundwater are limited within this study reach, so the large increases in DIC must come from particulate organic matter buried in the hyporheic zone and from the overlying soil. These measurements suggest that riparian zones supply, via hyporheic exchange, a disproportionately large fraction of carbon to headwater streams and may therefore play an outsized role in the global carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "In the heliosheath beyond the termination shock, low-energy (<0.5 keV) neutral atoms are created by charge exchange of ions with interstellar neutrals. Detecting these neutrals from Earth orbit is challenging because their flux is reduced substantially by ionization losses as they propagate from about 100 AU to 1 AU and because the measured flux competes with a variety of other signals and backgrounds. Using observations from IBEX-Lo and -Hi from two opposing vantage points in Earth orbit, a lower energy limit of about 0.1 keV on measurements of ENAs from the heliosphere and the characteristics of the energy spectrum from about 0.1 to 6 keV are established in two directions in the sky. The ion distribution that produces these neutrals is very kappa-like over 2 decades in energy, based on the ENA observations. When combined with in situ Voyager ion measurements, this kappa-like behavior extends over 5 decades in energy. This presentation focuses on the origins of the kappa-like ion distribution, particularly at lower energies, and investigates the implications for the ion-neutral interactions in the heliosheath.",

However, the preferred mantle radioactivity and heat loss efficiency predict wide spread mantle melting, or “thermal catastrophe”, only 2−3 Ga. Similarly, paleomagnetic observations that indicate a geodynamo as old as 3.4 Gyr are at odds with the “new core paradox”, which claims insufficient energy to drive the ancient geodynamo prior to inner core nucleation ~ 1 Ga in light of recent revisions to the thermal conductivity of the core. We demonstrate that to avoid both the mantle and core paradoxes restricts the present core heat flow to 13 − 17 TW, radiogenic core heat production to 1.5 − 2.0 TW, and inner core age to 0.4 − 0.5 Ga. This solution accommodates the geochemically preferred mantle radiogenic heat production of 13 TW, while maintaining a mostly solid mantle and core generated magnetic field over the geological history of the planet. Inner core nucleation should be accompanied by a boost in magnetic energy in the core and latent heat released at the inner-core boundary, which may be imprinted in the surface paleomagnetic and hot-spot record at that time.",

            "abstract": "Streamflow frequency is used for in-stream flow needs evaluation, water supply planning, water quality analysis, and stream classification, among other purposes. The Illinois Streamflow Accounting Model (ILSAM) was developed to predict the streamflow frequency for Illinois streams and has the capacity to explore anthropogenic impacts on streamflow frequency. Over the past two decades, ILSAM has been applied to ten major watersheds in Illinois. This study updates the hydrologic analysis for the Kankakee River watershed. The hydrologic analyses used to develop the model involved evaluating streamflow records from gaging stations and developing regional equations to estimate flows at ungaged sites throughout the watersheds. Impacts to flow quantity from dams, water supplies, and treated wastewater effluents are examined. The baseline flow condition is the flow record at gaged sites which includes historic anthropogenic effects. The unaltered flow condition, influenced primarily by climate, topography, hydrogeology, and land use, is determined by separating the effects of historic human impact. The effects of the various human modifications to flow in the basin have changed substantially over the history of the available streamflow records. The present flow condition is determined by assuming that current human impact extends back throughout the history of available streamflow records, and statistical estimates are computed accordingly. Flow frequency estimates for each gaging record are adjusted to account for differences in the period of record and other factors such as the hydrologic persistence of low flow. For ungaged sites, a regional regression based on unaltered flow conditions is developed to estimate flow frequency, and adjustments are made to account for human impacts to represent the present flow condition for all sites.",

            "abstract": "High resolution aerial photographs can provide detailed distribution of sea ice features so as to extract physical parameters to refine, validate, and improve climate models. For example, melt ponds play an important role in Earth's radiation balance since they strongly absorb solar radiation rather than reflecting it as snow and ice do. Furthermore, no previous studies have ever considered shadow in sea ice detection, which is ubiquitous in the aerial photographs especially in multi-year ice regions and during late melting phase. Based on our previous study, an object-based classification scheme is used to extract sea ice features including melt ponds and shadow from 163 selected aerial photographs taken during the Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHINARE 2010). The classification algorithm includes three major steps as follows. (1) Image segmentation groups the neighboring pixels into objects according to the similarity of spectral and texture information; (2) random forest ensemble classifier can distinguish the following objects: water, general submerged ice, shadow, and ice/snow; and (3) polygon neighbor analysis can further separate melt ponds from general submerged ice according to the spatial neighboring relationship. Finally, the shadows are used to estimate the sea ice ridge distribution based on local solar illumination geometry. Our results illustrate the spatial distribution and morphological characters of melt ponds and ridges in different latitudes of the Arctic Pacific sector. This method can be applied to massive photos and images taken in past years and future years, in deriving the detailed sea ice feature distribution and changes through years.",

As science becomes increasingly digital and therefore, dependent on software, improving community practices for sustainable science software will contribute to the sustainability of science.\nMembers of the Earth science informatics community, including scientific data producers and distributers, end-user scientists, system and application developers, and data center managers, use science software regularly and face the challenges and the opportunities that science software presents for the sustainability of science. To gain insight on practices needed for the sustainability of science software from the science software experiences of the Earth science informatics community, an interdisciplinary group of 300 community members were asked to engage in simultaneous roundtable discussions and report on their answers to questions about the requirements for improving scientific software sustainability. This paper will present an analysis of the issues reported and the conclusions offered by the participants. These results provide perspectives for science software sustainability practices and have implications for actions that organizations and their leadership can initiate to improve the sustainability of science software.",

SCIMPI was successfully installed at the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site U1416 during IODP Expedition 341S in May 2013. SCIMPI is designed to measure pore pressure, temperature and electrical resistivity over time in a borehole.\nThe first SCIMPI prototype comprises nine modules joined in a single array by flexible cables. Multiple floats keep the system taut against a sinker bar weight located on SCIMPI and resting on the bottom of the borehole. All the modules record temperature and electrical resistivity, and three are also equipped with pressure sensors. Currently, SCIMPI operates as an autonomous instrument with a data logger that is recovered using an ROV. The second recovery of the SCIMPI data logger took place during the Ocean Networks Canada maintenance cruise, Wiring the Abyss 2014, on May 25th, 2014.\nThe pressure sensor data show a stable trend in which tidal effects are observed in through the one year deployment. The temperature measurements in all the modules became stable over time with smaller variations over the last several months. The only temperature sensor differing from this trend is the shallowest, located at 8 meters below seafloor. This module shows a sudden spike of ~20°C that on April 5th, 2014, an event that was repeated several times from April 25th until recovery of modules. The electrical resistivity sensors show variations over time that could be related to gas hydrate dynamics at the Site. Interpretation of these data is speculative at this time but borehole-sealing processes as well as the formation of gas hydrate are potential processes influencing the recordings.\nSCIMPI will soon be connected to Ocean Networks Canada's NEPTUNE observatory at Clayoquot Slope node to provide real-time data from this subseafloor observatory.",

            "abstract": "We outline an efficient approach to help researchers and natural resource managers more effectively use global climate model information in their long-term planning. The approach provides an estimate of the magnitude of change of a particular impact (e.g., summertime streamflow) from a large ensemble of climate change projections prior to detailed analysis. These estimates provide both qualitative information as an end unto itself (e.g., the distribution of future changes between emissions scenarios for the specific impact) and a judicious, defensible evaluation structure that can be used to qualitatively select a sub-set of climate models for further analysis. More specifically, the evaluation identifies global climate model scenarios that both (1) span the range of possible futures for the variable/s most important to the impact under investigation, and (2) come from global climate models that adequately simulate historical climate, providing plausible results for the future climate in the region of interest. To identify how an ecosystem process responds to projected future changes, we methodically sample, using a simple sensitivity analysis, how an impact variable (e.g., streamflow magnitude, vegetation carbon) responds locally to projected regional temperature and precipitation changes. We demonstrate our technique over the Pacific Northwest, focusing on two types of impacts each in three distinct geographic settings: (a) changes in streamflow magnitudes in critical seasons for water management in the Willamette, Yakima, and Upper Columbia River basins; and (b) changes in annual vegetation carbon in the Oregon and Washington Coast Ranges, Western Cascades, and Columbia Basin ecoregions.",

            "abstract": "Fire regimes provide a sensitive indicator of changes in climate and human use as the concept includes fire extent, season, frequency, and intensity. Fires that occur outside the distribution of one or more aspects of a fire regime may affect ecosystem resilience. However, global scale data related to these varied aspects of fire regimes are highly inconsistent due to incomplete or inconsistent reporting. In this study, we derive a globally applicable approach to characterizing similar fire regimes using long geophysical time series, namely MODIS hotspots since 2000. K-means non-hierarchical clustering was used to generate empirically based groups that minimized within-cluster variability. Satellite-based fire detections are known to have shortcomings, including under-detection from obscuring smoke, clouds or dense canopy cover and rapid spread rates, as often occurs with flashy fuels or during extreme weather. Such regions are free from preconceptions, and the empirical, data-mining approach used on this relatively uniform data source allows the region structures to emerge from the data themselves. Comparing such an empirical classification to expectations from climate, phenology, land use or development-based models can help us interpret the similarities and differences among places and how they provide different indicators of changes of concern. Classifications can help identify where large infrequent mega-fires are likely to occur ahead of time such as in the boreal forest and portions of the Interior US West, and where fire reports are incomplete such as in less industrial countries.",

            "abstract": "The Dispersionless Injection (DI) region is the source of substorm associated enhancements in high energy particle flux (10s to 100s of keV). At any given time as it unfolds, DI is occurring across an extended region near the inner edge of the thin current sheet. This region forms around the time of substorm onset and evolves radially inward towards the ring current region. The Earthward edge of the injection region (the injection front) is capable of penetrating deep into the inner magnetosphere, providing a key seed population for the ring current, the radiation belts, and high-energy electron precipitation that affects atmospheric composition and technologies that rely on radio propagation through the upper atmosphere. Typically observed with in situ particle detectors, our knowledge of the injection front and the fate of injected particles is limited by the number and location of spacecraft observations. In this paper, we present multipoint observations of substorm injections in the Canadian sector derived from coordinated THEMIS and ground-based riometer measurements. The combined information of ground and in situ data provides key information about injection region evolution and the loss of injected particles in the inner magnetosphere. Utilizing more than twenty-five riometers operating in Canada and Scandinavia during the THEMIS era, we are able to constrain spacecraft observations in MLT and latitude/radial location, as well as monitor the precipitation from the resulting drifting electron population (the dispersed injections).\nFocusing on the 1624 dispersionless electron injection events discussed in Gabrielse et al. (2014), we present statistics of injection location and radial evolution as well as parameters such as radial penetration depth, ionospheric energy deposition and the relationship between them. We also present detailed examples of events in which THEMIS and the ground observations provide a complete picture of the injection region evolution. We will finish with a discussion of the implications of our results on competing theories as to how and where DIs begin (see e.g., Kabin et al., 2011 and Gabrielse et al., 2012).",

Large climate shifts are already detected in transition regions (7.5% of total land area) around 2010, including rapid replacement of mixed forest (Dwb) by deciduous forest (Dwa) over Northeast China and strong shrinkage of ET on the Tibetan Plateau, weak northward expansion of subtropical winter-dry (Cwa) over eastern China and contract of oceanic climate (Cwb) in Southwest China. Reduction of Dwb in Northeast China and ET on the Tibetan Plateau accelerates substantially during 2010-2030 under all scenarios. Half of the total area occupied by ET in 1990 is projected to be redistributed by 2040. Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, Dwc over Northeast China disappears by 2040-2050, ET on the Tibetan Plateaus disappears by 2070, shift of subtropical humid (Cfa) climate to Cwa over large parts of southeastern China occurs after 2050 due to decreasing wintertime precipitation, and the coverage of C-type climate increases about 7.6% by 2090.

            "abstract": "In this paper we examine teleconnections along the equatorial wave guide during IOD-ENSO interactions, with a focus on the year 2006. A marked feature of 2006 is that it is the year of the lowest seasonal prediction skill in the modern record, despite the appearance of a moderately strong El Nino event. The low prediction skill is marked in global and regional rainfall, but is also clear in other dynamic variables such as geopotential height. Another interesting feature of the 2006 El Nino was the low predictability for the event itself. Analysis of multi-model predictions collected and provided by the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, reveals that multiple phases of the 2006 event was poorly predicted, including the initiation and termination.\nA detailed analysis of multiple variables representing key oceanic and atmospheric variability is presented to discuss the evolution of an Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Nino during this year. In particular we focus on the robust and large-scale development of intense sea surface height and temperature anomalies at the eastern Indian Ocean during early June. Coupled convective variability rapidly develops leading to a strong IOD event that lasts from late May to December. Temporal analysis of the evolving El Nino shows that it lags the IOD by several months. Further analysis shows that strong and persistent westerly winds extending into the western Pacific warm pool were initiated and sustained by the anomalously high pressure region over the eastern Indian Ocean and the maritime continent in response to the abnormally weak convective activity in the region. These winds are noted to be steady on an interannual timescale and marked by the absence of notable intraseasonal activity. We argue that the initiation of the El Nino event was driven by these abnormal westerly winds which triggered the displacement of warm subsurface waters into the eastern Pacific through free oceanic Kelvin waves. As coupled convective variability is weak over the tropical Pacific during the El Nino episode, we argue that the event was by and large controlled by the equatorial teleconnections generated and sustained by the IOD event.",

A specific highlight is the thousands of students surveyed in regards to their knowledge gain, attitudes, and interest in science learning. Additionally, longitudinal studies expose the myriad of ways that the PolarTREC program influences teachers and their practice many years after program completion. The findings influence and shape the program every year, nearly perfecting the strategy for communicating climate change science to audiences around the world.\nThis presentation will present the social science research findings in our extensive evaluation and provide best practices for program structure as well as evaluation methods to best capture the impact on audiences beyond participants.",

The interaction between the heating wave and the probing pulse depends on the ambient and modified conditions of the D-region ionosphere. Cross-modulation observations are employed as a measure of the HF-modified refractive index. We employ an optimized version of Fejer's method that we developed during previous experiments. Experiments were performed in March 2013 at the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) observatory in Gakona, Alaska. During these experiments, the power of the HF heating signal incrementally increased in order to determine the dependence of cross-modulation on HF power. We found that a simple power law relationship does not hold at high power levels, similar to previous ELF/VLF wave generation experiments. In this paper, we critically compare these experimental observations with the predictions of a numerical ionospheric HF heating model and demonstrate close agreement.",

            "abstract": "Global climate change is an increasingly important driver of changes in the biogeograpraphy of vegetation. Such changes have primarily been characterized by gradual shifts in species distribution; however, major disturbances acting in concert with climate change may result in a sudden ‘jump’ in biogeographical distribution. This study examines the effects of wildfire on forest composition along an environmental gradient in the eastern Cascade Mountains of Central Washington, USA. A previous study by Camp et al. (1997) examined three drainages in this complex mountainous landscape to identify and characterize historic wildfire refugia based on topographic characteristics and forest age and species composition. These drainages subsequently burned in the 2012 Table Mountain and Peavine Canyon fires. In 2014 the Camp et al. plots were re-established and re-sampled to (1) assess burn severity using the Composite Burn Index (CBI) protocol and (2) assess fire effects upon the individual trees in each study plot. Remotely sensed imagery classified using the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) indicated these fires burned more intensely than historical fires in the region, providing a potential harbinger of future fire severity under climate change. Analysis of burn severity revealed that the fire burned across the entire environmental gradient of the drainages, with no significant difference in burn occurrence or burn severity between refugial and non-refugial plots as designated by Camp et al.; this suggests that historical wildfire refugia may no longer prove sustainable in an era of climate change. Additionally, trees characteristic of warmer and drier climates experienced lower fire mortality than trees typical of cooler and moister climates. If future reseeding and recruitment in the forest favors more xeric tree species, the 2012 fires may prove to be the disturbance event that precipitates a ‘jump’ in the biogeographic distribution of trees in these drainages.",

            "abstract": "Isoprene is the dominant hydrocarbon emitted by plants to the atmosphere with an approximate global emission of 550 Tg C yr-1. Isoprene emission studies have elucidated plants’ isoprene production capacity, and the controlling factors of instantaneous emissions. However, it is not yet well understood how long-term climatic factors such as drought and increasing ozone concentrations affect isoprene emission rates. Drought reduces photosynthetic activity and is thus expected to reduce isoprene emission rate, since isoprene production relies on photosynthates. On the other hand, ozone is also known to negatively affect photosynthesis rates, but can instead increase isoprene emissions. These apparent inconsistencies and a lack of experimental data make it difficult to accurately parameterize isoprene emission responses to changing environmental conditions. The objective of this work is to reduce some of these uncertainties, using oak seedlings as a study system.\nOur project focuses on isoprene emission responses of oak trees to typical summer drought and high ozone conditions in Texas. We report on experiments conducted using a laboratory whole-plant chamber and leaf-level data obtained from greenhouse-grown seedlings. The chamber experiment studied the effects of ozone and drought on isoprene emissions from >3 year old oak seedlings under controlled conditions of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), temperature, soil-moisture and the chamber’s air composition. Stress in plants was induced by manipulating potted soil-moisture and ozone concentration in the chamber. The greenhouse study focused on understanding the effects of drought under Texas climatic conditions. For this study we used two year old seedlings of water oak (Quercus nigra) and post oak (Quercus stellata). Temperature, humidity and light in the greenhouse followed local conditions. Leaf-level conductance, photosynthesis measurements and isoprene sampling were carried out under controlled leaf temperature and PAR. The only variable manipulated was the water added to the plants. Seedling isoprene and other VOC emissions were identified and quantified using GC-FID techniques. The results of our work may allow for an improved parameterization of isoprene emissions in VOC inventories, particularly for Texas.",

            "abstract": "During November 2011, three M≥5.0 earthquakes and thousands of aftershocks occurred on and near the Wilzetta fault, a structurally complex ~200 km long, Pennsylvanian-aged fault near Prague, Oklahoma, in close proximity to several active wastewater injection wells. All three M≥5.0 earthquakes had strike-slip mechanisms consistent with rupture on three independent focal planes, suggesting activation of three different strands of the Wilzetta fault.\nWastewater injection can cause a buildup of pore ﬂuid pressure along the fault, which decreases the fault strength and may induce earthquakes. Based on the proximity of earthquakes to active ﬂuid injection wells, the unilateral progression of aftershocks away from the initial M5.0 event, and shallow earthquake depths, Keranen et al. [2013] concluded that fluid injection was responsible for inducing the first M5.0 event. Furthermore, Sumy et al. [2014] found that the initial M5.0 event increased the Coulomb stress in the region of the M5.7 mainshock, triggering a cascade of earthquakes along the Wilzetta fault. Thus, while nearby wastewater injection directly induced the initial M5.0 event, this earthquake triggered successive failure along the Wilzetta fault; however, it remains unclear if the additional ruptured fault strands are also influenced by fluid injection.\nIn this study, we explore instrumental ground motions and shear-wave splitting of the November 2011 Prague, Oklahoma sequence, in order to construct ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) and understand the local stress regime, respectively. We examine ~1,000 earthquakes recorded by a total of 47 seismometers, located within ~150 km of the Wilzetta fault. With respect to GMPEs, initial results suggest that the ground motions are smaller than similar magnitude earthquakes of natural/tectonic origins, and these lower intensities may be a result of lower stress drops [e.g. Hough, 2014]. With respect to shear-wave splitting, we examine quality graded fast polarization and delay time measurements and observe fast directions oriented roughly E-W across the study area, which is consistent with the maximum principal stress of N80E determined from the focal mechanism inversion of Sumy et al. [2014].",

            "abstract": "Earthquake data recorded during two ocean-bottom-seismometer (OBS) deployments on the continental slope off New York and Southern New England are used to evaluate micro-seismicity and attenuation of the continental margin. The deployments were partly motivated by the detection by land seismometers of several ML2.5-3.8 continental margin earthquakes in this region during the previous four years. The data come from a five-month-long cluster deployment (1 km radius) of eleven short-period OBS in July 2012 at a water depth of ~835 m and a subsequent nine-month deployment of a network of five short-period OBS spaced 50 km apart at water depths between 900-2400 m. The land-based seismic network did not identify seismic activity on the margin during the two deployments. The OBS network located only one earthquake of ML~1 near the shelf edge, suggesting that seismic activity of the margin is probably successfully monitored by land seismometers. A successful land-based detection of earthquakes on the margin may indicate that low seismic attenuation extends from the Eastern U.S. to the continental shelf and slope. To better quantify the attenuation of the margin we derive the peak spectral attenuation of 6-8 ML2.8-4.1 earthquakes recorded by the OBS during the two deployments. These earthquakes were located on land close to shore and offshore between New Jersey and Nova Scotia, and propagation paths are almost entirely within the continental margin. Onshore earthquakes of ML ≤2.6 were not detected by the OBS. Information about the seismicity and attenuation of the margin will be used to evaluate the probability of earthquake-generated landslides.",

            "abstract": "The US Geological Survey (USGS) Geospatial Fabric (GF) supports the USGS National Hydrologic Model (NHM) by defining a minimally sufficient, nationally consistent set of geographic information needed to simulate streamflow at almost 60,000 points of interest (POIs). POIs primarily are defined based on: (a) a high quality set of USGS stream gages (Gages-II), (b) National Weather Service forecast nodes, (c) the USGS National Water Quality Assessment’s modeling network, (d) at inlets and outlets of selected water bodies, and (e) at confluences. Each POI is associated with a stream segment which typically has two adjacent land surface areas, referred to as hydrologic response units (HRUs). Parameter tables, largely based on the National Land Cover Databases, the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), and the geometry of the spatial data, have been derived for these features. Configurations of GF features and attribute tables are defined and made available through the USGS ScienceBase (https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/537b7327e4b0929ba496f66f). Data are organized into 20 ESRI file geodatabases, each covering a different region of the United States (\nhttps://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/535edb4ae4b08e65d60fc837\n). Future releases will include additional realizations of NHM parameter tables. These will serve to assess the impact of alternate data sources and processing methodologies on simulated streamflows. Tools for dynamically subsetting geodatabases and model inputs based on custom watersheds are currently being prototyped. The GF is a versatile framework for data integration because it maintains feature-level indexing back to NHDPlus and the National Hydrography Dataset, which is used in many water resource studies. In addition, the GF will help to ensure a minimum initial quality of parameter information, reduce the time of developing hydrological modeling applications in the United States, and generally improve the accuracy and scientific impact of USGS hydrological modeling.",

We deployed 454 (Site M0059) and 297 (site M0060) 8-cc discrete samples at approximately every 50 cm down-core from inside the respective site splices. The magnetic susceptibility (X) of the total of 751 samples was normalized to wet sample mass. We also performed stepwise alternating field demagnetization (AF) of the NRM up to a maximum field of 80 mT and the results show that the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) was isolated by a series of weak AF’s, typically between 0–25 mT, and that a low field of 5 mT removed weak VRM. After the removal of the VRM overprint the NRM intensity of the two sites is characterized by a general positive relationship with (X). The inclination data from both sites show positive and negative inclination values with a certain degree of scattering around 0°. At Site M0059 the upper lithologic units show inclinations that vary within 10 degrees either side of the geoaxial dipole prediction (GAD) for this location. In contrast the inclinations of Site M0060 show greater variability: only a few of the samples from the lower units approach this site’s GAD prediction, although the inclination values in the upper lithologic units are closer to the GAD prediction. Measurements of the temperature dependence of bulk susceptibility (k-T) indicate the presence of at three magnetic mineral phases, which display characteristic Curie point temperatures of 360-400°C, 520 and 575°C for both sites and an additional Curie temperature of 610°C for Site M0060. We have obtained four 14C radiometric age determinations from 4 different stratigraphic levels at site 59A. These dates range in age from 4100+/-100 to 810+/-60 years and allow us to correlate the directional data to the FENNOSTACK regional master curve (Snowball et al. 2007). An interval of relatively steep inclinations between approximately 18 m and 16 m depth in Site M0060 probably corresponds to the period of steep inclination experienced in Fennsocandia between 3090 and 2590 Cal. a BP, which is delimited by inclination features e and e1, respectively, in FENNOSTACK.",

These distinct distal lake layers occur as closely spaced couplets which retain the subtle geochemical variation that characterises the proximal Glacier Peak G and B layers. New radiocarbon dates for the tephras also closely corroborate the most recently revised proximal dates for the tephras (ca. 13,700 – 13,400 cal. yr B.P) which found that they are ca. 400 14C yr older than hitherto thought. Their presence this far eastward implies that their deposition spans the intervening continent (>4000 km) and adds to a developing distal tephrostratigraphical framework with applications to studies of latest Pleistocene deglaciation and environmental change, megafaunal extinction and archaeology.",

            "abstract": "Studies of tropospheric ozone trends over the southern African Highveld in the 1990-2007 period present a paradox. We used monthly averaged surface ozone data from 5 South African monitoring stations east of Johannesburg in a linear regression model to show that the cycles associated with the El Niño/La Niña make a considerable contribution to interannual ozone variability through perturbations in cloud cover, temperature and precipitation that interact with photochemistry (see Figure). During El Niño periods, typically sunnier and drier, summertime ozone is enhanced, whereas wetter, cloudier conditions of a La Niña are associated with lower ozone. Interestingly, the 5 stations show very little evidence of a statistically significant trend from 1990 through 2007. Over the same time period, the regression model shows that free tropospheric ozone, from 5-11 km, taken from monthly averaged SHADOZ (Southern Hemisphere ADditional OZonesondes) and MOZAIC (Measurement of Ozone and Water Vapour on Airbus in-service Aircraft) profiles, increased significantly (+20-25%/decade) in late autumn and early winter (May-July). There is also a positive ozone trend near the tropopause in summer (Nov.-Dec.) but none during the oft-studied months of biomass fires (Sept.-Oct.). It is difficult to interpret the seemingly contradictory trends in terms of emissions of ozone precursors that are not well characterized over the Highveld and larger southern African region. However, we ran a series of back-trajectories at 500 and 300 hPa to coincide with the profile sampling times in May-August 1990-2007. Regional contributions are implicated by recirculation in the Johannesburg region. Trajectories also point to long-range transport from the greater African continent, south Atlantic and South America, all known regions of high ozone and in the case of South America, growing pollution from emerging mega-cities.",

            "abstract": "Converted P-to-S phases from velocity discontinuities are widely used to investigate layered crustal and mantle structure beneath a seismic station. However, strong reverberations in unconsolidated or poorly consolidated sediments frequently mask the converted phases from deeper crustal and upper-mantle boundaries. Such reverberations are believed to be caused by the converted P-to-S phase between the sedimentary and basement layers. Here we proposed and tested an approach to effectively remove reverberations associated with the sedimentary layer. Synthetic receiver functions (RFs) are produced for a model with a thin sedimentary layer overlying a consolidated basement. Auto-correlation is firstly conducted on each of the synthetic RFs to determine the strength and period of the reverberation. A frequency domain resonance-removal filter is then applied to remove the reverberations. The P-to-S converted phases and their multiples from the Moho are clearly observed on the resulting RFs. The RFs are then time-corrected to remove the effects of the sedimentary layer, and the thickness and Vp/Vs of the consolidated crust are determined using the corrected RFs. Finally, the resulting crustal thickness and Vp/Vs are used as input parameters in a grid-search procedure for the thickness and Vp/Vs of the sedimentary layer. Testing using synthetic data demonstrates that this technique is efficient in resolving seismic structure beneath stations sitting on a layer of loose sediment. The efficiency and validity of this method are further examined by processing teleseismic data recorded at station NE68, which is located in the Songliao Basin in northeast China. The resulting sedimentary and crustal structures are consistent with those obtained by Tao et al. (2014) based on the wavefield downward continuation and decomposition method.",

            "abstract": "This work, carried out with an integrated methodological approach, describes the acquisition of gravity data and their integration with different geophysical techniques, in order to map and model the thickness of unconsolidated deposits and determine the bedrock configuration of two different intra-mountain plains: Leonessa plain (hereafter LP) and Rieti plain (hereafter RP).\nThe LP and the RP, the test areas of this study, are typical intra-mountain depressions of Center Apennines, related to the Plio-Quaternary extensional tectonic. Both basins are characterized by thick Quaternary fluvial-lacustrine deposits (gravel, sand and clay) overlaying the Meso-Cenozoic pelagic basin deposits.\nOn the LP, the study involved an area of 62 km2 occupied by 333 gravity stations. Instead, on the RP, the study area, of 35 km2, were occupied by 170 gravity stations. The gravity data resulted from the network adjustment were used to calculate the Bouguer anomaly map. Subtracting the regional field from the Bouguer anomaly produced the residual anomaly map.\nIn order to determine the distribution of the sedimentary infill, a 2D gravity modeling was developed in the region, including five profiles in the case study of LP and six profiles in the case study of RP. A realistic density of the unconsolidated Quaternary deposits (1.75-2,00 g/cm3 in the case of LP and 2,15 g/cm3 in the case of RP), a density of 2.50 g/cm3 for the Travertine and a density of 2.60 g/cm3 for the Meso-Cenozoic pelagic basin deposits were used to constrain the 2D gravimetric models. The models match quite well with the information determined from a collection of existing well logs and geophysical data obtained by the ambient noise, MASW and Downhole measurements.\nFinally, referring to these models, we were able to evaluate the thickness of the Quaternary sedimentary infilling and to define the 3D bedrock configuration of the basins. These 3D models represent a useful starting point for future activities such as microzonation or seismic hazard studies.",

            "abstract": "Natural methane emissions from the Arctic present an important potential feedback to global warming. Arctic methane emissions may come from either active microbial sources or from deep fossil reservoirs released by the thawing of permafrost and melting of glaciers. It is often difficult to distinguish between and quantify contributions from these methane sources based on stable isotope data. Analyses of methane clumped isotopes (isotopologues with two or more rare isotopes such as 13CH3D) can complement traditional stable isotope-based classifications of methane sources. This is because clumped isotope abundances (for isotopically equilibrated systems) are a function of temperature and can be used to identify pathways of methane generation. Additionally, distinctive effects of mixing on clumped isotope abundances make this analysis valuable for determining the origins of mixed gasses.\nWe find large variability in clumped isotope compositions of methane from seeps in several lakes, including thermokarst lakes, across Alaska. At Lake Sukok in northern Alaska we observe the emission of dominantly thermogenic methane, with a formation temperature of at least 100° C. At several other lakes we find evidence for mixing between thermogenic methane and biogenic methane that forms in low-temperature isotopic equilibrium. For example, at Eyak Lake in southeastern Alaska, analysis of three methane samples results in a distinctive isotopic mixing line between a high-temperature end-member that formed between 100-170° C, and a biogenic end-member that formed in isotopic equilibrium between 0-20° C. In this respect, biogenic methane in these lakes resembles observations from marine gas seeps, oil degradation, and sub-surface aquifers. Interestingly, at Goldstream Lake in interior Alaska, methane with strongly depleted clumped-isotope abundances, indicative of disequilibrium gas formation, is found, similar to observations from methanogen culture experiments.",

            "abstract": "New geochemical analyses of volcanic rocks in El Salvador add to existing data from Nicaragua and Costa Rica to create a comprehensive set of geochemical data for Central American volcanics. These data coupled with previously published 40Ar/39Ar ages covering the past 30 Ma shows that Costa Rica and Nicaragua had similar U/Th and Ba/La values until 10 Ma when the region developed the distinctive along arc variations that made this margin famous. U/Th values increased in Nicaragua since the Miocene, while remaining unchanged along the rest of the volcanic front. This coincides temporally with the Carbonate Crash, which caused a transition in Cocos plate sediments from low-U carbonates to high-U, organic rich hemipelagic muds. Increases in uranium are not observed in Costa Rica because its lower slab dip produces a more diffuse zone of partial melting and because of the contribution from Galapagos-derived tracks dilutes this signal. Ba/La has been used as a geochemical proxy for contributions from the subducting slab, however our analyses indicate that the Ba concentrations do not vary significantly along strike either in the subducting sediment or the volcanic front. Along-arc variation is controlled by changes in La, an indicator of the degree of partial melting or source enrichment. Trace element models of five segments of the volcanic front suggest that a subducting sediment component is more important to magmas produced in El Salvador and Nicaragua than in Costa Rica, where the geochemistry is controlled by recent (<10 Ma) recycling of Galapagos tracks.",

            "abstract": "It is now well known that the Voyager 1 spacecraft crossed the heliopause into interstellar space in late August 2012. A key observation supporting this conclusion was the detection of electron plasma oscillations in October-November 2012, and again in April-May 2013. These observations showed the local electron density was consistent with the expected density of the local interstellar plasma. Such plasma oscillations are believed to be excited by electron beams originating from shocks associated with global merged interaction regions (GMIRs) propagating outward from the Sun. Now, another series of plasma oscillation events has been observed starting in early February 2014, and continuing to the present time (late July 2014). These events show a clear association with changes in the cosmic ray intensities and anisotropies that are suggestive of a solar disturbance propagating outward through the interstellar plasma. The interpolated radial density profile inferred from these and the previous plasma oscillations shows that after crossing the heliopause the electron density increased rapidly from 0.055 cm-3 in late October 2012, at 122 AU, to a broad maximum of about 0.090 to 0.095 cm-3 in July-August 2013, at about 125 AU, followed by a slow decrease to about 0.085 cm-3 in the most recent data, at 128 AU. This density profile is consistent with a large-scale compression (i.e., pileup) of the interstellar plasma near the nose of the heliosphere, together with a smaller scale plasma depletion layer immediately adjacent to the heliopause, as suggested by Fuselier and Cairns [2013].",

The basin is located in the semiarid central region of the country and, aside from the typical pressures of growth in developing country basins, the Maipo river faces climate change impacts associated with a reduction in total runoff and changes in its seasonality. Surface water is the main water source for human settlements and economic activities including agriculture.\nIn 2012 we started a research project to create a climate variability and climate change adaptation plan for the basin. The pillars of the plan are co-produced by researchers and a Scenario Building Team (SBT) with membership of relevant water and land use stakeholders (including from civil society, public and private sectors) in the basin. Following similar experiences in other regions in the world that have faced the challenges of dealing with long term planning under uncertainty, the project has divided the task of developing the plan into a series of interconnected elements. A critical first component is to work on the desired vision(s) of the basin for the future. In this regards, the “water security” concept has been chosen as a framework that accommodates all objectives of the SBT members. Understanding and quantifying the uncertainties that could affect the future water security of the basin is another critical aspect of the plan. Near and long term climate scenarios are one dimension of these uncertainties that are combined with base development uncertainties such as urban growth scenarios. A third component constructs the models/tools that allows the assessment of impacts on water security that could arise under these scenarios. The final critical component relates to the development of the adaptation measures that could avoid the negative impacts and/or capture the potential opportunities. After two years in the development of the adaptation plan a series of results has been achieved in all critical components that are presented here. The success in the process now poses a series of new challenges, most importantly: how to implement and monitor the evolution of the adaptation process.",

Low flows in Hawaii streams provide a variety of beneficial uses that include maintaining fish habitat, supplying freshwater for irrigation and domestic uses, and protecting traditional and customary Hawaiian rights. However, the variability of low flows in ungaged streams in Hawaii has not been quantified and potential effects of climate change on low flows need to be better understood to properly manage surface-water resources. Regionalization of streamflow for ungaged areas in Hawaii provides a useful case study because streamflow, climate, and basin characteristics are extremely spatially and temporally variable. Here we present the development of statistical models to estimate low flows of ungaged streams in Hawaii for past and future rainfall conditions. We discuss the benefits and limitations of applying simple statistical approaches to improve understanding of changes in low flows in heterogeneous and data poor regions and to explicitly evaluate uncertainty and data needs in the context of climate change predictions for regional water-resources management.",

Stakeholders’ engagement evaluation plan must be based on the timing and available resources of the mining company, understanding the goals for the engagement, and on analyzes of the possible risks from engagement.\nIn conclusion, the Stakeholders engagement evaluation plan includes: first, determinations of the stakeholders list, which must include any interested or effected by the mine projects groups, for example: state and local government representatives, people from local communities, business partners, environmental NGOs, indigenous people, and academic groups. The contacts and availability for communication is critical for Stakeholders engagement. Next, is to analyze characteristics of all these parties and determinate the level of interest and level of their influence on the project. The next step includes the Stakeholders matrix and mapping development, where all these information will be put together.After that, must be chosen the methods for stakeholders’ engagement. The methods usually depends from the goals of engagement (create the dialog lines, collect the data, determinations of the local issues and concerns, or establish the negotiation process) and available resources as a time, people, budget. Is it very important here to recognize the possible risks from the engagement and establish the key massage for stakeholders. Finally, the engagement plan should be evaluated and can be implementing for the new social responsibility practice development.",

            "abstract": "Most subduction trenches retreat, not only today but throughout the Cenozoic. However, a few trenches clearly advance during part of the evolution, including Izu-Bonin Marianas (IBM) and Kermadec. Trench retreat is well understood as a basic consequence of slab pull, but it is debated what causes trench advance. The IBM trench underwent a complex evolution: right after its initiation, it rotated clockwise, leading to very fast retreat in the north and slow retreat in the south. But since 10-15 Ma, IBM trench motions have switched to advance at the southern end, and since 5 Ma also the northern end is advancing. Based on 2-D subduction models, it has been proposed proposed that the change in age of the subducting plate at the IBM trench (from 40-70 m.y. at the initiation of the trench 45 m.y. ago to 100-140 m.y. lithosphere subducting at the trench today) and its effect on plate strength could explain the transition from trench retreat to trench advance, and that the age gradient (younger in the north and older in the south) could explain the rotation of the trench. However, with new 3-D coupled fluid-solid subduction model where we can include such lateral age gradients, we find that this does not yield the observed behaviour. Instead, we propose an alternative mechanism, involving the subduction of the buoyant Caroline Island Ridge at the southern edge of the Mariana trench and show that it can explain both trench motion history and the current morphology of the IBM slab as imaged by seismic tomography.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic Tomography (HT) is a robust aquifer characterization method that is capable of providing high-resolution mapping of hydraulic conductivity and specific storage distributions or tomograms. This method is particularly cost-effective to recalcitrant sites where existing pump-and-treat system and monitoring network can be utilized. The high-resolution tomograms generated can provide critical information for targeted in-situ remediation of potential source zones and optimization of existing remediation strategies. In addition, zones for potential back diffusion can be identified.\nConducting HT surveys in operating pump-and-treat sites with complex hydrogeologic conditions requires special considerations. The design of the experiment has to be compatible to site-specific constraints. For example, a minimum total pumping rate may have to be met for the treatment facility to function. Many of the existing monitoring wells may not have been designed for HT surveys and have very long screen intervals. Using our current work at a Department of Defense site with more than twenty candidate extraction and injection wells, as well as over a hundred available monitoring wells as an example, we discuss our implementation strategy, and the HT analysis modifications to cope with these constrains. Lessons learnt from this work provide guidance on future implementation considerations of HT at recalcitrant environmental sites.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing society today. Assessing the impact of increasing temperatures and changing precipitation regimes on our ecosystems heavily relies on our ability to monitor and model changes in ecosystem response. At the same time, understanding how ecosystem changes feed back to the climate system greatly depends on our capability of measuring and modeling turbulent flux exchanges of energy, water, and carbon between the land surface and atmosphere. Accurately quantifying these land surface turbulent fluxes at hillslope and small catchment scales is challenging. This is due to difficulties in closing energy and mass balances at such scales, as well as heterogeneities that exist at larger spatial scales as a result of small-scale variations in soil moisture, soil and vegetation characteristics, and energy distribution. The current generation of land surface models (LSMs) for use in Earth System Models (ESMs) operate at even larger spatial scales due to lack of sufficient computing power and data availability of land surface characteristics. Improving our understanding of how small-scale variations in land surface properties and states affect large-scale turbulent fluxes is urgently needed to improve existing parameterizations adopted in LSMs. For this purpose, observational facilities at different spatial scales and with different degrees of control are needed. At Biosphere 2 of the University of Arizona, we recently expanded the monitoring capabilities of the Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO), to be able to: (1) accurately measure land surface fluxes of water, energy and carbon at the hillslope scale; (2) quantify small-scale variability of these fluxes across a moderately complex landscape; (3) analyze these small-scale observations of below- and aboveground processes to understand how they interact and feed back to induce large-scale fluxes; and (4) develop new parameterization schemes that account for sub-grid variability of observable land surface states and properties to predict turbulent fluxes at the hillslope scale from aggregated surface states, such as soil moisture. This presentation will provide an overview of the above-ground instrumentation as well as show early results of water and energy balance monitoring and modeling.",

            "abstract": "Trace amounts of water in the nominally anhydrous minerals of the upper mantle can drastically affect mantle properties. The presence of water reduces viscosity and causes melting at lower temperatures, both of which weaken the rock hosting the water. We investigate the relationship between water content, deformation, and olivine LPO in an upper mantle shear zone in the Josephine Peridotite of SW Oregon. Previous work in the Josephine focused on two shear zones, showing that water concentrations were higher in the centers of shear zones compared to the edges. This study focuses on a previously unanalyzed shear zone (Shear Zone A; SZA) that reaches a maximum strain of 64 with accompanying grain size reduction to ~200 μm from ~2 mm.\nElectron backscatter diffraction was performed on a transect of samples from the edge of the shear zone to the core. As strain increases, the olivine LPO evolves from a pre-existing orientation to a Type E slip system (slip on the (001) plane in the [100] direction). Olivine [100] axes are tilted past the shear plane at high strain, consistent with previous observations, though rotated to a higher angle (30°) than previously observed.\nWater concentrations in opx were measured and used to predict olivine concentrations in the same transect assuming an olivine/opx partition coefficient of 0.11. Opx in the core of SZA has ~200 ppm H2O, which corresponds to olivine with ~22 ppm H2O (~360 ppm H/Si). This low water is unexpected as the Type E LPO is usually associated with higher water contents. In addition, the transect shows that the center of the shear zone has a low water content compared to the rest of the shear zone. This is also unexpected as higher water was predicted to localize deformation; instead, the lowest water contents are found where the degree of deformation is highest. Hypotheses to explain this behavior include: a) melt formation in the center of the shear zone due to shear heating, followed by extraction, b) water content decreasing as a function of deformation due to recrystallization, and c) interacting shear zones leading to unusual water gradients over the small range of current samples.",

            "abstract": "The North American Craton, now forming the stable core of North America, has a long, eventful tectonic history. The assembly of the craton, collisions and accretion at its current boundaries, major rifting episodes within it, and the loss of ancient lithosphere beneath parts of it are type examples of these key components of cratonic dynamics and evolution. Seismic tomography offers rich evidence on the structure and evolution of the cratonic lithosphere. With the deployment of the USArray during the last decade, much of the North American continent has been densely sampled with broadband seismic data. The resolution of regional-scale imaging, however, remains uneven, with important questions regarding deep structure, lateral extent and evolution difficult to answer. Here we present a new high-resolution model of the upper mantle beneath North America constrained by waveform fits of over 700,000 vertical-component broadband seismograms. Automated multimode waveform inversion was used to extract structural information from surface and S waveforms, yielding resolving power from the crust down to the transition zone, and improved resolution for a variety of features in North America.\nThe internal structure of the Craton is resolved in detail. The lithosphere surrounding the 1 Ga failed Mid-Continental Rift shows reduced wavespeeds compared to the surrounding craton, likely indicating thermo-chemical alteration of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle. The sharp northern boundaries of the cratonic lithosphere closely follow the coastlines, with North America’s and Greenland’s lithospheric roots clearly separated. Strong lateral velocity gradients at depth observed in western Canada indicate the transition from cratonic lithosphere to Cordillera closely follows the surface trace of the Deformation Front. On the eastern margin of the continent, where multiple episodes of continental rifting are superimposed, the craton boundary coincides with the western extent of the Appalachian orogenic front, with significantly lower lateral velocity gradients than in the west. Finally, high velocities between the Great Bear Arc and Beaufort Sea provide convincing evidence for the recently proposed ‘MacKenzie Craton’, unexposed at the surface.",

            "abstract": "Pyrrhotite has been known for several decades to have anomalous demagnetization behavior when using tumbling AF techniques. This was quantified by Thomson (1990) to show that pyrrhotite can acquire rotational remanent magnetization (RRM) similar to the more intensely-studied iron sulfide, greigite. Use of RRM as an identification tool in natural samples has not become standard practice, perhaps due to the decrease in use of tumbling AF techniques. However, using the 2G SQuID magnetometer with in-line AF/ARM coils and RAPID automated protocols (Kirschvink et al. 2008), one can easily produce and measure RRM. This method of measuring RRM has been used to identify greigite (Suzuki et al. 2006), but not pyrrhotite. We present room temperature RRM measurements for samples spinning from -20 to +20 rev/sec, perpendicular to peak AF fields of 90mT (at 950 Hz) in iron-sulfide-bearing shales, argillites, and carbonates throughout Earth History (Miocene, Cretaceous, Mesoproterozoic, Late Archean). Presence of pyrrhotite was confirmed using AF demagnetization of NRM (GRM), IRM acquisition/AF demagnetization (Cisowski plots), Kappabridge thermal susceptibility, ultra-high resolution scanning SQuID microscopy (UHRSSM), and/or X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES)/multiple energy X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging. Although the total absence of pyrrhotite cannot be proven, the same techniques were applied to rocks that do not gain RRM easily to identify their iron sulfides and ferromagnetic minerals, and no magnetic iron sulfides were found. The RRM signal for pyrrhotite is distinct from that of greigite, suggesting it could be used as a tool for distinguishing these magnetic iron sulfides from each other. Further work on room temperature RRM could define a unique non-destructive rock magnetic test for pyrrhotite.",

            "abstract": "The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an important driver of regional hydroclimate variability through far-reaching teleconnections. Most climate models project an increase in the frequency of extreme El Niño events under increased greenhouse-gas (GHG) forcing. However, it is unclear how other aspects of ENSO and ENSO-driven teleconnections will evolve in the future. Here, we identify in 20th century sea-surface temperature (SST) observations a time-invariant ENSO-like (ENSOL) pattern that is largely uncontaminated by GHG forcing. We use this pattern to investigate the future precipitation (P) response to ENSO-like SST anomalies. Models that better capture observed ENSOL characteristics produce P teleconnection patterns that are in better accord with observations and more stationary in the 21st century. We decompose the future P response to ENSOL into the sum of three terms: (1) the change in P mean state, (2) the historical P response to ENSOL, and (3) a future enhancement in the P response to ENSOL. In many regions, this last term can aggravate the P extremes associated with ENSO variability. This simple decomposition allows us to identify regions likely to experience ENSOL-induced P changes that are without precedent in the current climate.

            "abstract": "Globally, subduction zones are region associated with earthquakes and volcanic activities, both involving risk to local populations. These processes are intimately related to the thermodynamic stability and instabilty of hydrous phases that are subducted with the down going slab. These phases sequestrate several wt % of water in their crystallographic structure and can account for significant proportion of the hydrogen budget of the upper mantle , transition zone and perhaps the top of the lower mantle. In order to quantify the degree of mantle hydration, we need to have a good understanding of the elastic properties of layered hydrous phases, the effects of temperature, and pressure and relate them to seismological observables, such as the velocity and its anisotropy.\nUsing first principle simulations, we have investigated several layered hydrous phases, including the important minerals antigorite, talc, and chlorite. These results are complementary to the recent experimental Brillouin Scattering results at ambient conditions. Based on the full elastic constant tensor we note that these hydrous phases have significant shear wave anisotropy and often have unusual pressure dependence of the anisotropy. Together with elasticity data, thermodynamic predictions of phase stability and experimental plastic deformation studies it is apparent that these layered hydrous phases could account for the large delay times observed in certain subduction zone settings, such as Ryukyu trench.\nAcknowledgement-\nMM is supported by the US National Science Foundation grant (EAR-1250477).

Understanding how monsoons will change with changing climate is of pressing societal importance, and yet remains a challenge: Numerous studies have explored the impact of global warming on monsoons, but many questions remain unanswered.\nIn this study, we perform experiments with an idealized General Circulation Model (GCM) to investigate the response of an idealized monsoon to climate change. We focus on two idealized continental geometries, an Africa-like continent stretching from pole to pole with a fixed longitudinal width, and an Asia-like continent that spans all longitudes north of 10°N. The climate is varied by perturbing the atmospheric longwave absorber, in analogy to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. We use the moist static energy, moisture and zonal momentum budgets (e.g., Chou et al. 2001, Bordoni and Schneider 2008) to interpret the simulated changes in monsoon onset, circulation strength and precipitation. Each budget is decomposed into mean, stationary and transient eddy fluxes, to explore the relative role of these circulations in the maintenance of the monsoonal precipitation. We specifically focus on how the distribution, both spatially and temporally, of precipitation changes as the climate is varied in the two different continental configurations.",

            "abstract": "Collecting sufficient amounts of natural methane sample for a high precision radiocarbon (14C-CH4) analysis was previously unfeasible when sampling from low methane concentration waters like the open ocean. A new method incorporating dissolved gas extraction technology (Liqui-Cel® membrane contactors) has been developed to circumvent the challenges that natural 14C-CH4 sampling presents. With this method, adequate amounts of methane-carbon for a traditional 14C-accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) analysis can be cleanly and efficiently extracted from 1000s L water in a few hours. This technique is currently being improved to enable sampling from > 11,000 L water in less than 1 hr. For transport from the field to the laboratory, each extracted gas sample is compressed into a small (1.68 L) high-pressure aluminum cylinder using an oil-free compressor pump. Due to the small size and portability of the sample cylinders, high resolution sampling plans composed of 30+ samples are possible even in remote locations. The laboratory preparation of these methane samples for 14C-AMS analyses is carried out on a new flow-through vacuum line. While the bulk water vapor and carbon dioxide (CO2) are removed before the sample is compressed in the field, the residual trace amounts of these constituents are cryogenically removed from the sample in the initial phase of the vacuum line. Carbon monoxide in the sample is quantitatively oxidized at 290°C to CO2 and cryogenically removed. Finally, the sample methane is quantitatively oxidized at 950°C to products CO2 and water and then cryogenically isolated. The new vacuum line technique achieves low blanks and purifies and oxidizes the methane contained in the extracted gas sample with high efficiency. At an AMS facility, an aliquot of the methane-produced CO2 is graphitized and analyzed for radiocarbon content using traditional 14C-AMS. Supporting dual-inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometry measurements are conducted to determine both the δ13C of the methane-produced CO2 and the δ2H of the methane-produced water.",

            "abstract": "Recent events in space, including the collision of Russia’s Cosmos 2251 satellite with Iridium 33 and China’s Feng Yun 1C anti-satellite demonstration, have stressed the capabilities of the Space Surveillance Network and its ability to provide accurate and actionable impact probability estimates. In particular low-Earth orbiting satellites are heavily influenced by upper atmospheric density, due to drag, which is very difficult to model accurately. This work focuses on the generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) technique for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in physics-based atmospheric models. The advantage of the gPC approach is that it can efficiently model non-Gaussian probability distribution functions (pdfs). The gPC approach is used to perform UQ on future atmospheric conditions. A number of physics-based models are used as test cases, including GITM and TIE-GCM, and the gPC is shown to have good performance in modeling non-Gaussian pdfs.\nLos Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has established a research effort, called IMPACT (Integrated Modeling of Perturbations in Atmospheres for Conjunction Tracking), to improve impact assessment via improved physics-based modeling. A number of atmospheric models exist which can be classified as either empirical or physics-based. Physics-based models can be used to provide a forward prediction which is required for accurate collision assessments. As part of this effort, accurate and consistent UQ is required for the atmospheric models used. One of the primary sources of uncertainty is input parameter uncertainty. These input parameters, which include F10.7, AP, and solar wind parameters, are measured constantly. In turn, these measurements are used to provide a prediction for future parameter values. Therefore, the uncertainty of the atmospheric model forecast, due to potential error in the input parameters, must be correctly characterized to estimate orbital uncertainty. Internal model parameters that model how the atmosphere is heated by the sun are not know exactly and therefore this work will look at the effects of these parameters on the uncertainty of the atmospheric model. Finally, geomagnetic storms have been shown to increase the uncertainty and this work will investigate the uncertainty response to geomagnetic storms.",

The associated source and observation data provide a basis for assessing current atmospheric models and estimating their contribution to infrasound detection and location. In this study, we utilize both seismic and acoustic data recorded at USArray Transportable Array (TA) stations and additional regional infrasound arrays in Utah and Nevada. Ground truth consists of a total of 25 rocket motor tests (static rocket motor burn tests) and 6 rocket motor demolitions in Utah for the time period from 2003 to 2013. Characteristics of infrasound signals generated by the rocket motor tests and rocket body demolitions are compared. The typical signal frequency band from the rocket motor tests is 5-10 Hz with durations of up to 60 seconds, while those from rocket body demolitions have relatively shorter durations (10 seconds) and lower frequencies (1-5 Hz). The distributions of stations that detect signals are quite variable in terms of both distance and azimuth and dependent on atmospheric conditions. Infrasound amplitudes document strong energy attenuation with range that must be quantified in order to assess the source strength. Ray tracing and parabolic equation (PE) modeling were conducted utilizing the ground-to-space (G2S) atmospheric specifications at the time of each event, in order to understand the predictability of the models and assess their utility in estimating amplitudes as a function of range. This unique dataset quantifies the contribution of temporal atmospheric conditions to infrasound detection and documents the predictive capabilities of current atmospheric model.",

            "abstract": "Model-based studies have suggested that changes may occur in hydrologic variables associated with increased probability of high precipitation occurrences, such as the 95th percentile of daily precipitation intensity. It has been common to discuss changes in extreme events in terms of consequences of the shift of the mean of the distribution, or an increase in variance. Here we present a prototype for the behavior of changes in the distribution of precipitation event size, i.e., of the precipitation integrated from onset to termination of an event. It has been noted in observations that event size distributions exhibit a scale-free, approximately power-law range with a cutoff at large event sizes (Peters et al, 2010). A simple stochastic model for an atmospheric column moisture budget shows how this behavior arises and how the cutoff is controlled by the physical parameters of the system. A simple set of conditions implies that the frequency of the very largest events may be expected to exhibit disproportionate sensitivity to changes. Any increase in the variance of the moisture convergence, as is projected to occur in the warmer climate, is predicted to yield changes in the very largest event-size portion of the distribution. Precipitation event size distributions computed from high time-resolution output from the Community Earth System Model appear to fit this prototype well in current climate, consistent with the form of observed event size distributions. In an ensemble of 15 simulations under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 for anthropogenic forcing increases, the very largest event portion of the distribution shows marked sensitivity, consistent with the simple prototype, with increases over most of the globe and strong regional increases. The theory suggests a set of conditions to evaluate for other climate quantities under which one should expect such sensitivity of probability of the very largest events.",

            "abstract": "Across the Himalayan orogen, high-grade Greater Himalayan (GH) rocks are juxtaposed between low-grade metasedimentary rocks, and the deformation mechanisms that led to their emplacement are debated. In this study, geologic mapping and microstructural analysis are utilized to understand the deformation conditions and exhumation path of GH rocks in northern Bhutan. Three north-south transects of GH rocks were mapped, corresponding to structural thicknesses of 11-15 km, and schist, paragneiss, and quartz veins were the main lithologies sampled and analyzed.\nQuantitative temperature estimates (~430°C, 545°C, 595°C, and 630°C) from quartz crystallographic preferred-orientation plot opening angles, collected from an electron backscatter diffraction detector on a scanning electron microscope, combined with semi-quantitative deformation temperature estimates obtained from cataloguing quartz recrystallization mechanisms in thin-section, show that GH rocks were initially deformed at temperatures between ~500-750°C, and were later overprinted by a lower-temperature (~400–500°C) recrystallization event. The higher-temperature event is interpreted to be associated with ca. 22–15 Ma displacement on the Main Central thrust, at or near peak metamorphic conditions. The lower-temperature overprint is interpreted to have occurred at a shallower point along the deformation path as GH rocks were exhumed, structurally-elevated, and passively translated southward, concurrent with ca. 18-10 Ma duplexing of Lesser Himalayan rocks.\nDuring the multiple stages of deformation, the GH rocks experienced a combination of pure- and simple-shear components of strain, as indicated by multiple outcrops that exhibit both top-to-the-north and top-to-the-south kinematic indicators. In addition, mean kinematic vorticity numbers, obtained from the oblique quartz shape-preferred orientation method, ranged from 0.61-0.94 (22-57% pure shear) during the higher-temperature event and 0.18-0.58 (60-88% pure shear) during the lower-temperature overprint. A significant pure-shear component observed on all three transects indicates that emplacement of GH rocks in Bhutan was accompanied by layer-normal flattening strain.",

            "abstract": "Crescent City, California has a long history of damaging tsunamis. Thirty-nine tsunamis have been recorded since 1933, including five that caused damage. Crescent City’s harbor and small boat basin are particularly vulnerable to strong currents. Humboldt State University has installed Acoustic Doppler Profilers (ADPs) in order to directly measure water pressure fluctuations and currents caused by tsunamis. An instrument in Humboldt Bay, ~100 km south of Crescent City, recorded tsunamis generated by the 2010 Mw 8.7 Chile and 2011 Mw 9.0 Japan earthquakes and demonstrated the usefulness of ADPs in measuring tsunami currents. In 2013, an ADP was deployed in Crescent City’s harbor adjacent to the NOAA tide gauge. On April 1, 2014, a Mw 8.2 earthquake occurred in northern Chile, producing a modest Pacific-wide tsunami and a 16 cm peak amplitude on the Crescent City tide gauge. We analyze the ADP data before and during the expected arrival of the April 2 tsunami to see if a tsunami signal is present. Tidal currents are generally small (5 cm/s or less). For two months before the tsunami, intermittent, high-frequency variability is present in velocity and pressure at periods on the order of 20, 9 and 5 min, which compare favorably to modal periods predicted using some simplified models of open-ended basins. For several hours after the tsunami arrival on April 2, spectral power levels in velocity and pressure around the 20 min period are notably enhanced. These results suggest that: (1) the observed periods of enhanced variability represent the first three modes (n=0, 1 and 2) of free oscillations in the harbor, (2) the dominant period of (non-tidal) oscillations observed during the April 2, 2014 tsunami (~20 min) and during previous tsunamis (e.g., the water level record for the March 11, 2011 tsunami; also ~20 min) represents harbor resonance corresponding to the lowest order mode, and (3) this event is very near the ADP limit of detectability with peak tsunami currents of 5-10 cm/s and higher frequency variability and instrument noise root-mean-squared amplitude of 4-5 cm/s.",

The radon content, groundwater level and rainfall show a positive correlation prior to the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes. The water radon concentrations change from one location to other which may be associated with the changes in ground water regime due to changes in stress regime and observed seismicity.

            "abstract": "Laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) can be used synergistically to characterize the geochemistry and mineralogy of potential microbial habitats and biosignatures. The value of LRS and LIBS has been recognized by the planetary science community: (i) NASA’s Mars2020 mission features a combined LRS-LIBS instrument, SuperCam, and an LRS instrument, SHERLOC; (ii) an LRS instrument, RLS, will fly on ESA’s 2018 ExoMars mission. The advantages of combining LRS and LIBS are evident: (1) LRS/LIBS can share hardware components; (2) LIBS reveals the relative concentration of major (and often trace) elements present in a sample; and (3) LRS yields information on the individual mineral species and their chemical/structural nature. Combining data from LRS and LIBS enables definitive mineral phase identification with precise chemical characterization of major, minor, and trace mineral species.\nNew approaches to data processing are needed to analyze large amounts of LRS+LIBS data efficiently and maximize the scientific return of integrated measurements. Multi-sensor data fusion (MSDF) is a method that allows for robust sample identification through automated acquisition, processing, and combination of data. It optimizes information usage, yielding a more robust characterization of a target than could be acquired through single sensor use. We have developed a prototype fuzzy logic adaptive MSDF model aimed towards the unsupervised characterization of Martian habitats and their biosignatures using LRS and LIBS datasets. Our model also incorporates fusion of microimaging (MI) data – critical for placing analyses in geological and spatial context. Here, we discuss the performance of our novel MSDF model and demonstrate that automated quantification of the salt abundance in sulfate/clay/phyllosilicate mixtures is possible through data fusion of collocated LRS, LIBS, and MI data.",

Real-time measurements of bed changes over a reach are a missing piece needed to link bed morphology with sediment transport processes during unsteady flows when the bed adjusts quickly to changing transport rates or visual observation of the bed is precluded by fine sediment in the water column. A bed load monitoring system (BLMS) was developed that records the sediment and water loads over discrete bed lengths throughout a flow event. It was designed for laboratory application where controlled measurement methods are possible. Upon data processing, the BLMS provides a continuous measure of the sediment load across the bed from which sediment movement rates through the reach, including areas of temporary aggradation or degradation, can be reconstructed.\nExamples are provided of how the bed load monitoring system has been applied during sediment feed and sediment recirculation experiments to further the interpretation of channel processes occurring during large flows. We detail the use of the BLMS to measure bed slopes during unsteady flows and to measure the movement of sediment downstream following different methods of dam removal. We evaluate the BLMS for use where DEM differencing was also applied to illustrate the information provided by each measurement method. Exciting implications of future research that incorporates a BLMS include a more informed management of river systems as a result of improved temporal predictions of sediment movement and the associated changes in channel slope and morphology.",

When examined individually, twelve of these orbits show an electron density distribution decreasing radially outward away from Saturn’s main rings, the classic distribution of a centrifugally-driven plasma expanding radially outward from a source inside the orbit of Enceladus. In this presentation we examine density profiles in the region between Saturn’s A Ring and the E Ring which show an electron density distribution decreasing radially outward from a plasma source in Saturn’s main rings. We show that the electron density measurements in this region exhibit a strong seasonal dependence resulting from the sublimation of icy particles on the ring surfaces which is controlled by the solar incidence angle. We also examine individual density profiles in the vicinity of the inner edge of the E ring, which show a mixing of the ring plasma expanding radially outward and the Enceladus plasma diffusing radially inward from a density peak just beyond the orbit of Enceladus.",

In particular, we use principal component analysis\ntechnique to extract the dominant directions of variability and\nform a basis for an orthogonal transformation. The assimilation is\nperformed in the space spanned by the orthogonal basis and used to\nadjust the model variables and parameters.\nThe experiments show that key solar parameters, which act as proxy\nfor solar activity, exert a significant influence in the evolution\nof the total atmospheric density. Furthermore, the results also\nshow the strong correlation that exists between upper atmospheric\ndensity and solar activity. That is, the correlation is strong\nduring solar active times, and weak during solar quiet times.\nIndicating that at active times the sun dominates the changes in\nthe ionosphere-thermosphere, while at quiet times internal\nprocesses dominate the evolution of the ionosphere-thermosphere.\nThe work is part of the Integrated Modeling of Perturbations in\nAtmospheres for Conjunction Tracking (IMPACT) project in Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory.",

The SDS is a fully automated system that will process the incoming raw data from the instruments, incorporate spacecraft and instrument engineering data, and use both dynamic and static ancillary products from the scientific community. The SDS will produce 14 standard data product processors. This paper will discuss the standard data products, their format, metadata, quality assessment products, as well as the planned release dates for the products both Beta and Validated quality. The standard data products will appear in Hierarchical Data Format-5 (HDF5) format. The products will contain metadata that conform to the ISO 19115 standard.

            "abstract": "This work evaluates the moisture sources that contribute to North American Monsoon precipitation over a 34-year period. The modified analytical dynamic recycling model (DRM) is used to evaluate the contributions from both oceanic and terrestrial regions. This computationally-efficient modeling framework reveals previously overlooked moisture source regions such as Central America and the Caribbean Sea in addition to the well-known Gulf of California and Gulf of Mexico source regions. Our results show that terrestrial evapotranspiration is as important as oceanic evaporation for NAM precipitation, and terrestrial sources contribute to approximately 40% of monsoonal moisture. There is a northward progression of moisture sources, beginning with Central America during the early season and transitioning north into the NAM region itself during the peak of the monsoon season. The most intense precipitation occurs towards the end of the season and tends to originate in the Gulf of California and tropical Pacific associated with tropical cyclones and gulf surges.\nHeavy stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in precipitation (δD and δ18O) collected for every precipitation event measured in Tucson, AZ for the period 1981-2013 complement our numerical results. Our analysis shows that precipitation events linked to sources from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea have a more positive isotopic composition than sources from the Gulf of California and Tropical Pacific. We also see that terrestrial regions that derive their precipitation from the Gulf of Mexico have more positive isotopic composition than those that derive their moisture from the Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Frequent outbreaks of insects and diseases have been recorded in forests of western North America during the past few decades, but the distribution of these outbreaks has not been uniform. In some cases, recent climatic variations along with the age and density of forests may explain some spatial variation. Forest managers and policy makers would benefit if areas prone to disturbance could be recognized so that mitigating actions could be taken. In this paper, we used two ponderosa pine-dominated sites in western Montana, U.S.A. to apply a modelling approach that couples information from remote sensing, soil surveys, and local weather stations to assess where bark beetle outbreaks might first occur and why. There was a slight downward trend in precipitation for both sites over the period between 1998 and 2010, and, interannual variability was high. Some years showed large increases followed by sharp decreases. Both sites had similar topography and fire histories, but bark beetle activity occurred earlier and more severely on one site than the other. The initial canopy density of the two sites was also similar, with leaf area indices derived via Landsat imagery ranging between 1.6- 2.0 m2 m-2. We wondered if the difference in bark beetle activity might be related to soils that were fine-textured at site I and coarse-textured at site II. We applied a process-based stand growth model (3-PG) to analyze the data and evaluate the hypotheses.",

            "abstract": "At Mercury, MESSENGER has documented ~1-2-s-long reductions in the dayside magnetospheric magnetic field with amplitudes up to 90% of the ambient intensity. These field reductions which we have termed cusp filaments are observed from just poleward of the magnetospheric cusp to mid-latitudes. During these events, MESSENGER’s Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS) measured H+ ions with magnetosheath-like energies. Minimum variance analysis of the Magnetometer (MAG) data indicates that the filaments are simple two dimensional flux tubes filled with magnetosheath plasma that has a diamagnetic effect on the local background field. Here we analyze 139 filaments identified in 3 years of MESSENGER magnetic field and plasma data to determine the physical properties of these structures. Our results indicate that cusp filaments are common phenomena for all solar wind conditions. They occur over a range of magnetic latitudes from ~50 to 80oN, with durations of ~0.1─2.5s and magnetic field decreases of ~50─300 nT. If the filaments are associated with flux transfer events (FTEs) and move over the spacecraft at speeds comparable to the flank magnetosheath flow speed of 300 km/s, then these filaments have dimensions of ~30─750 km, which is larger than the gyro-radius of a 1 keV H+ ion, i.e., ~ 23 km. Correlation analyses show no obvious dependence of the duration or magnitude of the diamagnetic decrease on magnetic latitude. Overall, the MAG and FIPS observations analyzed here appear consistent with an origin for cusp plasma filaments by the inflow of magnetosheath plasma associated with the localized magnetopause reconnection process that produces FTEs. Further analysis will be required to confirm this hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "In this study, reanalysis and other observational data are used to identify coherent and robust large-scale atmospheric patterns of interannual variability associated with the strength of the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM). A decomposition of the water vapor budget into dynamic and thermodynamic components shows that interannual variability in the SASM net precipitation (P-E) is primarily due to variations in winds rather than those in moisture. Using linear regression analysis, we find that strong monsoons relative to weak monsoons are associated with changes in the strength and structure of the cross-equatorial monsoonal circulation, which include a northward shift of its maximum and its ascending branch. Interestingly, and in disagreement with the view of monsoons as large-scale sea-breeze circulations, strong monsoon years are found to be associated with a decreased meridional gradient in the near surface atmospheric temperature in the SASM region. Extending our analysis to the southern hemisphere, we show how on interannual time scales a positive correlation exists between the strength of the monsoon and poleward eddy energy fluxes in the southern hemisphere mid-latitudes. Possible implications of these teleconnection patterns for increased understanding of the SASM interannual variability are discussed. Patterns of large-scale atmospheric variability associated with the SASM in CMIP5 simulations are explored and compared with observational results.",

            "abstract": "With it's high inclination orbit, GUVI provides global coverage of the ionosphere/thermosphere system, revisiting each polar region 15 times a day. The GUVI instrument has long been a resource for the ITM community with a panoply of data products available from the GUVI website (http://guvi.jhuapl.edu). GUVI is in a high inclination orbit and so provides coverage of both hemispheres. With the release last year of the data products from the DMSO/SSUSI instrument, particularly more detailed auroral zone products (Q, E0, Hemispheric Power, discrete auroral arcs, proton precipitation regions), new equatorial ionospheric products (3D electron densities, bubbles), a whole new set of UV data products has become available. SSUSI are available from http://ssusi.jhuapl.edu. To leverage the experience and knowledge gained from running all of these instruments we have adapted the SSUSI products so they can be made from GUVI telemetry. There are now updated versions of GUVI legacy products as well as brand new products. In addition, better on-orbit calibration techniques developed for SSUSI have now been applied to the GUVI instrument calibration - there is now a common set of software for calibrating both instruments. With a common data format, calibration, and product definition, the data from all SSUSI and GUVI instruments can now be easily combined to get multiple instruments to cover the hemispheres to do a variety of global studies. In addition, the GUVI spectrographic mode data provides great detail about spectrographic features (e.g. O/N2 ratios, NO band emission) that are important for understanding dynamical processes in the thermosphere. A new version of the GUVI website (with the same interface as the SSUSI website) has been launched from guvi.jhuapl.edu to showcase the legacy products made with the new calibration and also highlight the newly developed products for the GUVI imaging and spectrographic modes.",

            "abstract": "Our project encompasses an extremely specific aspect in relation to the five mass extinctions in geologic history. We asked ourselves whether larger or smaller body sizes would be better suited for surviving a mass extinction. To conduct research for our project, we used the body sizes of 17,172 marine animal genera as our primary data. These animals include echinoderms, arthropods, chordates, mollusks, and brachiopods. These creatures are perfect model organisms in terms of finding data on them because they have an excellent fossil record, and are well documented. We focused on the mean body size of these animals before and after each of the five mass extinctions (end-Ordovician, Late Devonian, end-Permian, end-Triassic, and end-Cretaceous). Our hypothesis was that the average biovolume of animals increased after each of the extinctions, with the mean size being greater after than it was before.\nOur size data is from the Ellis & Messina Catalogue of Ostracoda and the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. We obtained stratigraphic range data The Treatise and Sepkoski (2002). In our analyses, we compared the mean size of the different animal genera before and after each extinction event. We further partitioned size change across mass extinction boundaries into three categories: the surviving genera, the extinct genera, and the newly originating genera that came about after the extinction.\nAccording to our analyses, the mean sizes did not change significantly from the genera living during the stages before the extinctions and after the extinctions. From our results, we can assume that there were not enough major increases in the overall volume of the organisms to warrant a definite conclusion that extinctions lead to larger body sizes. Further support for our findings came from the T-tests in our R code. Only the Cretaceous period showed true evidence for size changing because of the extinction; in this case, the mean size decreased. T-tests for the Cretaceous comparisons showed that mean size decreased across the extinction boundary. This was due to the fact that new originating genera were smaller than the genera that survived. Our results show that there is variability in the relationship between body size and extinction selectivity in various mass extinctions.",

Groundwater flow is complex because Pahute Mesa is underlain by a thick sequence of alternating lava flows and tuffs which have been faulted into distinct structural blocks. Hydraulic properties of volcanic-rock aquifers, confining units, and fault structures have been quantified across a 50 mi² area where radionuclide transport occurs. This large area has been investigated by pumping 60 million gallons of groundwater during 16 large-scale aquifer tests. Water-level changes have been detected in observation wells more than 3 mi from pumped wells and were interpreted simultaneously with multiple groundwater flow models—one model for each well site. Hydraulic properties were distributed with a single hydrogeologic framework model that was sampled by each groundwater-flow model. Hydraulic properties were estimated across structural blocks with offsets of 1,500 ft where pumping signals were measured across fault structures. The resulting large-scale estimates of hydraulic conductivity distributions and regional transmissivity map will improve predictions of radionuclide transport.",

Additional pumping operations were undertaken in the course of excavation of two vertical shafts at the site. During these events, groundwater responses were monitored in multiple observation intervals in several shallow and deep boreholes. In this study, we first visually inspected these responses at all observation intervals induced by each pumping event. We found that some intervals at far-distance boreholes showed rapid, and strong responses, while intervals of boreholes near the vicinity of the pumping locations showed little responses. Moreover, the locations of the rapid and slow responses varied with pumping locations. This preliminary inspection suggested that some boreholes are likely connected via fractures and some are separated by flow barrier(s). Subsequently, these drawdown data sets were analyzed using a three-dimensional (3-D) transient hydraulic tomography (HT) code to estimate the hydraulic conductivity (K) and specific storage (Ss) distributions. Results of the analysis depicted several large-scale high K and low K zones and some small-scale features at the MIU site. The locations of these high and low K estimates explain the observed fast and slow groundwater responses, and corroborate with the locations of fractures and fault zones estimated based on geologic information. The HT analysis nevertheless provides a detailed description of the hydraulic characteristics of the fracture and fault zones.",

            "abstract": "The current study is aiming to discuss the Messinian Prospectivity of the concerned area, which is located in the offshore Nile Delta, about 25 Km from the Mediterranean Sea shoreline. An integrated exploration approach applied, using a variety of the 2D/3D seismic data, subsurface borehole geologic and log data of the selected wells distributed in the study area, as well as the geophysical and biostratigraphic data. The well data comprise well markers, and electric logs, where the geological data represented by litho-stratigraphic information, as well as ditch samples analysis of the studied interval. The geophysical data include check shots, VSP, velocity cubes and 3D seismic lines. Biostratigraphic data include biozones, benthonic to planktonic ratios, nannofossils and foraminiferal data.\nSeismic interpretation and seismic stratigraphic analysis, in the form of seismic sequence analysis, seismic facies analysis, seismic unit analysis and geologic confirmation have been done by the aid of Petrel and Kingdom computer softwares. The seismic lines were interpreted for defining the different parasequences and picking the various smaller sequences for mapping, after picking each sequence from the seismic correlation, it is facilitated the mapping of every sequence laterally. In addition, the interpretation of structures and isopach of every sequence has been carried out, and the seismic attributes for every sequence were possible, to extract the sands present in each sequence, and to study the extensions of these sands that act as a reservoir.\nThe integration of all results was taken as a base to produce the various models for the study area. The first one was the depositional environmental model, which showed that, the area varies from intertidal-littoral southward at Nidoco wells to inner-middle neritic at Baltim East wells then to outer neritic, and changes to bathyal and then to abyssal at the extreme north. The geologic model for the area was constructed revealing that, the area is changed from shelf to delta channels, and then converted to marine channels towards north. The depositional environments were shown to be delta front mouth bars on the shore face to the south, then this part was sloped to the north with the start of valley cut and a stage of submarine erosion and slumps.",

            "abstract": "We used a temporary network of approximately 600 seismographs to record a seismic source generated by the collapse of a 13-story building near the active trace of the Hayward Fault. These data allow us to evaluate variations in ground shaking across a series of 30 2-km-long radial arrays centered on the seismic source. Individual seismographs were spaced at 200-m intervals, forming a series of 360°concentric arrays around the seismic source. The data show variations in amplification caused by (1) soft sediments within the East Bay alluvial plain (EBAP), (2) hard rocks within the East Bay hills (EBH), (3) low-velocity rocks within the Hayward Fault zone (HFZ), and (4) topography. Given that ground shaking varies strongly with distance from the source, the concentric arrays allowed us to measure variations in ground shaking as a function of azimuth at fixed distances from the source. On individual linear profiles within the concentric arrays, we observed decreases in peak ground velocity (PGV) across the HFZ and other faults within the EBH. However, for a given distance from the source, we observe four to five fold amplification from the EBAP sites compared to most sites in the EBH. Topographic and fault-zone amplification effects within the EBH, however, are greater than the EBAP sediment amplification. Thus, for future earthquakes, shaking at many sites within the EBH may be significantly stronger than many sites within the EBAP. These observations suggest amplification can be expected in unconsolidated sediments, but topographic and fault-zone amplification can be larger. This confirms the importance of site effects for hazard mitigation and in interpreting MMI for future and historical earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The biovolume of animals has functioned as an important benchmark for measuring evolution throughout geologic time. In our project, we examined the observed average body size of ostracods over time in order to understand the mechanism of size evolution in these marine organisms. The body size of ostracods has varied since the beginning of the Ordovician, where the first true ostracods appeared. We created a stochastic branching model to create possible evolutionary trees of ostracod size. Using stratigraphic ranges for ostracods compiled from over 750 genera in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, we calculated overall speciation and extinction rates for our model. At each timestep in our model, new lineages can evolve or existing lineages can become extinct. Newly evolved lineages are assigned sizes based on their parent genera. We parameterized our model to generate neutral and directional changes in ostracod size to compare with the observed data. New sizes were chosen via a normal distribution, and the neutral model selected new sizes differentials centered on zero, allowing for an equal chance of larger or smaller ostracods at each speciation. Conversely, the directional model centered the distribution on a negative value, giving a larger chance of smaller ostracods. Our data strongly suggests that the overall direction of ostracod evolution has been following a model that directionally pushes mean ostracod size down, shying away from a neutral model. Our model was able to match the magnitude of size decrease. Our models had a constant linear decrease while the actual data had a much more rapid initial rate followed by a constant size. The nuance of the observed trends ultimately suggests a more complex method of size evolution. In conclusion, probabilistic methods can provide valuable insight into possible evolutionary mechanisms determining size evolution in ostracods.",

            "abstract": "Lunar mini-magnetospheres are formed as a consequence of solar-wind interaction with remanent crustal magnetization on the Moon. A variety of plasma and field perturbations have been observed in a vicinity of the lunar magnetic anomalies, including electron energization, ion reflection/deflection, magnetic field enhancements, electrostatic and electromagnetic wave activities, and low-altitude ion deceleration and electron acceleration. Recent Chandrayaan-1 observations of the backscattered energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) from the Moon in the solar wind revealed upward ENA flux depletion (and thus depletion of the proton flux impinging on the lunar surface) in association with strongly magnetized regions. These ENA observations demonstrate that the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind protons by the crustal magnetic fields. On the other hand, when the Moon was located in the Earth's plasma sheet, no significant depletion of the backscattered ENA flux was observed above the large and strong magnetic anomaly. It suggests less effective magnetic shielding of the surface from the plasma sheet protons than from the solar wind protons. We conduct test-particle simulations showing that protons with a broad velocity distribution are more likely to reach a strongly magnetized surface than those with a beam-like velocity distribution. The ENA observations together with the simulation results suggest that the lunar crustal magnetic fields are no longer capable of standing off the ambient plasma when the Moon is immersed in the hot magnetospheric plasma.",

            "abstract": "Goals of geobiochemistry include simultaneously evaluating the relative stabilities of microbial cells and minerals, and predicting how the composition of biomolecules can change in response to the progress of geochemical reactions. Recent developments in theoretical geochemistry make it possible to predict standard thermodynamic properties of proteins, nucleotides, lipids, and many metabolites including the constituents of the citric acid cycle, at all temperatures and pressures where life is known to occur, and beyond. Combining these predictions with constraints from geochemical data makes it possible to assess the relative stabilities of biomolecules. Resulting independent predictions of the environmental occurrence of homologous proteins and lipid side-chains can be compared with observations from metagenomic and metalipidomic data to quantify geochemical driving forces that shape the composition of biomolecules. In addition, the energetic costs of generating biomolecules from within a diverse range of habitable environments can be evaluated in terms of prevailing geochemical variables. Comparisons of geochemical bioenergetic calculations across habitats leads to the generalization that the availability of H2 determines the cost of autotrophic biosynthesis relative to the aquatic environment external to microbial cells, and that pH, temperature, pressure, and availability of C, N, P, and S are typically secondary. Increasingly reduced conditions, which are determined by reactions of water with mineral surfaces and mineral assemblages, allow many biosynthetic reactions to shift from costing energy to releasing energy. Protein and lipid synthesis, as well as the reverse citric acid cycle, become energy-releasing processes under these conditions. The resulting energy balances that determine habitability contrast dramatically with assumptions derived from oxic surface conditions, such as those where human biochemistry operates.",

            "abstract": "With the overarching goal of understanding the impacts of climate and land use changes on carbon and nutrient cycles, we are developing a reactive transport model that couples hydrologic and biogeochemical processes to microbial functional distributions inferred from site-specific ‘omic’ data. The objective of the modeling approach is to simulate changes in carbon and nutrient fluxes and aquifer biogeochemistry over longer time periods due to changes in climate and/or land use, while also considering shorter time periods in which water table fluctuations and temperature variations are important.\nA 2-D reactive transport model has been developed for the unsaturated-saturated zone of the Rifle site, CO, an alluvial aquifer bordering the Colorado River. Modeling efforts focus on the April through September 2013 time frame that corresponds to the spring snow melt event that lead to an approximately 1 meter rise in the water table followed by a gradual lowering over 3 months. Temperature variations of as much as 10ºC are observed at shallow depths (< 1m), while at least some temperature variation (1ºC) occurs as deep as about 7m. A field survey of the microbial populations indicates the presence and activity of chemo(litho)autotrophic bacteria within the saturated zone of the alluvial aquifer.\nModel simulations are used to quantify the release of carbon dioxide and consumption of oxygen via abiotic pathways and heterotrophic microbial oxidation of reduced species (Fe(II), S(-2)) and minerals (pyrite). Results indicate that the observed oxygen profiles and/or carbon fluxes cannot be matched by considering abiotic reactions alone. The importance of including microbial contributions from chemo(litho)autotrophic processes (e.g., ammonia, sulfur and iron oxidation) is supported by both field observations and model simulations. Important conclusions from the study are to: (1) include microbially-mediated processes and contributions from the unsaturated zone, and (2) account for seasonal temperature changes to accurately represent lateral and vertical delivery of water and nutrients as well as biogeochemical transformations within the Rifle Flood Plain system.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between a high frequency (HF) ordinary mode electromagnetic wave and the ionosphere induces electrostatic turbulence near the critical layer which results in the acceleration of electrons and ionization of the neutral gas by energetic electrons. Due to the artificial plasma created by this process, the reflection point of the electromagnetic wave is shifted downwards, leading to descending artificial ionospheric layers (DAILs). This work studies the dependence of DAIL formation on the injection angle of the HF wave and on the related ionospheric conditions. The model is based on a combination of ray-tracing techniques and numerical solutions of the Försterling equations. A model based on the Försterling equations has been developed to calculate the enhancement (swelling) of the electric field near the reflection point. As the swelling exceeds a certain threshold, it excites Langmuir turbulence, which in turn accelerates electrons to high energies, resulting in DAIL formation. Previous full-wave simulations of ionospheric turbulence have been able to capture some of the 2D nature of ionospheric heating but at great computational cost. This works presents an approach to performing rapid calculations of the electric field swelling of the ordinary mode, in order to facilitate a more computationally efficient 2D study of DAIL formation. Results show maximum swelling of the electric field near the magnetic zenith, with an amplitude on the order of several tens of volts per meter for a pump voltage of 1-2 V/m, which is in agreement with previous computational models as well as experiment. Preliminary work to incorporate a model for Langmuir turbulence induced by electric field swelling into the overall algorithm is also presented.",

While the broad nature of the relationships between n-alkane δ2H values and climate are appreciated on geologic scales, the quantitative details of what this proxy is reflecting remain ambiguous on plant and ecosystem levels. Areas of uncertainty on these smaller scales of importance to geologic interpretations are both the biosynthetic fractionation and the leaf-growth interval that is recorded by the isotope signal. To clarify these details, we designed a series of experiments in which modern plants were grown under controlled and monitored conditions.\nTo determine the biosynthetic fractionation, we analyzed n-alkanes from plant grown hydroponically on isotopically distinct waters and under contrasting and controlled humidities. We observed δ2H values of n-alkane were linearly related to growth water δ2H values, but with slope differences associated with humidity. These findings suggested leaf water were central controls on δ2H values of n-alkane and support a relatively constant biosynthetic fractionation factor between leaf water and n-alkanes. To determine the interval that the leaf wax isotope signal reflects, we studied a species naturally growing on water with a constant δ2H value. Here we found the δ2H values of n-alkanes recorded only a two-week period during leaf flush and did not vary thereafter. These data indicated the δ2H values of n-alkanes record conditions early in the season, rather than integrating over the entire growing season.\nUsing these data, we are beginning to develop geospatial predictions of the δ2H values of n-alkane across landscapes for given climate conditions, plant phenologies, and ecosystems. These emerging modeling tools may be used to assess modern ecosystem dynamics, to estimate weathering of leaf waxes to geologic repositories, and to define and test paleoclimate reconstructions from the δ2H values of n-alkanes.",

            "abstract": "We compare Aquarius 3.0 sea surface salinity with Argo upper mixed layer salinities, using both the standard Aquarius level-2 product and the Combined Active Passive (CAP) algorithm. Both algorithms show a zonal bias that increases with latitude in either hemisphere; however, the negative bias observed in the tropics is significantly reduced in the CAP version. In previous work using collocated TRMM precipitation data, we showed that the mean freshening bias due to rain-induced salinity stratification between the typical Argo measurement depth of 2-7 m and the Aquarius penetration depth of 0-2 cm is limited to less than 0.03 PSU, which is not enough to explain the tropical zonal bias seen in the standard algorithm [Drucker and Riser, 2014]. The reduction of the tropical bias with CAP is consistent with this finding and suggests that the zonal biases are likely due to retrieval error rather than the difference between Aquarius and Argo measurement depths.",

            "abstract": "Repeat oceanographic section data in the western South Atlantic taken mostly in 1989 (1995 across the Scotia Sea), 2005, and 2014 are used to quantify warming in abyssal waters that spread northward through the region from their Antarctic origins in the Weddell Sea. While much of the Scotia Sea warmed from 1995–2005, only the southernmost portion, on the north side of the Weddell Gyre, continued to warm from 2005–2014. The abyssal Argentine Basin also warmed from 1989–2005, but again only the southernmost portion continued to warm from 2005–2014, suggesting a slowdown in the inflow of the coldest, densest Antarctic Bottom Waters into the western South Atlantic from 1989–2014. In contrast, the abyssal waters of the Brazil Basin warmed both from 1989–2005 and from 2005–2014, at a rate of about 2 mºC yr-1. These results, together with findings from previous studies, suggest the deep warming signal observed in the Weddell Sea after the mid-1970s Weddell Polynya was followed by abyssal warming in the Argentine Basin from the late 1970s through about 2005, then warming in the deep Vema Channel from about 1992 through at least 2010, and warming in the Brazil Basin from 1989–2014.",

            "abstract": "Automatic oil spill detection and tracking from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is a difficult task, due in large part to the inhomogeneous properties of the sea surface, the high level of speckle inherent in SAR data, the complexity and the highly non-Gaussian nature of amplitude information, and the low temporal sampling that is often achieved with SAR systems.\nThis research presents a promising new oil spill detection and tracking method that is based on time series of SAR images. Through the combination of a number of advanced image processing techniques, the develop approach is able to mitigate some of these previously mentioned limitations of SAR-based oil-spill detection and enables fully automatic spill detection and tracking across a wide range of spatial scales. The method combines an initial automatic texture analysis with a consecutive change detection approach based on multi-scale image decomposition.\nThe first step of the approach, a texture transformation of the original SAR images, is performed in order to normalize the ocean background and enhance the contrast between oil-covered and oil-free ocean surfaces. The Lipschitz regularity (LR), a local texture parameter, is used here due to its proven ability to normalize the reflectivity properties of ocean water and maximize the visibly of oil in water. To calculate LR, the images are decomposed using two-dimensional continuous wavelet transform (2D-CWT), and transformed into Holder space to measure LR. After texture transformation, the now normalized images are inserted into our multi-temporal change detection algorithm. The multi-temporal change detection approach is a two-step procedure including (1) data enhancement and filtering and (2) multi-scale automatic change detection.\nThe performance of the developed approach is demonstrated by an application to oil spill areas in the Gulf of Mexico. In this example, areas affected by oil spills were identified from a series of ALOS PALSAR images acquired in 2010. The comparison showed exceptional performance of our method. This method can be applied to emergency management and decision support systems with a need for real-time data, and it shows great potential for rapid data analysis in other areas, including volcano detection, flood boundaries, forest health, and wildfires.",

            "abstract": "Santa Cruz Island is one of the oldest volcanoes in the Galápagos Archipelago; little is known about its history or its evolutionary relationship to the younger western shield volcanoes. Of particular note, the island’s northern and southern flanks are deformed by a series of major normal faults of unknown origin. Using an array of multidisciplinary tools, including field mapping, GPS, gravity, Ar-Ar and geochronology, and 3He exposure dating, we construct a structural and volcanic history of Santa Cruz. The Ar-Ar ages reveal that since ~1.5 Ma, the island has experienced two phases of volcanism, separated by ~0.4 My. The first occurred from 1620 ± 15 to 1160 ± 35 ka (1σ); the second lasted from 699 ± 45 to 74 ± 19 ka. Volcanism during the second phase was focused along an E-W trending summit vent system, from which all <200 ka lavas were deposited on the southern flank. Structural observations suggest that the island has experienced two major faulting episodes. North flank faults formed after 1160 ± 35 ka, whereas the southern faults were initiated between 416 ± 18 and 27 ± 16 ka. Gravity results indicate two E-W trending, intrusive complexes; one is centered north of the island’s summit and the other is beneath the southern flank. When integrated, our data are consistent with a model wherein the northern faults are associated with regional uplift occurring after 1.1 Ma and before 0.78 Ma (paleomag.; Bow, 1979). This deformation event may be related to the formation of the summit vent system and the initiation of the second phase of volcanism. The second volcanism phase is coincident with the formation of the southern faults. Southward spreading along the island’s southern flank accommodated extension initiated by intrusions, which ceased with volcanism at ~20 ka. The extended volcanic activity characteristic of Santa Cruz and of other older Galapagos Islands may be the result of rejuvenated volcanism linked to regional uplift event(s); it may also contribute to development of the morphological differences between eastern and western volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "Humans are intrinsic to the hydrologic system, both as agents of change and as beneficiaries of ecosystem services. This connection has been underappreciated in hydrology. We present a modeling linkage framework of an agent-based land use change model with a physical-based watershed model. The coupled model framework presented constitutes part of an integrated assessment model that is being developed to study human-ecosystem interaction in Missisquoi Bay, spanning Vermont and Québec, which is experiencing high concentrations of nutrients from the Missisquoi River watershed. The integrated assessment approach proposed is comprised of linking two simulation models: the Interactive Land-Use Transition Agent-Based Model (ILUTABM) and a physically based process model, the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys). The ILUTABM treats both landscape and landowners as agents and simulates annual land-use patterns resulting from landowners annual land-use decisions and Best Management Practices (BMPs) adaptations to landowners utilities, land productivity and perceived impacts of floods. The Missisquoi River at Swanton watershed RHESSys model (drainage area of 2,200 km2) driven by climate data was first calibrated to daily streamflows and water quality sensor data at the watershed outlet. Simulated land-use patterns were then processed to drive the calibrated RHESSys model to obtain streamflow nutrient loading realizations. Nutrients loading realizations are then examined and routed back to the ILUTAB model to obtain public polices needed to manage the Missisquoi watershed as well as the Lake Champlain in general. We infer that the applicability of this approach can be generalized to other similar watersheds.\nIndex Terms: 0402: Agricultural systems; 1800: Hydrology; 1803: Anthropogenic effects; 1834 Human impacts; 6344: System operation and management; 6334: Regional Planning",

In particular, the effects of solar wind Mach number and direction of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) are examined. Simulations with solar wind Mach number of 3 and small IMF cone angles show sporadic formation of SHFAs. Increasing the Mach number shows the formation of large number of SHFAs. We use the properties of these SHFAs to show that their duration does not depend on Mach number indicating that the size SHFAs increases with solar wind Mach number. Similarly, the level of the solar wind deceleration associated with SHFAs increases with Mach number as does their core ion temperature. We also show that the edges of SHFAs are associated with jumps in magnetic field strength that increase with shock Mach number as does the rate of SHFA formation. Simulations with IMF cone angle of 90o show that SHFAs form at the quasi-parallel bow shock provided the shock Alfvén Mach number is ~>3, indicating that SHFAs can form at all IMF cone angles. Finally, we show that the interaction of SHFAs with the bow shock results in spatial and temporal changes in plasma and field conditions in the magnetosheath whose strength increases with solar wind Mach number. The details of this interaction are described in this presentation.",

            "abstract": "Despite its vital importance to coastal hydrodynamics and maritime safety, bathymetry is often unknown or poorly constrained; remote sensing techniques show promise to help fill this gap. It has been shown that spatial gradients of cross-spectral phase can be successfully exploited to estimate highly-resolved, frequency-dependent wavenumber vectors in wave resolving image time series. These frequency-wavenumber vector pairs have proven useful for bathymetry estimation not only through basic inversion of the linear dispersion relation, but also through more complex data assimilation schemes. However, previous efforts are generally limited to open beaches.\nAs part of the DARLA and RIVET I/II experiments (Duck, NC; New River Inlet, NC; Columbia River Mouth, OR/WA), we present application of this methodology to two complementary remote sensors (X-band marine radar and optical video) and to a range of environments, from simple (open beach) to complex (a micro-tidal inlet mouth and an energetic meso-tidal estuary mouth). Bathymetry estimates via linear wave theory (the “cBathy” algorithm), spatially resolved on the order of one wavelength, are shown to reproduce bar gaps along open beaches and the structure of ebb-tidal shoals. These quasi-continuous estimates are provided at significantly greater resolution than those calculated via 3D-FFT methods over similar domain sizes (up to 40+ km2).\nMean currents can affect depth inversion estimates through the Doppler shift of the wave field. As the effect scales with the current vector component in the direction of the waves, this term is often negligible on open beaches, but it becomes significant near tidal inlets. Tidal averaging of the Doppler effect induces a depth estimate bias, but it does not appreciably deteriorate depth estimate accuracy in the presence of low-amplitude, oscillatory tidal currents. Additionally, if slack-water events can be identified, the problem can be divided into separate depth- and current-inversions.",

AM- and ECM-dominated forests often have distinct nutrient economies, and there is strong interest in mapping or detecting mycorrhizae over large areas. We explored remotely sensed tree canopy spectral properties to “detect” underlying mycorrhizal association across a gradient of AM- and ECM-dominated forest plots. We used a combination of principal components analysis and statistical mining of reflectance and band differencing across moderate/high-resolution Landsat data in conjunction with phenological signals from stitched seasonal time series and topographic features. This approach was trained and validated against measurements of tree species and mycorrhizal association across more than 60,000 trees throughout the central and eastern US. Using this approach, we were able to predict 81% of the variation in mycorrhizal association (p<0.001). Differences in phenological characteristics between AM- and ECM-associated trees drove the relatively high prediction skill.",

Aerosols in the atmosphere, including inorganic mineral dust particles and organic compounds from biogenic and anthropogenic sources, are recognized to be effective ice nuclei (IN) that lead to the formation of ice crystals. These ice crystals play important roles in climate through their interactions with solar and terrestrial radiation. However, a detailed understanding is hampered by the fact that the aerosols vary in size, chemical composition, morphology, crystal orientation, and local defects. In EMSL, some of those challenges can be addressed by utilizing state-of-the-art synthesis and characterization capabilities. By using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), we are able to synthesis materials, such as TiO2 and Fe2O3, that are commonly found in mineral dusts in their single crystalline thin film form with controlled surface termination. Fundamental studies on these designed surfaces allow us to vary some of the variables independently so that a concrete cause and effect relationship can be established. In this study, we grow epitaxial rutile TiO2(110) and anatase TiO2(001) films and investigate water adsorption and water nucleation processes on these surfaces by ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (E-SEM). The surface reaction dynamics revealed can be of critical importance in understanding the water/ice nucleation process on complex aerosols.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost underlies ~70% of all National Park Service administered land in Alaska and it provides a stable foundation to parks’ ecosystems and wildlife habitats. However, the strength of this foundation is waning as its temperature is rising in response to recent climate warming. Consequently, thermokarst activities are on the rise and they are altering the parks’ landscape, ecosystems, and wildlife habitats. In order to effectively respond to these changes park managers need up-to-date knowledge of the current permafrost temperature and distribution, and how they might evolve with changing climate in the future. To help decision makers understand and respond to the changing permafrost condition, we are modeling near-surface permafrost dynamics—permafrost temperature, distribution, and active layer thickness—in eight national parks of Alaska at a decadal time scale. We are using GIPL 1.0 model (Spatially Distributed Model of Permafrost Dynamics in Alaska), the best available climate inputs, and high-resolution (28 m) ecotype, soil landscape, and snow inputs. Here we present results for two national parks—Denali National Park and Preserve (DENA) and Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve (WRST). Areas underlain by glaciers and permanent ice-fields were excluded. In DENA, the model suggested near-surface permafrost in 51% of the park area for the 2000 decade, predicted its decline to 6% by 2050s, and 1% by 2090s. In WRST, the model suggested near-surface permafrost in 72% of the park area for the 2000 decade, predicted its decline to 42% by 2050s, and 15% by 2090s. In summary, the near-surface permafrost will likely be degrading in most parts of DENA and WRST towards the end of the current century except at higher elevations where climate models continue to project colder temperature. The modeled maps of DENA and WRST showed 86% and 95% agreement with the field observations of permafrost presence/ absence at 1375 and 430 sites, respectively. In conclusion, the modeled high-resolution permafrost maps show the effect of changing climate on near-surface permafrost. They offer decision makers a clear understanding of how near-surface permafrost distribution in the parks might change in the future, which was lacking up until now, to guide critical monitoring and management decisions.",

            "abstract": "Hot Springs are common in amagmatic settings, but the mechanisms of heating are often obscure. We have investigated the origin of the Truth or Consequences, New Mexico low-temperature (~ 41 °C) hot springs in the southern Rio Grande rift. We tested two mechanisms that could account for the geothermal anomaly. The first scenario is that the anomaly is the result of lateral forced convection associated with a gently-dipping carbonate aquifer. The second scenario is that high permeability of crystalline basement rocks permits circulation of groundwater down to depths of 8 km prior to discharging in Truth or Consequences. To test these hypotheses, we constructed a two-dimensional hydrothermal model of the region using FEMOC. Model parameters were constrained by calibrating to measured temperatures, specific discharge rates and groundwater residence times. We collected 16 temperature profiles, 11 geochemistry samples and 6 carbon-14 samples within the study area. The geothermal waters are Na+/Cl- dominated and have apparent groundwater ages ranging from 5,500 to 11,500 years. Hot Springs geochemistry is consistent with water/rock interaction in a silicate geothermal reservoir, rather than a carbonate system. Peclet-number analysis of temperature profiles suggests specific discharge rates beneath Truth or Consequences range from 2 to 4 m/year. Geothermometry indicates maximum reservoir temperatures are around 167 °C. We were able to reasonably reproduce observed measurements using the permeable-basement scenario (10-12 m2). The carbonate-aquifer scenario failed to match observations. Our findings imply that the Truth or Consequences geothermal system formed as a result of deep groundwater circulation within permeable crystalline basement rocks. Focused geothermal discharge is the result of localized faulting, which has created a hydrologic window through a regional confining unit. In tectonically active areas, deep groundwater circulation within fractured crystalline basement may play a more prominent role in the formation of geothermal systems than has generally been acknowledged.",

            "abstract": "The distribution and migration of liquids in various layers of a PEFC is commonly modelled by the 3D flow equations. Given the fact these layers are very thin, there are major problems with such models, including heavy computational efforts and doubts in their applicability to the fibrous gas diffusion layer (GDL). Recently, a new approach for modelling multiphase flow through a stack of thin porous layers has been developed [Qin and Hassanizadeh, Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer 70 (2014) 693-708]. In this approach, which is called “reduced continua model”, each layer is modelled as a 2D domain with governing equations in terms of thickness-averaged properties. This work is aimed to illustrating the advantages of the reduced continua model in modelling liquid water dynamics in a PEFC. In comparison to the Richards model, the reduced continua model predicts quite similar water dynamics in the micro porous layer (MPL), but lower steady-state water saturation in the GDL, particularly under the channel area. This is qualitatively in agreement with experimental observations in the literature. Finally, sensitivity studies of a few material parameters by the reduced continua model have been provided.",

            "abstract": "The deepest extent of inhabited rock, known as the biotic fringe, is determined by the interplay of geochemical and biochemical reaction rates. As a consequence it is unlikely that a single parameter, such as temperature, will be generally diagnostic. More probably, shifting combinations of compositional factors, together with temperature and pressure changes, will determine the position and dynamic movements of the biotic fringe. As an example, during serpentinization the biotic fringe may be determined by the depletion of carbon through carbonate precipitation or abiotic organic synthesis at mineral surfaces at temperatures and pressures that are readily inhabited elsewhere. During other weathering, diagenetic and alteration processes, the transition from sterile to populated may be determined by supply rates of reductants, oxidants, nutrients, or their diverse combinations. Where geochemical composition and mineral catalysts permit rapid abiotic organic synthesis and redox equilibration, microbes are unlikely to be able to compete. This is especially true if such conditions inhibit the function of enzymatic catalysts. As abiotic rates slow, opportunities for catalysis emerge as can the biotic fringe where enzymes can function effectively. There are many ways to turn this conceptual model into one that makes quantitative predictions. Rates of many abiotic redox and organic synthesis reactions are amenable to experimental study, and parallel biotic rate experiments yield particularly useful results. Likewise, determining how enzymes are inactivated at the limits of their function will add explicit biochemical constraints. Exploring for the biotic fringe in the subsurface involves using compositional data to evaluate apparent temperatures of equilibration that reveal anomalous approaches to redox equilibrium at conditions where abiotic rates are insufficient. Meanwhile, sampling the inhabitants of the biotic fringe will reveal surprising extents of enzyme behavior.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the effect of fire on annual streamflow is important for management of water supply, water quality and the environment. Unfortunately, annual streamflow response to fire is highly variable, making predictions of post-fire streamflow change for a given watershed or for a given period challenging. For this study, the regional effect of fire on annual streamflow was calculated for parts of central and southern California. Synthesizing data from 12 paired-watershed studies, a mixed modeling statistical approach was used to account for the hierarchical structure of the combined dataset. Hierarchical structures occur when data are organized at more than one level, such as when annual streamflow data is grouped by watershed. Post-fire effects were best represented in the model by a fire variable that accounted for both differences in watershed area burnt and post-fire vegetation recovery. At a regional scale, post-fire annual streamflow increased 145% (86% to 310%) during the first post-fire year for watersheds that were 100% burnt. This response was sensitive to annual wetness conditions, with the greatest increase in post-fire annual streamflow observed during moderately wet years. These results provide a baseline estimate of post-fire streamflow response for both gauged and ungauged California watersheds.",

It is critical to know the internal structure of clouds and precipitation since it is the vertical distribution of condensate that determines the characteristics of the cloud radiative forcing and lends insight into the vertical structure of condensation heating, which have large impact on the evolution of cloud systems. Cloudsat and CALIPSO provide the unprecedented data that allow us to look at detailed cloud and precipitation structures. In this study, we examine the vertical distribution of clouds and precipitation in CAM5 using simulated CloudSat radar reflectivities. Our focus is to evaluate how well the model simulated clouds over several different important cloud regimes and estimate the effects of simulator uncertainties from precipitation sub-column distribution. The selected regimes include TWP, Southern Ocean, and Australian stratus region. The impacts of different assumptions used to assign precipitation to sub-columns are examined, and the uncertainties from precipitation distribution are analyzed.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.

            "abstract": "The mechanism of geyser eruption has long intrigued scientists and the public, yet it has remained a matter of debate. Three major categories of model have been proposed: One category focuses on the processes in the geyser conduit. The second focuses on the processes in an underground ‘bubble trap’ that connects to the surface through a conduit. The third considers the geyser system to consist of a vertical fracture zone of high permeability and compressibility, surrounded by rock matrix of low permeability and compressibility. Since the interior of geysers is largely inaccessible to direct observation, numerical simulation constrained by available observation may be an important tool for deciphering the mechanism of geyser eruption. Here we use numerical simulation to explore the mechanism of geyser eruption from a system that consists of a heated underground cavern, delineated by seismic tremor location near the Old Faithful Geyser, WY (Vandemeulebrouck, et al., 2013) and connects to the surface through a conduit. Differential equations representing conservations of mass, momentum and energy, constrained by appropriate initial and boundary conditions, are solved to simulate the coupled geyser processes.\nHydrothermal fluids seeping into the cavern heat up the bottom water to form an unstable thermal boundary layer near the base. Convection becomes intermittent at large Rayleigh number. Top-down boiling in the conduit releases pressure not only in the conduit but also in the cavern, triggering bubble nucleation and uprise from the base. Convective overturn of the thermal boundary layer leads to vigorous boiling in the cavern and geyser eruption through the conduit. Boiling in the cavern sustains geyser eruption until the thermal boundary layer is destroyed. Results suggest that the complex interaction between processes in the conduit and in the cavern, rather than either one in isolation, may control geyser eruption.",

            "abstract": "Favorable conditions to tropospheric ozone (O3) formation are present over the Persian Gulf Region. Ozone is a well known pollutant affecting human health and natural ecosystems. Among the several factors contributing to the formation of the O3 hot spot over the Middle East, the presence of local emissions of its precursors needs to be considered. We report initial measurements of a suite of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), an important component of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which, coupled with nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight, are key chemical precursors of tropospheric O3.\nWe measured 63 speciated C2-C10 NMHCs, in addition to methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO) in three cities of Saudi Arabia (Jeddah, Mecca, and Madina; October-November 2012 and April 2013) and in the city of Lahore (Pakistan; December 2012). To put these data into perspective, we compare our results to data collected in Singapore (August-November 2012). We observed enhanced levels in all three Saudi Arabian cities compared to the local background and to those measured in Singapore. However, the Saudi levels are much lower than those measured in Lahore, where the sum of quantified NMHCs is about six times higher. For Madina, enhanced levels of the alkenes, ethyne and CO indicated that vehicle exhaust was the dominant source. In Jeddah and Mecca, the most abundant NMHC were the alkanes (47-61% of total measured NMHCs), which are more closely associated with emissions from natural gas, liquid petroleum gas (LPG), and gasoline evaporation. In Lahore, the hydroxyl radical (OH) reactivity, used to evaluate the importance of the different measured species toward ozone production, is three to six times higher than for the Saudi cities, and more than 20 times higher than for Singapore. For all urban areas reported here, among the measured compounds, the alkenes (especially ethene and propene) dominate in terms of OH reactivity because of a combination of their great abundance and relatively fast reaction rates with the hydroxyl radical. In light of the ozone hot spot detected over the Persian/Arabia Gulf our study shows the importance of different classes of NMHCs, or individual species, to the OH reactivity. This information can help policy makers regulate emissions in an attempt to reduce O3 formation by targeting key atmospheric pollutants.",

            "abstract": "Europa is a prime candidate to search for a present-day habitable environment in our solar system. As such, NASA has engaged a Science Definition Team (SDT) to define a strategy to advance our scientific understanding of this icy world with the goal: Explore Europa to investigate its habitability. A mission architecture is defined where a spacecraft in Jupiter orbit would make many close flybys of Europa, concentrating on remote sensing to explore the moon. The spacecraft trajectory would permit ~45 flybys at a variety of latitudes and longitudes, enabling globally distributed regional coverage of Europa’s surface. This concept is known as the Europa Clipper.\nThe SDT recommended three science objectives for the Europa Clipper: Ice Shell and Ocean--Characterize the ice shell and any subsurface water, including their heterogeneity, ocean properties, and the nature of surface-ice-ocean exchange; Composition--Understand the habitability of Europa's ocean through composition and chemistry; Geology--Understand the formation of surface features, including sites of recent or current activity, and characterize high science interest localities. The SDT also considered implications of the recent HST detection of plumes at Europa.\nTo feed forward to potential future exploration that could be enabled by a lander, it was deemed that the Clipper should provide the capability to perform reconnaissance. In consultation with NASA Headquarters, the SDT developed a reconnaissance goal: Characterize Scientifically Compelling Sites, and Hazards, for a Potential Future Landed Mission to Europa. This leads to two objectives: Site Safety--Assess the distribution of surface hazards, the load-bearing capacity of the surface, the structure of the subsurface, and the regolith thickness; Science Value--Assess the composition of surface materials, the geologic context of the surface, the potential for geological activity, the proximity of near surface water, and the potential for active upwelling of ocean material.\nThe Clipper concept provides an efficient means to explore Europa and investigate its habitability. Development of the mission concept is ongoing with current studies focusing on spacecraft design trades and refinements, launch vehicle options (EELV and SLS), and power source (MMRTG and solar), to name a few.",

However, understanding how biochar addition influences metal(loid) mobility is necessary. Here, the sequestration of 5 metal(loid)s in suspensions of biochars adjusted to pH 4.5 or 6.0 were characterized. Solutions of the oxyanion As and the cations Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd were added at a single rate of 3 mmol kg-1 biochar. Six biochars were obtained by large-scale pyrolysis of softwood, hardwood, grass, and poultry litter under different conditions. Biochars were characterized using N2-BET (surface area), proximate analysis, elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In this study, metal(loid) sequestration depended on the suspension pH, metal(loid), and biochar characteristics. In most cases, a significantly (α=0.05) greater proportion of cation was sequestered in biochar suspensions adjusted to pH 6.0 compared to pH 4.5. In contrast, pH had no significant effect on the sequestration of As. The magnitude of the increase in sequestration at pH 6.0 compared to pH 4.5 can be attributed to specific biochar characteristics. Enhancement of Ni, Zn, and Cd sequestration at pH 6.0 compared to pH 4.5 was correlated (R2>0.50) to inorganic C content and neutralization potential of biochars. Furthermore, increased Cu sequestration at pH 6.0 compared to pH 4.5 was correlated (R2>0.50) to % Fixed matter and organic C content of biochars. This data suggests that at pH 6.0, sequestration of Ni, Zn, and Cd as carbonates and interactions between organic C and Cu were more favourable compared to pH 4.5. For Ni, Cu, and Cd, differences in sequestration at the two pH were also related (R2>0.50) to the relative distribution of functional groups. This study emphasizes the need for a more holistic understanding of how biochar properties influence metal sequestration.",

Contemporary N to NE-directed shortening of ~1–2 mm/yr occurs across the belt, but the distribution of Quaternary deformation among the individual Yakima folds and faults is unclear. The Yakima River incises roughly normal to several of these structures south of Ellensburg, WA, where topography mimics structural relief and fluvial incision may be a proxy for differential rock uplift. Here, we combine LiDAR analysis, field mapping, and cosmogenic isochron burial ages of gravels above strath terraces to quantify the rate of Quaternary incision through two of these folds, Manastash and Umtanum Ridges. We mapped terraces flanking the Yakima River at five levels—individual terraces consist of mixed rock-type river gravel deposits capping basalt straths. We sampled eight terrace gravels for isochron burial dating utilizing cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al to determine terrace ages and calculate incision rates. Preliminary isochron burial ages from two sampled terraces yield mid-to-early Quaternary ages for terraces ~60 and ~15 m above the modern Yakima River (1.08 ± 0.29 Ma and 1.59 ± 0.25 Ma, respectively). Although these ages overlap within error (1s), the younger, higher terrace lies within the core of the Manastash Ridge anticline, while the lower, older deposit occurs in the intervening syncline north of Umtanum Ridge. Corresponding incision rates are < 0.10 mm/yr, and are consistent with differential uplift of the Manastash Ridge anticline, despite large age uncertainties resulting from the narrow range of relatively low 10Be concentrations for analyzed samples. We are processing additional samples to reduce burial age uncertainties, and characterize incision and uplift rates on six more strath terraces spanning heights of ~5-100 m above the active channel, distributed across the Manastash and Umtanum Ridge folds.",

            "abstract": "29Si doped experiments demonstrated that Si isotope doping is a robust new experimental technique for measuring silicate reaction kinetics. Albite dissolution batch experiments were conducted under ambient temperature and pH 3-7.5. In our experiments, initial solutions were doped with artificial 29Si, resulting in a Si isotopic composition highly anomalous to natural Si isotope compositions. The isotopic contrast and analytical precision of ±0.05 (unit in %) allow detection of the dissolution of a minute amount of albite in the aqueous solutions. Results show that the temporal evolution of 28Si and 29Si abundances in batch experiments (3-270 days) tightly bracketed the steady state albite dissolution rates, and the measured rates are consistent with literature data. Because the precipitation of secondary phases consumes silica but leaves the Si isotope ratios unchanged in experimental solutions, dissolution rates were still measurable when secondary phase precipitation took place in experiments. Meanwhile, the combination of Si isotopes and Si elementary concentrations, precisely determined with the Si isotope dilution method, allowed albite dissolution and secondary phase precipitation rates to be determined simultaneously.\nExperimental data illustrate that this method allows measurements of silicate reaction rates at precisions and conditions never before possible. The high detection sensitivity allows measuring steady state rates extending to longer experimental duration than previously possible at ambient temperatures. Freedom from interferences of secondary phase precipitation means we can now measure rates at circumneutral pH and near equilibrium conditions under which precipitation likely takes place. Particularly, measurements of rates close to equilibrium would help resolve the long-standing problem of field-lab gap in silicate dissolution rates.",

            "abstract": "The Whipple detachment fault in E. California is a classic example of a large-displacement (~40 km), low-angle normal fault formed during Miocene Basin and Range extension. The footwall of this fault exhibits a range of mid-crustal rocks deformed near the brittle-ductile transition, including mylonites, cataclasites, and pseudotachylites, which provide insight into mid-crustal rheology from steady-state to seismic strain rates. Here we focus on a diverse array of pseudotachylites discovered in the Whipple footwall that have not been previously described. We examine the structural contexts, morphologies, and compositions of the pseudotachylites and discuss their implications for seismogenesis on continental low-angle normal faults. \nVeins that we interpret to be pseudotachylites occur as planar, anastomosing, and reservoir-like injections found along the margins of dikes, along mini-detachments kinematically linked to the Whipple fault, and within a few tens of centimeters below the silicified, erosionally resistant “microbreccia ledge” of the main detachment. The orientations of the vein generation surfaces are dominantly shallowly E-dipping, subparallel to the detachment fault itself; some occur on higher angle normal faults that sole into low angle shear zones. Veins were not found cutting the microbreccia ledge itself, suggesting that comminution and silicification post-dates pseudotachylite formation.\nIn thin section, the veins exhibit a range in composition and degree of preservation. Some contain lath-shaped spherulites, others contain opaque, microcrystalline matrices with relict flow banding and embayed, primarily quartz clasts. Some pseudotachylite veins grade into cataclasites at their margins, suggesting cataclasis was precursory to vein formation, whereas others cut pristine mylonites with no evidence of earlier brittle deformation. Those that cut pristine mylonites contain clasts with dynamically recrystallized quartz grains with diameters of 5-7 μm. This suggests a minimum shear stress for formation of the pseudotachylite veins of 60-80 MPa based on quartz paleopiezometry. \nThese data provide evidence that the low-angle Whipple fault and associated structures was seismically active at mid-crustal depths.",

            "abstract": "Student-conducted research in courses during the first two undergraduate years can increase learning and improve student self-confidence in scientific study, and is recommended for engaging and retaining students in STEM fields (PCAST, 2012). At Pomona College, incorporating student research throughout the geology curriculum tripled the number of students conducting research prior to their senior year that culminated in a professional conference presentation (Reinen et al., 2006). Here we present an example of discovery-based research in Neotectonics, a second-tier course predominantly enrolling first-and second-year students; describe the steps involved in the four week project; and discuss early outcomes of student confidence, engagement and retention.\nIn the San Gorgonio Pass region (SGPR) in southern California, the San Andreas fault undergoes a transition from predominantly strike-slip to a complex system of faults with significant dip-slip, resulting in diffuse deformation and raising the question of whether a large earthquake on the San Andreas could propagate through the region (Yule, 2009). In spring 2014, seven students in the Neotectonics course conducted original research investigating quantifiable geomorphic evidence of tectonic activity in the SGPR. Students addressed questions of [1] unequal uplift in the San Bernardino Mountains, [2] fault activity indicated by stream knick points, [3] the role of fault style on mountain front sinuosity, and [4] characteristic earthquake slip determined via fault scarp degradation models. Students developed and revised individual projects, collaborated with each other on methods, and presented results in a public forum. A final class day was spent reviewing the projects and planning future research directions.\nPre- and post-course surveys show increases in students’ self-confidence in the design, implementation, and presentation of original scientific inquiries. 5 of 6 eligible students participated in research the following summer, the same 5 enrolled in the follow-up course for Fall 2014, and one student changed her major from the social sciences in order to conduct geology senior thesis research.\nPCAST: http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/pcast/docsreports\nReinen et al., CUR-Quarterly, 2006.\nYule, Geology, 2009.",

            "abstract": "Many critical wetland biogeochemical processes are still largely unknown or poorly understood at best. Yet, available models for predicting wetland greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (e.g., CO2, CH4, and N2O) are generally mechanistic in nature. This knowledge gap leads to inappropriate process descriptions or over-parameterizations in existing mechanistic models, which often fail to provide accurate and robust predictions across time and space. We developed a systematic data-analytics and informatics method to identify the dominant controls and quantify the relative linkages of wetland GHG fluxes in relation to various hydro-climatic, sea level, biogeochemical and ecological drivers. The method was applied to data collected from 2012-14 through an extensive field campaign from different blue carbon sites of Waquoit Bay, MA. Multivariate pattern recognition techniques of principal component and factor analyses were employed to identify the dominant controls of wetland GHG fluxes; classifying and grouping process variables based on their similarity and interrelation patterns. Power-law based partial least squares regression models were developed to quantify the relative linkages of major GHGs with different process drivers and stressors, as well as to achieve site-specific predictions of GHG fluxes. Wetland biogeochemical similitude and scaling laws were also investigated to unravel emergent patterns and organizing principles of wetland GHG fluxes. The research findings will guide the development of parsimonious empirical to appropriate mechanistic models for spatio-temporally robust predictions of GHGs fluxes and carbon sequestration from coastal wetland ecosystems. The research is part of two current projects funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation; focusing on wetland data collections, knowledge formation, formulation of robust GHGs prediction models, and development of ecological engineering tools.",

            "abstract": "The 2003 Mw6.5 San Simeon earthquake and the 2004 Mw6.0 Parkfield earthquake have been found to cause significant seismic velocity decreases along the San Andreas Fault (SAF). However, the depth range of the velocity decreases is hard to constrain based on traditional approaches and is still inclusive. In this study, we used noise interferometry (MSNoise) and surface wave inversion to measure the S-wave velocity changes at different depths near Parkfield after the two large earthquakes. We processed continuous seismic recordings from 15 stations near Parkfield from 2001 to 2011 to obtain the noise cross-correlation functions, and measured the temporal variations in Rayleigh wave phase velocities at 6 different frequency bands. We then invert the Rayleigh wave phase velocity changes at different frequencies using a series of Rayleigh wave sensitivity kernels, for the S-wave velocity changes at different depths. Our results indicate that the S-wave velocity decreases caused by the San Simeon earthquake are relatively small (up to ~0.1%), and they access depths of at least 6 km in the region of Parkfield. On the other hand, the S-wave velocity decrease caused by the Parkfield earthquake is larger (up to ~0.3%), but is dominated by elastic changes in the top 1-2 km of the crust. Our ongoing work is focused on constraining and understanding the physical mechanisms for the different depth ranges of velocity changes cause by the two large earthquakes, and characterization of the recovery processes at different depths after the Parkfield earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The first heat flow values made in Mexico were reported by Von Herzen [Science, 1963] for the marine environment and Smith [EPSL, 1974] for the continent. Since that time the number of measurements has increased greatly but are mostly from oil and gas exploration and in and around geothermal areas. We have compiled published values of conductive heat flow for Mexico and the Gulf of California to generate a new regional heat flow map consisting of 261 values. In addition to those original values, published heat flow sources include, Lee and Henyey [JGR, 1975], Lawver and Williams [JGR, 1979] Smith et al. [JGR, 1979], Lachenbruch et al. [JGR, 1985], and Ziagos et al. [JGR, 1985]. Although the geographic distribution is uneven, heat flow data are present in each of the eight main tectonic provinces.\nOur new compilation indicates relatively high regional heat flow averages in the Gulf Extensional Province (n=114, 92±22 mW/m2) and Mexican Basin and Range (n=21, 82±20 mW/m2) and are consistent with geologic estimates of extension. Lower regional averages are found in the Baja California Microplate (n=91, 75±19 mW/m2), the Sierra Madre Occidental (n=9, 75±12 mW/m2), the Sierra Madre Oriental (n=4, 68±15 mW/m2) and Mesa Central (n=X 77±23 mW/m2). In contrast low and variable heat flow value characterize the forearc region of the Middle America Trench (n=6, 35±16 mW/m2). A higher mean heat flow is associated with the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (n=6, 78±26 mW/m2).\nContinental elevation results from a combination of buoyancy (i.e. compositional and thermal) and geodynamic forces. We combine these regional heat flow values with estimates of crustal thickness and density for each tectonic province and compute the thermal and compositional buoyancy following the approach of Hasterok and Chapman [JGR, 2007a,b]. We find that within uncertainties most provinces lie near the theoretical isostatic relationship with the exception of the Mesa Central and Sierra Madre del Sur that are anomalously below and above the theoretical relationship, respectively.",

            "abstract": "We present a new approach to measuring crustal thickness and bulk properties from teleseismic data. In contrast to the traditional H-k stacking approach, which involves receiver-function deconvolution followed by stacking along expected arrival-time curves, we eliminate the deconvolution step and generate synthetic transfer functions predicting the relationship between the vertical and radial components. Given a catalogue of precalculated transfer functions, we convolve the vertical component with each assumed transfer function and then calculate a misfit between the real and predicted radial component. As a single-layer crust is no longer a necessary assumption, we use the transfer-function approach to extend H-k analysis to models containing sedimentary basins. We apply this new technique to two data sets: one from Earthscope instrumentation in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota, USA, and one from the FaultLab project, which instrumented the branching North Anatolian Fault, Turkey. From the US data set, we find that the transfer-function approach is able to recover approximate sedimentary thickness in the Williston Basin, as well as remove the contaminating effects of the sedimentary layers from crustal thickness and basement P/S velocity ratio measurements, and so detect westward crustal thinning towards the Trans-Hudson Orogen that may represent crustal erosion related to the orogenic process, as well as compositional differences between Superior and Trans-Hudson basement rocks. The data from Turkey reveal a \"stair-step\" northward deepening of the Moho across the two major strands of the North Anatolian Fault and a northward decrease in the P/S velocity ratio, overlain by highly variable sediment thicknesses reflecting a complex system of pull-apart basins in the upper crust.",

            "abstract": "We developed a scaling-based, simple empirical model for spatio-temporally robust prediction of the diurnal cycles of wetland net ecosystem exchange (NEE) by using an extended stochastic harmonic algorithm (ESHA). A reference-time observation from each diurnal cycle was utilized as the scaling parameter to normalize and collapse hourly observed NEE of different days into a single, dimensionless diurnal curve. The modeling concept was tested by parameterizing the unique diurnal curve and predicting hourly NEE of May to October (summer growing and fall seasons) between 2002-12 for diverse wetland ecosystems, as available in the U.S. AmeriFLUX network. As an example, the Taylor Slough short hydroperiod marsh site in the Florida Everglades had data for four consecutive growing seasons from 2009-12; results showed impressive modeling efficiency (coefficient of determination, R2 = 0.66) and accuracy (ratio of root-mean-square-error to the standard deviation of observations, RSR = 0.58). Model validation was performed with an independent year of NEE data, indicating equally impressive performance (R2 = 0.68, RSR = 0.57). The model included a parsimonious set of estimated parameters, which exhibited spatio-temporal robustness by collapsing onto narrow ranges. Model robustness was further investigated by analytically deriving and quantifying parameter sensitivity coefficients and a first-order uncertainty measure. The relatively robust, empirical NEE model can be applied for simulating continuous (e.g., hourly) NEE time-series from a single reference observation (or a set of limited observations) at different wetland sites of comparable hydro-climatology, biogeochemistry, and ecology. The method can also be used for a robust gap-filling of missing data in observed time-series of periodic ecohydrological variables for wetland or other ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Recent events have demonstrated that the United States’ transportation infrastructure is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events which will likely increase in the future. In light of the 60% shortfall of the $900 billion investment needed over the next five years to maintain this aging infrastructure, hardening of all infrastructures is unlikely. Alternative strategies are needed to ensure that critical aspects of the transportation network are maintained during climate extremes. Preliminary concepts around multi-tier service expectations of bridges and roads with reference to network capacity will be presented. Drawing from recent flooding events across the U.S., specific examples for roads/pavement will be used to illustrate impacts, disruptions, and trade-offs between performance during events and subsequent damage. This talk will also address policy and cultural norms within the civil engineering practice that will likely challenge the application of graceful failure pathways during extreme events.",

The ST5 spacecraft were in a 300 km x 4500 km orbit while the DMSP spacecraft were in near circular orbit at ~ 850 km. We removed gain jumps from the ST5 data and improved a high-latitude background removal method for DMSP. All data were processed through the Modified Apex Coordinate transformation and mapped to 110 km. Agreement between different spacecraft observations was verified by computing magnetic conjunctions and extracting data from a small region around each ST5-DMSP conjunction. We found excellent agreement between the magnetic perturbations at 277 conjunctions between DMSP and ST5. With these data we show: 1) a global view of storm-time field aligned current (FAC) perturbations; 2) a global view of calm-before-the-storm FAC events; and 3) clear evidence of hemispheric asymmetries in cusp region magnetic perturbation strength during the equinox season. Our methods provide a ‘path forward’ in terms of comparing on-orbit electric and magnetic field data from multiple spacecraft.",

            "abstract": "Energy literacy requires knowledge about the trade-offs inherent in energy alternatives, about how humans use energy and have choices in how much energy to use, and about what changes to the Earth system are occurring from energy uses. It also requires collaborative decision-making skills coupled with awareness about what values we bring to the table as we negotiate solutions that serve both personal needs and the common good. Coming up with a notion of the common good requires delineating how environmental crises occurring in other parts of the world compare to our own. We also need to understand criteria for judging what might be viable solutions. This presentation describes work that SRI International is carrying out to meet these awareness-building needs. SRI educational researchers created a curriculum that immerses students in studying regional climate change data about California in comparison to global climate change. Students ponder solution energy-related strategies and impact analyses. The curriculum will be described, as will a collaboration between SRI educational researchers and materials scientists. The scientists are designing and testing technologies for producing biofuels and solar power, and for sequestering carbon from coal fired power plants. As they apply principles of science and engineering to test materials intended to meet these energy challenges, they understand that even if the tests prove successful, if there is not economic feasibility or environmental advantage, the technology may not stand as a viable solution. This educator-scientist team is using the Essential Energy Principles and Next Generation Science Standards to articulate milestones along a trajectory of energy learning. The trajectory starts with simple understandings of what energy is and what constitute our energy challenges. It ends with more the types of more sophisticated understandings needed for designing and testing energy technology solutions.",

            "abstract": "Freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide are under increasing anthropogenic pressure at local (e.g., irrigation diversions, wastewater discharge) and global scales (e.g., climate change, global trading). The impact depends on an ecosystem’s sensitivity, which is determined by its geophysical and ecological settings, and the population and activities in its surrounding watershed. Given the importance of ecosystem services, it is critical that we improve our ability to identify and understand changes in aquatic ecosystems, and translate them to risk of service loss. Furthermore, to inspire changes in human behavior, it is equally critical that we learn to communicate risk, and pose risk mitigation strategies, in a manner acceptable to a broad spectrum of stakeholders. Quantifying the nature and timing of the risk is difficult because (1) we often fail to understand the connection between anthropogenic pressures and the timing and extent of ecosystem changes; and (2) the concept of risk is inherently coupled to human perception, which generally differs with cultural and socio-economic conditions. In this study, we endeavor to assess aquatic ecosystem risks across an international array of six study sites. The challenge is to construct a methodology capable of capturing the marked biogeographical, socioeconomic, and cultural differences among the sites, which include: (1) Muskoka River watershed in humid continental Ontario, Canada; (2) Lower San Joaquin River, an impounded snow-fed river in semi-arid Central California; (3) Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta, a tropical coastal lagoon in Colombia; (4) Senguer River basin in the semi-arid part of Argentina; (5) Laguna de Rocha watershed in humid subtropical Uruguay; and (6) Palomas Lake complex in oceanic Chilean Patagonia. Results will include a characterization of the experimental gradient over the six sites, an overview of the risk assessment methodology, and preliminary findings for several of the sites.",

            "abstract": "Iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) compounds are common constituents of terrestrial hydrothermal systems. The transformation of Fe and S compounds is inferred to be an ancient mechanism of energy conservation that is still represented in extant life inhabiting contemporary hydrothermal environments. While substantial research has been conducted to uncover the ability of microorganisms to couple Fe and S transformations with other biogeochemical cycles (e.g., H, O, C cycles) in hydrothermal environments, few studies have focused on the interplay between the Fe and S cycles. In particular, a paucity of studies has been conducted on this phenomenon in acidic high temperature ecosystems despite the common co-occurrence of Fe and S in these environments. Here, we report the isolation and physiological characterization of a metabolically diverse thermoacidiphilic and autotrophic archaeon from an acidic hot spring environment in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) that is capable of both direct and indirect coupling of the Fe and S cycles. Growth experiments indicate differential attachment requirements depending on the mode of growth and imply the importance of intermediate sulfur species in supporting its metabolism. Genomic analyses confirm the metabolic plasticity of this strain and suggest numerous other mechanisms by which this organism may exploit other geochemical cycles during Fe or S dependent growth. Cultivation and cultivation independent approaches suggest that the distribution of this archaeon is widespread in Fe and S rich hot spring environments in YNP and is likely a keystone population in these environments, responsible for a large proportion of primary productivity. These results underscore the utility of integrating geochemical, cultivation, physiological, and genomic approaches in understanding biogeochemical cycling in volcanic environments.",

            "abstract": "When the first digital information was stored electronically, discovery of what existed was through file names and the organization of the file system. With the advent of networks, digital information was shared on a wider scale, but discovery remained based on file and folder names. With a growing number of information sources, named based discovery quickly became ineffective. The keyword based search engine was one of the first types of a mashup in the world of Web 1.0. Embedded links from one document to another with prescribed relationships between files and the world of Web 2.0 was formed. Search engines like Google used the links to improve search results and a worldwide mashup was formed. While a vast improvement, the need for semantic (meaning rich) discovery was clear, especially for the discovery of scientific data. In response, every science discipline defined schemas to describe their type of data. Some core schemas where shared, but most schemas are custom tailored even though they share many common concepts. As with the networking of information sources, science increasingly relies on data from multiple disciplines. So there is a need to bring together multiple sources of semantically rich information. We explore how harvesting, conceptual mapping, facet based search engines, search term promotion, and style sheets can be combined to create the next generation of mashups in the emerging world of Web 3.0. We use NASA's Planetary Data System and NASA's Heliophysics Data Environment to illustrate how to create a multi-discipline mash-up.",

Detailed data on the morphology of braided river channels can now be captured at varying scales and spatial resolutions using remote sensing technologies designed for topographic mapping, including interferometric synthetic aperture radar, aerial photogrammetry, and aerial and ground-based lidar. A common product of these data is a digital elevation model (DEM) which not only maps the morphological structure of the river at the time of data acquisition, but also enables analysis of the flow distribution, hydraulic geometry, and bed stresses.\nWe present a 2D flow model of a 120 km reach of the Platte River, NE, US, parameterized with a 1 m DEM constructed from aerial lidar and channel bathymetry data. The model is motivated by the opportunity to study the flow distribution across threads of different sizes, to examine how braiding changes with increases in discharge, and to study how the distribution of flow among threads evolves with changes in stage. These results shed additional light on the hydraulic geometry of braided rivers. Additionally, the value of fine resolution data is measured by repeating this analysis with coarsened input data.",

            "abstract": "Conventional tsunami generation theory assumes that vertical uplift at the seafloor is entirely responsible for sea surface uplift after an earthquake. This vertical uplift, which includes direct vertical displacement as well as contributions from horizontal displacement of the sloped seabed, is low-pass filtered to account for nonhydrostatic ocean response at short wavelengths and used as an initial condition in tsunami models. However, Song et al. [2008] suggest that for geometries and horizontal displacements associated with realistic tsunamis, horizontal momentum transfer plays a key role in determining tsunami height. To gain insight into this problem, we use a provably stable and accurate finite difference method that can model the full seismic, ocean acoustic, and tsunami wavefield generated by megathrust earthquakes in two dimensions. This is done using summation-by-parts (SBP) finite difference operators and weak enforcement of boundary conditions via the simultaneous approximation term (SAT) method. Our numerical method rigorously couples the elastodynamic response of the solid Earth with that of a compressible ocean, in the presence of gravity. We model surface gravity waves using a linearized traction-free boundary condition on the perturbed free surface of an ocean initially in hydrostatic balance. We have applied our method to study the seismic, ocean acoustic, and tsunami waves generated by rupture on a thrust fault extending to the bottom of an ocean of constant depth. The results of our model disagree somewhat with the tsunami predicted by the standard approach; the amplitude of the landward traveling tsunami is smaller than predicted, while the amplitude of the seaward traveling tsunami is larger than predicted. We are presently studying if this difference is a directivity effect associated with up-dip rupture propagation or is related to horizontal momentum transfer to the ocean. Using our method, we have the potential to investigate tsunamis generated by vertical and horizontal displacements in oceans with realistically complex seafloor geometries.",

            "abstract": "Paleotsunami deposits contain information about the flow that created them that can be used to reconstruct tsunami flow speed and thereby improving assessment of tsunami hazard. We applied an inverse tsunami sediment transport model to sandy deposits near Sendai Airport, Japan, that formed during the 11 March 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami to test model performance and explore the spatial variations in tsunami flow speed. The inverse model assumes the amount of suspended sediment in the water column is in equilibrium with local flow speed and that sediment transport convergences, primarily from bedload transport, do not contribute significantly to formation of the portion of the deposit we identify as formed by sediment settling out of suspension. We interpret massive or inversely graded intervals as forming from sediment transport convergences and do not model them. Sediment falling out of suspension forms a specific type of normal grading, termed ‘suspension’ grading, where the entire grain size distribution shifts to finer sizes higher up in a deposit. Suspension grading is often observed in deposits of high-energy flows, including turbidity currents and tsunamis. The inverse model calculates tsunami flow speed from the thickness and bulk grain size of a suspension-graded interval. We identified 24 suspension-graded intervals from 7 trenches located near the Sendai Airport from ~250-1350 m inland from the shoreline. Flow speeds were highest ~500 m from the shoreline, landward of the forested sand dunes where the tsunami encountered lower roughness in a low-lying area as it traveled downslope. Modeled tsunami flow speeds range from 2.2 to 9.0 m/s. Tsunami flow speeds are sensitive to roughness, which is unfortunately poorly constrained. Flow speed calculated by the inverse model was similar to those calculated from video taken from a helicopter about 1-2 km inland. Deposit reconstructions of suspension-graded intervals reproduced observed upward shifts in grain size distributions reasonably well. As approaches to estimating paleo-roughness improve, the flow speed and size of paleotsunamis will be better understood and the ability to assess tsunami hazard from paleotsunami deposits will improve.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the fate of soil carbon when permafrost soils begin to thaw is critical for predicting the impact of permafrost thaw on global climate change. Microbial metabolism of soil carbon can produce carbon dioxide or methane, depending on soil conditions, and which pathway dominates has great significance for the strength of climate feedbacks since methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. In Arctic ecosystems, methane production from upland environments is not well understood and generally assumed to be low because conditions there are generally not favorable for methanogenesis. Small changes in topography, however, can lead to great heterogeneity in soil conditions at small scales that may lead to higher methane flux than generally recognized. In this study, we investigated patterns in methane, carbon dioxide, and oxygen concentrations in in surface waters of 15 small ponds in the Kolyma River watershed in Northeast Siberia. The ponds were distributed across a topographic gradient from upland tundra high in the landscape to low-lying ponds in the floodplain of the Kolyma River. In addition, we used chambers to measured methane fluxes from a variety of topographic depressions that ranged from pools to moss-dominated saturated soils lacking surface water, to dry soils dominated by sedges. Dissolved carbon dioxide concentrations in ponds showed no trend down the topographic gradient while methane concentrations decreased downslope. The decrease in methane production may be the result of a switch from green moss to brown moss, which may act as a host for methanotrophic bacteria. Ponds with green moss had significantly higher concentrations of methane than the ponds with brown moss. In addition, we found significantly higher methane fluxes from pools and saturated soils then from drier soils, which showed very low fluxes. These results suggest that upland tundra may be a significant source of methane, and that methane fluxes are driven by a combination of soil conditions and the composition of vegetation within topographic depressions. Clearly, better understanding of small-scale patterns in gas flux and the conditions which effect it is critical to our ability to model feedbacks that may result from anthropogenic climate change.",

            "abstract": "Don Quixote Pond, like Don Juan Pond in the South Fork of Wright Valley, Antarctica, is a model for calcium and chlorine weathering and distribution on Mars. It is located in the western part of the North Fork about 100 m above Mean Seawater Level; its brine is seasonally frozen [1]. Field observations show zones of discoloration which grow lighter with distance from the pond edges.\nFour sediment cores, a set of radial surface samples, special surface samples, and samples of local rocks were obtained [2]. We report on chemical and mineral analyses of traverse samples and on two cores. Core DQ20 is a northeastern shoreline core. Its soluble salt concentration exceeds 200 micromoles/g in the top 5 cm, and then falls to less than 70 micromoles/g at the permafrost depth of 15 cm. These concentrations are low when compared to similarly positioned locations at Don Juan Pond and to cores from Prospect Mesa close to Lake Vanda, Wright Valley. Halite, soda niter, tachyhydrite and/bischovite are suggested from the ionic molar relationships\nMeasured halite concentrations of surface samples, collected along a traverse of 35 m from the pond outwards, range from over 5% to trace amounts, decreasing with distance. Gypsum is also present in almost all of these samples ranging from 0.2% to 2.6%, but does not exhibit a trend. However, in core DQ35, located at a distance of 15 m along the traverse, gypsum decreases from 2.5% to 0.6% from the surface to the permafrost depth of 12 cm.\nWhile DQ35 and radial samples show high quartz and albite abundance, samples that contained visible encrustations and evaporites are low in these minerals and rich in highly diverse alteration products.\nDon Juan Basin ponds may have formed by a complex surface water mobilization of weathering products [3] and local groundwater action [4,5]. In contrast, Don Quixote pond mineralogy and chemistry may be consistent with a less complex shallow and deep groundwater system origin [1].\n[1] Harris H.J.H. & Cartwright K., 1981, in: Dry Valley Drilling Project, L.D.

            "abstract": "Alaskan arctic lakes lay covered by up to three meters of ice and snow for approximately two-thirds of the year, yet comparatively little is known about their ecosystem metabolism during this period. We combined the use of free-water measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) and the laboratory incubation of sediment cores to characterize spatial and temporal patterns in the ecosystem respiration (ER) of five arctic lakes spanning a gradient in size from 1 to 150 ha. Seasonal rates of ER throughout the water column ranged from < 0.001 to 0.034 mg L-1 h-1; sediment ER ranged from mg 6.1 m-2 h-1 to 50.7 mg m-2 h-1. Although there were significant differences in sediment ER among lakes, average water column ER did not differ significantly. Seasonal patterns of DO draw down were most often linear. However, within the water column above the deepest basin of each lake, rates were higher during autumn – winter than winter – spring, with the lowest rates typically found in the upper 70% of the water column and the highest rates near the bottom. ER measured near the bottom along the slope of lake basins was lower than that at the center of lake basins and closer in magnitude to water column ER. Spatial patters in free-water rates were reflected by sediment ER, which was 21 – 66 % higher in cores collected from the deepest point of lake basins than in sediments collected at shallower locations found at the margin of basins. These observations suggest that two mechanisms operating in tandem account for the higher apparent rates of DO drawdown found within lake basins during the winter. Higher local rates of sediment ER and, similar to observations in other lakes, the transport of DO depleted waters from lake margins to deep basins. Together they contribute to the formation of hypoxia in the deeper basins of lakes and the concentration of other respiratory products, with important implications for energy flow within lakes and carbon budgets across the arctic.",

            "abstract": "Large silicic volcanic centers produce the most catastrophic eruptions on earth, but the processes and timescales of melt generation, storage, and extraction within these systems are not well known. Useful methods for constraining these timescales include 1) U-series dating of single zircons or bulk major minerals, which reveals the time at which a given mineral crystallized, and 2) diffusion profiles, which record the amount of time a single crystal spent above a given temperature prior to eruption. Recent work has directly linked these two techniques in plagioclase by combining diffusion profiles in single crystals with U-series dating of a bulk separate (Cooper and Kent, 2014, Nature v 506). In order to link timescales of crystallization (and thus residence) and diffusion within individual crystals in a large silicic system, we present in situ U-Th ages and diffusion profiles of Li in zircon from the most recent rhyolitic eruption of the Okataina Volcanic Center (OVC), part of the Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand. Li has been experimentally measured to diffuse across distances measureable by NanoSIMS (i.e., microns-submicron) on timescales relevant to magma storage at magmatic temperatures (Cherniak and Watson, 2010, Contrib Mineral Petrol v 160). Combining analyses of Li along NanoSIMS traverses in zircon with surface and interior SHRIMP-RG U-Th age spots reveals that long-lived zircons (with total residence times of up to 100 ka) preserve Li profiles reflecting relatively brief amounts of time (less than hundreds of years) spent at supersolidus conditions. These traverses suggest that only a few percent of the total lifetime of each crystal could have been spent at supersolidus (700-900°C) temperatures. These findings support other data suggesting that small-volume rhyolitic magmas within the OVC may have spent significant proportions of their pre-eruptive existences at near- or subsolidus conditions (e.g., Storm et al., 2012, Contrib Mineral Petrol v 163).",

            "abstract": "It has long been known that the vertical profile of ammonia within Jupiter's cloud layers is not well-described by a simple equilibrium profile, with saturated vapor above the cloud base and the well-mixed deep abundance below the cloud base. An additional depletion of ammonia by a factor of 4-10 is required by global microwave spectra at p < 6 bar [e.g., 1]. Dynamical effects, ranging from cloud layer circulation between belts and zones [2] to molecular differentiation following convective activity [3] might be sufficient to explain the global microwave data.\nHowever, in situ cloud density measurements by the Galileo Probe [4] suggest a large gap in our understanding of cloud chemistry in Jupiter, especially when combined with other tracers such as volatile mixing ratios [5] and static stability [6]. Using the “fresh clouds” method of modeling cloud density [7], and assuming that cloud-forming advection was weak at all levels in the probe site, we find that NH4SH formation cannot explain cloud densities between 1 and 1.4 bar in situ. The composition of additional chemical species, or adsorption of ammonia on other ices, are candidate processes that strongly require further laboratory study of the H2O-NH3-H2S volatile system at temperatures of 150 to 300 K [1]. Spectral features near 3 microns suggest widespread NH4SH in the visible cloud decks of Jupiter [8], but additional species may also contribute to absorption at these wavelengths. Infrared spectroscopy at high angular resolution in the future---performed by Juno, JWST, or 30-m class ground-based telescopes---may be able to observe ammonia depletion mechanisms in action.\n",

            "abstract": "Drought and heat waves greatly influenced vegetation growth and photosynthesis. With an increasing frequency, these extreme climate events could alter the carbon cycle at regional and continental scales. To better understand the impacts of drought and heat wave on vegetation and carbon fluxes in temperate terrestrial ecosystems, we first evaluated three vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI)) during 2000-2013 to determine the sensitivity of these vegetation indices to drought and heat waves in 2003 at 14 CO2 eddy covariance flux tower sites in Europe. We then ran the satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) at these sites and compared gross primary production (GPP) estimates from the VPM model (GPPVPM) with estimates from the eddy covariance measurements (GPPEC). The VPM model is driven by climate data (air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation) and two vegetation indices (EVI and LSWI). The comparison shows that the VPM model has a good capability in predicting vegetation photosynthesis in both normal and drought periods. The results from this research work not only reveals the various sensitivity of NDVI, EVI and LSWI to drought and heat wave in 2003, in Europe, but also shows that the VPM model is a robust tool for modeling GPP in terrestrial ecosystems in Europe.",

            "abstract": "Super-continents coalesce over subduction zone complexes and their subsequent dispersal is usually attributed to heating and upwelling of continent-insulated mantle. This dispersal mechanism, however, requires considerable mantle internal heating. Alternatively, the super-continent configuration may be mechanically unstable and disperse regardless of heating mode. In particular, increased drag on plates or subducting slabs (e.g., by accumulating continents) causes them to slow down and trenches to rollback. Once subcontinental slabs are slightly separated, resistance to their descent increases, inducing further trench migration. Slabs thus undergo a rollback instability, which disperses super-continents. A simple theoretical model illustrates this instability and shows there are two equilibrium states, one unstable super-continent state where slabs are conjoined, and one stable state where slabs are widely separated. Slab rollback from the unstable to stable states occurs at typical slow tectonic speeds, and over a period commensurate with the age of ocean basins and the Wilson cycle.",

            "abstract": "Based on glacio-meteorological measurements and mass-balance stake records during the five-year period of 2005–2010 on the southeast Tibetan Plateau, an energy-mass balance model was applied to study the surface mass balance of the Parlung No. 94 Glacier, as well as its response to regional climate conditions. The primary physical parameters involved in the model were locally calibrated by using relevant glacio-meteorological datasets. The good agreement between the snowpack height/mass balance simulations and the in-situ measurements available from a total of 12 monitoring stakes over this glacier confirmed the satisfactory performance of the energy-mass balance model. Results suggested that the recent state of the Parlung No. 94 Glacier was far removed from the ‘ideal’ climatic regime leading to zero mass balance, with its annual mass balance of approximately -0.9 m w.e. during 2005–2010. Climatic sensitivity experiments were also carried out to interpret the observed mass-balance changes, and the experiments demonstrated that the maritime glaciers concerned herein were theoretically more vulnerable to ongoing climate warming on the Tibetan Plateau than potential changes in the amount of precipitation. A plausible causal explanation for the recent glacier shrinkage in this region was concerned with the increasing air temperature. Moreover, both the mass balance simulations and the field measurements indicated that the mass accumulation over this maritime glacier occurred primarily in the boreal spring. Such “spring-accumulation type” glaciers are presumed to be distributed mainly within a narrow wedge-shaped region along the Brahmaputra River. Climatic sensitivities of the glacier mass balanceare also found to be closely linked to the regional precipitation seasonality that is simultaneously modulated by various atmospheric circulation patterns, such as the southern westerlies, the Bay of Bengal vortex in the spring season and the Indian monsoon in the summer season.",

            "abstract": "In a warming climate the vitality of mid-latitude glaciers is an important measure of local response to global climate change. However, debris-covered glaciers can respond to climate change in a nonlinear manner. Supraglacial debris alters the energy balance at the atmosphere-glacier interface compared with debris-free glaciers, and can result in both accelerated and reduced ablation through complex processes that occur on a variety of scales. Emmons Glacier, on the northeast slope of Mount Rainier (Washington, USA), offers an opportunity to study these processes in supraglacial debris that are otherwise difficult to study in situ (e.g. Himalayan glaciers). Emmons Glacier underwent a steady advance in the late 20th century despite a warming climate, in part due to increased surface debris cover.\nKey energy balance variables were measured in August of 2013 and 2014 using a temporary weather station installed directly on the debris-covered terminus of Emmons Glacier. Ablation of debris-covered ice was monitored in situ with ablation stakes drilled into the debris-covered ice in a 3600 m2 grid, a size comparable to a single pixel in leading thermal remote-sensing platforms. Debris thickness at the study site ranged from 3-50 cm at the ablation stakes, and textures varied from sand and gravel to large boulders with open pore space. Daily ablation rates varied by a factor of 5 in this small area and were affected by debris thickness, texture, and moisture as well as local surface slope and aspect. On this scale, ablation rates correlated better with debris surface temperature than air temperature. Spatial gradients in ablation rate may strongly influence long-term melt rates through evolving surface topography and consequent redistribution of supraglacial debris, but cannot be resolved using thermal imagery from most current satellite platforms. A preliminary field experiment with a ground-based thermal infrared camera yielded temperature measurements with fine spatial resolution (<1m pixel) and compared well with direct temperature measurements of the debris surface. This result suggests that high resolution ground-based or low-altitude (UAV) thermal imagery could become a valuable tool for monitoring change in debris-covered glaciers.",

            "abstract": "A prolonged episode of continental erosion during the latest Precambrian exposed crystalline basement rocks to atmospheric weathering over an area that is unprecedented in the rock record. As a result, an elevated flux of continental weathering products has been suggested as an important influence over seawater chemistry during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. The effects of strongly elevated pCO2 and reduced pO2 on the composition of the continental weathering flux to the oceans was investigated by geochemical and petrologic analysis of nine weathering profiles of early-late Cambrian age from Laurentia, Baltica and Gondwana. These included eight weathering horizons developed on basement rocks ranging from felsic to mafic in composition and one profile that developed on muds in an early Cambrian fluvial basin. Patterns of cation depletion and enrichment are comparable to those observed in modern weathering profiles, with the exception of Fe, which was depleted in all nine profiles analyzed. Thus, under Cambrian weathering conditions, Fe appears to have been preferentially leached and ultimately lost to the oceans, rather than accumulated in soils. These results are supported by clay mineralogy, which reveal structural Fe losses from pedogenic clays as well as from parent rocks in the upper 0.5 to 8 m of the profiles. Because the weathering flux of P is strongly coupled to Fe, these data imply a sustained and elevated flux of iron and phosphorous to the oceans from weathering across an exceptionally large area of exposed crystalline basement. This flux may have had several important consequences, including stimulation of primary productivity during the initial Phanerozoic radiation of the Metazoa.",

In the Mesozoic, the eastern parts of these two blocks experienced widespread lithospheric reactivation and magmatism under the extensional environment. In this study, we applied the P-wave receiver function and shear-wave splitting methods to the data recorded by the broadband temporary seismic array. The crustal thickness is in the range of 29–36km. From the NW part of the Jiangnan fault to the North China Craton, the Moho becomes deeper gradually. The common conversion point stacking result shows that the 410-km discontinuity is relatively flat while the 660-km discontinuity is deeper to the north of ~29°N than the south. Combined with seismic tomography studies, the results suggest that the base of the MTZ is influenced by the cold temperature environment of the ancient stagnant slabs to the north of ~29°N. The MTZ thickness under the Yangtze Block is larger relative to the IASP91 model. The fast polarization directions are NE-SW in Cathaysia Block, NW-SE and NEE-SWW in Yangtze block and NWW-SEE in eastern North China Craton. The Fresnel zone analysis indicates that the anisotropy in the relatively shallow depth varies significantly from the Cathaysia Block to the Yangtze block, indicating the significantly different lithospheric structures of them. The Jiangnan fault is revealed as an important boundary within the Yangtze block.",

Recent observations from Kaguya and Chandrayaan have shown that lunar magnetic anomalies efficiently reflect incoming solar wind protons, providing substantial shielding of portions of the crust, with potential implications for both space weathering and surface sputtering. The two ARTEMIS probes have made a number of low-altitude (tens of kilometers) passes over regions with moderately strong crustal magnetic fields, at local times both near the sub-solar point and at the terminator. Several such passes occurred over a region of the surface containing unusual albedo markings - or \"swirls\" - that could indicate a local reduction in space weathering. We investigate the ARTEMIS low-altitude passes in detail, focusing on how the observed reflected protons and other local modifications of charged particle distributions and electromagnetic fields relate to the properties of the surface.",

            "abstract": "We used data recorded at 86 broadband seismic stations of the IDOR Passive Seismic Project to determine upper mantle anisotropy across the suture along which Blue Mountain island-arc terranes accreted to North America during Cretaceous. This suture is currently associated with the Western Idaho Shear Zone (WISZ), a narrow, highly-deformed ductile fault that was the locus of both dextral strike-slip along, and subduction beneath, the Paleozoic margin of the North American craton. We measured shear wave splitting intensity (SI), a seismic observable that is suitable for use in 3-D inversions of upper mantle seismic anisotropy, to determine these fabrics beneath the IDOR network. SI fast-polarization directions are spatially coherent across the region, and fall into three main groups: a group with fast azimuths trending ENE-WSW, observed at stations in eastern Oregon and the NW-SE-striking western Snake River Plain; a group with E-W trending fast azimuths observed at stations along the WISZ and the Idaho Batholith, which outcrops immediately east of the suture zone; and a group with ENE-WSW trending fast azimuths observed at stations situated in the Basin-and-Range extended region of southeastern Idaho. SI delay times range from 0.46 to 1.85 seconds, with a mean of 1.1 s. We also used backazimuthal variations of SI at all stations to invert for for 3-D anisotropic fabric using the finite-frequency approach called vectorial tomography (Chevrot and Monteiller, 2009). Our preliminary results are consistent with alignment of upper mantle fabrics in the extension direction as Basin-and-Range extension propagates northward into less-extended regions of Idaho and Oregon.",

            "abstract": "We explore the hypothesis that year-to-year differences in the orbital angular momentum of Mars [Shirley, this meeting] can contribute to the interannual variability of the Mars climate. For much of the year, the seasonal cycle of the atmospheric circulation is highly repeatable, being driven by global insolation patterns; however, during southern summer (the ‘dust storm season’), the atmosphere is more highly variable from year-to-year. The processes underlying this variability are not yet clear. As a means of addressing this uncertainty, we explore the possibility that the root cause may be extrinsic to the atmospheric system itself. Recent work has uncovered a mechanism for a coupling of Mars’ orbital and rotational motions that yields heretofore-unsuspected accelerations on the martian atmosphere. These accelerations, while instantaneously small (on the order of 10-5 ms-2), may cumulatively yield wind velocity changes of several 10s of ms-1 on seasonal timescales.\nHere, we use the MarsWRF general circulation model to examine the effect of these newly identified coupling term accelerations (CTAs) on Mars’ atmospheric circulation. The accelerations vary significantly with time, and exhibit variable phasing with respect to Mars’ annual cycle. We have run MarsWRF with the inclusion of the additional accelerations for a range of years from MY -16 (1924) to MY 34 (2018). We find that interannual variability in the model output derives largely from differences in the sign and magnitude of the CTAs, confirming one of the predictions of the physical hypothesis. During certain seasons the overall circulation is strengthened by the CTAs, while at other times the CTAs disappear. Resultant surface wind stresses, which are a function of the near-surface winds, are enhanced during periods when the CTAs attain maximum values. We have begun to explore the relationship between the CTAs and the martian dust cycle through its influence on these surface stresses.",

            "abstract": "Hydrate saturation of gas-hydrate bearing sediment is a key of gas production from natural gas-hydrate reservoir. Developable natural gas-hydrates by conventional gas/oil production apparatus almost exist in unconsolidated sedimental layer. Generally, hydrate saturations of sedimental samples are directly estimated by volume of gas generated from dissociation of gas hydrates in pore spaces, porosity data and volume of the sediments. Furthermore, hydrate saturation can be also assessed using velocity of P-wave through sedimental samples. Nevertheless, hydrate saturation would be changed by morphological variations (grain-coating, cementing and pore-filling model) of gas hydrates in pore spaces. Jin et al.[1,2] recently observed the O-H stretching bands of H2O molecules of methane hydrate in porous media using an attenuated total reflection IR (ATR−IR) spectra. They observed in situ hydrate formation/dissociation process in sandy samples (Tohoku Keisya number 8, grain size of ca. 110 μm). In this presentation, we present IR spectroscopy approach to in situ evaluation of hydrate saturation of pressured gas-hydrate sediments.

            "abstract": "The Kalkarindji continental flood basalt province (CFBP) of northern Australia is the oldest Phanerozoic large igneous province (LIP) in the world. The extent of this Middle Cambrian LIP has been estimated to at least 2.1 x 106 km2 with exposures in Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland, and South Australia. The research into Kalkarindji is still in its infancy with only a handful of studies published. The rocks of the Kalkarindji province occur as lava flows, sills, dykes, and volcanic tuffs. Kalkarindji has been linked to an extinction event at the Early-Middle Cambrian boundary. The Kalkarindji province displays Low-Ti values and high SiO2 values compared to other large igneous provinces, enriched 87Sr/86Sr values, and low 187Os/188Os. This project presents a large data set of new geochemical analyses of the various constituents of the Kalkarindji CFBP. Source mixing calculations, assimilation and fractionation models, coupled with Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to understand the petrogenesis of the province. The trace element and 87Sr/86Sr values indicate a contribution of enriched crustal-like material into the source region; however, the Os values fall into typical mantle ranges. These geochemical patterns suggest that the mantle source(s) of the Kalkarindji CFBP has been directly enriched at some stage of history, before the emplacement of the province. This study will provide further insights into the magma source and origin processes needed to create one of the world’s largest and oldest Phanerozoic large igneous provinces.",

Sediment cores recovered from fjords along the eastern margin of the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands (51°S, 166°E) are ideally located to sensitively record changes in the strength and position of the SHWW throughout the Holocene. A 5.75m core from Hanfield Inlet preserves both marine and terrestrial environmental components, which we use to develop a multiproxy record of past climatic conditions. This core, composed entirely of brown marine mud and silt, was recovered from a depth of 44m. Based on the entrance sill depth of the fjord (10mbsl) and our knowledge of regional sea level rise, we infer that the base of the core will be early Holocene in age, which will be confirmed using radiocarbon age dating. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages (125-500μm fraction) in surface and downcore samples are dominated by three taxa, Nonionellina flemingi, Cassidulina carinata and Quinqueloculina seminula. These species are either shallow infaunal or infaunal. We will use stable carbon (δ¹³C) and oxygen (δ¹⁸O) isotope geochemistry of the benthic foraminifera Nonionellina flemingi, Bolivina cf. earlandi, Trifarina angulosa, Bulimina marginata f. marginata and Cibicides species (all identified from Rose Bengal stained box-core samples) to reconstruct water column fluctuations associated with frontal migration.

            "abstract": "Water is the most abundant volatile species in explosively erupting silicic magmas and significantly affects magma viscosity, magma fragmentation and the dynamics of the eruption column. The effect that water has on these eruption processes can be modulated by outgassing degassing from a permeable magma. The magnitude, rate and timing of outgassing during magma ascent, in particular in relation to fragmentation, remains a subject of debate. Here we constrain how much, how fast and where the erupting magma lost its water during the 1060 CE Plinian phase of the Glass Mountain eruption of Medicine Lake Volcano, California.\nUsing thermogravimetric analysis coupled with numerical modeling, we show that the magma lost >90% of its initial water upon eruption. Textural analyses of natural pumices, together with numerical modeling of magma ascent and degassing, indicate that 65-90% of the water exsolved before fragmentation, but very little was able to outgas before fragmentation. The magma attained permeability only within about 1 to 10 seconds before fragmenting and during that time interval permeable gas flow resulted in only a modest amount of gas flux from the un-fragmented magma. Instead, most of the water is lost shortly after fragmentation, because gas can escape rapidly from lapilli-size pyroclasts. This results in an efficient rarefaction of the gas-pyroclast mixture above the fragmentation level, indicating that the development of magma permeability and ensuing permeable outgassing are a necessary condition for sustain explosive eruptions of silicic magma. Magma permeability is thus a double-edged sword, it facilitates both, the effusive and the explosive eruption of silicic magma. ",

            "abstract": "As part of a study on how vegetation water use and permafrost dynamics impact stream flow in the boreal forest discontinuous permafrost zone, a Bayesian modeling framework has been developed to assess the effect of parameter uncertainties in an integrated vegetation water use and simple, first-order, non-linear hydrological model. Composed of a front-end Bayes driver and a backend interactive hydrological model, the system is meant to facilitate rapid execution of seasonal simulations driven by hundreds to thousands of parameter variations to analyze the sensitivity of the system to a varying parameter space in order to derive more effective parameterizations for larger-scale simulations. The backend modeling component provides an Application Programming Interface (API) for introducing parameters in the form of constant or time-varying scalars or spatially distributed grids.\nIn this work, we describe the basic structure of the flexible, object-oriented modeling system and test its performance against collected basin data from headwater catchments of varying permafrost extent and ecosystem structure (deciduous versus coniferous vegetation). We will also analyze model and sub-model (evaporation, transpiration, precipitation and streamflow) sensitivity to parameters through application of the system to two catchment basins of the Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed (CPCRW) located in Interior Alaska. The C2 basin is a mostly permafrost-free, south facing catchment dominated by deciduous vegetation. The C3 basin is underlain by more than 50% permafrost and is dominated by coniferous vegetation. The ultimate goal of the modeling system is to improve parameterizations in mesoscale hydrologic models, and application of the HYPE system to the well-instrumented CPCRW provides a valuable opportunity for experimentation.",

The section, between Peru and Tahiti, encompasses a range of processes that influence the supply, removal, and internal cycling of trace metals and offers the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the drivers of the transport and fate of contaminants in the ocean. The capability to analyze water and filtered particulate samples in the quantities available, allows us to determine the partitioning of selected radionuclides among dissolved and particulate forms (Kd) and estimate Pu-particulate fluxes.\nThe overarching objective of our work is to determine the concentrations of several anthropogenic radionuclides, including 239Pu, 240Pu, 237Np, and 137Cs with sufficient resolution to define their basin-wide distributions in the Pacific Ocean. Data collected in the East Pacific Rise hydrothermal plume allows a discussion on the partitioning behavior of plutonium and neptunium.",

            "abstract": "Understanding of the state of the cryosphere and its relationship to other components of the Earth system requires both models of geophysical processes and observations of geophysical properties and processes, however linking observations and models is far from trivial. This paper looks at examples from sea ice and land ice model-observation linkages to examine some approaches, challenges and solutions.\nIn a sea-ice example, ice deformation is analyzed as a key process that indicates fundamental changes in the Arctic sea ice cover. Simulation results from the Los Alamos Sea-Ice Model CICE, which is also the sea-ice component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), are compared to parameters indicative of deformation as derived from mathematical analysis of remote sensing data. Data include altimeter, micro-ASAR and image data from manned and unmanned aircraft campaigns (NASA OIB and Characterization of Arctic Sea Ice Experiment, CASIE). The key problem to linking data and model results is the derivation of matching parameters on both the model and observation side.\nFor terrestrial glaciology, we include an example of a surge process in a glacier system and and example of a dynamic ice sheet model for Greenland. To investigate the surge of the Bering Bagley Glacier System, we use numerical forward modeling experiments and, on the data analysis side, a connectionist approach to analyze crevasse provinces. In the Greenland ice sheet example, we look at the influence of ice surface and bed topography, as derived from remote sensing data, on on results from a dynamic ice sheet model.",

            "abstract": "The Eastern Tropical South Pacific upwelling zone, where low to undetectable oxygen concentrations exist in the water column, is a region of intense nitrous oxide (N2O) production in the ocean. N2O production is generally attributed to nitrification and denitrification in oxic and anoxic waters, respectively, with overlap under suboxic conditions. Seawater samples from different depths and in situ oxygen concentrations were incubated with 15N tracer labeled substrates (NH4+, NO2- and NO3-) to measure potential N2O production rates. These rates were used to determine contributions of nitrification and denitrification to total N2O production.\nN2O reached maximum concentrations at the base of oxycline just above the oxygen deficient zone (ODZ) and nitrification was the major production pathway. The N2O yield from nitrification, i.e., the ratio of N2O to NO2- production from NH4+, increased from ~0.04% to ~1% as oxygen concentration decreased from 100% to ~1% saturation. This relationship is consistent with culture studies showing increased N2O yield from nitrification at low oxygen; and thus with high N2O production rate from nitrification in the oxycline. N2O production from NO3- was detected at the base of oxycline. Highest N2O production rates (up to 10 nM d-1) were detected at the top of the ODZ, with denitrification as the major pathway. At the secondary nitrite maximum within the core of the ODZ, rates of N2O production from denitrification were relatively high despite low N2O concentration, suggesting N2O reduction to N2 must be co-occurring. This implies rapid N2O turnover by denitrification within the ODZ and a close coupling between production and consumption. These results indicate that oxygen concentrations greatly influence both the magnitude of N2O production and the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification. Because most N2O production occurred in the oxycline and in the uppermost layer of the ODZ, anticipated spatial expansion of these zones could increase the extent of N2O production and the marine N2O efflux to the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "During strong El Niño events, sea level drops around tropical western Pacific islands by up to 20–30 cm. Such extreme events (referred to in Samoa as ‘taimasa’) expose shallow reefs, thereby damaging associated coastal ecosystems and contributing to the formation of ‘flat topped coral heads’ often referred to as microatolls. We show that during the termination of strong El Niño events, a southward movement of weak trade winds prolongs extreme low sea levels in the southwestern Pacific. Whereas future sea levels are projected to gradually rise, recent modeling evidence suggests that the frequency of strong El Niño events (which alter local trade winds and sea level) is very likely to increase with greenhouse warming. Such changes could exacerbate El Niño-related sea level drops, especially in the tropical southwestern Pacific. Using present-generation coupled climate models forced with increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations, we assess how the interplay between global mean sea level rise, on one hand, and more frequent interannual sea level drops, on the other, will affect future coastal sea levels in the tropical Pacific.",

Recent advances in ocean bottom broadband seismometry (e.g., Suetsugu & Shiobara, 2014, Annual Review EPS), together with advances in the seismic analysis methodology, have now enabled us to resolve the regional 1-D structure of the entire lithosphere/asthenosphere system, including seismic anisotropy (both radial and azimuthal), with deployments of ~10-15 broadband ocean bottom seismometers (BBOBSs) (namely “ocean-bottom broadband dispersion survey”; Takeo et al., 2013, JGR; Kawakatsu et al., 2013, AGU; Takeo, 2014, Ph.D. Thesis; Takeo et al., 2014, JpGU). Having ~15 BBOBSs as an array unit for 2-year deployment, and repeating such deployments in a leap-frog way (an array of arrays) for a decade or so would enable us to cover a large portion of the Pacific basin. Such efforts, not only by giving regional constraints on the 1-D structure, but also by sharing waveform data for global scale waveform tomography, would drastically increase our knowledge of how plate tectonics works on this planet, as well as how it worked for the past 150 million years.

In atmospheric and climate sciences, there are great expectations for the integration and reuse of data for advancing science. To realize this potential, resources are needed that explicate the range of repository options available for locating and depositing open data, their conditions of access and use, and the services and tools they provide.\nThis study profiled 38 open digital repositories in the atmospheric and climate sciences, analyzing each on 55 criteria through content analysis of their websites. The results provide a systematic way to assess and compare capabilities, services, and institutional characteristics and identify trends across repositories. Selected results from the more detailed outcomes to be presented:\nMost repositories offer guidance on data format(s) for submission and dissemination.\n42% offer authorization-free access.\nMore than half use some type of data identification system such as DOIs.\nNearly half offer some data processing, with a similar number providing software or tools.\n78.9% request that users cite or acknowledge datasets used and the data center.\nOnly 21.1% recommend specific metadata standards, such as ISO 19115 or Dublin Core, with more than half utilizing a customized metadata scheme.\nInformation was rarely provided on repository certification and accreditation and uneven for transfer of rights and data security.\nFew provided policy information on preservation, migration, reappraisal, disposal, or long-term sustainability.\nAs repository use increases, it will be important for institutions to make their procedures and policies explicit, to build trust with user communities and improve efficiencies in data sharing.

Many of the previous studies have reported the decreasing trends of pan evaporation in the area of the continental climate of the middle latitude. However, few studies in the region in a high latitude area such as Finland haven't been carried out so far. The purpose of this study is to investigate the long term variations of pan evaporation in Finland located in high latitude using a trend analysis. The causes of the trends of pan evaporation were discussed from two points of view: a complementary relationship and Penman's equation (1948). The results were summarized as follows: (1) The variations of pan evaporation showed decreasing trends at 5 stations and increasing ones at 2 stations. (2) The mechanistic causes for the decreasing trends at 5 stations were mainly the increases of precipitation and the aerodynamic term in Penman's equation. (3) The mechanistic causes for the increasing trends at 2 stations couldn't be revealed.\nH. L. Penman. 1948.

            "abstract": "The effusion rate of lava from a basaltic volcano is a parameter of critical importance given its direct association with hazard—for example, high effusion rates imply long lava flows. At Kīlauea Volcano, Hawai‘i, numerous methods have been used to quantify effusion rate, including direct observation of lava streams, measurement of gas emissions, geologic mapping, modeling of thermal radiance, and quantification of topographic change. None of these techniques, however, have consistently yielded reliable results since about 2008, due to either changes in the character of volcanism or the expense associated with data collection. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from the TanDEM-X satellite mission offer a potential solution to this problem. Differencing digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from temporally sequential TanDEM-X SAR imagery provides measure of elevation change over time due to accumulation of lava across the entirety of Kīlauea’s 100 km2 East Rift Zone lava flow field. Summing these elevation changes over the area of an active lava flow and dividing by the time spanned by the TanDEM-X data gives the time-averaged discharge rate (TADR) of lava. The TADR calculated from multiple TanDEM-X-derived DEMs spanning days to weeks at Kīlauea during mid-2011 to mid-2013 suggests a dense-rock equivalent lava discharge rate of approximately 2 m3/s, which is about half the long-term average rate over the course of Kīlauea’s 1983–present East Rift Zone eruption. This result implies an increase in the rate of lava storage at Kīlauea, a decrease in the magma supply rate, or some combination of both with respect to previous years. TanDEM-X-derived topographic maps also provide insights into the four-dimensional growth of Kīlauea’s lava flow field—a dataset not available by other means but important for assessing the factors that control current and future lava flow pathways.",

Until now Wb could not be retrieved from space. CCN is crudely estimated from aerosol optical properties. This practice is fraught with problems, especially in the vicinity of clouds, where it is needed most. In very low aerosol concentrations, where a small absolute difference in CCN makes a big difference in cloud properties, the aerosol optical properties become almost useless. These obstacles have impeded satellite quantification of cloud-aerosol interactions and explain the large uncertainty that we still have in ascribing these effects to climate forcing. Here I show emerging breakthrough capabilities to retrieve from satellites measurements both CCN(S) and Wb. This makes it possible to use the clouds as CCN chambers, where S is set and the nucleated cloud drop concentrations are counted. Retrieving convective cloud base drop concentrations (Nd) and updraft speed (Wb) allows the calculation of S. Then Nd is in fact CCN(S). The prospects of satellite retrievals of both CCN(S) and Wb will allow disentangling the effects of CCN and updrafts on cloud microstructure and radiative effects.",

            "abstract": "Present thermal evolution models for continental rifting are based on pure-shear extension (McKenzie 1978), in which crustal and mantle strain is co-located and all rocks cool throughout rifting. However, the multi-phase rift model of Lavier and Manatschal (2006) accommodates lithospheric extension via spatially offset crustal and mantle strains, producing depth-dependent thinning and exhumation of lithospheric mantle. Significant reheating of the upper plate is a natural consequence of this model. We seek to constrain the temperature-time history of the upper-plate Tethyan margin preserved in Corsica to discriminate between the two thermal models.\nA record of the conditions and timing of reheating is preserved in the age and trace element compositions of metamorphic zircon overgrowths. Zircon from the hanging wall and footwall of the Jurassic-age Belli Piani shear zone (Beltrando et al 2013) were depth-profiled for both U-Pb and trace element concentrations via LA-ICP-MS split streaming. Across both sides of the shear zone, U-Pb ages show a strong population of 275-300 Ma grains. However, a subset of footwall grains show 165-210 Ma overgrowths. These ages indicate that the margin reached temperature conditions sufficient for zircon saturation and subsequent zircon growth. These lower crustal findings are consistent with prior observations made within the sedimentary succession, which records rapid thermal uplift, karstification, and subsequent drowning of Triassic dolostones contemporaneous with the opening of the Alpine Tethys (Decarlis and Lualdis 2008). Ti-in-zircon thermometry yields temperatures of ~720°C in the hanging wall and ~830°C in the footwall. This is consistent with the appearance of overgrowths, and provides further support that the Belli Piani shear zone was active during Jurassic rifting. Collectively, these data point directly to a rift-coeval reheating event that affected the entire crustal pile and lend support to the multi-stage Lavier and Manatschal model.",

            "abstract": "Evolution of the epikarst begins with the enlargement of micro-fractures. As hydraulic channels become connected to an exit system, the hydraulic gradient will drive continued development of primary karst channels. But, what is the genesis of micro-fracture evolution into channelized paths? We investigate two mechanisms and their role in the physical and chemical evolution of the microfracture. During liquid drainage, air-water interfacial instability leads to development of capillary droplets embedded in rock surface films. Pressure gradient between capillary droplets and rock surface films drives liquid into droplets via the matrix skin. Droplet paths may predispose the rock phase to greater dissolution relative to paths that experience only film flow. Successive droplets down the same path, as seen in experiments, could lead to linear erosional features that evolve toward pipe development. The rate of geochemical dissolution by these liquid elements depends upon fluid carrying capacity and dissolution kinetics. One of the mechanisms important to calcite dissolution is diffusion of CO2 from fracture air into the liquid elements. Exchange of fracture and atmospheric air can reset gas composition within the fracture system. A mechanism for regular flushing of microfracture air is suggested where nightly inverted thermal gradients in the upper 30 cm of rock near the rock-atmosphere interface, can trigger gas density instabilities within the microfracture that travel deeper into the epikarst, potentially flushing the entire microfracture system with atmospheric air. Such diurnal gas flushing would serve as a reset switch for microfracture-gas-chemistry towards atmospheric values on a daily basis. The net dissolution rate of microfractures, and the rate and spatial distribution of dissolved substances delivered to subsurface caverns, would depend on these two mechanisms of liquid motion and gas venting.",

The water vapor measurements of the EOS-MLS and ACE-FTS are examined and stratified according to the ISCCP deep convection indices. Moreover, trajectory models are used to aid the identification of deep convection impacted water vapor samples. It is found that the convection impacted samples are significantly moister than the nonimpact samples at the lowermost stratospheric layer right above the tropopause, but a dryer tendency is also noticed right above the moistened layer. On the other hand, a substantial fraction of high concentration samples in the datasets cannot be attributed to the moistening effect. Implications of the results are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogeological forecasting problems, like many subsurface forecasting problems, often suffer from the scarcity of reliable data yet complex prior information about the underlying earth system. Assimilating and integrating this information into an earth model requires using iterative parameter space exploration techniques or Monte Carlo Markov Chain techniques. Since such an earth model needs to account for many large and small scale features of the underlying system, as the system gets larger, iterative modeling can become computationally prohibitive, in particular when the forward model would allow for only a few hundred model evaluations. In addition, most modeling methods do not include the purpose for which inverse method are built, namely, the actual forecast and usually focus only on data and model.\nIn this study, we present a technique to extract features of the earth system informed by time-varying dynamic data (data features) and those that inform a time-varying forecasting variable (forecast features) using Functional Principal Component Analysis. Canonical Coefficient Analysis is then used to examine the relationship between these features using a linear model. When this relationship suggests that the available data informs the required forecast, a simple linear regression can be used on the linear model to directly estimate the posterior of the forecasting problem, without any iterative inversion of model parameters. This idea and method is illustrated using an example of contaminant flow in an aquifer with complex prior, large dimension and non-linear flow & transport model.",

However, the mechanism by which these particles form and grow, and how other compounds are taken up into the particle, is currently not well characterized. It appears that in many cases, the SOA is a highly viscous material such that uptake of semi-volatile oxidation products is irreversible. The goal of the present experiments was to study the incorporation of organic nitrates into SOA formed in the ozolonylsis of α-pinene using a large volume, slow-flow, stainless steel aerosol flow reactor. Gas phase 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (2EHN) was monitored by GC/MS using a simultaneous scan/single ion monitoring (SIM) mode following the signal at m/z 46 (NO2+) specific to organic nitrate. In addition, particle size distributions were monitored using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and polydisperse particles were collected onto a Ge-ATR crystal using a custom impactor located at the end of the flow reactor (30 min reaction time). Particulate 2EHN was quantified by GC/MS after extraction of the SOA impacted on the Ge crystal. In parallel, evaporation of the SOA and its components was monitored by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Insights into phase of the SOA and the uptake coefficient of 2EHN in the O3/α-pinene SOA are presented.",

            "abstract": "The Deep Horizon oil spill incident on April 20, 2010 potentially compromised the Gulf Coast’s ecosystem and human health through the marine food chain. One of the mitigation strategies to impede oil migration to the Gulf Coast’s shorelines was to burn off crude oil, which resulted in the production of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions such as, benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, and benzo[b]fluoranthene compounds. Noticeable high deaths of marine animals and a decline in phytoplankton productivity have been linked to PAH- and dispersant-toxicity. Phytoplankton plays a pivotal role in natural food chains, production of O2, and capture of CO2.   Grambling State University’s Water Quality Management students used the University of New Hampshire’s Student Climate Data website and the NASA DICCE data portal in learning activities to understand impacts of spill mitigation on chlorophyll a concentrations. Students used NASA Giovanni data and spectral satellite images to examine phytoplankton productivity around coastal shorelines, including Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the Florida pan-handle. Area-averaged time series from Giovanni indicated that June was the peak month for chlorophyll a from 2007 to 2012. Spectral images showed that chlorophyll a concentrations between 2.5-30mg/m3 were widely distributed around the shorelines of Louisiana, Mississippi, and the Florida pan-handle from June 2007 to June 2008. Students then examined chlorophyll a concentrations in April 2010 and May 2010. Data obtained from spectral images by students showed phytoplankton blooms with a 2.5mg/m3 concentration dramatically decreased from that of April 2010. Next students examined phytoplankton productivity from 0.08-30mg/m3 in the month of June for 2010, 2011, and 2012. In June 2010, a pattern of movement in phytoplankton blooms was observed toward southwest Louisiana and Texas shorelines. Comparative data from June 2011 and June 2012 demonstrated a low concentration of chlorophyll a of 10mg/m3 around the shorelines of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the Florida pan-handle, indicating a decline in phytoplankton productivity. Students believed that phytoplankton movement and low productivity was caused by exposure to PAH- and dispersant-toxicity.",

            "abstract": "We present highly resolved observations of fluorescence and optical backscatter taken in the estuarine turbidity maxima (ETM) of the North Channel of the Columbia River estuary (USA) during summer 2013. Measurements were made using two REMUS-100 autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with ECO Puck triplets. Concentrations of three phytoplankton pigments were measured by fluorescence emission at wavelengths of 695 nm for chlorophyll, 570 nm for phycoerythrin, and 680 nm for phycocyanin. We use phycocyanin to indicate the presence of freshwater phytoplankton. Optical backscatter at wavelengths of 700 nm and 880 nm are used to characterize turbidity. During flood tide, high phycocyanin concentrations were associated with a strong ETM event which had relatively low salinity waters of approximately 6 psu. These data indicate that this low salinity ETM event contained large concentrations of freshwater phytoplankton. Since freshwater phytoplankton are known to lyse in saltwater, the brackish ETM event may have formed by the accumulation of lysed freshwater phytoplankton that settled out from the river as it mixed in the lower estuary. As the flood tide proceeded, it brought high concentrations of marine phytoplankton into the north channel at mid-depth as indicated by high chlorophyll levels with significantly lower phycoerythrin concentrations in high salinity waters of approximately 30 psu. The data set highlights the potential for large variability in phytoplankton species composition and concentrations within the ETM depending on mixing rates and phytoplankton bloom dynamics. Visualization of the 4-D data is aided by generating interpolated data movies.",

The Servita fault possibly was originated like a suture that derived of a continental collision in Late Mesoproterozoic times when Rodinia was conform totally. The Servita Fault as normal fault in Mesozoic times contributed to the Colombian Cretaceous basin development. In Late Cretaceous because to collision of the Caribbean plate with the northwestern corner of South America a strong compressive stress was occur and kinematics changes were presented in the normal faults restrained to the basin like among others the Servita Fault, where these were converted in inverse faults. From early Pliocene until Present times the Servita Fault controlled the growth of the Cordillera and the Llanos foothills in this sector of Central Colombia. Result of this is the seismicity activity registered for this region from historical times (less of 500 years for Colombian case).\nTwo earthquakes have transcended in this region in last three centuries: the first one occurred on October 18th, 1743 with a current probabilistic magnitude greater than 6.5 and the second one struck on May 24th, 2008 with a M = 5.9.\nIn this work we show how this fault has develop from its origin, and how this can would produce a M > 6.5 earthquake very close to metropolitan area of Bogota D.C., and Villavicencio.

Sunward magnetic perturbations over the northern polar region are consistent with field-aligned currents directed downward in the morning and upward in the evening. The average total current is typically 30 kA, with nominal current densities of 20 nA per square meter. Observations from orbits with minimum altitudes spanning 50 to 500 km are used to test whether the signature varies as the square root of the background magnetic field intensity, as is expected for Birkeland currents. The data also provide confirmation that currents close below the observation altitude, and measurements obtained from the lowest spacecraft periapsis distances set upper limits on the closure altitude of the currents. Initial modeling of current closure in a spherical shell model indicates that the currents may close within the planet itself, radially through the outermost layers of low electrical conductivity, and laterally at greater depth where the conductivity is presumed to be substantially higher as a result of greater temperatures in the semiconducting lower crust and upper mantle. We present results of an electrostatic solution in spherical geometry modified for a conductivity that increases with depth, consistent with expectations from radial temperature profiles given by thermal history models, to constrain the conductivity properties of the north polar region of Mercury.",

            "abstract": "Cratons are continental nuclei that have been tectonically quiescent for at least a billion years. They show distinct geological and geophysical signatures from younger continental regions. Some Precambrian crustal generation models suggest a change in tectonic processes at the end of the Archean, marking the onset of modern-style plate tectonics and different lithospheric growth mechanisms.\nEastern Canada comprises Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic terranes, recording tectonic events spanning ~3 Ga of Earth history. It is a natural laboratory to test hypotheses concerning craton genesis and Precambrian plate tectonics. To constrain structural variations across this region, a new broadband seismograph network has been deployed from southernmost Hudson Bay to coastal Nova Scotia. The main profile crosses major tectonic boundaries between the Superior craton, the Proterozoic Grenville and Phanerozoic Appalachian provinces.\nA profile of crustal structure across the major tectonic terranes was constructed from transdimensional Bayesian receiver function inversions. 1D structure beneath individual stations is described in terms of two parameters: shear wavespeed variation with depth, and likelihood of discontinuity, both defined probabilistically. A clear Moho can be identified at about 36-42 km with variable transition width. Moreover, a persistent sub-continental lithospheric impedance contrast is detected at 52-57 km beneath most stations. The ubiquity of this feature across a profile spanning 3 Ga of lithospheric processes could imply that post-cratonization chemical modification may have homogenized the uppermost mantle.\nSmall age-dependent variations in mean bulk crustal Vp/Vs ratios are revealed from receiver function H-k stacking: ~1.71, ~1.77 and ~1.75 for the Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic respectively. Crustal thickness also varies systematically with age, with Moho depths of ~35 km for the Archean and Phanerozoic but up to 10 km thicker in some parts of the Proterozoic. These results are consistent with a non-plate tectonic origin for the predominantly felsic and thin Archean crust, as opposed to more mafic Proterozoic terranes with deeper crustal roots that do not reciprocate the low-relief surface topography.",

            "abstract": "Meteorological drought indices are often assumed to accurately characterize the severity of a drought event; however, these indices do not necessarily reflect the likelihood or severity of a particular type of drought impact experienced on the ground. In previous research, this link between index and impact was often estimated based on thresholds found by experience, measured using composite indices with assumed weighting schemes, or defined based on very narrow impact measures, using either a narrow spatial extent or very specific impacts. This study expands on earlier work by demonstrating the feasibility of relating user-provided impact reports to the climatological drought indices SPI and SPEI by logistic regression. The user-provided drought impact reports are based on the European Drought Impact Inventory (EDII, www.geo.uio.no/edc/droughtdb/), a newly developed online database that allows both public report submission and querying the more than 4,000 reported impacts spanning 33 European countries. This new tool is used to quantify the link between meteorological drought indices and impacts focusing on four primary impact types, spanning agriculture, energy and industry, public water supply, and freshwater ecosystem across five European countries. Statistically significant climate indices are retained as predictors using step-wise regression and used to compare the most relevant drought indices and accumulation periods for different impact types and regions. Agricultural impacts are explained best by 2-12 month anomalies, with 2-3 month anomalies found in predominantly rain-fed agricultural regions, and anomalies greater than 3 months related to agricultural management practices. Energy and industry impacts, related to hydropower and energy cooling water in these countries, respond to longer accumulated precipitation anomalies (6-12 months). Public water supply and freshwater ecosystem impacts are explained by a more complex combination of short (1-3 month) and seasonal (6-12 month) anomalies. A mean of 47.0% (22.4-71.6%) impact deviance is explained by the resulting models, highlighting the feasibility of using such statistical techniques and drought impact databases to model drought impact likelihood based on relatively easily calculated meteorological drought indices.",

            "abstract": "Recently a new tsunami forecast system SIFT (Short-term Inundation and Forecasting of Tsunamis) has been declared operational by the National Weather Service (NWS) Tsunami Warning Centers. The SIFT system assimilates real-time information from a network of observing systems deployed in the open ocean, to produce on-the-fly estimates of tsunami impact at specific coastal communities. These estimates are computed via the tsunami simulation code MOST (Method of Splitting Tsunami) and include forecast products such as tsunami arrival time, duration of the event, predicted tsunami currents, maximum sea surface elevation and expected inundation areas. These computations are performed under the assumption that the mean sea level remains constant at Mean High Water (MHW) during the entire tsunami event. This assumption produces conservative tsunami forecasts that tend to err on the side of caution with the possibility of substantial overestimates of the inundation areas. To avoid this problem and produce more accurate, operational tsunami forecasts, we investigate the interaction of tsunamis with a longer period water level variation due to tidal forcing, by comparing simulations of the 2011 Japan event at different at different locations with and without tidal effects. Our results demonstrate that while non-linear effects resulting from this interaction are minimal in water surface elevation, they can have a significant effect on inundation areas. Based on these findings we propose a simple, first-order correction to the standard MHW forecast, that can be performed on-the-fly by the SIFT system without the need for complex tidal models.",

            "abstract": "The hadal zone (depths greater than 6000 m), comprising mostly deep trenches on Earth, represents the largest poorly understood and the most mysterious habitat on Earth. Hadal Science and Technology Program (HADSTEP), the first Chinese deep-sea program focusing primarily on the hadal zones, was financially supported by Chinese Academy of Sciences in April, 2014. The objective of this program is to explore and understand of the deepest environments and their ecosystems on Earth, in combination with the development of hadal technology. The main research interests of this program are to determine (i) the community structure, ecological function, and evolution of the hadal communities, (ii) the environmental features and biogeochemical processes of hadal zones, (iii) the impact of deep-sea current and tectonic activity on hadal fauna, and (iv) the geological evolution of hadal zones. Meanwhile, a great effort will be made for technological developments to access the extreme depths. Several hadal equipments (e.g. free-fall imaging lander, glider, deep mooring, animal trap, sediment trap, chemical sensor, and seismometer) will be developed to improve the capability of hadal exploration. Renewed interest in the deep trenches combined with technological advances will create new opportunities to explore and understand the deepest environment on earth.",

            "abstract": "Plant wax n-alkanes are long-chain, saturated hydrocarbons contained within the protective waxy cuticle on leaves. These lipids are pervasive and persistent in soils and sediments and thus are ideal biomarkers of ancient terrestrial organic matter. In ecosystems dominated by C3 plants, the relationship between the carbon isotopic value of whole leaves and lipids is fairly well documented, but this relationship has not been fully investigated for plants that use C4 photosynthesis. In both cases, it is unclear if the isotopic relationships are sensitive to environmental conditions, or reflect inherited characteristics. This study used a natural climate gradient on the Kohala peninsula of Hawaii to investigate relationships between climate and the δ13C and δ2H values of n-alkanes in C3 and C4 plants.\nδ13C of C3 leaves and lipids decreased 5 ‰ from the driest to the wettest sites, consistent with published data. Carbon isotope values of C4 plants showed no relationship to moisture up to 1000 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP). Above this threshold, δ 13C values were around 10‰ more depleted, likely due to a combination of canopy effects and C4 grasses growing in an uncharacteristically wet and cold environment. In C3 plants, the fractionation between leaf and lipid carbon isotopes did not vary with MAP, which allows estimations of δ13C leaf to be made from alkanes preserved in ancient sediments.\nAlong this transect, C3 plants produce around twice the quantity of n-alkanes as C4 grasses. C4 grasses produce longer carbon chains. As a result, n-alkanes in the geologic record will be biased towards C3 plants, but the presence of alkanes C33 and C35 indicate the contributions of C4 grasses.  In both C3 and C4 plants, average chain length increased with mean annual precipitation, but the taxonomic differences in chain length were greater than environmental differences.\nHydrogen isotopes of n-alkanes show no trends with MAP, but do show clear differences between plant functional types and sampled taxa. That there is no strong trend between fractionation and aridity supports the use of δ2Hlipid as a record of environmental waters at the time of lipid synthesis, provided that the relative contributions of each plant functional type can be identified using other proxies.",

The observed streamflow shows variability over a large range of time-scales, none of which significantly dominates the others; consequently, the time-series seems noisy and is difficult to be directly used in model parameter estimation efforts without significant filtering.\nWe perform a multi-resolution wavelet decomposition of the observed streamflow, and use the wavelet power coefficients (WPC) as the tuning data. We construct a mapping (a surrogate model) between WPC and three hydrological parameters of the CLM using a training set of 256 CLM runs. The dependence of WPC on the parameters is complex and cannot be captured using a surrogate unless the parameter combinations yield physically plausible model predictions, i.e., those that are skillful when compared to observations. Retaining only the top quartile of the runs ensures skillfulness, as measured by the RMS error between observations and CLM predictions. This “screening” of the training data yields a region (the “valid” region) in the parameter space where accurate surrogate models can be created.\nWe construct a classifier for the “valid” region, and, in conjunction with the surrogate models for WPC, pose a Bayesian inverse problem for the three hydrological parameters. The inverse problem is solved using an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to construct a three-dimensional posterior distribution for the hydrological parameters. Posterior predictive tests using the surrogate model reveal that the posterior distribution is more predictive than the nominal values of the parameters, which are used as default values in the current version of CLM. The effectiveness of the inversion is then validated by testing the posterior samples by performing real CLM simulations at both sites.",

The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approach have been used for studies of those phenomena, in which some traditional models for a resistivity with the assumption of dependence of current or magnetic field, or with no physical reason are adopted for MHD simulations of magnetic reconnection. We perform 2D numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection in the MHD framework with our two proposed effective resistivity models and in the kinetic approach (full PIC simulation), and compare the results obtained in those ways.

            "abstract": "From the measurements of 210Po and 210Pb in atmospheric dry and bulk depositional flux and in aerosols in southeast Michigan, we observed the following: i) the 210Po/210Pb activity ratio in bulk precipitation was lower than that in aerosols and this was attributed to the possible presence of volatile 210Po in the atmosphere; and ii) it was proposed that only a small fraction of aerosols actively participate in the scavenging of particle-reactive radionuclides based on lack of correlation between the activity of 210Pb and aerosol mass concentration. We extended this study to investigate the particle-cycling in a shallow, dynamic freshwater system in southeast Michigan. The 210Po/210Pb activity ratios in bulk deposition is mostly <0.1 while in benthic sediments, this ratio is usually ~1.0. This activity ratio in finer resuspended sedimentary particulate matter is altered from the scavenging of Po and Pb derived from the atmospheric deposition, and thus, the 210Po/210Pb activity ratio in suspended particulate matter can be utilized as a tracer for particle cycling. We measured the concentrations 210Po and 210Pb in a suite of surficial benthic sediments and particulate matter collected in sediment traps from five different locations in the Clinton River that discharges in to Lake St. Clair in southeast Michigan to quantify the sediment resuspension rates and to determine the particle residence time. The mean 210Po/210Pb activity ratio of suspended trap and surficial bottom sediments were 0.72 and 0.75, respectively, indicating that the sediment trap particles were mostly derived from resuspended bottom sediments. Particle residence time varied from 0.3 to 4 days for 210Pb and 0.9 to 13.4 days for 210Po. Sediment resuspension rate calculated via a single box model approach yielded a mean resuspension rate of 0.5 g cm-2 yr-1 using 210Pb and 0.2 g cm-2 yr-1 using 210Po. A comparison of the 210Po and 210Pb fluxes in the sediment trap to that in the direct atmospheric deposition indicates that only about 1% of the 210Pb and about 0.1% of the 210Po were derived from direct atmospheric deposition while most of the trapped 210Pb and 210Po were delivered by the resuspension of bottom sediments.",

Statistical analysis of observations and climate models forced with projected emissions scenarios point to more frequent and intense precipitation extremes at global and century scales. A statistical delineation of changes in IDF curves at scales relevant for infrastructures has proved elusive, owing to significant spatial variability, data and model quality, and estimation uncertainties. The contribution of climate internal variability, in addition to thresholds and intermittences, has not received much attention in the literature. However, this relatively irreducible component of the uncertainty may dominate for decadal planning horizons, especially at the spatial scales relevant for hydraulic infrastructures. A characterization of the irreducible uncertainties, which in turn yields an envelope of plausible scenarios, may need to be a critical pathway for resilient engineering. Statistical and information theoretic methods are developed or adapted from the literature to characterize predictability and nonstationarity of IDF curves. Risk management methods are examined to develop best practices for translating the characterization of irreducible uncertainty to guidelines for infrastructural decisions and resource allocations.",

Eruptive activities at Showa crater, about 500 m east of Minami-dake, since 2006 increased, accompanying ground inflation in October 2009 – May 2010 (2009 event) in contrast to the Minami-dake period. Similar inflation occurred in October 2011 – March 2012 (2011 event). In this study, we analyzed GPS, tilt and strain data synthetically to obtain pressure sources around Sakurajima during the periods of high explosivity with ground inflation.\nWe applied 3-pressure-source model to the deformation of 2009 and 2011 events. Main inflation source is located beneath Aira caldera at a depth of 9.6 km, similar to previous study. In Sakurajima, inflation pressure source is located beneath Kita-dake 1 km north of Minami-dake at a depth of 3.3 km (K-source), and deflation source is located beneath Minami-dake at a depth of 0.7 km (M-source). We estimated temporal change of volume of K- and M-sources fixing inflation rate of Aira source for 2011 event. Inflation rate of K-source increased in November 2011 and kept at a constant rate until January 2012. Deflation rate of M-source increased at the same time as inflation rate of K-source increased, and kept at a constant rate until March 2012. Amount of volume increase of K-source is nearly 20 times larger than that of volume decrease of M-source. Magma was thought to migrate from Aira source to K-source in November 2011 and continued until January 2012. Due to higher eruptive volume from Showa crater than migration of magma from K-source, M-source deflated slightly from late November 2011 to March 2012.",

An integrated geophysical and hydrochemical approach is adopted to study these sand and gravel deposits, which are likely to constitute regional offshore aquifers and hold brackish paleo-waters. Marine seismic reflection profiles from Lantau Island South, are studied to depict the three-dimensional configuration of the subsurface aquifer-aquitard system. Sedimentological evidence and geophysical properties of an offshore vibrocore drilled south of Lantua Island show a three-fold sequence, with two upper marine layers and a lowermost oxidized terrestrial layer. The shifts of depositional environments are attributed to the Holocene sea level rise. Hydrochemical analysis of the porewater from the core samples indicates the presence of brackish water in the lowermost layer and possible diffusion transport. High ammonium levels in porewater and acoustic turbidity in seismic profiles are resulted from biogenic activities.

            "abstract": "Inland aquatic carbon cycling is an important component of global carbon cycle and recent work has shown that anthropogenic activities can significantly alter the flux of terrestrial carbon through these systems to oceans and lakes. The study of dissolved carbon species in rivers provides detailed information about the natural and anthropogenic processing of carbon within a watershed. We measured water chemistry and stable isotope ratios (δ13C, δ18O, δ2H) of three major rivers (Bear, Jordan and Weber) seasonally, within the Great Salt Lake Basin to understand sources and processes governing the carbon cycling within the basin. Our preliminary data suggest strong correlation between the DIC concentration and land use/land cover for all the three waterways, with DIC increasing as the rivers flow through agricultural and urban regions. We also observed significant decrease in the DIC with the addition of fresh water from the tributaries which was most significant during the spring sampling. All the three rivers are super saturated in dissolved CO2 with respected to the atmospheric CO2 concentration, with pCO2 ranging from 1-5 times the atmospheric value and also showing strong seasonal variations. Coupling the pCO2 data with the isotopic value and concentration of DIC suggests that the variations within and among the rivers are manifestation of the different sources of DIC, further altered by in-situ processes such as organic respiration and photosynthesis. Our result suggest that human induced changes in land use and land cover have significantly altered the carbon budget of waterways of the Great Salt Lake Basin and carbon flux to the Great Salt Lake itself. Our future work will further quantify these changes, increasing our understanding of past, present and future changes in carbon cycling in closed semi-arid basins, and its importance in the global carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Northern peatlands are important sinks of carbon. However, ongoing climate change and human impact trigger emission of the stored carbon into the atmosphere. Because of the progressive disturbances there is an urgent need to recognize these processes in space and time. We investigated a profile from a Mukhrino bog located close to the Mukhrino Field Station, about 20 km from Khanty-Mansiysk (60°54’ N, 68°42’ E). One meter peat core was subsampled in one-centimeter intervals. Pollen, testate amoebae, plant macrofossils, bulk density and carbon content were analyzed in high-resolution to reconstruct hydrology, droughts and carbon accumulation rates during the last 1200 years. We hypothesize that continental bogs of Siberia have been existing in under summer drought stress during the last millennium and hydrological change (dry shift) is also reflected in local fires. Palaeoecological work was accompanied by surface sampling to collect testate amoebae training set for transfer function development. These microorganisms have been scarcely studied in this part of the world. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that 23.7% of variance is explained by the model. Furthermore, water table appeared to be the most significant variable for sampled communities. Testate amoebae calibration data set performed the reliably using weighted averaging model (RMSEPboot=7.9, R2boot=0.74). According to our quantitative reconstruction, higher charcoal influx was inferred between AD 1975 and 1990 what suggests higher fire frequency. However, water table was the lowest between AD 1150 and AD 1965. The data show lack of correlation between peatland wetness and regional fires. Consequently, it suggests that peatland hydrological dynamics might be independent from fires frequency, as fires were caused by recent human activities in concomitance with the positive Arctic Oscillation Index during the last decade.",

The 2011 Tohoku Mw 9.0 earthquake is a recent large earthquake happened at the northeastern Japan subduction zone, and there are a lots of GPS observations around that area. The coseismic and interseismic GPS observations would put a great constraint on numerical simulations about earthquake cycle. In this study, we set up a 2D model to simulate the seismic cycles at the northeastern Japan subduction zone. The model has 1600 km in width and 340 km in depth. The continent crust is assumed elastic and the mantle lithosphere and asthenosphere are viscoelastic. The geometry of the subducted fault and material properties of the model are chosen based on geophysical observations in that area. The top part of the fault form surface to depth 40 km is assumed controlling by the slip-weakening friction law and is capable of locking or slipping according to the stress changes spontaneously, while the other lower part is supposing to have a constant slip rate of 10 cm/year. This finite-element model is solved with the code PyLith. Numerical results show that at this area, an earthquake of Mw 9 could happen at about every 160 years. The coseismic and interseismic surface deformation of the model agrees well with the GPS observations if we let the model earthquake be the Tohoku earthquake. Another important result is that in order to match the model surface deformation with the observed GPS data, the viscosity of continental lithosphere should be one order of magnitude larger than the underneath asthenosphere.",

            "abstract": "Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a numerical optimization method which aims at minimizing the difference between the synthetic and recorded seismic data to obtain high resolution subsurface images. A practical implementation for FWI is the adjoint-state method (AD), in which the data residuals at receiver locations are simultaneously back-propagated to form the gradient. Scattering-integral method (SI) is an alternative way which is based on the explicit building of the sensitivity kernel (Fréchet derivative matrix). Although it is more memory-consuming, SI is more efficient than AD when the number of the sources is larger than the number of the receivers. To improve the convergence of FWI, the information carried out by the inverse Hessian operator is crucial. Taking account accurately of the effect of this operator in FWI can correct illumination deficits, reserve the amplitude of the subsurface parameters, and remove artifacts generated by multiple reflections. In multi-parameter FWI, the off-diagonal blocks of the Hessian operator reflect the coupling between different parameter classes. Therefore, incorporating its inverse could help to mitigate the trade-off effects.\nIn this study, we focus on the truncated Gauss-Newton implementation for multi-parameter FWI. The model update is computed through a matrix-free conjugate gradient solution of the Newton linear system. Both the gradient and the Hessian-vector product are calculated using the SI approach instead of the first- and second-order AD. However, the gradient expressed by kernel-vector product is calculated through the accumulation of the decomposed vector-scalar products. Thus, it’s not necessary to store the huge sensitivity matrix beforehand. We call this method the matrix decomposition approach (MD). And the Hessian-vector product is replaced by two kernel-vector products which are then calculated by the above MD. By this way, we don’t need to solve two additional wave propagation problems as in the second-order AD formulae. Therefore, this implementation is more efficient than AD when the number of the sources is just larger than a few percent of the number of the receivers. Finally, we apply our method to Overthrust model to simultaneously update velocity and density. The revealed results prove the effectiveness of this method.",

            "abstract": "A Bayesian approach to inference in atmospheric remote sensing, where the measurements are functions of the quantities of interest, uses the posterior distribution of the atmospheric state and includes the posterior covariance matrix as a measure of uncertainty. This optimal estimation paradigm is implemented in a number of remote sensing applications, including the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) Level 2 (L2) retrieval algorithm. Each implementation of a retrieval algorithm requires numerous design choices, such as state vector configuration and prior distributions. These choices will impact the true uncertainty, which we define as the distribution of the retrieval error, and the adequacy of the retrieved posterior covariance as a measure of that true uncertainty.\nWe develop a surrogate forward model and retrieval to investigate the impact of these implementation choices on both the true and reported retrieval uncertainties. The surrogate model uses key aspects of the OCO-2 L2 forward model but is of reduced complexity to allow for fast computation and strict control over implementation choices. The surrogate model is embedded into a Monte Carlo framework that allows stochastic simulation from prescribed distributions of the true atmospheric state and of selected retrieval algorithm inputs. The bias and error covariance of the retrieved state estimate and functions of it, such as the profile-weighted average CO2 mixing ratio, XCO2, summarize the uncertainty and can be compared to the OCO-2 L2 retrieval’s reported posterior covariance. We illustrate these figures of merit in the presence of misspecification of various components of the atmospheric state vector.",

            "abstract": "The 2010 Chilean and the 2011 Tohoku tsunami events demonstrated the tsunami's ability to penetrate much farther along rivers than the ground inundation. At the same time, while tsunami impacts to the coastal areas have been subject to countless studies, little is known about tsunami propagation in rivers. Here we examine the field data and conduct numerical simulations to gain better understanding of the tsunami impacts in rivers.\nThe evidence which motivated our study is comprised of water level measurements of the aforementioned tsunamis in multiple rivers in Japan, and the 2011 Tohoku and some other tsunamis in the Columbia River in the US.\nWhen the available tsunami observations in these very different rivers are brought together, they display remarkably similar patterns not observed on the open coast. Two phenomena were discovered in the field data. First, the phase of the river tide determines the tsunami penetration distance in a very specific way common to all rivers. Tsunami wave progressively disappears on receding tide, whereas high tide greatly facilitates the tsunami intrusion, as seen in the Figure. Second, a strong near-field tsunami causes substantial and prolonged water accumulation in lower river reaches. As the 2011 tsunami intruded rivers in Japan, the water level along rivers rose 1-2 m and stayed high for many hours, with the maximum rise occurring several km from the river mouth. The rise in the water level at some upstream gaging stations even exceeded the tsunami amplitude there.\nUsing the numerical experiments, we attempt to identify the physics behind these effects. We will demonstrate that the nonlinear interactions among the flow components (tsunami, tide, and riverine flow) are an essential condition governing wave dynamics in tidal rivers. Understanding these interactions might explain some previous surprising observations of waves in river environments.\nFigure: Measurements of the 2010/02/27 tsunami along Naruse and Yoshida rivers, Japan, showing progressive development of the tsunami wave modulation by tide.

It uses dynamical downscaling to provide climate projections for the CORDEX-AustralAsia region at 50 km resolution, and for South-East Australia at 10 km resolution. The project is the first of its kind in the level of sophistication of model selection. Specifically, the selection process for General Circulation Models (GCMs) included (i) evaluating model performance based on literature review, (ii) calculating model independence, and (iii) analyzing future changes in temperature and precipitation. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) for downscaling the GCMs were identified based on model independence, as well as on their performance for several precipitation events over South-East Australia.\nWe first present seasonal and annual mean changes for key climate metrics (e.g., temperature, precipitation, etc.) for both regions for periods 2020-2039 and 2060-2079. We then use the seasonal and annual mean output from NARCliM to address several key questions: (1) How independent are the members of the NARCliM ensemble? (2) Do the RCMs span sufficient range of uncertainty in the driving GCM projections? (3) Are the RCMs significantly different from observations? and (4) Over which areas do we expect a significant change in surface atmospheric temperature and precipitation in periods 2020-2039 and 2060-2079?

The minimum pressure in Irene occurred about 40 h later than the time of maximum wind speed. Simulations performed with WRF with the spectral bin microphysics (SBM) showed that both the weakening of Irene and the time shift between maximum of wind and the minimum of pressure were caused by the effects of aerosols leading to the intensification of convection at its periphery resulting in an increase in size.\nIrena was also simulated using different bulk-parameterization schemes. The dispersion of TC in simulations using different schemes is very high, which indicates high sensitivity of TC intensity to microphysical processes. Despite the fact that new bulk-parameterization schemes simulated TC intensity quite well, non of bulk-schemes were able to predict the time shift between maximum wind and minimum surface pressure. The plausible reason is a too weak sensitivity of bulk schemes to aerosols.",

            "abstract": "As megacities around the world continue to develop at breakneck speeds, future development, investment, and social wellbeing are threatened by a number of environmental and social factors. Chief among these is frequent, persistent, and unpredictable urban flooding. Jakarta, Indonesia with a population of 28 million, is a prime example of a city plagued by such flooding. Yet although Jakarta has ample hydraulic infrastructure already in place with more being constructed, the increasingly severity of the flooding it experiences is not from a lack of hydraulic infrastructure but rather a failure of existing infrastructure. As was demonstrated during the most recent floods in Jakarta, the infrastructure failure is often the result of excessive amounts of trash in the flood canals. This trash clogs pumps and reduces the overall system capacity. Despite this critical weakness of flood control in Jakarta, no data exists on the overall amount of trash in the flood canals, much less on how it varies temporally and spatially. The recent availability of low cost photography provides a means to obtain such data. Time lapse photography postprocessed with computer vision algorithms yields a low cost, remote, and automatic solution to measuring the trash fluxes. When combined with the measurement of key hydrological parameters, a thorough understanding of the relationship between trash fluxes and the hydrology of massive urban areas becomes possible. This work examines algorithm development, quantifying trash parameters, and hydrological measurements followed by data assimilation into existing hydraulic and hydrological models of Jakarta. The insights afforded from such an approach allows for more efficient operating of hydraulic infrastructure, knowledge of when and where critical levels of trash originate from, and the opportunity for community outreach – which is ultimately needed to reduce the trash in the flood canals of Jakarta and megacities around the world.",

These data should provide essential clues on the past habitability of Gale crater. Amongst the SAM suite of instruments [1], SAM-GC (Gas Chromatograph) is devoted to identify and quantify volatiles evolved from the thermal (heating up to about 900°C)/chemical (derivatization procedure) treatment of any soil sample collected by the Curiosity rover. With the aim to search for potential organic molecules outgassed from the samples, SAM-GC analytical channels composed of thermal-desorption injector, and a MXT-CLP or a MXT-Q chromatographic column was chosen to achieve all the measurements done up today, with the aim to separate of a wide range of volatile inorganic and organic molecules. Four solid samples have been analyzed with GCMS, one sand sample collected at the Rocknest site, two rock samples (John Klein and Cumberland respectively) collected at the Yellowknife Bay site using the Curiosity driller, and one rock sample collected at the Kimberly site.\nAll the measurements were successful and they produced complex chromatograms with both detectors used for SAM GC, i.e. a thermal conductivity detector and the SAM quandrupole mass spectrometer. Their interpretation already revealed the presence of an oxychlorine phase present in the sample which is at the origin of chlorohydrocarbons clearly identified [2] but this represents only a fraction of the GCMS signal recorded [3,4]. This work presents a systematic comparison of the GCMS measurements done for the different samples collected, supported by reference data obtained in laboratory with different spare models of the gas chromatograph, with the aim to bring new elements of interpretation of the SAM measurements.\n",

Once the convection electric field weakens the outer plasmasphere refills from the ionosphere. Observations at geosynchronous orbit (GEO) show that plasmaspheric ions sometimes refill to number densities in excess of 100 cm-3 within ~48 hours. This observed refilling rate is far in excess of that generally predicted by theoretical models. To study the physics of refilling, a fully-updated version of the SUPIM code is used. We present observations of refilling at GEO alongside a detailed modeling study of the factors governing the refilling process. Suggestions are made for overcoming the disparity between observations and model results.",

            "abstract": "Model tuning is unavoidable in climate models. This raises the question whether data used in tuning or calibration can also be used in evaluating a model’s performance or skill. In the philosophical literature this question is discussed as the problem of old evidence: is a model more highly confirmed by novel evidence predicted by the model or is evidence that is accommodated by the model during model construction equally as confirmatory of the model? In this paper I present several conditions under which a weak predictivism holds—conditions under which predictive success is more highly confirmatory of a model’s empirical performance than mere accommodation—and argue that these conditions are met in the case of climate modeling. In particular, I argue that predictive success can be evidence that a model has certain ‘good-making’ features that are ‘epistemically opaque’—that is, the presence of which is difficult to detect otherwise. I also propose a Bayesian formulation of the predictivist thesis.",

            "abstract": "Plasmaspheric hiss plays a key role in controlling the structure and dynamics of Earth's radiation belts.The quiet time slot region between the inner and outer belts can be explained as a steady-state balance between earthward radial diffusion and pitch-angle scattering loss of energetic electrons to the atmosphere induced by plasmaspheric hiss. Plasmaspheric hiss can also induce gradual precipitation loss of MeV electrons from the outer radiation belt. Plasmaspheric hiss has been widely regarded as a broadband,structureless,incoherent emission. Here, by examining burst-mode vector waveform data from the EMFISIS instrument on the Van Allen Probes mission,we show that plasmaspheric hiss is a coherent emission with complex fine structure. Specifically, plasmaspheric hiss appears as discrete rising tone and falling tone elements. By means of waveform analysis we identify typical amplitudes,phase profiles,and sweep rates of the rising and falling tone elements. The new observations reported here can be expected to fuel a re-examination of the properties of plasmaspheric hiss, including a further re-analysis of the generation mechanism for hiss.",

            "abstract": "Only a few studies in the past have investigated the statistics of extreme events under geoengineering. In this study, a global climate model is used to investigate the impact of solar radiation management on extreme precipitation events on regional scale. Solar constant was reduced by 2.25% to counteract the global mean surface temperature change caused by a doubling of CO2 (2XCO2) from its preindustrial control value. Using daily precipitation rates, extreme events are defined as those which exceed 99.9th percentile precipitation threshold. Extremes are substantially reduced in geoengineering simulation: the magnitude of change is much smaller than those that occur in a simulation with doubled CO2. Regional analysis over 22 Giorgi land regions is also performed. Doubling of CO2 leads to an increase in intensity of extreme (99.9th percentile) precipitation by 17.7% on global-mean basis with maximum increase in intensity over South Asian region by 37%. In the geoengineering simulation, there is a global-mean reduction in intensity of 3.8%, with a maximum reduction over Tropical Ocean by 8.9%. Further, we find that the doubled CO2 simulation shows an increase in the frequency of extremes (>50 mm/day) by 50-200% with a global mean increase of 80%. In contrast, in geo-engineering climate there is a decrease in frequency of extreme events by 20% globally with a larger decrease over Tropical Ocean by 30%. In both the climate states (2XCO2 and geo-engineering) change in “extremes” is always greater than change in “means” over large domains. We conclude that changes in precipitation extremes are larger in 2XCO2 scenario compared to preindustrial climate while extremes decline slightly in the geoengineered climate. We are also investigating the changes in extreme statistics for daily maximum and minimum temperature, evapotranspiration and vegetation productivity. Results will be presented at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "There are many situations that a spacecraft surface would be covered by a layer of dusts, such as that around a comet and and on the surfaces of the Moon and asteroids. Previous studies of surface charging in plasmas have mostly considered a “clean” conducting or dielectric surface. On the other hand, studies of dust charging in plasmas have mostly considered that of single, isolated dust grains (the “dust-in-plasma” condition), where a dust grain is electrically isolated from its neighboring dusts. This paper considers the charging of a surface covered by a layer of dust grains (the “dusty-surface” condition), where the inter-dust distance is almost zero but the dust grains do not form a solid surface. Under such a condition, the sheath of each individual dust particles overlap to form one single sheath and the charging of individual dust grains is strongly affected by that of the neighboring dust grains and the surface.\nExperiments and numerical simulations are carried out to understand the charging of both conducting and dielectric dusty surfaces. Surface charging measurements will be presented for different dust layer thickness, dust grain size, dust density, and different ambient plasma conditions. The effect of the existence of a dusty layer on surface potential as well as the difference between charging of a single dust-in-plasma and that of a dust grain as part of a dusty surface will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a novel two-tiered approach to incorporate information from categorical land-use for point estimation: (1) The influence of the composition and the size of land-use within a neighbourhood of a point location was detected in data, and is describable via locally mixed distributions. (2) This averaged information of the locally mixed distributions can be included to improve the estimation of values at point locations.\nThis approach is applicable for a variety of problems and variables, for example for ground-truthing of meteorological models. This paper demonstrates the method by using categorical land-use information to estimate full distributions of contaminant concentrations at the shallow water table. This information is subsequently used as secondary information for point estimates of concentrations. Both secondary information and censored measurements are taken into account in a full stochastic copula-based model.\nWithin the proposed method, the secondary information represents the dominantly small-scale and vertical infiltration process, where the spatial dependence model represents the dominantly horizontal larger-scale groundwater flow and solute transport process.\nAt each interpolation location, a full local distribution is obtained by mixing the pure distributions of the land-use categories according to the composition of the land-use in the vicinity of the interpolation point. The pure distributions for a given neighbourhood size are jointly optimized for all groups of secondary information. A contaminant-specific, spatially distributed measure of the information content of the secondary information is presented.\nThe impacts of the improvements of the geostatistical model are evaluated using regional groundwater quality data from a large monitoring network (∼2500 measurement locations) within the state of Baden-Württemberg (~36.000 km2), Germany. Land-use as secondary information is available as categorical variable in a 30m x 30m resolution.\nDifferent approaches for the incorporation of the secondary information and their effectiveness are demonstrated. The improved quality of the interpolation, particularly the improved quantification of the uncertainty at each location, is demonstrated by cross-validation results.",

How solar activities affected hydrological changes in westerly-controlled arid central Asia (ACA) on decadal/centennial timescales remains poorly investigated, due to lack of high-quality records. Here we present high-resolution multi-proxy records of lake level changes, and thus effective moisture fluctuations, over the last millennium, from a shoreline sediment core retrieved from Lake Manas, northwestern China. Besides generally confirmed relatively wet conditions during the cool Little Ice Age, records of the geophysical and geochemical indicators, including lightness, calcium counts, and C37 alkenone contents, consistently show substantial and frequent lake level fluctuations, and more importantly, resemble solar irradiance changes. Further, the ~11-year Schwabe cycle, ~70-100-year Gleissberg cycle, and relatively weak spectral power in between, as characters in the sunspot number record, together with the ~200-year Suess-de Vries cycle revealed in the reconstructed total solar irradiance records, are all evident in the higher-resolution calcium and lightness records. Together, our records clearly demonstrate solar imprints on effective moisture fluctuations in ACA over the last millennium, and the occurrence of the Schwabe cycle even during the solar minima.",

            "abstract": "Present terrestrial ecosystem models still contain substantial uncertainties, as model intercomparison studies have shown, because of poor model constraint by observational data. So, development of advanced methodology of data-model fusion, or data-assimilation, is an important task to reduce the uncertainties and improve model predictability. In this study, I apply the Particle filter (or Sequential Monte Carlo filer) to optimize parameters of a process-based terrestrial ecosystem model (VISIT). The Particle filter is one of the data-assimilation methods, in which probability distribution of model state is approximated by many samples of parameter set (i.e., particle). This is a computationally intensive method and applicable to nonlinear systems; this is an advantage of the method in comparison with other techniques like Ensemble Kalman filter and variational method. At several sites, I used flux measurement data of atmosphere-ecosystem CO2 exchange in sequential and non-sequential manners. In the sequential data assimilation, a time-series data at 30-min or daily steps were used to optimize gas-exchange-related parameters; this method would be also effective to assimilate satellite observational data. On the other hand, in the non-sequential case, annual or long-term mean budget was adjusted to observations; this method would be also effective to assimilate carbon stock data. Although there remain technical issues (e.g., appropriate number of particles and likelihood function), I demonstrate that the Partile filter is an effective method of data-assimilation for process-based models, enhancing collaboration between field and model researchers.",

The results are compared to the simulations of the 1-D photochemical model KINETICS using different UV variabilities. Shapiro et al. [Atmos. Chem. Phys., 2012] have examined the 27-day solar cycle modulation in tropical mesospheric OH measured by MLS, and found that the OH 27-day solar response is ~1% per 1% change in Lyman-α at 80 km. However, as different band-pass filter is applied, the OH response varies significantly. An optimal filter is selected based on the convergence of OH response with respect to filter window size. The results show that in the middle atmosphere model simulations underestimate the hydroxyl radical variabilities to short term solar forcing by 20%-50%.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost thaw is likely to create a substantial positive feedback to climate warming, as previously frozen carbon becomes bioavailable and is released to the atmosphere. Microbes mediate this release, while also consuming “new” carbon from plant inputs and middle-aged soil carbon pools in the seasonally-thawed active layer overlying permafrost. This carbon consumption releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), both potent greenhouse gases. To investigate microbial carbon cycling in this changing habitat, we examined how microbial communities’ carbon substrate degradation changes along a natural permafrost thaw gradient in Stordalen Mire (68.35°N, 19.05°E), northern Sweden. At this location, intermediate thaw creates Sphagnum moss-dominated bogs, while complete thaw results in Eriophorum sedge-dominated fens. The progression of thaw results in increasing organic matter lability (Hodgkins et al, 2014), shifting microbial community composition (Mondav & Woodcroft et al 2014), and changing carbon gas emissions (McCalley et al, in review). However, the inter-relationship of the first two in producing the third remains unclear. We analyzed microbial carbon substrate utilization in the intermediate-thaw and full-thaw sites by two incubation-based methods. We used Biolog EcoPlates, which contain 31 ecologically relevant carbon substrates and a colorimetric marker of their consumption, and into which we added a soil liquid suspension. In addition, we performed mason-jar incubations of peat with carbon substrate amendments and measured CH4 and CO2 emissions. Preliminary Biolog Ecoplate incubations showed that intermediate-thaw features responded faster and more strongly overall to a wide range of substrates relative to the full-thaw features. Preliminary mason jar incubations showed that acetate amendment elicited the greatest response increase in CH4  production and the second greatest increase in CO2 production relative to the controls, in samples from both habitats. In addition, the lowest CH4 and CO2 production was seen in amendments of sphagnum acid. It is important to understand the carbon substrate utilization occurring at these initial and advanced thaw features to speculate the degree to which various carbon inputs are being metabolized to produce the observed gas emissions.",

            "abstract": "The future European geostationary Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) will carry a lightning observation instrument - the Lightning Imager (LI), which will observe lightning in thunderstorm for the whole visible Earth disk with high temporal and spatial resolution. Its data will be of great benefit for nowcasting of lightning thread and severe weather, as well as for applications in lightning physics, chemistry and climatology.\nPrimary data output of the instrument are the 'lightning events’ corresponding to triggered pixels of the detector matrix. These primary data are processed into a set of products: hierarchically organized point data - groups and flashes, and various products of data accumulated over time and space bins. The algorithm strategies for generation of these level-2 products are evaluated in this contribution.\nThe clustering of the lightning event data consists of two steps: i) pixel events are clustered in a group representing the optical pulse, and ii) the groups are clustered in a flash representing the lightning flash. The algorithm strategies for clustering are discussed and evaluated for the various algorithm parameters. The distance function and linkage criteria are formulated in time and space. For groups the criterion is immediate adjacency in time and space. For flashes the gap to the nearest neighbor in time and space have to be lower a threshold value. Examples and statistics of the application of the clustering algorithms are presented for LIS data and for proxy data.\nThe second group of products accumulate the lightning point data in time (30s) and space (2km) intervals. The planned products are the accumulated flash number, flash area and flash radiance. All these products are created on a per flash bases using the pixel set for each flash. They are calculated on a grid which correspond cloud imager (FCI) grid on the same platform. The accumulated products represent an snapshot picture of the current lightning activity, valuable in nowcasting, and can be further accumulated into various lightning statistics and climatologies. The contribution discusses the interpretation and application of these products on different time scales.",

            "abstract": "SPREE is a flexible array (FA) deployment associated with the EarthScope project with the aim of better understanding the Mid-Continent Rift Zone (MCRZ). We have used data from SPREE FA and TA stations to detect and locate small earthquakes in the vicinity of the northwestern arm of the Mid-Continent Rift Zone, covering Minnesota, Wisconsin, and parts of Iowa, Michigan, and Ontario. This region, now stable craton, is a failed Precambrian rift marked by low levels of recorded seismicity, perhaps resulting in part from a historic dearth of stations deployed in the region. We assessed this possibility by taking advantage of the densest array that has been deployed in the region. Processing has allowed for regional stress constraints and a means of distinguishing earthquakes from mine blasts, and a quantitative method to differentiate natural earthquakes from mine blasting events, frequent here. After automated event identification, a manual review confirmed 14 earthquakes and several hundred blasting events with magnitudes ranging from M1 - M3. Observed seismicity is in reasonable agreement with available historical data. We use these earthquakes in conjunction with historical catalogs to estimate regional recurrence intervals for events of greater magnitudes. While initial earthquake/blast discrimination was done manually, the ratio of Rayleigh to P-wave amplitude appears to be a reliable discriminant for distinguishing between earthquakes and mine blasting in this region in a systematic way, with earthquakes displaying a systematically depressed ratio. Additionally, P-wave first-motion data and S/P amplitude ratios from natural events constrain focal mechanisms and regional stresses. These methods indicate roughly WSW-ENE compression, consistent with other determinations and absolute plate motion. The majority of events detected lie some distance from the actual rift; we thus conclude current seismicity bears no preferred association with the MCR.",

            "abstract": "The Longitudinal Valley in Eastern Taiwan sits at the collision suture between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates. Based on repeated GPS campaigned measurements from 25 stations six times in 2007-2014 and 10 continuous GPS single-frequency stations recorded in 2011-2014, we characterize the surface deformation in the northernmost Longitudinal Valley where the Coastal Range of the Philippine Sea plate turns northward diving under the Eurasian plate producing two major active faults: the Milun fault and the Longitudinal Valley fault. We reconstructed a GPS velocity field and conducted strain analyses and elastic block modeling. Our results suggest a clockwise rotation at a rate of 33° M/yr and an eastward tectonic escape in the small Hualien City block (HUAL) area of ~10 × 10 km, which is apparently detached from the regional rotating RYUK block (~ 100 x 100 km) defined by previous studies. Combining the levelling data that indicated the Coastal Range is going down toward the north, we interpret the tectonic escape of the northernmost Longitudinal Valley as being initiated locally by the northwest indentation of the Coastal Range, which pushed the HUAL block to move upward and eastward. According to our strain analyses, the HUAL block shows a significant internal elastic strain inside the Milun Tableland, the hanging wall of the Milun fault. No significant deformation was observed across the surface trace of the fault, indicating that the Milun fault is now probably locked in the near surface. The deformation in the footwall of the fault was accommodated by pure-shear strain with a major NNW-compression and a minor ENE-extension. The deformation in the hanging wall is characterized by simple-shear strain with ENE-extension in its northern part and little deformation in the southern part, separated by a little known NW-trending active fault zone (Dongmingyi fault), which needs further investigation.",

            "abstract": "Structural geology, strain and kinematics of shearing of the ASRR shear zone are essential in elucidating the nature of shearing along the shear zone and its role in the tectonic evolution of eastern Tibet. This study reports new progress on our understanding the structural geology and tectonic significance of the Yao Shan metamorphic complex (YSMC), the NW extension of the Day Nui Con Voi complex along the ASRR shear zone.\nStructural analysis reveals that the YSMC constitutes a large linear antiform cored by highly sheared Proterozoic high grade rocks. Progressive shearing of the rocks generated early pure and late simple shearing-dominated fabrics at decreasing temperatures. L-fabrics and A-type folds at various scales are characteristic structural elements in the complex. A linear antiform is best outlined by the outer shell Cambrian-Triassic marbles, metabasalt and phyllitic rocks. In addition, these rocks contain shear fabrics consistent with those in the high grade core. The AMS data of 186 specimens from 20 sites along a section across the central YSMC shows generally high anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility implying high shear strain. Most samples possess flattening strain AMS fabrics, in spite of fabrics types of the tectonites. Magnetic foliations due to oriented growth of biotite and magnetite have intersection angles of less than 15° with mylonite foliation (S fabrics), indicating high shear strain. Meanwhile, the intersection suggests that both dextral shearing and sinistral shearing occur across the complex, which is compatible with outcrop and microscopic observations.\nIt is suggested that the Yao Shan-Day Nui Con Voi complex is a linear a-type anticlinal fold formed by crustal scale syn-shearing folding and doming. The present study demonstrates that the Yao Shan-Day Nui Con Voi anticlinal structure was formed as a result of middle and lower crustal flow along the ASRR shear zone in southeastern Tibet during Indian-Eurasian continental collision.",

There are a number of different research models currently available or in development, and as these models mature and output becomes available for use, there is great interest in how these different models compare and how useful they may be at different scales. At the kick-off meeting of the Global Flood Partnership (GFP) in March 2014, the need to compare these new global flood models was identified as a research priority, both for developers of the models and users of the output. The Global Flood Partnership (GFP) is an informal network of scientists and practitioners from public, private and international organisations providing or using global flood monitoring, modelling and forecasting. (\nhttp://portal.gdacs.org/Global-Flood-Partnership\n). On behalf of the GFP, The Willis Research Network is undertaking this comparison research and the work presented here is the result of the first phase of this comparison for three models; CaMa-Flood, GLOFRIS & ECMWF. The comparison analysis is undertaken for the entire African continent, identified by GFP members as the best location to facilitate data sharing by model teams and where there was the most interest from potential users of the model outputs. Initial analysis results include flooded area for a range of hazard return periods (25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 years) and this is also compared against catchment sizes and climatic zone. Results will be discussed in the context of the different model structures and input data used, while also addressing scale issues and practicalities of use. Finally, plans for the validation of the models against microwave and optical remote sensing data will be outlined.",

            "abstract": "The North China Craton (NCC), as an Archean craton, consists of two distinctly different units. The eastern NCC had undergone extensive reactivation during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic as seen from surface volcanism, magmatism, and tectonic deformation, while the western NCC has remained stable. Seismic studies show that lithospheric thicknesses are about 80 km and 200 km for the eastern and western NCC, respectively. A particularly important question is to what extent the chemically buoyant lithospheric mantle of the eastern NCC has been removed during the reactivation process and how much relict lithospheric mantle has remained after the reactivation. It is sometimes suggested that the reactivation removed the entire cratonic lithosphere in the eastern NCC and that the 80 km thick lithosphere at present is mainly comprised of the normal mantle materials. In this study, we seek to answer this question by determining residual topography for the NCC and comparing it with the model topography from dynamic models of gravitational instability of cratonic lithosphere. The residual topography after removal of crustal thickness effects shows that the eastern NCC is ~500 m higher than the western NCC. Our dynamic models with non-Newtonian rheology show that the instability for chemically buoyant cratonic lithosphere initiates at the shallow part of the lithosphere, propagates through and affects the entire lithosphere, thus leading to efficient thermal mixing of the lithosphere and thinning of thermal and mechanical lithosphere. However, due to its chemical buoyancy, most of the lithospheric mantle returns to and remains in its original vertical extent (i.e., the top 200 km), after its thermal mixing with the underlying asthenospheric mantle. The dynamic topography for the destabilized cratonic lithosphere is ~700 m higher than that for the stable lithosphere, consistent with the estimated residual topography for the NCC. This suggests that the reactivation process only thins the thermal and mechanical lithosphere for the eastern NCC, while its chemically distinct and buoyant lithospheric mantle largely remains where it used to be in the top 200 km. Our proposed thermal and chemical mixing processes have important implications for understanding the reactivation of the NCC.",

Their operation is leading to a rapidly increasing amount of data, and position time series are now routinely provided by several high-quality services. These networks often capture transient-deformation features of geophysical origin that are difficult to separate from the background noise or from seasonal residuals in the time series. In addition, because of the very large number of stations now available, it has become impossible to systematically inspect each time series and visually compare them at all neighboring sites. In order to overcome these limitations, we adapt Multichannel Singular Spectrum Analysis (M-SSA), a method derived from the analysis of dynamical systems, to the spatial and temporal analysis of GNSS position time series in dense networks. We show that this data-adaptive method — previously applied to climate, bio-medical and macro-economic indicators — allows us to extract spatio-temporal features of geophysical interest from GPS time series without a priori knowledge of the system's dynamics or of the data set’s noise characteristics. We illustrate our results with examples from seasonal signals in Alaska and from micro-inflation/deflation episodes at an Aleutian-arc volcano.",

Here we study the mechanism of δD variation in this region, by reconstructing the past 10.5 ka n-fatty acid (FA) δD records from sediment core taken in Lake Hurleg on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and comparing them to the previously presented temperature and moisture data from the same core. Comparison of both C16 and C26 n-FA δD with the average carbon length of n-FA suggests that n-FA δD variability was independent of the n-FA distribution. For δD in the C26 n-FA, it serves as an indicator of hydrogen isotopic signals in terrestrial water. During the Holocene, the heavier C26 n-FA δD values corresponded to millennial cold and wet conditions as inferred by the temperature and salinity records. Thus the terrestrial water δD value changes might be caused by factors other than temperature and moisture, such as the vegetation type and the glacial melt water input. As for the C16 n-FA, although it contains both terrestrial and aquatic source, it mainly mimics the lacustrine water isotopic signal. Therefore, the difference between C16 and C26 n-FA δD can be interpreted as the fractionation between terrestrial and aquatic water induced by evaporation on lake surface. Based on the δD records together with temperature and moisture records, we suggest in millennial timescale, not only stronger precipitation but also less evaporation occurred during the cold periods in the Lake Hurleg region.",

The scheme consists of orographically forced upward motion (w) and moisture flux convergence (Q) given at surface. The scheme improves rainfall estimation over the entire Asian region, particularly over the Asian region dominating shallow orographic rainfall. However, overestimation and false-positive of orographic rainfall remain. This is because the orographic rainfall conditions has moderate thresholds for global application. In order to improve the orographic rainfall detection, the moist Frouid number (Fw) with w and Q are examined to the scheme.\nThe GSMaP rainfall estimates with the scheme in V6 (GSMaP1) and revised version using Fw (GSMaP2) are compared with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) data for the case of Typhoon Morakot (2009) caused heavy orographic rainfall over Taiwan. GSMaP1 detects false-positive orographic rainfall in the western part of Taiwan. This is because strong wind such as Typhoon makes upward motion even in moderate slope areas. On the contrary, GSMaP2 improves the area of orographic rainfall since the scheme is switched off for Fw greater than or equal to 1.0 corresponding to the low altitude. A verification score and zonal mean rainfall amounts obtained from the TRMM Microwave Imager are better agreement with those from the PR over Asian region.",

            "abstract": "The insolation evolution [Laskar 2004] from 4 to 2.5 Ma depicts a series of three summer solstice insolation minima between 2.7 and 2.6 Ma, but there are other more important summer solstice minima notably around 3.82 and 3.05 Ma. On such a time span of more than 1 Ma, data shows that there are variations in the evolution of atmospheric CO2 concentration with a local maximum around 3 Ma [Seki et al.2010; Bartoli et al. 2011], before a decrease between 3 and 2.6 Ma. The latter, suggesting an abrupt ice sheet inception around 2.7 Ma, has been shown to be a major culprit for the full Greenland Glaciation [Lunt et al. 2008]. However, a recent study [Contoux et al. 2014, in review] suggests that a lowering of CO2 is not sufficient to initiate a glaciation on Greenland and must be combined to low summer insolation, with surviving ice during insolation maximum, suggesting a cumulative process in the first place, which could further lead to full glaciation at 2.7 Ma.\nThrough a new tri-dimensional interpolation method implemented within the asynchronous coupling between an atmosphere ocean general circulation model (IPSL-CM5A) and an ice sheet model (GRISLI), we investigate the transient evolution of Greenland ice sheet during the Pliocene to diagnose whether the ice sheet inception is an abrupt event or rather a cumulative process, involving waxing and waning of the ice sheet during several orbital cycles.\n",

We developed a sequential optimization method based on a global optimization technique; shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) method (Duan et al., 1993). First, photosynthetic parameters (maximum carboxylation and maximum electron transfer rate at 25oC; Vcmax25 and Jmax25) were optimized for GPP, and then stomatal conductance parameters (m and b in the Ball-Berry model) were optimized for evapotranspiration. Based on our optimization, Vcmax25, Jmax25, and m varied seasonally, but b value was almost constant throughout seasons. Vcmax25 and Jmax25 were higher in summer months than other months, which related to understory leaf area index. m was higher in winter months than other months, but did not significantly change throughout the growing season. Our results indicated that simulations using constant ecophysiological parameters could underestimate photosynthesis and evapotranspiration of high-latitude ecosystems.\n",

            "abstract": "Soil water flow in laboratory experiments often presents complexities which include a dynamic behavior indicated by non-equilibrium between water content θ and water potential h which are known as “dynamic effects”. During the last six decades dynamic effects have been observed directly or indirectly as (1) non-uniqueness of the diffusivity vs water content function, (2) the flow rate dependence of the water retention curve, (3) a relaxation in the system-averaged water content in experiments with controlled pressure head boundary conditions and (4) as a relaxation of the pressure head while the flux density and macroscopic water content distribution appear to be constant. Macroscopically, all the observations mentioned above can be described by the following mechanism: Even in well sorted materials there are always some highly conducting pore paths in which the flow is initiated when the boundary condition is changed. This is followed by an equilibration phase during which a relatively small amount of water initially behind the wetting or drying front moves in the major flow direction. This second phase of equilibration is not instantaneous and is responsible for the observed drift in the θ vs h relationship at the REV scale.\nDiamantopoulos et al. (2012) presented a model which describes dynamic effects in the case of Multistep Outflow experiments. They assumed that the water content is macroscopically portioned into two fractions: Water content in one fraction is in equilibrium with the pressure head whereas the equilibration of the water content in the second fraction lags behind. In this work we applied the non-equilibrium model of Diamantopoulos et al. (2012) to the four different observations of dynamic effects in laboratory experiments presented in the literature. Results show that the model predicted nonequilibrium effects very well in all four types of flow experiments.",

            "abstract": "A flume experiment was conducted to examine the evolution of a sand-gravel reach under a lack of sediment supply. The experimental data are used to validate a numerical sand-gravel model. A bed composed of a bi-modal sediment mixture is installed with a uniform slope and an imposed gradual fining pattern. Initially, the sand fraction gradually increases in streamwise direction until the bed is fully composed of sand. The water discharge and downstream water level were constant, and the sediment feed rate was equal to zero. The experiment was dominated by bed load, partial transport, and a subcritical flow regime was imposed. The flow rate was such that only sand was mobile (partial transport), which led to a coarsening over the upstream reach and a gradual reduction of the sediment transport rate during the experiment. New equipment was used to measure the evolution of the grain size distribution of the bed surface during the experiment over the entire flume using image analysis. In the upstream reach we observed a gradual coarsening over time and the formation of an armour layer, which resulted in a more abrupt transition in grain size of the bed surface. Bed degradation increased in streamwise direction. This is due to the initial streamwise increase in the availability of sand in the bed. The different volume fraction content of sand in the bed allowed for the gravel to sink more in the downstream part of the upstream reach. The sand reach suffered from a larger degradation. Finally, we see one reach dominated by sand, small bedforms, and a small bed slope, and a gravel reach dominated by a larger bed slope.",

            "abstract": "Pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is used for long to characterize the chemical composition and structure of analogues of Titan’s aerosols (tholins). However, a review of the characterizations of tholins done for 30 years with this technique show that the nature of the tholins were quite different in the different studies, and the analytical conditions used for Pyr-GCMS analysis were generally very limited. The differences observed in the results obtained in these different studies are therefore difficult to attribute either to the process used to produce the tholins, or to the analytical conditions used. These are the reasons we performed a systematic study on tholins produced uniquely with the PAMPRE laboratory experiment based on a RF cold plasma, to determine the composition and structure of these analogues of Titan’s aerosols, and to estimate the difference of properties induced by a variation of the content of CH4 in the initial gaseous mixture. To take the whole benefit of the pyr-GCMS technique, we performed analyses of tholins by studying the influence of all the analytical parameters. Among the main parameters, we studied : the influence of the temperature of pyrolysis on the nature of the gaseous compounds released by the solid tholins; the program of temperature used to heat the GC column in order to find a tradeoff for the analysis of both the lightest and heaviest compounds released by the sample; the separation of the same pyrolysates with two different columns. Moreover, the identification of numerous isomers was confirmed using analytical standards.\nWIth this study, we managed to strictly characterize a wide range of pyrolyzates for the three tholins sample studied. Most of these species are nitrogen bearing organics of various natures. More than the detection of pyrolyzates which have never been reported in previous studies, we showed that even if numerous pyrolysates were common between the three types of tholins studied, several species seem rather specific to a given initial gaseous mixture. After giving a brief status of the state of the art of this type of studies, we will present the results we obtained, which allow to give a better view of the composition and structure of Titan’s tholins, and the influence of the content of methane in the initial gaseous mixture on it.",

The Taiwan orogeny is also accompanied by the opening of the Okinawa Trough. The fold-and-thrust belt in NE Taiwan shows a convex shape. What are the roles of plate indentation and back-arc opening that played in the curvature of the NE Taiwan salient?\nOur paleomagnetic study indicates both a complex pattern of local block rotations characterized by pre- and post-folding magnetizations, and a consistent, homogeneous pattern of magnetic lineations (supported by the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility) which remain parallel to the regional fold axis all along the salient. Such homogeneity of the trends of the structures favors the interpretation of the rotational pattern as a succession of large-scale regional clockwise then local anticlockwise rotations.\nThe pre-collision structure trends corrected by the block rotations in different areas reveals a syn-collision curvature that mimics the current shape of the Central Range and an inherited convex shape only bent significantly at its northern tip. We propose to associate the main clockwise bending of the NE Taiwan salient to the indentation of the Luzon volcanic arc against the Eurasian plate and the anticlockwise \"un-bending\" to the opening of the Okinawa Trough.",

This study utilizes the daily Effective Drought Index (EDI) to precisely and quantitatively predict future drought occurrences in Korea over the period 2014–2100. The EDI is computed from precipitation data generated by the regional climate model (HadGEM3-RA) under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 8.5) scenario. Using this data for 678 grid points (12.5 km interval) groups of cluster regions with similar climates, the G1 (Northwest), G2 (Middle), G3 (Northeast) and G4 (Southern) regions, are constructed. Drought forecasting period is categorised into the early phase (EP, 2014-2040), middle phase (MP, 2041-2070) and latter phase (LP, 2071-2100). Future drought events are quantified and ranked according to the duration and intensity. Moreover, the occurrences of drought (when, where, how severe) within the clustered regions are represented as a spatial map over Korea. Based on the grid-point averages, the most severe future drought throughout the 87-year period are expected to occur in Namwon around 2039-2041 with peak intensity (minimum EDI) –3.54 and projected duration of 580 days. The most severe drought by cluster analysis is expected to occur in the G3 region with a mean intensity of –2.85 in 2027. Within the spatial area of investigation, 6 years of drought periodicity and a slight decrease in the peak intensity is noted. Finally a spatial-temporal drought map is constructed for all clusters and time-periods under consideration. ",

            "abstract": "The origin of the Greater Himalayan Sequence (GHS) of the Himalaya and the paleogeographic position of the Lhasa terrane within Gondwanaland remain controversial. In the Eastern Himalayan syntaxis, the metamorphic basements of the northern Indian plate (Namche Barwa Group) and the South Lhasa terrane (Nyingchi Complex) can be studied to explore these issues. The youngest ages of detrital zircons in the metasedimentary rocks from the Pai Formation of the Namche Barwa Group (NBG) and the Nyingchi Complex suggest their maximum depositional ages are no older than 942 Ma and 1006 Ma, respectively. A granitic gneiss intruding the Pai Formation and a metarhyolite overlying the Nyingchi Complex have protolith ages of 477 ± 3 Ma and 507 ± 4 Ma, respectively, providing upper age limits for their deposition. The detrital zircons in the Pai Formation and Nyingchi Complex define four major age peaks at ~1170 Ma, ~1350 Ma, ~1565 Ma, and ~1750 Ma. Both the ~1170 Ma and ~1350 Ma zircons have large variation of eHf(t) values (-19.4 to +5.6); most ~1565 Ma zircons have positive eHf(t) values (+1.2 - +9.0), and most ~1750 Ma zircons have negative eHf(t) values (-7.1 to -1.9), which are consistent with those of the Mesoproterozoic orthogneiss in the Duoxiongla migmatite of NBG. The trace-element signatures of ~1.5-1.3 Ga detrital zircons indicate they were derived from sources characterized by bimodal magmatism. The potential sources for the metasediments in the Pai Formation and Nyingchi Complex include the Rayner-Eastern Ghats Orogen and its contact zone with the Archaean Indian cratons, the Central Indian Tectonic Zone, the northeastern India craton and Dharwar craton, South Lhasa terrane and probably Eastern Antarctic. Comparisons of detrital zircon age spectra of the coeval metasedimentary rocks from the Nyingchi Complex, the Pai Formation, the GHS and upper Lesser Himalayan Sequence in Arunachal Himalayan, and the Indian cratonic successions suggest that: (1) the NBG is the northeastern extension of the GHS in Arunachal Himalaya; (2) their protolithes were deposited along the northern passive margin of the Indian craton; (3) prior to the Cambrian, the South Lhasa terrane was tectonically linked to northern India rather than northwest Australia.",

They include a modulation of many different ionospheric parameters at the same time, such as plasma density, neutral density, electric field, and magnetic field (electric currents). Variations in plasma temperatures are also expected. So far, these parameters have been sensed by different instruments deployed during different campaigns.\nThe newly launched satellite mission Swarm will provide observations of all these parameters onboard the same spacecraft simultaneously, with a sampling frequency of 1 Hz or higher. In addition, the Swarm constellation mission with 3 satellites, two flying side-by-side at about 470km altitude and with a local time difference of about 4min, and another satellite flying at 510km altitude provides excellent opportunity, e.g., to derive the spatial persistence of structures at different scales lengths.\nThis paper will show first results from Swarm satellite observations of post-sunset equatorial plasma irregularities. The occurrence frequency is compared to previously known results and with respect to expected variations in solar flux level and sensing altitude, correlation lengths for small and large scale structures are discussed and the simultaneous observations are used to estimate the drift speed and/or inclination of the irregularities. Given the actual state of the different Swarm data, it is tested whether and to which level irregularity magnetic signatures can be predicted by means of the remaining parameters that are sensed onboard the satellites.",

            "abstract": "Water pollution is a major challenge in large river systems such as the Ganga (i.e. Ganges). With a population of 400 million, widespread agriculture and a heavy industrial base, this river basin is facing multiple stressors and as a result, is now notorious for poor water quality. One of the key issues in addressing this problem remains basic water quality monitoring with systematic and reliable methods. Currently, water quality datasets in the River Ganga are highly fragmented and inadequate for most investigations. Given the sub-continental scale of the system, remote sensing could offer a plausible solution if capable of producing holistic assessments of water quality with a standardised methodology. Specifically, the development of hyperspectral remote sensing, capable of detecting very small changes in incident radiation, offers the potential to mimic laboratory spectroscopy and thus identify the chemicals polluting a body of water, and perhaps, even measure their concentration. However, the use of hyperspectral remote sensing in order to measure water quality is not yet established and remains a very challenging problem.\nIn this study, laboratory experiments, ancillary field data and hyperspectral imagery from the Hyperion sensor were used to explore the feasibility of using remote sensing to detect chromium pollution in the River Ganga. The laboratory experiments demonstrated that field spectroscopy was indeed capable of detecting chromium in concentrations that can currently be found in the Ganga. Furthermore, the analysis of the Hyperion images of the River Ganga shows some promising results which suggest that chromium compounds can be detected using hyperspectral satellite imagery. However, the results confirm that measuring water quality from spaceborne hyperspectral imagery is extremely challenging and further research is required to improve the confidence of these results and refine this methodology.",

            "abstract": "One of the key criteria for successful geological storage of CO2 is that the target reservoir must not leak the stored gases over extended periods. Due to the peculiarity of its geological and geodynamic setting, which results in the production, accumulation, and leakage of large volumes of natural CO2, the Italian peninsula can be used as a natural laboratory as it provides to study gas migration mechanisms in large-scale geological systems, as well as to determine whether and how much sequestered CO2 could hypothetically leak from a subsurface reservoir.\nMoving from west to east, the Italian peninsula includes several geodynamic settings: the Tyrrhenian back arc basin and associated volcanic arcs, the Apennines fold and thrust belt, and the Adriatic foredeep. All of them are characterized by a diffuse and/or massive degassing of deeply derived CO2, which is usually emitted by vents or dissolved and transported by large aquifers. In the volcanic islands, in the south of the Tyrrhenian Sea, large areas are characterized by leakage from the sea floor.\nBased on the statistical and geo-spatial interpretation of more than 40,000 soil gas samples collected in central and southern Italy by the Fluid Chemistry Laboratory of “La Sapienza” University of Rome over more than 30 years of activity, different migration patterns related to the different geodynamic settings are distinguished and described. This very large database has been organised and managed in a GIS environment that allows the calculation of fundamental statistical parameters, the analysis of distribution patterns, the study of spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity, and the elaboration of maps. The interpretation of these data allow us to define background values of CO2, strongly related to geological setting, and other minor (CH4) and trace gases (He and Rn), that characterise the different geological scenarios. A common feature is that anomalous gas concentrations occur in restricted zones, both aligned along preferential pathways (i.e. faults and fractures) and/or as spot anomalies. This database and associated studies constitutes a unique tool for studying the various physical and chemical processes involved, as well as for the development of new sampling strategies for site assessment and monitoring of any CO2 geological storage site.",

            "abstract": "Mountains are water towers that provide water security to many billions of people. An outstanding question is how climate change may affect surface-groundwater interactions in snow and ice-covered catchments. To address this question, we applied the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to the seasonally snow-covered Como Creek watershed to simulate discharge. The results for the years 2005-2008 show that the simulated discharge approximated the measured data in 2008, while the other years have been underestimated. As for the year 2008, sensitivity analysis shows that the correctly simulated discharge depends greatly on soil depth2, depth3 and Ws. For example, a 1% increase in soil depth2, depth3 or Ws leads to 1.3%, 0.8% and 1.3% increases in the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (Er). When depth2 and depth3 increased at the same time, Er increased higher than merely depth2 or depth3. The VIC results suggest that 85% of discharge is from groundwater in this snow-covered catchment. End-member mixing analysis using isotopic and geochemical tracers in 2010 showed that groundwater is the main water source for discharge, suggesting that the VIC modeling results are reasonable. The calibration of the VIC model serves as the basis for future projections in discharge after perturbations such as climate change and increases in the magnitude and timing of wildfires.",

            "abstract": " We propose a new concept of climatology called the Available Water Climate (AWC). Available water is ‘the remained water usable in every moment’ that is calculated regardless of any time intervals or the amounts of precipitation. With this concept, the Available Water Resources Index (AWRI) has been digitized following the earlier work of Byun and Lee (2002).\n The applicability of AWRI not only to the assessment and prediction of water related disasters but also to the academic researches has been tested. Resulted merits are as follows.\nFirstly, the threshold value of AWRI for the occurrence of all water related disasters like flood, drought, inundation landslide, and drought each region became clear, therefore the assessment and the prediction of them became much more precise than before. It became clear that the more extreme the AWRI value is, the severer the related disasters become. As example, all disasters caused by heavy rains, even though a small inundation, became predictable at the time step of heavy rain warning with the help of the Long-term remained water index(LWI). As another example, the drought intensity and its dates on start and end are defined with more reasonably and precisely than any other drought indexes with help of the Effective drought index (EDI) using sliding time scale.\nSecondly, the spatiotemporal distribution of water environment were digitized clearly and objectively using AWRI and new concepts of the Water Abundant Season (WAS) and the Little Water Season (LIWAS), their dates on start and end, and their strength were defined, which is very beneficial for agriculture, forestry, and all other water controls.\nAlso, the differences of water environments among regions were clearly digitized and the improvement of the climate classification by Köppen etc. became possible. Thirdly, other merits will be found continuously afterwards.",

            "abstract": "Salt marshes are geomorphic structures located in ecotone environments such as lagoon and estuaries, providing lot of ecosystem services to local population. In the last decades they are disappearing due to several factors such as sea level rise, subsidence and edge erosion due to surface waves. The latter is likely the chief mechanism modeling marsh boundaries and leading to the loss of wide marsh areas. In the case of the Venice Lagoon, from the beginning of the last century, the whole salt marsh surface has more than halved and trends indicate that the salt marshes might completely disappear over the next 50 years.\nHere, we present a field monitoring activity that we are currently carrying out on a retreating salt marsh located in the north part of the Lagoon of Venice (Italy). The marsh is subject to North-East (Bora) wind. Marsh area loss during the last decades has been documented through the comparison of georeferenced aerial photographs showing a retreat rate of the order of 1 m/year.\nField measurements started by the end of November 2013 and consist of: salt marsh bank geometry at different cross-sections and wave climate in the lagoon about 30 m in front of the salt marsh. Erosion data are obtained by means of erosion pins located horizontally on the marsh scarp; at higher banks (about 0.9 m), two pins are located along the same vertical direction, for lower banks (about 0.4m), only one pin is employed. Significant wave height has been measured during three storm surges by means of pressure transducers (Pts).\nThe measured wave climate in front of the bank was then put into relationship with the offshore wave climate estimated using wind data (intensity and direction) and bathymetric data. Wind intensity and direction is measured hourly by several measurement stations located in the Lagoon of Venice. In this way, it is possible to extrapolate wave climate hourly at the monitored marsh and calculate the wave power that acted on the bank in a given time interval.\nField survey revealed that the main retreating mechanisms are particle by particle erosion alternated to cantilever failures. Preliminary results show a linear relationship between erosion rate and wave energy flux and the existence of a critical threshold for the onset of erosion.",

            "abstract": "The French Polynesian region is characterized by positive topographic anomalies of 700 m, a concentration of hotspot chains. Many seismic tomography results show a broad low-velocity anomaly in the lower mantle continued from the base of the mantle. These observations suggest that a large-scale mantle flow rises from the bottom of the mantle beneath the region. Joint Japanese-French broadband seismological observations were performed from 2001 to 2005 with 10 island stations from the Polynesian PLUME project and 10 broadband ocean bottom seismometers (BBOBSs) from the Polynesian BBOBS project. A P-wave tomography using the data from these projects revealed that large-scale low-velocity anomalies (on the order of 1000 km in diameter) from the bottom of the mantle become smaller-scale low-velocity anomalies (on the order of 100 km in diameter) at the depth of about 1000 km. However the connection of the small-scale low-velocity anomalies to the surface hotspots was not unrevealed because of the poor resolution in the upper mantle.\nA new P-wave tomography with better resolution in the upper mantle was obtained by adding data from BBOSBSs around Society Islands deployed along the TIARES project during 2009 - 2010 and by taking the finite frequency effect into account for the frequency-depended differential travel times. The frequency-depended differential travel times were measured by multi-band cross correlating P waveforms. The new P-wave tomography shows strong low-velocity anomalies beneath the Society Islands and Pitcairn in the upper mantle although they do not extend to the 660-km discontinuity. This model also shows that small-scale low-velocity anomalies in the uppermost lower mantle. The low-velocity anomalies in the depth range about 550 - 900 km are smaller both in lateral area and amplitude than those in most of the upper mantle and the lower mantle. There is no correlation between velocity patterns in that depth range and those in the upper mantle or in the lower mantle, suggesting that the broad slow anomalies in the lower mantle do not connect to the surface directly.",

            "abstract": "In the last decades different studies have addressed short-term earthquake precursors by focusing on the observation of a wide variety of physical phenomena that can precede strong earthquakes. This includes anomalous seismicity patterns, ground water level changes, gas emissions, geochemical changes in groundwater, seismo-electromagnetic phenomena, seismo-ionospheric coupling, surface deformations etc. Some cases of the potential precursors observed in the past where later found as an artifact of sensor-system malfunctioning. Therefore, such monitoring needs to be long-term, time-stamped and continuous, with a professional quality assurance procedure. Moreover, it is important to correlate data recorded with multi-sensor systems. We present a case study of running a multi-sensor system in Valais, Switzerland. The Valais is the area of highest seismic hazard in Switzerland and has experienced a magnitude 6 or larger event every 100 years on average. The system consists of seismic, geodetic (GPS), geochemical and geomagnetic instruments. Here we focus on the latter two. In particular, the observation of possible geochemical earthquake precursory signals is carried out by the installation of two instruments: 1) field fluorometer for monitoring of the fluorescence spectral analysis of water, which can monitor 3 different wavelength bands, temperature and turbidity; 2) geochemical gas concentration sensors, which monitor radon, CO2, and CH4 gases. The geomagnetic observations are performed by three component coil magnetometers. All instrument are designed to run in continuous mode and stream data in real-time. In this presentation we focus mainly on operational aspects of such system. We discuss problems faced during operation, feasibility of the installation, and in general lessons learned for potential future applications.",

            "abstract": "The aggradation and progradation of deltaic plains over stratigraphically relevant (centennial to millennial) timescales is not well constrained, largely due to the difficulty to directly date clastic strata. Here we address this problem by means of ~50 new OSL ages from the late Holocene Mississippi Delta. We focus on the Lafourche subdelta, a precursor of the modern Mississippi River that was active from ~1500 to 600 years ago and built a land area of ~10,000 km2. The upstream reach of this system (~50 km in length) exhibits widespread aggradation by means of crevasse splays that is highly episodic in nature. The fluviodeltaic stratigraphic record at any given locality within this reach consists of a patch work of discrete, autogenic sediment bodies, with century-scale aggradation rates typically ~1 to 4 cm/yr. Sand accounts for only ~5% within these overbank strata. Hence, inland crevasse splays are extremely efficient at trapping muddy overbank sediment, with a retention rate conservatively estimated at >60%. We attribute this to the fact that aggradation occurred within a swamp, where vegetation-induced roughness enhanced the settling of the fine grain-size fractions.\nIn contrast, the lowermost ~100 km of the Lafourche subdelta formed by progradation into shallow open waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The stratigraphy within this reach is substantially different and features mouth-bar sheet sands ~2-4 m in thickness, similar to the modern Wax Lake Delta. These mouth bars are draped by mud-dominated overbank deposits that thin in a seaward direction, likely due to the shorter time span of aggradation in the lowermost reaches. OSL dating of the mouth-bar sands enables us to quantify the progradation rate of the shoreline.

In the present ridge-system, hydrogen production in the serpentinized peridotite layer, is considered as major energy source. However, low temperature hydrothermal zone in the lower crust layer in the ridge has been recognized as hydrogen producing zone. Then what is the hydrogen source in the oceanic lower crust? Accreted oceanic plateau is one of the best sample to describe hydration process due to deep-sea-hydrothermal alteration because it is easy to observe huge outcrops and collect samples systematically in whole section. We have collected rock samples from Mikabu high P/T rocks in Toba area and from Ootoyo area, Japan because there are large scale trench cliffs in the mine. Here, we report mineral composition surrounding organic carbon that was found in metabasaltic rocks from Otoyo area. The metabasalt underlies metachert, and exhibit extensive plagioclase veins. Carbonaceous material and FeS are concentrated near the veins. Serpentinization of olivine gabbro was recognized there. In the Toba area, wehrlite and hornblende gabbro are dominant as the oceanic lower crustal material, subsequently suffered high P/T metamorphism. Abundant serpentine with magnetite are along olivine grain boundaries. Cr-spinel and epidote are occasionally recognized. That is, hydrogen was produced due to hydration reaction in the intruded wherlite from the lower crust of the large plateau. In summary, the lower crust might be significant zone producing hydrogen, and provide bacteria cluster above.",

Al., 2012, Kurtz et. Al., 2013, Kwok and Maksym, 2014). To characterize and evaluate snow depth retrieval uncertainties as related to snow physical properties, an OIB mission was flown near Eureka, Nunavut (79°59’20”N, 85°56’27”W) within the Canadian Arctic archipelago as part of the 2014 OIB Arctic campaign. A series of 12 parallel flight lines covered a narrow swath of first year sea ice approximately 50 km in length. Immediately following the OIB mission, an intensive 10-day field campaign was completed to characterize snow and ice properties within the footprint of the OIB snow radar at multiple scales. Measurements were divided between two observation areas: (1) a primary sampling transect along the length of the flights to characterize horizontal variability in bulk snow properties and (2) a set of intensive grids (250 m x 250) to evaluate variations in snow properties sub-grid to OIB products. As part of each experiment, standard sampling methods were used to collect geo-located snow depth and snow pit measurements (stratigraphy, density, grain size, and salinity). More than 30,000 geo-located snow depth measurements were collected along the primary transect with 94% located within the snow radar footprint. The substantial volume of field measurements coincident with OIB snow radar observations provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate and advance the retrieval of radar-derived snow depth over sea ice. In this study, we present statistical analysis of the observed radar signal and measured snow properties at multiple scales to address previously identified ambiguities in the interpretation of the radar returns.",

            "abstract": "The understanding of focused fluid flow in sedimentary basins builds on field geological observations and the interpretation of reflection seismic data, where fluid conduits manifest as anomalous amplitude patterns known as seismic chimneys or pipes. Seismic data is the most effective method for the analysis of entire fluid flow systems by constraining subsurface geometries, fluid accumulations and permeability barriers, but seismic data cannot provide information about the internal architecture, interaction with the bedrock and flow processes due to its coarse resolution. Field geological investigations of fluid conduit outcrops are capable of filling observation gaps on a sub-seismic scale and help constrain formation dynamics as well as hydraulic properties of fluid conduits and the bedrock.\nHere, we show that it is possible to correlate specific amplitude patterns of seismic chimneys with field observation of focused fluid conduits from the Colorado Plateau. The migrating fluids (gas, water, fluidized sediment) and their formation dynamics, which can be associated with different types of conduits (fractures, fluidizations, injections), result in distinguishable seismic signatures. These constrains improve the qualitative interpretation of seismic chimneys by adding information about migration and formation characteristics. A further integration of field geological and seismic investigation of focused fluid flow structures may help to quantify their hydraulic properties and how these evolve with time, which has important implications for the hydrocarbon prospection and the subsurface storage of wastewater and CO2.",

We have determined how warmer and wetter summers affect coupled carbon-water cycling in a High Arctic polar semi-desert ecosystem in NW Greenland. Measurements of ecosystem CO2 and water fluxes throughout the growing season and leaf ecophysiological traits (gas exchange, morphology, leaf chemistry) were made at a long-term climate change experiment. After 9 years of exposure to warmer (+ 4°C) and / or wetter (+ 50% precipitation) treatments, we found diverging plant strategies between the responses to warming with or without an increase in summer precipitation. Warming alone resulted in an increase in leaf nitrogen, mesophyll conductance and leaf-mass per area and higher rates of leaf-level photosynthesis, but with warming and wetting combined leaf traits remain largely unchanged. However, total leaf area increased with warming plus wetting but was unchanged with warming alone. The combined effect of these leaf trait and canopy adjustments is a decrease in ecosystem water-use efficiency (the ratio of net productivity to evapotranspiration) with warming only, but a substantial increase with combined warming and wetting. We conclude that increasing summer precipitation will alter tundra ecohydrological responses to warming; that leaf-level changes in ecophysiological traits have an upward cascading consequence for ecosystem and land surface-climate interactions; and the current relative resistance of High Arctic ecosystems to warming may mask biochemical and carbon cycling changes already underway.",

In numerical \"water-hosing\" experiments, for example, imposing an anomalous freshwater flux in the northern hemisphere leads to a slow-down of the AMOC and a corresponding reduction of the northward heat transport. Here, we study the sensitivity of the heat transport to surface freshwater fluxes using a generalized stability analysis and find that, while the direct relationship between the AMOC and heat transport holds on shorter time scales, it completely reverses on timescales longer than ~500 yr. That is, a reduction in the AMOC volume transport can actually lead to a stronger heat transport on those long timescales, which results from the gradual increase in ocean thermal stratification. We discuss the implications of these results for the problem of steady state (statistically equilibrium) in ocean and climate GCM as well as various paleoclimate problems such as millennial climate variability and the maintenance of equable climate states.",

Based on satellite images and extensive field investigations the lake area on the Tibetna Plateau exhibits significant changes since the end of 1990s: a coherent lake growth on the TP interior (TPI) has occurred and shrinkage on the southern TP. Closed lakes on the TPI varied heterogeneously during 1976–1999, but expanded coherently and significantly in both lake area and water depth during 1999–2010. Although the decreased potential evaporation and glacier mass loss may contribute to the lake growth since the late 1990s, the significant water surplus is mainly attributed to increased regional precipitation, which, in turn, may be related to changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation, including the intensified Northern Hemisphere summer monsoon (NHSM) circulation and the poleward shift of the Eastern Asian westerlies jet stream.",

It is testing the Stern-Bloomer hypothesis that subduction initiation (SI) was followed by a strongly extensional period of slab sinking and trench roll-back and then by a transitional period leading to the establishment of significant slab-parallel plate motion and hence normal subduction. The Expedition aims to carry out offset drilling at two sites near 28°30’N in the Bonin forearc. Ideally, these together will give the vertical volcanic stratigraphy needed to trace the geodynamic and petrogenetic processes associated with SI, and provide the complete reference section required for comparison with volcanic sequences of possible SI origin found on land in ophiolite complexes and elsewhere. We predict, but need to confirm, a c. 1.0-1.5km sequence with basal, MORB-like forearc basalts (known as FAB) marking the initial period of extension, boninites characterizing the transitional period, and tholeiitic and calc-alkaline lavas marking the establishment of normal arc volcanism. Study of such a sequence will enable us to understand the chemical gradients within and across these volcanic units, to reconstruct mantle flow and melting processes during the course of SI, and to test the hypothesis that fore-arc lithosphere created during SI is the birthplace of most supra-subduction zone ophiolites. Here, we present the first Expedition results, including (a) the volcanic stratigraphic record and subdivision into lava units, (b) the classifications and interpretations made possible by shipboard (portable XRF and ICP) analyses and down-hole measurements, and (c) the biostratigraphic, magnetic, mineralogical, sedimentary and structural constraints on the geological history of the SI section and the interactions between magmatic, hydrothermal and tectonic activity during its evolution.",

            "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated [1] that the vascular system of the healthy human brain cortex is a superposition of two structural components, each corresponding to a different spatial scale. At small-scale, the vascular network has a capillary structure, which is homogeneous and space-filling over a cut-off length. At larger scale, veins and arteries conform to a quasi-fractal branched structure. This structural duality is consistent with the functional duality of the vasculature, i.e. distribution and exchange. From a modeling perspective, this can be viewed as the superposition of: (a) a continuum model describing slow transport in the small-scale capillary network, characterized by a representative elementary volume and effective properties; and (b) a discrete network approach [2] describing fast transport in the arterial and venous network, which cannot be homogenized because of its fractal nature.\nThis problematic is analogous to modeling problems encountered in geological media, e.g, in petroleum engineering, where fast conducting channels (wells or fractures) are embedded in a porous medium (reservoir rock). An efficient method to reduce the computational cost of fractures/continuum simulations is to use relatively large grid blocks for the continuum model. However, this also makes it difficult to accurately couple both structural components. In this work, we solve this issue by adapting the “well model” concept used in petroleum engineering [3] to brain specific 3-D situations. We obtain a unique linear system of equations describing the discrete network, the continuum and the well model coupling. Results are presented for realistic geometries and compared with a non-homogenized small-scale network model of an idealized periodic capillary network of known permeability.\n[1] Lorthois & Cassot, J.

            "abstract": "On Oct 19th of this year, circa 18:30 UT, dynamically new Oort Cloud comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) will fly within 138,000 km of the planet Mars. This distance is so small (~1/3 the mean Earth-Moon distance, and 16 times closer than any comet has approached the Earth in the modern spaceflight era) that Mars will be moving through the comet's outer atmosphere, or coma, carrying Mars, and its orbiting and ground based roving spacecraft fleet with it. In this way the Mars fleet will be participating in a close comet flyby, and in addition to supporting the encounter by leading NASA's CIOC campaign, our group is also obtaining remote sensing observations of the comet in September - October 2014. We have received 5 partial days of observing time in late September at the NASA/IRTF facility, when the comet is brightest from the Earth, to use the SPeX NIR spectrometer at 2-5 um to measure the comet's gas and dust production contemporaneously with the BOPPS balloon mission. We have also obtained 54 ksec of Chandra time and 10 orbits of HST time to monitor the comet's nucleus, dust, and the gas/ion interaction and x-ray emission from the comet and Mars during the close encounter on 19-20 October 2014. Both the comet and Mars are known x-ray emitters, and Mars' flight through the comet's outer coma downstream wrt the solar wind suggests there will be an important transfer of gas and ions into the Martian exosphere, enhancing the Martian x-ray signal.\nIn this paper we report on our preliminary results from the Chandra, HST, and IRTF observations and put them in context with other observations taken during the Comet Siding Spring Observing Campaign.",

            "abstract": "The Andes constitute one of the most important orographic barriers in the S hemisphere, which impacts atmospheric circulation, the amount and distribution of rainfall, and resulting surface processes. In the central Andes of Argentina the orogenic Puna Plateau and the intermontane basins within the adjacent Eastern Cordillera (EC) constitute archives that furnish spatiotemporal information on the uplift of the orogen and ensuing paleoenvironmental changes. Presently, rainfall in NW Argentina is focused along the windward flanks of the EC, while its intermontane basins and the Puna constitute high-elevation regions with decreasing rainfall and steep topographic gradients. The influence of topography on hydrologic conditions is reflected in the stable isotopic composition of meteoric water. Importantly, in light of these systematic present-day isotope characteristics, proxy materials retrieved from basin strata may record analogous conditions in the past and provide insight concerning topographic growth through time. Here, we present isotopic data of volcanic glass (δDg), extracted from volcanic ash deposits interbedded with strata in different sedimentary basins across the E flank of the plateau. Combined with geochronology, our data show clear spatiotemporal variations in δDg within the different basins that are correlated with regional topographic growth and associated orographic effects during the Mio-Pliocene. For example, the Humahuaca basin (23.5°S) shows a gradual δDg-decrease that documents uplift of the basin catchment and possibly enhanced rainout along a paleo-Andean front, followed by a strong shift towards modern δDg values (–100‰) after 3 Ma, associated with aridification due to range uplift and orographic shielding to the E. In the Angastaco basin (25.5°S), δDg is more variable prior to 3.5 Ma (–70 to –95‰). Conditions similar to today (–65‰) were established by at least 1 Ma. Isotopic and sedimentologic data from the Toro basin (24.5°S) suggest a similar pattern, indicating topographic growth along the E Andean front. Isotope data from the broken foreland to the east seem unaffected by large isotopic shifts, which may ultimately help to reconstruct relative elevation changes across the Andes to better understand the topographic evolution of the orogen interior.",

            "abstract": "Population growth increases food request. Assessing food demand and predicting the actual supply for a given location are critical components of strategic food security planning at regional scale. Crop yield can be simulated using crop models because is site-specific and determined by weather, management, length of growing season and soil properties. Crop models require reliable location-specific data that are not generally available. Obtaining these data at a large number of locations is time-consuming, costly and sometimes simply not feasible. An upscaling method to extend coverage of sparse estimates of crop yield to an appropriate extrapolation domain is required. This work is aimed to investigate the applicability of a geostatistical data fusion approach for merging remote sensing data with the predictions of a simulation model of wheat growth and production using ground-based data. The study area is Capitanata plain (4000 km2) located in Apulia Region, mostly cropped with durum wheat. The MODIS EVI/NDVI data products for Capitanata plain were downloaded from the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LPDAAC) remote for the whole crop cycle of durum wheat. Phenological development, biomass growth and grain quantity of durum wheat were simulated by the Delphi system, based on a crop simulation model linked to a database including soil properties, agronomical and meteorological data. Multicollocated cokriging was used to integrate secondary exhaustive information (multi-spectral MODIS data) with primary variable (sparsely distributed biomass/yield model predictions of durum wheat). The model estimates looked strongly spatially correlated with the radiance data (red and NIR bands) and the fusion data approach proved to be quite suitable and flexible to integrate data of different type and support.",

            "abstract": "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays an important role in climate. The classical view of an ocean conveyor belt with northward surface currents and southward return currents transporting convectively-formed waters from the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean to other ocean basins suggests a tight relation between convection and sinking. However, convection regions feature a large vertical heat and salt transport, but very little vertical mass transport. Instead, it has been argued that the net sinking of dense waters that constitute the sinking branch of the AMOC must take place near boundaries and steep topography rather than in the ocean interior.\nSo far, this theoretical result has been confirmed in highly idealized regional model studies and in laboratory experiments. It is, however, unclear how well the sinking of dense waters is represented in the current generation of ocean models and climate models, and whether the factors driving and controlling the sinking are in accordance with the developed theory. The latter is of crucial importance for the reliability of the projected future behavior of the AMOC and its impacts on climate.\nIn this study, we address this issue by analyzing the outcomes of two global ocean models that differ only in their horizontal resolution (an eddy-permitting version, and a climate-model like version). We analyze the characteristics of the sinking, like the amount and spatial pattern. Moreover, the partition between sinking in the boundary current region and sinking in the interior is quantified. It appears that model resolution (and applied numerical diffusion) have a strong impact on the characteristics of the modeled sinking. These impacts are discussed in light of differences in the characteristics of the subpolar gyre circulation.",

            "abstract": "The reduction of snow spectral albedo by black carbon(BC) and mineral dust, both alone and in combination, is computed using radiative-transfer modeling. Several size distributions of BC are examined; one is chosen to represent ambient soot. Many measurements of absorption spectra of mineral dust are critically reviewed as a basis for specifying dust properties for modeling. Two standard solar spectra are used: clear sky with the global average(insolation-weighted) solar zenith angle ~50 degrees, and the spectrum under an overcast cloud of optical thickness 11. The primary variables for the parameterizations are the radiatively-effective snow grain radius (r) and BC mass mixing ratio (C) in snow (and/or dust mixing ratio). A change of solar zenith angle can be mimicked by changing the snow grain radius.\nResults are shown for all mass-mixing ratios (MMR) covering the full range from pure snow to pure soot and pure dust, and for snow grain radii from 5 to 2500 mm, to cover the range of possible grain sizes on planetary surfaces. To keep the parameterizations simple, only opaque homogeneous snowpacks are considered. Parameterizations are developed for three broad bands used in GCMs as well as several narrower bands; quadratic or cubic functions of log r and log C are generally adequate. The parameterizations are valid up to BC content of 10 ppm, which is needed for highly polluted snow, for example as found in northeast China.\nA given MMR of BC causes greater albedo reduction in coarse-grained snow; BC and r can be combined into a single variable to compute the reduction of albedo relative to pure snow. For allwave albedo or visible albedo, a twofold increase of C results in the same change in BC-caused albedo reduction as multiplying r by 2.6. The near-IR albedo is less sensitive to BC content; there a twofold increase of C can be mimicked by a fivefold increase of r.\nThe albedo reduction by soot is less if the snow already contains dust, a common situation on mountain glaciers, for example in the Himalaya, and in the agricultural and grazing lands of North America and Central Asia. The effect of dust on snow albedo at visible wavelengths can be represented by an “equivalent BC” MMR, which is about a factor of 200 smaller than the dust MMR. Dust has little effect on the near-IR albedo because the near-IR albedo of pure dust is similar to that of pure snow.",

            "abstract": "Seeing the iconic Grand Canyon and Death Valley in person is a transformative experience for most geologists, including nine undergraduate geology students from upstate New York. The students were enrolled in a one-credit course designed around a nine-day spring-break field trip to Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP) and Death Valley National Park (DVNP). We met once a week before the trip to plan day-to-day activities and discuss background geologic information. Students selected a research topic related to our itinerary and wrote a guidebook entry for the topic. Students’ entries were combined with papers, maps, and background material to make a guidebook. The printed guidebooks provided students with a “publication” of their work to show to others and refer to in the field. The nine-day field trip started with a flight into Las Vegas, NV, on 3/1/14. We spent three nights camping at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, one night camping in Valley of Fire State Park (VOFSP, 55 mi N of Las Vegas), and three nights staying at the Shoshone Education and Research Center (SHEAR) east of Death Valley. Highlights of the trip included the hike along the Bright Angel Trail (and fault) to Plateau Point and recognition of the Great Unconformity at GCNP; the White Domes loop hike, camping at the Beehives, and observation of the Muddy Mountain Overthrust in VOFSP; and hikes at Ubehebe Crater, Badwater Salt Flat, and Natural Bridge Canyon in DVNP. Each student presented his/her research topic at a pertinent point in the field trip; students were impressively well-prepared. One requirement of the course was a poster presentation on each student’s research topic at our Undergraduate Research Symposium in April. For most of the students, the poster session was the first experience preparing and presenting a poster. In addition, the class gave a joint colloquium presentation to several hundred science majors and a number of science faculty at Saint Rose. Each student spoke for five minutes on his/her research topic, accompanied by slides. This was their first experience giving a talk in public, and most learned the lesson that preparation and practice are keys to a good talk. Course evaluations were overwhelmingly positive. In my experience, there is no substitute for seeing geology in the field; the students agreed.",

            "abstract": "Earth deserts show a rich variety of dune shapes from transverse to barchan, star and linear dunes depending on the history of wind regimes (strength and variability) and sand availability [1]. In desert, exposed to one wind direction, dunes perpendicular to the wind direction are found to be transverse or barchans, only sand availability plays a key role on their formation and evolution. However, the evolution time scale of such structures (several years) limits our investigation of their morphodynamics understanding. We use here, a laboratory experiment able to considerably reduce space and time scales by reproducing millimeter to centimeter subaqueous dunes by controlling environmental parameters such as type of wind (multi-winds, bimodal, quasi-bimodal or unidirectional wind) and amount of sediment [2,3]. This set up allows us to characterize more precisely the different modes of dune formation and long-term evolution, and to constrain the physics behind the morphogenesis and dynamics of dunes. Indeed, the formation, evolution and transition between the different dune modes are better understood and quantified thanks to a new setting experiment able to give a remote sediment source in continuous (closer to what happens in terrestrial desert): a sand distributor that controls the input sand flow. Firstly, in a one wind direction conditions, we managed to follow and quantify the growth of the instability of transverse dunes that break into barchans when the sand supply is low and reversely when the sand supply is higher, barchan fields evolve to bars dunes ending to form transverse. The next step will be to perform experiments under two winds conditions in order to better constrain the formation mode of linear dunes, depending also only on the input sand flux. Previous experiments shown that linear “finger” dunes can be triggered by the break of transverse dunes and then the elongating of one barchan’s arm [4].\nThese studies can farther explain more precisely in different wind history and sand supply, these patterns state that should emerge and, by applying the relevant scale law, to apply this laboratory work to terrestrial and planetary (Mars and Titan) desert dynamics.\n[1] Bagnold R.A.

Up to now, LFM-helio has been limited to steady-state solutions dominated by corotating structures. We have developed a generalized interface for specification of time-dependent coronal boundary conditions and ingestion of MAS simulation data into the LFM model. The coupling is done by overlapping the LFM inner boundary buffer region with the outer portion of the MAS coronal grid. LFM-helio operates in the inertial rest frame, but our coupling code is sufficiently flexible that MAS solutions performed in either rotating or inertial frames can be ingested. We present results of a number of idealized coupled MAS/LFM-helio simulations — ranging from simply symmetric solar wind background to realistic including high and slow speed streams — intended to test the interface for seamless propagation of transients from the corona into the inner heliosphere domain. The transients are then tracked to larger heliocentric distances — to Earth and beyond. We specifically investigate the magnetic structure of the CMEs as they propagate through the interplanetary medium including rotation and erosion, and consider how the simulation resolution affects the results. We also developed codes for creation of synthetic white-light heliographic images which are used to help track CMEs kinematics through J-maps and put the simulations into a realistic observational context.",

            "abstract": "Modelling energy balance interactions between forests and sub-canopy snow requires an improved understanding of how trees absorb then emit radiation. The amount of long-wave enhancement at the sub-canopy snow surface, relative to above canopy long-wave emittance from the atmosphere, is strongly affected by the surface temperature of forest elements (trunks, crowns, needles, leaves) exposed to incoming radiation. Here we present in-situ meteorological, tree temperature and forest canopy structure measurements from Arctic European snow-covered boreal forests; March through April in Abisko, Sweden (2011) and Sodankylä, Finland (2012). Meteorological measurements are used to assess spatial and temporal variations in tree temperatures and sub-canopy long-wave enhancement. Simple models, which use hemispherical photography to derive sky-view fractions, are used in conjunction with measured air temperature, tree trunk temperature and Terrestrial Laser Scanning measurements to assess the influence of tree type, forest canopy structure and application of sky-view fraction in modelled estimation of sub-canopy long-wave radiation.",

To the four mission objectives, i.e., disaster mitigation, environmental monitoring represented by the forest monitoring and cryospheric monitoring, land monitoring, and technology development, PALSAR-2 and ALOS-2 provides the 1~3m high resolution Spotlight and Strip with multi polarization with an imaging swath of 50km, ScanSAR imaging with 350~490km swath with dual polarizations, shorter temporal baseline of 14 days and spatial baseline of within 1km, shorter time delay of less than 72 hours (74 hours in worst case) for emergency observation request to the disaster area, and almost all of global beam synchronization for ScanSAR Interferometry. ALOS-2 science program initiates the JAXA’s Calibration, Validation, Application researches of the PALSAR-2/ALOS-2 and Pi-SAR-L2. As the application research, the disaster mitigation and the urban area monitoring using the high-resolution data should contribute significantly to the human society since the disasters occur frequently and globally. High resolution and multi polarimetric SAR with the shorter revisit time reserves the quicker detection of the land changes. In this presentation, we will summarize the contents of the ALOS-2 science program, its expected outcomes, and comparative study results with PALSAR.\nSome application examples of the disaster mitigation using the recent high resolution SARs, i.e., Pi-SAR-L2 and PALSAR will be also introduced. Kyoto and Carbon Initiative project is the JAXA’s Forest and related Carbon estimation project using the time series PALSAR, PALSAR-2 and ground truth dataset. It was established in 2002 and continued for KC-3 (2011/9~2014/3) and later. Main products that will be used are the forest distribution, forest change, ScanSAR mosaic, high resolution SAR mosaic (time series) and those produced for ALSO and JERS-1. Under the collaboration with 3 international institutes, estimating the forest carbon and its time series, and their relationship with the environmental change will be investigated.",

            "abstract": "Modern day ocean circulation is dominated by thermal convection with cold waters subsiding in the Northern Atlantic, filling the ocean interior with cold and heavy water. However, ocean circulation diminished during the last glaciation and consequently the downwelling of the cold. Therefore interior ocean water temperatures must have been affected by other mechanisms which are negligible in the current state. We propose that the submergence of highly saline water from warm seas with high rates of evaporation (like the Red or Mediterranean Sea) was a major factor controlling ocean circulation during the last glaciation. Even today, waters in these poorly connected seas are the heaviest waters in the World ocean (1.029 g/cm3). The second mechanism affecting ocean temperature is the geothermal heat flux. With no heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean, geothermal heat flux through the ocean floor is capable of increasing ocean temperature by tens of degrees C over a 100 thousand year glacial cycle.\nTo support these hypotheses we present an ocean box model that describes thermohaline circulation in the World Ocean. According to the model parameters, all water circulation is driven by the water density gradient. Boxes include high-latitude seas, high salinity seas, surface ocean, glaciers, and rift and lateral zones of the ocean interior. External heat sources are radiative forcing, affected by Milankovich cycles, and geothermal heat flux. Additionally this model accounts for the heat produced by organic rain decay.\nTaking all input parameters close to currently observed values, the model manages to recreate the glacial-interglacial cycles. During the glacial periods only haline circulation takes place, the ocean is strongly stratified, and the interior ocean accumulates heat while high-latitudes accumulate ice. 112,000 years after glaciation starts, water density on the ocean bottom becomes equal to the density of water in high-latitude seas, strong thermal convection takes placeand the ocean quickly (within 14,600 years) releases the heat.\nTo our knowledge, this current hypothesis is the only one capable of giving the explanation for the abrupt 25 degree C increase in atmospheric temperature in Greenland during the last deglaciation.",

These compounds could partition into atmospheric water droplets, and react within the aqueous phase producing higher molecular weight and less volatile compounds which could form new aerosol (Ervens et al., 2011).\nThis work investigates the formation and composition of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from the photooxidation of isoprene and methacrolein (its main first-generation oxidation product) and the effect of cloud water on SOA formation and composition.\nThe experiments were performed within the CUMULUS project (CloUd MULtiphase chemistry of organic compoUndS in the troposphere) at the 4.2 m3 stainless steel CESAM chamber (Wang et al., 2011). In each experiment, isoprene or methacrolein was injected in the chamber together with HONO under dry conditions before irradiation. The experimental protocol was optimised to generate cloud events in the chamber, lasting for ca. 10 minutes in the presence of light. Gas phase compounds were analyzed on-line by a Proton Transfer Reaction Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS), a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), NOx and O3 analyzers. SOA formation and composition were analysed on-line with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and an Aerodyne High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and off-line through sampling on filters and analysis in GC-MS and LC-MS.\nWe observed that during cloud formation water soluble gas-phase oxidation products readily partitioned into cloud droplets and new SOA was promptly produced. Chemical composition, elemental ratios and density of SOA were compared before, during cloud formation and after cloud evaporation.\nErvens, B. et al. (2011) Atmos. Chem.

            "abstract": "In July 2010 a strong biomass burning event occurred in the North of Saskatchewan, Canada. The fires were well observed by satellites. The changing synoptic situation and the variations in plume height created a complex distribution of the emitted gaseous and particulate matter.\nThe comprehensive regional model system COSMO-ART allows us to study the influence of aerosols on the atmosphere. The formation of new aerosol particles from gaseous precursors is as well accounted as changes in the mixing state of existing aerosol particles. The impact of aerosol particles on cloud microphysics and precipitation is simulated by a two-moment scheme in combination with parameterizations for aerosol activation and ice nucleation. To address emissions from biomass burning, the model system was extended by a plume rise model. It delivers the effective emission height which depends on the current state of the atmosphere and the fire intensity. Datasets based on satellites provide the composition and source strength of numerous chemical tracers.\nWith this framework we are able to gain insight into various effects of aerosols from biomass burning. We found that simulated aerosol optical depth is in very good agreement with AERONET measurements. Temperature at the surface is significantly influenced by adsorbing and scattering particles inside elevated smoke layers. This has further impact on thermal stratification. The high aerosol load inside clouds leads to displaced precipitation patterns. Number and size distributions of cloud droplets are examined for different smoke regimes. It turns out that it depends on the hygroscopicity of available aerosols.",

            "abstract": "We present a synthetic view of the plasma microinstabilities which can occur in the foot of supercritical perpendicular shocks. In these shocks a substantial fraction of ions is reflected at the steep shock ramp. Then, some streaming instabilities are excited by the relative drifts between populations of incoming ions, reflected ions, and electrons across the foot’s magnetic field. The instabilities cover wavelengths from the ion inertia length to the electron gyroradius and frequencies from the lower-hybrid to the electron cyclotron, depending upon solar wind characteristics.\nThe particle distributions are modelled as three components: a broad electron population and two ion populations, namely a core and a beam representing the reflected ions. The two ion populations drift in opposite direction with respect to the electron population so as to ensure the zero current condition along the shock normal direction. Assuming the ion beam is directed along the shock normal at 90° to B0, we investigate the possible instabilities under various wave propagation angles. The plasma considered is characterized by a double anisotropy: one defined by the direction of B0, the other by that of the reflected beam. Let Ψ be the magnetic coplanarity plane defined by these two directions. There are therefore two main angles playing a role for the instabilities: (a) the angle θbk between the wave vector and B0, (b) the angle ψvk between the wave vector and the plane Ψ containing the beam. As a result the 3 × 3 dielectric tensor Q is full with terms that are distinct.\nWe show three types of instability at various angles: 1) one about the electron gyroradius with frequencies at the electron cyclotron frequency Ωe and harmonics; 2) one about the electron inertia length with frequencies less than Ωe ; 3) one about the ion inertia length with frequencies of the order of the lower-hybrid. The dispersion relation is computed with the dielectric tensor Q for different parameter values. The instabilities are analyzed with full electromagnetic PIC simulations and are compared with the MTSI-1 and 2 of Matsukyio and Scholer [JGR 111, 2006] or the low-frequency whistlers of Hellinger and Mangeney [JGR 102, 1997] are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Bedrock geology, climate and time are important controls on chemical weathering and release of dissolved silica. Forested land vs. other land uses was recently hypothesized as another control. The Finger Lakes region is an ideal natural laboratory to test this hypothesis as local watersheds vary in area, bedrock and agricultural to forested land cover in this rural setting.\nAnnual mean dissolved silica data from 11 watersheds in our ongoing monitoring program ranged from 100 to 4,000 μg/L Si, analyzing filtered (0.45 μm) samples by spectrophotometer (molybdate indicator with metol/oxalic acid reagents). Like earlier work, only forested land use (12 to 73%) correlated to the mean silica concentrations (r2 = 0.3), which improves (r2 = 0.6) when a small, primarily (24%) developed watershed is excluded from the correlation. Bedrock (Devonian carbonates, 0 to 8% and clastics, 0 to 99% covered by till) and basin area (10 to 500 km2) did not correlate (r2 <= 0.1). Event and base flow samples of an agricultural (64%) watershed revealed peak to base flow fluctuations in silica concentrations that more closely mimic nitrates and other groundwater solutes than suspended particles, phosphates and other runoff signature parameters.\nAnnual mean epilimnion and hypolimnion dissolved silica data from the 8 easternmost Finger Lakes in our ongoing monitoring program ranged from 250 to 1,500 μg/L Si. Forested cover (30 to 75%) positively correlated to epilimnion silica concentrations (r2 = 0.6). Lake water residence time (1 to 17 yr) negatively correlated to hypolimnion silica concentrations (r2 = 0.5). Agricultural land use, bedrock, and productivity indicators (chlorophyll-a, total phosphate, and secchi disk depth) lacked correlation (r2 <= 0.1). It suggested that land use impacts stream and, surprisingly, lake dissolved silica chemistry. Biogeochemical processes in the lakes like diatom uptake appears to increasingly decrease silica concentrations in lakes with longer residence times.",

            "abstract": "Thawing permafrost and the resulting mineralization of previously frozen organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are considered important future feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere. We characterized two contrasting permafrost cores as well as 21 top permafrost cores from Zackenberg in High-Arctic Greenland which is a site characterized by progressive permafrost thawing of more than 1 cm y-1 since 1996. Samples have been analyzed for total C and N content, dissolved C and N as well as the potential production of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in an incubation experiment.\n10 days after the thawing was initiated, rRNA from selected samples were extracted, transformed into cDNA and cloned to obtain an overview of the most abundant active bacterial populations in the incubation experiment. A total of 697 clones were successfully sequenced, yielding 21 unique OTUs. Despite the relatively high coverage values the diversity of bacteria in the samples was low (with a maximum Shannon-Wiener diversity index of 2.1).\nFirmicutes (6 OTUs, 45-77% of clones) and Gammaproteobacteria (5 OTUs, 19-47% of clones) were the dominant groups in the samples, with Betaproteobacteria (4 OTUs), Actinobacteria (4 OTUs), Alphaproteobacteria (1 OTU) and Bacteroidetes (1 OTU) being less dominant. These characterizations revealed that those bacteria that are able to quickly colonize the thawing permafrost are mainly related to three groups of bacterial clones: Lysinibacillus; Pseudomonas and Clostridium.\nQuantification of functional genes related to soil nitrogen transformation were performed both on the DNA and on the mRNA level using primers specific for genes involved in production of nitrous oxide (nirS, nirK) and consumption of nitrous oxide (nosZ). This showed that the genes were found in most soils, but that they only were expressed at a low level. We further measured the rates of nitrous oxide release from the soils and found that these were not clearly related to the potential (DNA) and activity (mRNA) found in the soils.\nHowever, distinct differences were found in the active microbiomes of the thawed soils, and this is discussed in relation to the emission of N2O, CH4 and CO2.",

            "abstract": "Serpentinization is a metamorphic process by which ultramafic rocks are hydrothermally altered to store H2O, produce magnetite and release H2, a part of which may be converted into CH4 by Fischer-Tropsch reactions. It could have been a major process to trap a large fraction of the H2O of the planet during the Noachian in altered minerals at depth and at the same time release a significant amount of H2 and CH4 to the crust and the atmosphere. An amount of a 300-1000 m deep Global Equivalent Layer of H2O trapped in serpentine has been proved to be consistent with both present crustal magnetization and atmospheric D/H ratio (Chassefière et al., 2013). The corresponding total amount of H2 released in the course of serpentinization is ~7 1020 moles, a part of which (up to several tens percents by referring to Earth’s case) may have been converted to CH4 and trapped in the lower cryosphere under hydrate form. As shown by Lasue et al. (2014), the CH4 trapping capacity of the early martian cryosphere exceeds, or is similar to, the above amount. Any destabilization of the CH4-rich cryosphere after most serpentinization occurred, at the end of the Noachian, could have resulted in the release to the atmosphere of huge amounts of CH4, rapidly converted into H2 by photochemical reactions. Ramirez et al. (2014) have shown that the collision-induced absorption caused by H2 could have increased surface temperature above H2O freezing point, provided CO2 pressure was in the range from 1-2 bar and H2 mixing ratio larger than 5%. A simple calculation shows that the CH4 accumulated in the early martian cryosphere is able to feed up the atmosphere with H2 at the required level during a time up to 2 107 yr, larger than the time generally assumed to be necessary for valley network formation (Hoke et al., 2011). We discuss the possible occurrence of a positive feedback of H2-induced greenhouse increasing the amount of liquid H2O available for serpentinization, and the resulting potentially sharp climate change. Because the same mechanism is responsible for both H2-induce greenhouse and trapping of H2O to serpentine, a rapid tipping from a short intense hydrological event to dry conditions is expected. Possible removal by flowing water of most of CO2 atmosphere and its transfer to subsurface hydrothermal systems where carbonate may have been formed is also discussed.",

            "abstract": "This work explains the sedimentation history and environment and climate changes during the Holocene along the southwest coast of India. The area is characterized by various landforms such as lagoons, barrier islands, beach ridges, paleostrandlines, alluvial plains, marshy lands and flood plains. Paleodelta, located at the mouth of the modern Periyar River is an important geomorphic marker.\nA borehole of 40 m depth was drilled in the paleodelta and sediment samples were recovered at different depth intervals. Paleoclimate and paleo-environment were inferred based on geochronology, textural and geotechnical parameters, clay minerals, and pollen analysis results.\nThe bottom of the borehole represents an age of ~ 12 ka BP. Sediments exhibit coarsening texture upwards of the borehole, with fine mud and peat intercalations at the bottom. Six litho facies - muddy sand, sand, sandy mud, silty sand, sandy silt, and mud - were recorded. Geotechnical properties comprising moisture content, organic carbon, plasticity index record high values, whereas low bulk density associated with a low critical shear stress, are recorded. An increase in illite and to a lesser degree smectite with concomitant decrease in kaolinite is observed.\nSediment texture represents a major change of depositional environment from marine to fluvial sedimentary facies during the major sea level fall i.e., after 7 ka B.P. The present sea level attained during 4-5 ka B.P; major rise of sea level has taken place from 7-11 ka BP and regression during 7 – 5 ka B.P. These transgression and regression phases introduced the changes in the environment of deposition. The monsoon was dynamic and more intense after the major fall of sea level causing the fluctuations in the fluvial facies. Upward coarsening of grain size in the borehole indicates change in sediment deposition due to increased hydrodynamic conditions and strong fluvial action, which can be linked to marine regression. Geotechnical properties suggest textural changes and sedimentary facies. An upward increase in smectite and kaolinite and decreasing illite supports major fall in sea level and also the aridity. Pollen record of sediment strata supports the paleo-environment dominated by the presence of semi-evergreen type of mangrove plants during mid- to early-Holocene times.",

            "abstract": "We use OpenGGCM global MHD simulations to study the nightside magnetospheric/ magnetotail/ ionospheric responses to interplanetary (IP) fast foward shocks. Three cases are presented in this study: two inclined oblique shocks, hereafter IOS-1 and IOS-2, where the latter has a Mach number twice stronger than the former. Both shocks have impact angles of 30o in relation to the Sun-Earth line. Lastly, we choose a frontal perpendicular shock, FPS, whose shock normal is along th Sun-Earth line, with the same Mach number as IOS-1. We find that, in the IOS-1 case, due to the north-south asymmetry, the magnetotail is deflected southward, leading to a mild compression. The geomagnetic activity observed in the nightside ionosphere is then weak. On the other hand, in the head-on case, the FPS compresses the magnetotail on both sides symmetrically. This compression triggers a substorm allowing a larger amount of stored energy in the magnetotail to be released to the nightside ionosphere, resulting in a larger geomagnetic activity there. By comparing IOS-2 and FPS, we find that, despite the IOS-2 having a larger Mach number, the FPS leads to larger geomagnetic responses in the ionosphere nightside. As a result, we conclude that IP shocks with similar upstream conditions, such as magnetic field, speed, density, and even Mach number, can be differently geoeffective, depending on their shock normal orientation.",

            "abstract": "The pollen 14C age and oxygen isotopic composition of siliceous sinter deposits from the former Beowawe geyser field reveal evidence of two hydrothermal discharge events that followed relatively low-magnitude ( < M5) earthquakes of Holocene and Late Pleistocene age along the Malpais fault zone in Whirlwind Valley, Nevada, USA. The observed 20 %o trend of decreasing over about a 5000 to 7000 year period following each earthquake is consistent with a single-pass, fault-controlled groundwater flow system that received increasing amounts of recharge of cool, unexchanged, meteoric water through time. Hydrothermal/isotopic model reconstructions of the Beowawe system suggests that each of the earthquakes must have produced at least a 103 fold increase in fault permeability (from < 10-14 m2 to > 10-11 m2). Observed overturned temperature profiles in geothermal wells close (300m) to the Malpais fault suggest the onset of thermal convection occurred over shorter time scales (200-1000 years). We suggest that individual Malpais fault segments become clogged on shorter time scales and new routes to the surface are taken.",

            "abstract": "The Cascadia subduction zone is a hot end-member system that is characterized by the subduction of young, thickly sedimented lithosphere. Previous receiver function studies have observed a low velocity zone (LVZ) with strong contrasts along the thrust up to 40 km depth. It is hypothesized that this may be created by a channel of either near-lithostatic pressure fluids or stronger metasediments, implying a weak thrust zone. These studies have been limited to data from onshore stations, and thus have not imaged the shallower, geodetically locked portion of the thrust zone, which is located offshore. The ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) from the Cascadia Initiative (CI), which are among the first broadband instruments successfully deployed in shallow water using low-profile Trawl-Resistant-Mounts (TRM), offer the opportunity to extend receiver function studies of the LVZ offshore. Calculation of receiver functions from OBS data is difficult due to water column noise. Fortunately, the TRM housing yields quieter horizontal-component signals, and with proper application of tilt and compliance corrections receiver functions are calculated at all of the successfully deployed TRM OBS from CI Year 1, as well as at some deep water stations. We use velocity models from the previous onshore receiver function studies to generate synthetic receiver functions to compare with our data. Several of the stations on the continental margin have consistent arrivals at 3-4 s lag that match predicted depths for the subduction interface. The shallow-water stations deployed off the coast of Grays Harbor, Washington record a high-amplitude asymmetric arrival consistent with reverberations off the top and bottom of the LVZ. This high-amplitude arrival is not as evident at other stations along the margin region. This along strike variation may be evidence for segmentation along the thrust zone; however, a careful analysis of these complex signals will be needed to determine the extent of the LVZ offshore. The evolution of this LVZ from the up-dip locked region through the transition zone to the down-dip freely slipping region will aid in our understanding of the hydration state of the Cascadia thrust.",

            "abstract": "Since the mid-Pliocene, East Asian climates have experienced significant changes. One view suggests that significant uplift of the Tibetan Plateau during this period could have been responsible for these dramatic changes in the strength of the East Asian monsoon and for Asian interior aridification, while some other authors attribute these changes to the ongoing global cooling and rapid growth of the Arctic ice-sheet. Up to the present, which factor dominates the major changes of East Asian climate in the mid-Pliocene is still a contentious issue. This study presents an analysis of several climate proxies including magnetic susceptibility, grain-size, (CaO*+Na2O+MgO)/TiO2 ratio, Na/Ka ratio, Fe flux, and dust accumulation rates of the Xifeng Red Clay sequence in the eastern Chinese Loess Plateau and the Xihe Pliocene loess-soil sequence in West Qinling. They reveal that aridity in the continental interior and winter monsoon circulation both intensified, whereas the East Asian summer monsoon showed a weakening rather than intensifying trend since the mid-Pliocene. These changes are also supported by the other multi-proxy records from various regions in East Asia. Previous numerical modeling studies have demonstrated that uplift of the Tibetan Plateau would have simultaneously enhanced continental-scale summer and winter monsoon strength as well as central Asian aridity. The mid-Pliocene climate changes in East Asia are therefore unlikely to be a response to Plateau uplift. On the contrary, our recent modeling results give support to the view that ongoing cooling could have intensified both the aridity of the interior and the strength of the winter monsoon, but weakened the summer monsoon in East Asia.",

            "abstract": "This study aims to provide overall understanding of the summertime synoptic variability of precipitation and moisture transport at midlatitude over East Asia and the northwestern Pacific.\nUsing satellite precipitation and reanalysis data, a clear relationship is found between upper tropospheric disturbances (Rossby waves), surface precipitation, and lower tropospheric humidity. The upper tropospheric disturbances are characterized by the undulation of the 1.5 PVU contours of potential vorticity (PV) on the 350-K isentropic surfaces. Case studies suggest that a precipitation belt of several hundred kilometers wide and one to several thousand kilometers long is formed very frequently on the equatorward and low-PV side of the northernmost 1.5 PVU contours, which meander together around 40N. Lower tropospheric specific humidity is also enhanced there, and it falls sharply to the north of these contours. The synoptic situations associated with it include, but are not limited to, the familiar situation in which moist convection is enhanced ahead of upper-level troughs. These results are confirmed by a composite analysis over the 12 summers from 2001.\nA novel method of analyzing the forcing of the quasi-geostrophic potential enstrophy reveals that upper tropospheric disturbances in the area are propagated predominantly from the west along the Asian jet, and that they exert a significant forcing onto near-surface levels, while the opposite upward forcing is weak. A Q-vector analysis shows that the upwelling associated with the precipitation bands is forced predominantly by confluence. This circulation is frontogenetic, and surface fronts are often formed therein. The latitudinal extent of humid air masses is affected not only by this circulation but by low-level flows induced by upper-level disturbances in a cooperative manner. Latent heating in the precipitation bands is significant, but its role is passive to reduce the effective static stability.\nResults on the Atlantic is briefly touched.",

            "abstract": "An overwhelming scientific consensus exists on the issue of anthropogenic climate change. Unfortunately, public perception of expert agreement remains low- only around 1 in 10 Americans correctly estimates the actual level of consensus on the topic. Moreover, several recent studies have demonstrated the pivotal role that perceived consensus plays in the public's acceptance of key scientific facts about environmental problems, as well as their willingness to support policy to address them. This \"consensus gap\", between the high level of scientific agreement vs. the public's perception of it, has led to calls for increased consensus messaging. However this call has been challenged by a number of different groups: climate \"skeptics\" in denial about the existence and validity of the consensus; some social science researchers and journalists who believe that such messages will be ineffective or counterproductive; and even some scientists and science advocates who downplay the value of consensus in science generally. All of these concerns can be addressed by effectively communicating the role of consensus within science to the public, as well as the conditions under which consensus is likely to be correct. Here, we demonstrate that the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change satisfies these conditions, and discuss past examples of purported consensus that failed or succeeded to satisfy them as well. We conclude by discussing the way in which scientific consensus is interpreted by the public, and how consensus messaging can improve climate literacy.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Climate Model Data Service (CDS) and the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) are collaborating to provide an end-to-end system for the comparative study of the major reanalysis projects: ECMWF ERA-Interim, NASA/GMAO MERRA, NOAA/NCEP CFSR, NOAA/ESRL 20CR, JMA JRA25, and JRA55. These reanalyses have been repackaged to adhere to the CMIP5 standards and published on the ESGF. Reanalysis centers provide interfaces to the various reanalyses, but each data set requires some effort to either compare with other reanalyses or with atmospheric model output. The repackaging for ESGF required reformatting, restructuring and modifications to the metadata to facilitate the ESGF search capabilities. Once this was done, the data structure is the same as used by the very successful CMIP3 and CMIP5 making comparison among reanalyses and climate models a relatively easy exercise. The data can now be accessed using WGET, OPENDAP, or HTTPServer at\nhttps://earthsystemcog.org/projects/ana4mips/\n.\nAn example using this interface will be shown including comparison of the reanalyses portrayal of the surface heat balance during the 2010 Russian heat wave. We have found that although the difference reanalyses produce very similar atmospheric features of the heat wave, the surface energy balance terms such as latent and sensible heat show considerable differences. This comparison helps point out systematic differences in the reanalyses surface moisture and may lead to a better understanding of the differences.",

            "abstract": "In the Northern Hemisphere, moraines deposited by mountain glaciers during the Little Ice Age (LIA) typically represent the largest extent of glaciers during the late Holocene. Yet in some settings, pre-LIA moraines are preserved offering a unique opportunity to develop longer chronologies of late Holocene glacier change; in turn these chronologies can be used to assess spatio-temporal patterns of glaciation and their associated climatic driving mechanisms. Unfortunately, determining absolute ages for late Holocene moraines in the Arctic has proven difficult. Lichenometry has often been used to 1) broadly constrain the timing of moraine abandonment, and 2) correlate moraines between valleys, whereas in other cases fresh (unvegetated) moraines are casually ascribed to the LIA. Although fresh moraines fronting modern glacier snouts were undoubtedly deposited sometime during the last few hundred years, direct and precise ages for these moraines are scarce. However, recent advancements in 10Be surface exposure dating now allow for robust late Holocene glacier chronologies in some Arctic settings. We present a well-resolved 10Be-based record of glaciation from north-central Baffin Island and combine this chronology with a previously published record of ice-cap expansion to develop a holistic view of glaciation on Baffin Island over the last millennium. A prominent feature of our record is the extended state of glaciers during the Medieval Warm Period.",

            "abstract": "Natural science and geographical research are now able to take advantage of environmental simulations that more accurately test experimental hypotheses, resulting in deeper understanding. Experiments affected by the natural environment can benefit from 3D landscape simulations capable of simulating a variety of terrains and environmental phenomena.\nSuch simulations can employ random terrain generation algorithms that dynamically simulate environments to test specific models against a variety of factors. Through the use of noise functions such as Perlin noise, Simplex noise, and diamond square algorithms, computers can generate simulations that model a variety of landscapes and ecosystems.\nThis study shows how these algorithms work together to create realistic landscapes. By seeding values into the diamond square algorithm, one can control the shape of landscape. Perlin noise and Simplex noise are also used to simulate moisture and temperature. The smooth gradient created by coherent noise allows more realistic landscapes to be simulated.\nTerrain generation algorithms can be used in environmental studies and physics simulations. Potential studies that would benefit from simulations include the geophysical impact of flash floods or drought on a particular region and regional impacts on low lying area due to global warming and rising sea levels. Furthermore, terrain generation algorithms also serve as aesthetic tools to display landscapes (Google Earth), and simulate planetary landscapes. Hence, it can be used as a tool to assist science education.\nAlgorithms used to generate these natural phenomena provide scientists a different approach in analyzing our world. The random algorithms used in terrain generation not only contribute to the generating the terrains themselves, but are also capable of simulating weather patterns.",

            "abstract": "We present a new 3-D P-wave velocity model of the upper mantle under eastern Tibet determined from 113,831 high-quality teleseismic arrival-time data. Our data are hand-picked from seismograms of 784 teleseismic events (30o-90o) with magnitudes of 5.2 or greater. These events were recorded by 21 portable seismic stations deployed in Yunnan during April 2010 to July 2011 and 259 permanent stations of Chinese provincial seismic networks during September 2008 to December 2011 in the study region. Our results provide new insights into the mantle structure and dynamics of eastern Tibet. High-velocity (high-V) anomalies are revealed down to 200 km depth under stable cratonic regions, such as Sichuan basin, Ordos and Alashan blocks. Prominent low-velocity (low-V) anomalies are revealed in the upper mantle under the Kunlun-Qinling fold zone, Songpan-Ganzi, Qiangtang, Lahsa, and Chuan-Dian diamond blocks, suggesting that the eastward moving low-V materials are obstructed by Sichuan basin, Ordos and Alashan blocks, and they could be extruded through the Qinling fold zone and the Chuan-Dian block to eastern China. In addition, the extent and thickness of these low-V anomalies are well correlated with the surface topography, suggesting that uplift of eastern Tibet is closely related to the low-V anomalies which may reflect hot materials and have strong buoyancy. In the mantle transition zone, broad high-V anomalies are visible from the Burma arc northward to the Kunlun fault and eastward to the Xiaojiang fault, which extend for a total of approximately 700 km. The high-V anomalies are connected upward to the Wadati-Benioff seismic zone beneath the Burma arc. These results suggest that the Indian slab has subducted horizontally for a long distance in the mantle transition zone after it descended into the mantle, and its deep dehydration has contributed to forming the low-V anomalies in the big mantle wedge above the slab. Our present results shed new light on the formation and evolution of the Tibetan plateau.",

Significant changes include expansion of arid and high-latitude continental climate zones, shrinkage in polar and mid-latitude continental climates, poleward shifts in temperate, continental and polar climates, and elevation rises in tropical and polar climates.

The degradation of alpine meadow can changes soil physical and chemical properties as well as it’s spatial variability. However, little research has been done that address the spatial patterns of soil properties under different degradation degrees of alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau although these changes were important to water and heat study and modelling of land surface. 296 soil surface (0-10 cm) samples were collected using grid sampling design from three different degraded alpine meadow regions (1 km2). Then soil water content (SWC) and organic carbon content (OCC) were measured. Classical statistical and geostatistical methods were employed to study the spatial heterogeneities of SWC and OCC under different degradation degrees (Non-degraded ND, moderately degraded MD, extremely degraded ED) of alpine meadow. Results show that both SWC and OCC of alpine meadow were normally distributed with the exception of SWC under ED. On average, both SWC and OCC of alpine meadow decreased in the order that ND > MD > ED. For nugget ratios, SWC and OCC of alpine meadow showed increasing spatial dependence tendency from ND to ED. For the range of spatial variation, both SWC and OCC of alpine meadow showed increasing tendency in distance with the increasing degree of degradation. In all, the degradation of alpine meadow has significant impact on spatial heterogeneities of SWC and OCC of alpine meadow. With increasing of alpine meadow degradation, soil water condition and nutrient condition become worse, and their distributions in spatial become unevenly.",

            "abstract": "We present the first results of the NEURAL project (www.izor.hr/neural), which is dedicated to creation of an efficient and reliable ocean surface current forecasting system. This system is based on high-frequency (HF) radar measurements, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and neural network algorithms (Self-Organizing Maps, SOM). Joint mapping of mesoscale ground winds and HF radars in a coastal area points to a high correlation between two sets, indicating that wind forecast may be used as a basis for forecasting ocean surface currents. NEURAL project consists of three modules: (i) the technological module which covers installation of new HF radars in the coastal area of the middle Adriatic, and implementation of data management procedures; (ii) the research module which deals with an assessment of different combinations of input variables (radial vs. Cartesian vectors, original vs. detided vs. filtered series, WRF-ARW vs. Aladin meteorological model), all in order to get the best hindcasted surface currents; and finally (iii) the operational module in which NWP operational products will be used for short-term forecasting of ocean surface currents. Both historical and newly observed HF radar data, as well as reanalysis and operational NWP model runs will be used within the (ii) and (iii) modules of the project. Finally, the observed, hindcasted and forecasted ocean current will be compared to the operational ROMS model outputs to compare skill reliability of the forecasting system based on neural network approach to the skill and reliability of numerical ocean models. We expect the forecasting system based on neural network approach to be more reliable than the one based on numerical ocean model as it is more exclusively based on measurements. Disadvantages of such a system are that it can be applied only in areas where long series surface currents measurements exist and where the recognized patterns can be properly ascribed to a forcing field.",

Using Reimei and SAMPEX satellite data, we investigate characteristics of the pulsating aurora electrons and relativistic electron microbursts. Reimei satellite reveals that the pulsating aurora is caused by repetition of tens keV electrons and the internal modulations with a few Hz exist inside the precipitation. Beside intermittent precipitations of a few keV electrons, the stable precipitation of low energy electron ~1 keV is simultaneously observed. SAMPEX satellite confirmed the pulsation of relativistic electron microbursts and the internal modulations embedded in the microburst. We simulate the pitch angle scattering of energetic electrons from ten keV to ~1 MeV, considering the propagation of whistler mode waves along the field line. The simulation shows that the pulsation and internal modulations of electrons are caused by the repetition of chorus bursts and rising tones, respectively, and those are commonly observed in both ten keV electrons (pulsating aurora) and relativistic electron microbursts. Upper band chorus waves cause the stable low energy electron precipitations. The results indicate that the propagating whistler mode chorus waves are the common process to cause both pulsating aurora and relativistic electron microbursts along the field line.",

To check the hypothesis about the correlation between permafrost ground type and quantity of methane, produced by microorganisms, the samples from deposits of thermokarst depression (alas), Yedoma and fluvial deposits of Kolyma floodplain for gas measurements and microbiological study were collected and the experiment with anaerobic incubation was conducted.\nGas analysis indicated that alas and floodplain samples were characterized by high methane concentrations whereas Yedoma samples had only traces of methane. Two media with different substrates were prepared anaerobically for incubation. First medium contained sucrose as a substrate for hydrolytic microflora and the second one contained acetate as a substrate for methanogens. Two samples from alas, one sample from Yedoma and one from floodplain were placed in anaerobic bottles and media under gas mixture (N2, CO2 and H2) were added. The bottles were incubated for 2 weeks at room temperature. The results of the experiment showed that there was the increase of methane concentrations in the bottles with Yedoma and Floodplain samples to 52-60 and 67-90 %, respectively, from initial concentrations in contrast with Alas sample inoculated bottles. At the same time the concentration of methane in control bottles, which did not include substrates, increased to 15-19%.\nCurrent research is a part of NSF funded project “The Polaris”.",

            "abstract": "We are now century or more into the \"great geophysical experiment\" of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As this \"experiment\" slowly plays out, a major need is to track changes in land and ocean ecosystems which are impacted both changes in physical climate and chemical climate (e.g. changing CO2 levels.). Measurements of CO2 concentration and related variables (such as O2 and the isotopes of CO2) in background air continue to provide key insights into how these systems are changing.\nOne surprise coming from these observations is evidence that land ecosystems are serving as a sink for a significant fraction the excess carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel burning. Ecosystems remote from direct human influences have evidently been thrown out of steady state by a range of processes and are accumulating carbon unusually. Evidence for this sink is compelling found from a variety of methods, including from measurements of atmospheric O2 abundance. Additional compelling evidence for large changes in land ecosystem comes from measurements of the seasonal cycle in atmospheric CO2.\nIn contrast, there is little evidence that marine ecosystems - at least those remote from coastal influences - have undergone such large changes. While the oceans are absorbing excess CO2, this is mostly a physical, not a biological, process. But just as the absence of evidence is not evidence for absence, it could just be that we lack strong long-term atmospheric constraints on marine ecosystems. Whereas atmospheric CO2 data provides a wealth of information on land processes, they do a poor job of resolving ocean biological processes because the buffering chemistry of CO2 in seawater slows the response of atmospheric CO2 to processes originating from within the ocean.\nThis talk will highlight evidence for changes in land ecosystems from measurements and CO2 and its isotopes, and will illustrate a path forward to resolving changes in marine ecosystems and related impacts on the ocean carbon sink via measurements in atmospheric O2 concentration, particularly via the tracer \"atmospheric potential oxygen\" APO, which is effectively the sum of the O2 and CO2 concentrations, which shows rich variability of marine origin.",

            "abstract": "We have analyzed bathymetric, seismic, and geophysical data of the South China Sea (SCS) to investigate the characteristics of seamounts and their implications on the magmatic evolution of a mid-ocean ridge from active seafloor spreading to post-spreading volcanism. Among the two dozens of seamounts that can be identified with ease on multi-beam bathymetry data, about half of them are located along the fossil spreading ridge while the remaining located off axis. The distribution of off-axis seamounts also shows strong asymmetry about the fossil spreading ridge with a much greater population of seamounts concentrated in the northern basin. The shape of individual seamounts is approximated as elliptical cones to yield best-fitting models: the population of seamounts in the SCS has an average major-axis length of 21 km (standard deviation σ = 8.3 km) and an average minor-axis length of 14 km (σ = 5.3 km); The above-seafloor height and volume of the seamounts have average value of 2.9 km (σ = 1.1 km) and 1.21*1012 m3 (σ = 0.99*1012 m3), respectively. However, limited seismic reflection data show that when the parts of the seamounts buried in the sediment are considered, the resulting estimations of the seamount dimension and volume would increase significantly. Overall, seamounts located on the fossil ridge in the East Subbasin have larger dimension and volume than those in the Southwest Subbasin, except for a seamount neat the Zhongnan Fault between the two subbasins. Adjacent seamounts on the fossil ridge have an average separation distance of 53 km (σ = 9.4 km). We are currently investing lithospheric and mantle melting mechanisms that might control the observed characteristics of the spatial distribution and dimension of seamounts in the SCS.\nKeywords: the South China Sea, fossil spreading ridge, seamounts",

            "abstract": "One of the major sources of error in reference frame determination comes from the undetected discontinuities in station position time series, particularly in GNSS data. Until now, discontinuities in station position time series due to large earthquakes were usually detected visually. Based on a geophysical modeling, we develop a method to predict the effect of co-seismic deformations on position series. Investigating a global network of GPS stations, we demonstrate that a systematic global modeling of co-seismic deformations helps greatly to detect discontinuities in GPS coordinate time series. We show that numerous discontinuities induced by earthquakes are too small to be visually detected because of seasonal variations and GPS noise that disturb their identification. However, not taking these discontinuities into account has a large impact on the station velocity estimation, considering today’s precision requirements. Beyond time series discontinuities, we also investigate GPS station displacements induced by two decades of accumulated seismicity. We show here that the accumulation of very small co-seismic deformations may explain non-linear behaviors of GPS station position. It raises the unexpected question of the treatment of such station non-linear motions in reference frame elaboration.",

            "abstract": "The Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica is an ideal place to study megathrust processes due to its position immediately above the subduction interface. Continuous GPS and seismic recordings over the past decade provided a valuable dataset for better understanding the seismotectonics of Nicoya Peninsula and forecasting the size and location of the Sept. 5, 2012 Moment magnitude (MW) 7.6 Nicoya earthquake. Here we report on repeating earthquakes that rupture the same fault patch and generate nearly identical waveforms. To identify these events we first select event pairs with high mean cross correlation coefficients (CCC > 0.9) from newly detected events based on a waveform matching technique. Next, we group event pairs into clusters, and relocate them using a double-difference location algorithm (HypoDD) retaining only events with centroid locations that overlap by at least 50%. At the time of this submission we’ve found approximately 50 repeating sequences with at least three events during the first 3 months following the 2012 mainshock. The recurrence intervals of these clusters increase with time after the mainshock, consistent with the Omori's aftershock decay law. Despite clear evidence of foreshocks in the 10 days preceding the mainshock, we did not identify any repeating earthquakes during this period. Our next step is to estimate the inferred seismic moment of slip for all repeating events in each cluster, and use them to compare with models of postseismic slip along the megathrust using geodetic data. Our goal is to develop a robust approach to infer aseismic slip on the rupture zone from systematic analysis of repeating earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The interglacials after 430 ka BP are characterized by warmer climates and higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations than the interglacials which occurred before. The cause of this climatic transition (the so-called Mid-Brunhes Event, MBE) is not yet fully understood. Based on climate model simulations, our results show that, in response to insolation changes only, feedbacks between sea ice, temperature, evaporation and salinity caused vigorous pre-MBE Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation and Southern Ocean ventilation (Yin, 2013, Insolation-induced mid-Brunhes transition in Southern Ocean ventilation and deep-ocean temperature. Nature, 494, 222-225). Our results also show that strong Westerlies increased the pre-MBE overturning in the Southern Ocean via an increased latitudinal insolation gradient created by changes in eccentricity during austral winter and in obliquity during austral summer. The enhanced AABW formation leads to a cooler deep ocean during the older interglacials. These insolation-induced differences in the deep-sea temperature and in the Southern Ocean ventilation between the more recent interglacials and the older ones were not expected, because there is no visible systematic difference in the astronomical parameters between the interglacials before and after 430 ka ago. The apparent MBE (i.e. the difference in the interglacial intensity before and after 430 ka BP) appears resulting from the complex response of the climate system to the different combinations of the astronomical parameters prevailing before and after 430 ka BP. Preliminary results from a carbon cycle model shed light on the possible role of the Southern Ocean in the magnitude change of the interglacial atmospheric CO2 concentration around 430 ka.",

CMEs occur with the formation and expulsion of large-scale flux ropes from the solar corona, which are routinely observed in interplanetary space. Simulating and predicting the structure and dynamics of these ICME magnetic fields is essential to the progress of heliospheric science and space weather prediction. We combine observations made by different observing techniques of CME events to develop a numerical model capable of predicting the magnetic field of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMES). Photospheric magnetic field measurements from SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI are used to specify a coronal magnetic flux rope that drives the CMEs. We examine halo CMEs events that produced clearly observed magnetic clouds at Earth and present our model predictions of these events with an emphasis placed on the z component of the magnetic field. Comparison of the MHD model predictions with coronagraph observations and in-situ data allow us to robustly determine the parameters that define the initial state of the driving flux rope, thus providing a predictive model.",

This interrelation reinforces water and energy consumptions and challenges the sustainable management of both resources in light of growing population, developing economy, and dwindling resources. Climate change often exacerbates the negative effects of the water-energy nexus by intervening water and energy allocation, availability, and quality, forcing communities to seek more energy dependent alternative water sources and/or more water dependent alternative energy sources. The climate-water-energy interrelations play an important role in water and energy management, yet our understandings on the interactions between climate and the water-energy nexus are still very limited. Therefore, this study aims at qualitatively and quantitatively assessing the impacts of climate change from the water-energy nexus perspective by investigating previous literatures, case studies, climate change patterns, and recent extreme climate events. Management difficulties resulted from climate related source shifts as well as policy and regulation changes will be illustrated and discussed.

Within this framework, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the potential for water quality improvement and changes in hydraulic conductivity when managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is performed by infiltrating treated wastewater in soils that do not have high potential for sorption. For example, in the Attica (Athens and vicinity) region of Greece, the bedrock is mostly marble, resulting in calcite-rich soils that present little potential for sorption of contaminants to mineral surfaces. This leaves consumption of organic contaminants by microbes as the critical mechanism for water quality improvement, when treated wastewater is infiltrated through such soils.\nIn order to enhance the potential for contaminant consumption by aerobic bacteria in a way that would be realistic to later perform in an infiltration basin, we conduct experiments using a series of wetting and drying cycles. The experimental setup consists of 90-cm long soil columns, fitted with oxygen sensors, time-domain reflectometry sensors (to measure moisture content), sampling ports, oxidation-reduction probes, and head observation tubes. We use the data collected from these sensors and features of the experimental setup to answer the following questions:\n1. Does hydraulic conductivity change, from formation of a biofilm or dissolution of calcite (or both)?\n2. Are organic contaminants consumed?\n3. What effect do wetting and drying cycles have on consumption of organic contaminants?\n4. How long can infiltration of treated wastewater last, before oxygen is consumed and conditions become reducing?\nThese questions are investigated by observing the hydraulic head and outflow, performing tracer tests, taking samples from the sampling ports and outflow for chemical analyses, and measuring moisture content and oxygen concentration, in the course of performing multiple wetting and drying cycles.\nThese column experiments will be used to evaluate the potential for new MAR applications in areas facing water scarcity challenges. In the future the experiments will be expanded to test multiple soils and optimize both the soil type and infiltration patterns in order to best obtain water quality improvements through MAR.",

When a raindrop is detected, the sensor unit triggers the camera to record sequential raindrop images of up to 1000 frames per second. The captured raindrop images are then digitally processed using a computer software developed to determine the raindrop characteristics. The capabilities of the HOD were evaluated both in the laboratory using high-precision spherical lenses and water drops of known sizes and in the field during rainfall events.

Conodonts is a kind of extinct species of marine animals and widely distributed in marine sediments all over the world. Rich in radiogenic Sr contents and difficulty to be affected during diagenesis alteration makes conodonts a good choice in seawater Sr isotope composition studies (John et al., 2008). Conodont samples were collected from 24th to 39th layer across Permian-Triassic boundary at Meishan D section (GSSP), Zhejiang Province, South China (Yin et al., 2001). Conodonts was originated from fresh limestone and only conodont elements with CAI<2 were chosen for in-situ strontium isotope analysis using laser-ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS). Conodont samples are from totally 25 layers in seven conodont zones making it possible for a high resolution 87Sr/ 86Sr curve reconstruction during the Permian-Triassic transition. 87Sr/ 86Sr ratio kept a relatively high value (0.70752) in the middle part of the Clarkina yini zone and a lower value (0.70634) in the upperpart of Clarkina taylorae zone.

            "abstract": "Mountain regions are changing rapidly as a result of climate change. It has been well established that these mountain regions are experiencing rapid glacier retreat. With accelerated retreat, glacial melt runoff can accumulate in an overdeepened glacier bed left behind by the receding glacier and can be bound by the walls of unstable frontal and lateral moraines to form a hazardous lake. However, when smaller glaciers retreat and downwaste they no longer contain enough ice to sustain the flow of water and maintain level of the lake. Furthermore, some smaller glaciers in the Hindu Kush and Himalayan region are observing extreme downwasting, which are either turning them into a rock glacier or heavily debris covered glacier leading to the reduced ice melt. Consequently, it is important to study these overdeepened beds, which are contained by the unstable mass. This is especially significant considering the great degree of complexity in the mountain weather system and recent examples of high intensity and short duration rainfall in the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, Karakoram region of Pakistan, and Central Himalayan region of India and Nepal. A precise understanding of mountain climate system is necessary, but so does these potentially deglaciated overdeepened beds where rain-fed lakes can form and increase systems hydrostatic pressure that can breach moraine containment and flood entire downstream region. Once lake has formed it possesses hydrological characteristics that are similar to the glacial lakes, which are known to put lives and infrastructure in danger. Therefore, in this study we evaluated overdeepened beds that are located in the complex topography and contained by abandoned or unstable lateral moraine using field and remote sensing satellite images. Our results provide degree of failure associated with these lakes based on the complex spatial and topological analysis as well as orographic distribution of the region. Such studies are not common in the region owing to the lack of field observations, high degree of uncertainty associated with whatever limited field data is available, difficulty in satellite-based assessment, unpredictability with the precipitation pattern, and inadequate local or fine resolution downscaled climate models.",

            "abstract": "The widely distributed Late Mesozoic igneous events in North China have been intensively studied in the past decades and proposed to be accounted by lithospheric thinning. However, mechanism of the lithospheric thining is still in debate. In this study, we report U-Pb zircon ages, geochemical data and Sr-Nd isotopic data for the Cretaceous mafic and associated felsic intrusions from the middle Sulu orogenic belt in the Shandong Peninsula. The ICP-MS U-Pb zircon analyses show consistent crystallization ages ranging from 120.2 ± 2.1 Ma to 123.3 ± 1.6 Ma for four representative samples. These rocks are characterized by LREE and LILE enrichment, HREE depletion, high initial 87Sr/86Sr values ranging from 0.70401 to 0.70966, low negative εNd(t) values from -22.0 to -12.2. These features suggest that they were derived from a common enriched lithospheric mantle source. Geochemical and isotopic data indicate that the original magma of these rocks was produced by partial melting of an ancient lithospheric mantle, which was variably mixed with lower crustal eclogite derived melts. The lamprophyres, andesitic porphyrites and syenogranite may have been attributed to subsequent fractional crystallization of olivine and pyroxene, whereas the rhyolite resulted from K-feldspar and plagioclase fractionation, without any crustal contamination affection. Tectonically, the petrogenesis process of these rocks favors an intense lithospheric extensional regime beneath the Sulu orogenic belt at 120 ~ 124 Ma, which was resulted by the widespread removal of the upper mantle and lower crust that driven by the abrupt change of the subducting direction of the Pacific plate.",

Climate change may also modify discharge of the river Weser flowing into the German Bight, which will alter both water levels and salinity distributions along the coast. To study the long-term effects of sea level rise and discharge variations to the salinity distribution, a 3D seawater intrusion model was designed using the fully coupled surface-subsurface numerical model HydroGeoSphere. The model simulates the coastal aquifer as an integral system considering complexities such as variable-density groundwater flow, surface-subsurface interaction, irregular land topography and anthropogenic structures (e.g. dykes, drainage canals, water gates). Using PEST, steady state groundwater flow of year 2009 is calibrated. In addition, 3 climate change scenarios are simulated based on the calibrated model: (i) sea level rise of 1 m, (ii) the salinity of the seaside boundary increased by 25 %, and (iii) the salinity of the seaside boundary decreased by 70 %. Results demonstrate the changes of fresh groundwater resources, surface water depths and salinity distribution. The obtained results are useful for coastal engineering practices, drinking water resources management and for the development of climate change adaptation strategies.",

            "abstract": "Urban microclimate plays an important role in urban water use, energy use, pollutant transport, and the general comfort and well-being of urban inhabitants. The microclimate interacts locally with urban morphology, water levels, properties of urban surfaces, and vegetation cover all of which contribute significantly to the strong spatial variability observed in urban areas. Considerable parts of urban open spaces take the form of street canyons. These urban street canyons play a remarkable role in creating urban microclimates. Within street canyons themselves, a wide variety of phenomena contribute to complex flow patterns. These include various flow structures such as wake fields, circulation zones, isolated roughness flow, wake interference and skimming flows. In addition, heat fluxes from the buildings and the surrounding area enhance the complexity of the flow field inside the canyon. Here, we introduce Uintah:MPMICE for the simulation of fluid structure interactions in urban flows. Uintah:MPMICE has been developed in a massively parallel computational infrastructure, uses material points to represent buildings, and the large-eddy simulation (LES) technique to represent momentum and scalar transport. To validate Uintah:MPMICE, simulations of typical street canyons are compared against published wind tunnel particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) data for the cases of step-up and step-down street canyons. Our findings show promising results in capturing major flow features, namely wake fields, recirculation zones, wake interference, vortex structures, and flow separation in street canyons. LES results demonstrate the ability of the simulations to predict flow topology details such as secondary circulation zones and wall-originating elevated shear layers in step-up and step-down cases, respectively. Furthermore, mean flow and variance statistics indicate sensitivity to inlet boundary conditions; upstream turbulence generation method, in particular, has a significant impact on the LES results.",

We report observations of the same magnetic cloud made by the MESSENGER spacecraft at Mercury (then at 0.44 AU) and later by STEREO-B at 1.09 AU, while the two spacecraft were radially aligned in November 2011. Observation with two radially aligned spacecraft allows sampling of approximately the same region of a magnetic cloud, and so allows any evolution that may have occurred within that region during propagation between the two spacecraft to be determined. The flux rope within the November 2011 cloud has been analysed using force-free fitting and minimum variance analysis: it has been estimated that the rope axis rotated from an inclination of approximately 25° relative to the solar equatorial plane at MESSENGER to lie within a few degrees of the plane at STEREO-B. We investigate the hypothesis that this rotation and alignment with the solar equatorial plane is driven by interactions of the cloud with the heliospheric current sheet.",

            "abstract": "Reactive transport modelling is one method for assessing long-term geochemical processes influencing radionuclide mobility in geologic formations considered for implementation of the multi-barrier deep geologic repository concept. A key issue revolves around the quantitative prediction and assessment of solute migration and retardation through engineered and enclosing natural barriers.\nThe reactive transport code MIN3P-THCm, with several code enhancements (i.e., multisite ion exchange, multicomponent diffusion and hybrid multicomponent diffusion models), was used to simulate a series of benchmarking problems, laboratory experiments, and in-situ diffusion experiments in the framework of the Mont Terri and EBS-TF-C projects. For the Mont Terri project, excellent agreement was achieved with other groups for the generic benchmarking simulations. Additional simulations were undertaken to reproduce in-situ borehole diffusion experiments using parameters determined through laboratory experiments. Comparison of the simulated and the in-situ borehole diffusion data showed: good agreement for HTO, anions, weakly sorbing tracers and major ions, but some discrepancies for strongly sorbing tracers. Sensitivity analysis revealed that a scenario in which the borehole filter is assumed to be partially filled with dispersed fine clay particles originating from the host rock might explain the rapid concentration decrease of strongly sorbing tracers in the borehole solution. For the EBS-TF-C project, comparison of simulated and experimental data shows very good agreement for cases involving conservative transport and anion migration. Excellent agreement was also obtained for cation migration in comparison to other established reactive transport codes; however, some discrepancies remain between observed and simulated data. In the future, continued development of conceptual models and numerical implementations could lead to further improvements in mechanistic descriptions of strongly sorbed cation transport.",

            "abstract": "Because of polar and in particular Arctic amplification of global warming, high latitudes are sensitive to climate change. How sensitive they are depends, among factors, on how sea ice, clouds, and boundary layer processes respond to climate change. For example, the uncertainties in the Arctic cloud fraction simulated by current GCMs contribute to the inter-model spread in sea ice states through their impact on the surface energy budget (Eisenman et al. 2007), and they potentially exert feedbacks on sea ice cover. It is questionable whether the widely used semi-empirical cloud parameterizations, developed primarily for low latitudes, can be applied to polar regions to capture their climate change response.\nHere we use a newly-developed large-eddy simulations model (PyCLES) to study Arctic clouds and how they respond to a wide range of climate changes, including seasonal sea ice loss. PyCLES resolves motions that are relevant to cloud processes, but its domain size is limited. Therefore, we apply large-scale dynamics from an idealized GCM as forcings to PyCLES, and vary the climate by changing the longwave optical thickness. We study the statistically steady states that eventually ensue to elucide the processes governing Arctic clouds in different climates. We also include bulk mixed-phased microphysics and a simple (thermodynamic) sea ice model, which modifies the surface energy balance.\nOur primary results show that without a low-level temperature inversion, low cloud fraction decreases as the climate warms. As sea ice melts, low cloud fraction also decreases as a result of increased surface temperature, assuming that the large-scale advection of water vapor remains unchanged.",

            "abstract": "Shrub coverage in the arctic has significantly increased in the past 50 years. Spruce seedling establishment in areas above the upper forest boundary has likewise increased as treeline has advanced. Little is known about the effect of shrubs on spruce seedlings near arctic tree lines, and how shrubs may affect the advance of tree line. In order to determine the effect of these shrubs on seedling establishment, we took measurements of shrub coverage in study plots in the Alaska Range established in the late 1990s at and above the current treeline. At each of ten plots located at and above treeline, ten points were systematically selected, using a grid pattern, and ten were selected at haphazardly chosen seedlings. At each point, a measurement of shrub coverage was taken, indicating the species present at the ground level, under 25 centimeters, between 25cm and a meter, between one and two meters, and between two and four meters, and above four meters above ground level. The data at systematic points indicates almost ubiquitous cover of shrubs in the under 25 cm height class, 43 percent coverage between 25cm and a meter, 14.5 percent coverage between one and two meters, 2 percent coverage between two and four meters, and three percent coverage above four meters. The frequency of each shrub height category at points with seedlings differed significantly from the frequency at the systematic points (χ2 = 26.3, p =.0000337). Points with seedlings had less shrub coverage overall than the systematic points, particularly in the tallest height categories. The frequency of tall shrubs in sites with seedlings was almost half that in the systematic points. Very similar patterns existed in both the tree line and above tree line transects. These results suggest that seedlings preferentially establish in sites without tall shrubs. Shrubs may therefore limit establishment of spruce at tree line, and continued shrub expansion may inhibit or slow tree line expansion.",

To quantify ET in the hyper-arid climates, we developed diagnostic indicators of the groundwater-ET relationship and a methodology based on seasonal groundwater level fluctuation approach. Under similar climates and depth to the water table (2-2.5 m), ET in the riparian zones as a result of direct root water uptake (RWU) through riparian shrubs (0.63-0.73 mm/d at the Tamarix ramosissima site and 1.89-2.33 mm/d at the Populus euphratica site) is much greater than that in a Gobi-desert site (0.12-0.27 mm/d). Numerical simulations using a one-dimensional land surface model with a RWU model that explicitly describes root-groundwater interactions indicate that direct RWU at the riparian sites is primarily dependent on the root dynamics that interacts with groundwater dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Large tsunami generates an acoustic wave and shakes the atmosphere layer around a focal region. The generated acoustic wave propagates to ionosphere layer which is located at about 300km hight and causes a ionospheric disturbance. So, a generated acoustic wave causes the density of total electron content (TEC) inside ionospheric layer to be change. The changing TEC inside ionospheric layer can be measured by dense GPS network, such as GEONET. We focus on a large tsunami such as the 2011 March 11 Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Mw 9.0) , which caused vast damages to the country. Tsunami wave due to the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake generates acoustic wave which propagates to ionospheric layer. The Japanese dense network of GPS detected clear anomaly of ionospheric TEC due to Tsunami wave around the focal region. We assume that acoustic wave cause the ionospheric disturbance and estimate tsunami wave propagation using Back Projection (BP) method of ionospheric disturbance.\nThe Japanese dense array of GPS recorded ionospheric disturbances as changes in TEC due to the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. In this study, we try to reveal the detail of generating tsunami propagation using changing TEC from GPS observation network. At first, we process GPS-TEC above focal region by 1 sec sampling of GEONET. We remove slant GPS-TEC effects using filter out second degrees polynomial fitting. We try to adapt back projection (BP) method for GPS-TEC time series. The BP product shows the beam formed time history and location of coherent acoustic-wave energy generated by large tsunami observed at ionospheric layer regional arrays and across the GPS Network. BPs are performed by beam forming (stacking) energy to a flat grid around the source region with variable spatial resolution scaled by the magnitude of generating tsunami velocity for each second.\nIn result, we can obtain the generating tsunami wave due to a large earthquake. The method is perfectly new and provide detail of tsunami propagating wave distribution from huge GPS-TEC data. We can obtain in-direct measurement Tsunami wave generation from ionospheric disturbances. So, this result will bring a revolution of tsunami study.",

            "abstract": "Droughts affect every region of the world and can have a significant impact on human and natural systems. Therefore the need to better understand the spatiotemporal variability of droughts is of great importance. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is often used as an indicator of drought, requiring only precipitation, air temperature, and potential evapotranspiration (PET) as inputs. PET using the Thornthwaite method is commonly used as an input for PDSI. However, calculating PDSI using the Thornthwaite PET method has come under recent scrutiny for overestimating drought conditions when air temperatures exceed the historical baseline. With increasing air temperatures around the world, calculating PDSI using the Thornthwaite PET method may no longer be an appropriate option. Therefore, various researchers have called for the use of the physically-based Penman-Monteith PET method to estimate PDSI. Here, we present a user-friendly PDSI tool that uses the Penman-Monteith method to calculate PET as an input to the PDSI calculations. Comparisons with a global PDSI dataset also estimated using the Penman-Monteith method indicate good spatial correlation. This tool allows users to easily calculate a suite of Palmer drought indices using Penman-Monteith PET for current and future drought projections at any spatial scale. We present a 12-km resolution Penman-Monteith PDSI dataset of the United States, as well as potential applications of its use.",

            "abstract": "Filamentous microbial mats in a travertine-depositing hot spring at Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park exert primary controls on the growth rate, mineralogy, and crystal fabric of calcium carbonate minerals (travertine) that precipitate in the spring. Filaments directly affect porosity and permeability of travertine by providing a structural framework consisting of “ropes” of microbial cells around which carbonate minerals precipitate, creating a uniquely biogenetic mineral fabric characterized by horizontal layers of large tubular pores. Nanometer scale microscopy reveals that these mineral fabrics may be directly tied to microbial activities, as aragonite crystals precipitating directly on filaments are smaller and more densely packed than crystals precipitating on extra-polymeric substances (EPS) between filaments. In order to more closely examine the processes which control calcium carbonate crystallization dynamics in this system, a high-resolution transect of water and travertine was sampled for geochemistry, microscopy, and microbial biomass along the primary flow path from upstream to downstream of Narrow Gauge spring at Mammoth Hot Springs. Travertine samples were analyzed for petrography using transmitted light, cathodoluminescence, and laser confocal microscopy to examine crystal morphology and associations with microbial filaments and provide insight on pore network distributions. Additionally, travertine and spring water geochemistry was also analyzed for major and trace ions, δ34S, δ13C, and δ18O, to identify any trends that may relate to crystallization rates, microbial biomass, or crystal habit. Total biomass was determined using dried weight. Water-rock-microbe interactions result in upstream-to-downstream variations in travertine crystal morphology and water chemistry that are directly related to systematic changes in microbial biomass and community respiration. Geochemical modeling lends insight into the biogeochemical reactions that affect travertine crystallization in this dynamic spring system. Quantification of these processes allows development of a dynamic process-based biomarker that can be used to more accurately identify and interpret ancient microbial ecology and evolution on Earth or potentially other planets.",

This technique, based on phase sensitive detection of microwave absorption is capable of detecting 10-12 cm3of a superconductor embedded in a non-superconducting matrix. We applied our technique to search for superconductivity in micrometeorites, small extraterrestrial (ET) particles that add most of the ET mass to the present day Earth. We measured approximately 65 micrometeorites and compared their spectra with those of eight reference materials.Micrometeorites (MMs) are ideal samples with which to test our highly sensitive superconductivity probe, as individual MMs weigh 10-5 g and the large number of micrometeorites arriving on Earth, suggests some contain minerals formed under conditions that cannot be replicated in the laboratory. Minerals in meteorites formed during planetary processes associated with accretion/condensation, planetary differentiation, and segregation. Other components such as pre-solar grains, SiC, diamonds, graphite, Si3N4, and deuterium enriched organics formed under some of the most intense physical-chemical environments in the Universe, including supernovae and stellar outflows. It is during such severe processes that exotic superconducting species may have been created.The research presented here established the methodology and proved the ultrahigh sensitivity of the technique by detecting the presence of the Verwey-transition of the magnetite present in these micrometeorites. The investigated micrometeorites contained no superconducting phases. This work was supported by an AFOSR MURI grant no. F49550-09-1–0577.",

            "abstract": "Integrating geodetic measurements from both ground based and satellite observations is crucial to improved monitoring and evaluation of volcanic hazards in Iceland. The focus of our deformation team is to generate and interpret an extended time series of high resolution deformation measurements derived from InSAR and GPS observations, in the vicinity of the most active volcanoes in Iceland: including Hekla, Katla, Eyjafjallajökull and Askja. A comprehensive network of ground-based deformation monitoring equipment is already deployed at several of these volcanoes and a series of campaign GPS measurements are routinely undertaken each summer. InSAR observations are complementary to these field based measurements and their high spatial resolution assists in resolving the geometry and location of the source of the deformation.\nIceland has recently been declared a Permanent Geohazard Supersite by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites, based on its propensity for relatively frequent eruptions and their potentially hazardous, long ranging effects. The recent Supersite award ensures a considerable amount of SAR data is made available for both past and future satellite acquisitions, including new X-band images (acquired by TerraSAR-X and Cosmo-SkyMed satellites), and historic C-band images (from ERS and ENVISAT satellites). We present long-term deformation time-series spanning > 20 years for Hekla, Katla, Eyjafjallajökull and Askja volcanoes, based on a variety of geodetic techniques including InSAR, GPS and tilt measurements.\nInSAR and tilt measurements at Hekla indicate renewed melt supply to a sub-volcanic reservoir after the last eruption in 2000. Although InSAR and GPS observations at Katla volcano (between 2001 and 2009) suggest no indication of magma induced deformation outside the ice-cap, it is possible that a small flood at Mýrdalsjökull in July 2011, followed by an increase in micro-seismic earthquakes, was related to magmatic activity. Post-eruption deformation observations reveal inflation at Eyjafjallajökull, possibly related to the influx of new melt or readjustment of crustal stresses following the 2010 eruption. Continued deflation at Askja caldera since 1983 may have contributed to crustal weakening and the triggering of a major rockslide and tsunami on the 21 July, 2014.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimatic studies often use stratigraphic changes in the oxygen isotope composition (δ18O) of lacustrine carbonate to infer changes in water temperature and/or the δ18O of lake water. To better understand the environmental factors that influence the isotopic composition of lacustrine carbonates and the assumptions that need to be made to infer past changes in climate, we undertook a four-year study of the water chemistry and sediment trap material in Seneca Lake (NY, USA), a large, monomictic, glacial, hardwater lake. Sediment trap material collected weekly between May 2009 and 2013 together with isotopic monitoring of surface and bottom water allow for analysis of the controls on calcite precipitation in the lake. We show that calcite mainly accumulates in traps July through September when the lake water column is stratified and epilimnetic water temperature exceeds 20°C. Up to ~70% of the sediment is comprised of calcite during summer and only ~10% of the sediment is calcite during autumn, winter, and spring. The δ18O of Seneca Lake epilimnetic water varies by only ~0.6 ‰ throughout the year whereas the δ18O of bulk carbonate varies by as much as 2.4‰. As calcite precipitates in the eplimnion, the δ18O declines. Likely due to the large volume and residence time of water, the δ18O of Seneca Lake water appears to track changes in temperature. Our temperature reconstruction using the δ18O of calcite and epilimnetic lake water reveals that calcite was a reasonable proxy for lake surface temperature from July through September. During the remainder of the year, reconstructed temperatures exceed actual temperatures by as much as 18°C. Sediment resuspension (including calcite) during isothermal conditions may explain why calcite is a poor predictor of lake surface temperature in late autumn though spring. The δ18O of calcite in this lake records summer temperatures rather than year-round conditions.",

            "abstract": "Increasingly, studies are concluding that silicic ignimbrites are the result of the amalgamation of multiple discrete magma batches. Yet the existence of discrete batches presents a conundrum for magma generation and storage; if silicic magma batches are not generated nearly in situ in the upper crust, they must traverse, and reside within, a thermally hostile environment with large temperature gradients, resulting in low survivability in their shallow magmatic hearths. The Snake River Plain (Idaho, USA) is a type example of this ‘multi-batch’ assembly with ignimbrites containing multiple populations of pyroxene crystals, glass shards, and crystal aggregates. The ubiquitous crystal aggregates hint at a mechanism to facilitate the existence of multiple, relatively small batches of rhyolite in the upper crust. These aggregates contain the same plagioclase, pyroxene, and oxide mineral compositions as single phenocrysts of the same minerals in their host rocks, but they have significantly less silicic bulk compositions and lack quartz and sanidine, which occur as single phenocrysts in the deposits. This implies significant crystallization followed by melt extraction from mushy reservoir margins. The extracted melt then continues to evolve (crystallizing sanidine and quartz) while the melt-depleted margins provide an increasingly rigid and refractory network segregating the crystal-poor batches of magma. The hot, refractory, margins insulate the crystal-poor lenses, allowing (1) extended residence in the upper crust, and (2) preservation of chemical heterogeneities among batches. In contrast, systems that produce cumulates richer in low-temperature phases (quartz, K-feldspars, and/or biotite) favour remelting upon recharge, leading to less segregation of eruptible melt pockets and the formation of gradationally zoned ignimbrites. The occurrence of similar crystal aggregates from a variety of magmatic lineages suggests the generality of this process.",

Recent studies of aquifers in the footprint of several gas plays across the US have shown that (1) dissolved thermogenic methane may or may not be present in the shallow groundwater and (2) shallow thermogenic methane may be naturally occurring and emplaced through mostly vertical migration over geologic time and not necessarily a consequence of recent unconventional gas production. We are currently conducting a large sampling campaign across the state of Texas to characterize shallow methane in fresh-water aquifers overlying shale plays and other tight formations. We collected a total of ~800 water samples, ~500 in the Barnett, ~150 in the Eagle Ford, ~80 in the Haynesville shale plays as well as ~50 in the Delaware Basin of West Texas. Preliminary analytical results suggest that dissolved methane is not widespread in shallow groundwater and that, when present at concentrations exceeding 10 mg/L, it is often of thermogenic origin according to the isotopic signature and to the presence of other light hydrocarbons. The Barnett Shale contains a large methane hotspot (~ 2 miles wide) along the Hood-Parker county line which is likely of natural origin whereas the Eagle Ford and Haynesville shales, neglecting microbial methane, show more distributed methane occurrences. Samples from the Delaware Basin show no methane except close to blowouts.",

            "abstract": "Satellite remote sensing provides data on land surface characteristics, useful for mapping land surface energy fluxes and evapotranspiration (ET). Land-surface temperature (LST) derived from thermal infrared (TIR) satellite data has been reliably used as a remote indicator of ET and surface moisture status. However, TIR imagery usually operates at a coarser resolution than that of shortwave sensors on the same satellite platform, making it sometimes unsuitable for monitoring of field-scale crop conditions. This study applies the data mining sharpener (DMS; Gao et al., 2012) technique to data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which sharpens the 1 km thermal data down to the resolution of the optical data (250-500 m) based on functional LST and reflectance relationships established using a flexible regression tree approach. The DMS approach adopted here has been enhanced/refined for application over irrigated farming areas located in harsh desert environments in Saudi Arabia.\nThe sharpened LST data is input to an integrated modeling system that uses the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model and associated flux disaggregation scheme (DisALEXI) in conjunction with model reanalysis data and remotely sensed data from polar orbiting (MODIS) and geostationary (MSG; Meteosat Second Generation) satellite platforms to facilitate daily estimates of evapotranspiration. Results are evaluated against available flux tower observations over irrigated maize near Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. Successful monitoring of field-scale changes in surface fluxes are of importance towards an efficient water use in areas where fresh water resources are scarce and poorly monitored.\nGao, F.; Kustas, W.P.; Anderson, M.C.

Most commonly found in deep ocean floors where low temperature and high pressure are primal conditions for hydrate to form, gas hydrates contain most of the world's mobile carbon and yet it remains an important and open question how methane leakage from gas hydrate impacts ocean and the atmosphere. While current work focus on the breakdown of gas hydrate in marine environment and the the release of methane from seafloor, few studies explore the fate of a single or a plume of methane bubbles when entering the water column after the release. We propose to study the fate of an individual and a series of methane bubbles through mathematical modeling, specifically using a phase-field approach. Phase-field modeling is a mathematical framework that describes systems that are out of thermodynamic equilibrium. First introduced in the context of solidification process and phase transitions, it has since been adopted in the field of multiphase flow. In this work, we present a new phase-field formulation for multiphase/multicomponent flows that allows us to model the fate of methane bubbles in the water system as a nonequilibrium process.",

            "abstract": "Recent development in modeling soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition includes the explicit incorporation of enzyme and microbial dynamics. A characteristic of these models is a feedback between substrate and consumers which is absent in traditional first order decay models. Second, microbial decomposition models incorporate carbon use efficiency (CUE) as a function of temperature which proved to be critical to prediction of SOC with warming. Our main goal is to explore microbial decomposition models with respect to responses of microbes to enzyme activity, costs to enzyme production, and to incorporation of growth vs. maintenance respiration. In order to simplify the modeling setup we assumed quick adjustment of enzyme activity and depolymerized carbon to microbial and SOC pools. Enzyme activity plays an important role to decomposition if its production is scaled to microbial biomass. In fact if microbes are allowed to optimize enzyme productivity the microbial enzyme model becomes unstable. Thus if the assumption of enzyme productivity is relaxed, other limiting factors must come into play. To stabilize the model, we account for two feedbacks that include cost of enzyme production and diminishing return of depolymerization with increasing enzyme concentration and activity. These feedback mechanisms caused the model to behave in a similar way to traditional, first order decay models. Most importantly, we found, that under warming, the changes in SOC carbon were more severe in enzyme synthesis is costly. In turn, carbon use efficiency (CUE) and its dynamical response to temperature is mainly determined by 1) the rate of turnover of microbes 2) the partitioning of dead microbial matter into different quality pools, and 3) and whether growth, maintenance respiration and microbial death rate have distinct responses to changes in temperature.\nAbbreviations: p: decay of enzyme, g: coefficient for growth respiration, : fraction of material from microbial turnover that enters the DOC pool, loss of C scaled to microbial mass, half saturation constant.",

One portion of the wet chemistry experiment is composed of MTBSTFA (N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide) / DMF (dimethylformamide).\nAbundant chlorinated hydrocarbons have been detected with SAM when analyzing samples collected in several sites explored by Curiosity rover. Some of these chlorohydrocarbons are produced during pyrolysis by the reaction of Martian oxychlorine compounds in the samples with terrestrial carbon from a derivatization agent (MTBSTFA) used in SAM (1, 2). Chlorobenzene cannot be formed by the direct reaction of MTBSTFA and DMF when heated in the presence of fused silica and perchlorates under SAM-like conditions (1)) therefore two other reaction pathways for chlorobenzene were proposed : (1) reactions between the volatile thermal degradation products of perchlorates (e.g. O2, Cl2 and HCl) and Tenax® and (2) the interaction of perchlorates with organic material from the martian regolith such as benzenecarboxylates (3, 4).\nThis study investigates several propositions for chlorinated hydrocarbon formation by looking for: (1) all products coming from the interaction of Tenax® (which is part of the SAM hydrocarbon trap) and perchlorates, (2) also between some soil sample and perchlorates in the presence or absence of MTBSTFA and (c) sources of chlorinated hydrocarbon precursors.\n",

            "abstract": "The San Cristobal Trough, which occupies the southern segment of the South Solomon Trench, hosts a dominantly left-lateral transform plate boundary (SCTF) linking the southern end of the Solomon Islands subduction zone (SISZ) to the northern end of the New Hebrides (Vanuatu) subduction zone (NHSZ). At its western end (SISZ), the Australia plate is torn as a result of the transition from subduction to transform motion. The southern side of the tear translates approximately 375 km along the SCTF before subducting beneath the Santa Cruz Islands at the NHSZ. Earthquakes occurring along this transform reflect the processes of plate tearing, fault zone evolution, and subsequent underthrusting and subduction of the Australia-plate-side of the transform. A knot of earthquake activity at the western end of the SCTF juxtaposes high-angle thrust faulting events with left-lateral strike slip events. These record the tearing of Australian lithosphere, as shown by a recent pair of large earthquakes in that region - a Mw 7.6 strike-slip event (12 April 2014) followed 22 hours later by a Mw 7.4 high-angle reverse faulting event (13 April 2014). Associated displacements reflect oblique tearing (northern-side down and west), allowing the Australia Plate to follow two disparate paths - subduction at the SISZ to the north and translation along the SCTF to the south. Moving eastward along the transform, the plate boundary shows three styles of earthquake activity. The main transform is dominated by shallow, E-W striking, left-lateral faulting and E-W striking thrust faults (with a north-dipping shallow fault plane) - these reflect partitioning of oblique motion along the transform between the Australia and Pacific plates. Outboard (+/- 100 km) of the plate boundary, a group of E-W striking shallow normal faulting events reflect upward bending driven by the convergent component of plate motions. Approaching the NHSZ, normal faulting earthquakes in the Australia Plate rotate clockwise, consistent with outer-rise normal faulting of the NHSZ.",

            "abstract": "Ecosystem states evolve due to complex interactions over various space and time scales. Process networks, in which nodes are time series variables and directional links are measures of information transfer, provide a method to analyze an ecosystem in terms of feedbacks, information transfer, and synchronization. It has been shown using FLUXNET data and ecohydrological modeling that variables such as precipitation, soil temperature, soil moisture, and heat fluxes exhibit forcings and feedbacks that are altered during periods of climate extremes such as drought. In this study, we use methods to deal with short datasets to observe shifts in network behavior over hourly to daily timescales. We compute network properties including transfer entropy, mutual information, and net system transport. To test our methods, we first generate chaotic test networks of various sizes and connectivity structures. It is found that a single feedback between two nodes causes a “self-feedback” to be detected at both nodes, which propagates throughout the network causing complete connectivity at predictable timescales. Depending on the symmetry of feedbacks and overall connectivity, a network may partially or completely synchronize. We then apply our methods to evaluate short-term ecosystem responses to climate extremes in agricultural landscapes in Illinois. We use 30- minute flux tower data from Bondville, IL, and 1 to15-minute data from recently installed weather stations and flux tower in the Sangamon River watershed to analyze network structure before, during, and after rainfall events or dry periods. Simulations in MLCan, a plant-atmosphere-canopy model, are performed to incorporate unmeasured nodes involving photosynthesis and soil hydrology. We compare the structure of feedbacks, forcings, and synchronization to vegetation response as measured by LAI or NDVI, in addition to a comparison with our test networks. This type of analysis can identify the feedbacks and links critical for ecosystem resilience or vulnerability to climate extremes.",

            "abstract": "In the present neither Mars nor Venus has Earth-like plate tectonics, though both are likely still volcanically active. Volcanism on Mars and Venus most resembles intra-plate volcanism on Earth, where magmatism occurs through intact lithospheric plates, away from plate boundaries. On Earth intra-plate magmatism has long been proposed to be the result of lithospheric thinning through delamination or ductile dripping. Exactly how these processes create volcanism, however, has remained obscure; particularly in the case of ductile dripping, which does not produce significant topography in the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.\nThough its fall may not trigger significant asthenospheric upwelling, the sinking drip itself will heat conductively as it enters the asthenosphere, and may itself melt, depending upon its solidus temperature and the temperature of the asthenosphere. We refer to this as “drip magmatism,” following the hypothesis of Elkins-Tanton (2007). This model produces testable predictions for the resulting magmatic compositions. Drip magmatism was tested by Ducea (2013) for the Altiplano Plateau in the central Andes, by Holbig and Grove (2008) for magmas from Tibet, by Elkins-Tanton (2014) for the Sierra Nevada, and by Furman et al. (2014) for the central African rift; geochemistry in all these localities confirm drip magmatism.\nDrip magmatism provides a quantifiable mechanism for slow but regular recycling of volatiles into a planetary atmosphere. Further, it could be driven primarily by carbon, or halogens, or other incompatible and volatile elements, in addition to water. Thus, volcanism on one-plate planets, or during a putative “hot” or “slow” tectonics phase on the early Earth, may provide sufficient volatile recycling for habitability.",

            "abstract": "A mag 6.4 earthquake offshore northern Puerto Rico earlier this year (1/13/14) is a reminder of the high risk of earthquakes and tsunamis in the northeastern Caribbean. Had the magnitude of this event been 0.1 larger (M 6.5) a tsunami warning would have been issued for the Puerto Rico-Virgin Islands (PRVI) region based on the West Coast Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (WCATWC) and Puerto Rico Seismic Network (PRSN) response procedures at the time. Such an alert level would have led local authorities to issue evacuation orders for all PRVI coastal areas. Since the number of deaths associated with tsunamis in the Caribbean region is greater than the total casualties from tsunamis in the entire US (including Hawaii and Alaska coasts) having an effective and redundant warning system is critical in order to save lives and to minimize false alarms that could result in significant economic costs and loss of confidence of Caribbean residents.\nWe are evaluating three fundamental components of tsunami monitoring protocols currently in place in the northeastern Caribbean: 1) preliminary earthquake parameters (used to determine the potential that a tsunami will be generated and the basis of tsunami alert levels), 2) adequacy of the tsunami alert levels, and 3) tsunami message dissemination. We compiled a catalog of earthquake locations (2007-2014) and dissemination times from the PTWC, WCATWC and NEIC (final locations). The events were classified into 3 categories: local [17°-20°N, 63.5°-69°W], regional (Caribbean basin) and distant/teleseismic (Atlantic basin). A total of 104 local earthquakes, 31 regional and 25 distant events were analyzed. We found that in general preliminary epicentral locations have an accuracy of 40 km. 64% of local events were located with an accuracy of 20 km. The depth accuracy of local events shallower than 50 km, regional and distant earthquakes is usually smaller than 30 km. For deeper local events the error distribution shows more variability (-32 to 81 km); preliminary locations tend to underestimate depth. A trade-off between epicentral location and depth was observed for several local events deeper than 50 km.",

It is well dated at 133 Ma preceding the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, but the causative geodynamic processes are still poorly understood. Although a low-velocity anomaly has been imaged by seismic tomography in the northeast region of the PMP and interpreted as a fossil conduct of a mantle plume that is related to the flood basalt eruptions, geochemical data indicate that such magmatism is caused by the melting of a heterogeneous and enriched lithospheric mantle with no deep plume participation.\nModels of density perturbations in the upper mantle estimated from joint inversion of geoid anomalies and P-wave delay times will offer important constraints on mantle dynamics.\nA new generation of accurate global geopotential models derived from satellite-missions (e.g. GRACE, GOCE) allows us to estimate density distribution within the Earth from geoid inversion. In order to obtain the residual geoid anomaly related to the density structure of the mantle, we use the EGM2008 model removing estimated geoid perturbations owing to variations in crustal structure (i.e., topographical masses, Moho depth, thickness of sediments and basalts).\nUsing a spherical-Earth approximation, the density model space is represented by a set of tesseroids and the velocity model is parameterized in nodes of a spherical grid where cubic B-splines are utilized as an interpolation function. To constrain the density inversion, we add more than 10,000 manually picked teleseismic P-wave delay times. During the inversion procedure, density and P-wave velocity are linked through the optimization of a constant linear factor correlating density and velocity perturbation. Such optimization will be performed using a probability density function (PDF) [Tarantola, 2005].\nWe will present the preliminary results of this joint inversion scheme and hypothesize on the geodynamic processes responsible for the flood basalt eruptions.",

The water of Yarkant River in China Karakoram is mainly supplied by glaciers and snow meltwater, so runoff is greatly affected by air temperature. The meltwater flow has responded to both wetting and cooling climate and glacier changes in high mountains. The study analyzed the variations of climate, glaciers and summer meltwater flow in two different periods, glacier retreat and advance before and after 1996 based on long term data of monthly air temperature, precipitation and discharge from alpine stations for recent 53 years (1960-2012). The influence of the glacier and climatic conditions (retreat/advance vs temperature and precipitation) on runoff were simulated by a monthly regression model, through which we explored the hydrological changes in Yarkant River. By two groups of the monthly regression model, we found reliable correlations between monthly air temperature and discharge during June to September of strong ablation months in glacier retreat period before 1996. Then in the glacier advance, the melt coefficient of June discharge become into much greater than that of after 1996 in a warmer and wetter climate, and the coefficient in July did not change. However the correlationa disappeared in August and September with a cool and wet climate since 1997, the results indicated no increase in summer flow suggest that the glacier thickening, surging and expanding can intensify both meltwater storage and refreeze in subglacial systems.",

This has led to a great deal of interest in the mechanisms and spatio-temporal patterns of Pliocene warmth and sea level rise, as well as interest in how the Pliocene can constrain climate sensitivity. The Pliocene has also been used to identify potential biases or missing processes in climate models (through model-proxy reconstruction comparisons). To date, however, there has been little focus on exploiting the model-reconstruction disagreements in order to better inform policymaking, by providing alternative scenarios beyond those produced by models alone. We drive a marine ecosystem model of the North Atlantic Ocean with state of the art climate model output from the CMIP5 archive, as well as conditions derived from the PRISM multiproxy reconstruction of mid-Pliocene SSTs, in order to assess the impact future warming spatially-resembling the Pliocene will have on fisheries relative to warming anticipated by climate models.",

            "abstract": "Archeomagnetic studies in the Near East report the occurrence of strong rises of geomagnetic intensity in this region ca. 980 BC and 890 BC. Here we seek corroborative evidence of such 'spike' events, lasting over only a very few decades, in the records of the past production rates of the cosmogenic nuclides 14C and 10Be. Our forward modeling strategy rests on global, time-dependent, geomagnetic spike field models feeding state-of-the-art models of cosmogenic nuclide production. We find that spike models with an energy budget in line with our current understanding of large-scale flow at Earth’s core surface fail to produce a visible imprint in the cosmonuclide records. Spike models able to reproduce the intensity levels reported in the Near East are at variance with this understanding, yet their computed impact on the production rate of 10Be intriguingly shows hints of what is measured in polar ice cores, albeit with a time shift of 3 to 4 decades. Their imprint on the record of 14C is less obvious, presumably because its production is more sensitive to changes in the dipole moment rather than in the geometrical configuration of the geomagnetic field. These preliminary results stress the need for further studies devoted to the occurrence, timing, and dynamical origin of extreme geomagnetic field intensity variations, and their possible imprint on the past production of cosmogenic radionuclides.",

            "abstract": "Bank erosion and failure is a major contributor of fine sediment to streams and rivers, and can be driven by subsurface flow. In restoration projects, vegetation is often planted on banks to reduce erosion and stabilize the banks. However, the relationship between subsurface flow, erosion and vegetation remains somewhat speculative. A comparative study quantified the effect of surface planting on subsurface erosion and soil strength. Six 32-gallon containers were layered with a sandy loam overlying a highly conductive sand layer and a confining clay. Three treatments were applied in pairs: switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), sod (turf-type tall fescue and Kentucky bluegrass mix), and no vegetation. After a vegetation establishment period, the 2, 10, and 100 year rainfalls were simulated. Samples collected from ports in the containers were analyzed for subsurface drainage volume and suspended sediment concentration. After all rainfall simulations, a sediment core was taken from each container to measure shear strength and root density.\nResults indicate the relative benefits of vegetative planting to reduce subsurface erosion during storms and enhance soil strength. Switchgrass reduced the total amount of sediment removed from containers during all three storms when compared to the sod and during the 10 and 100 year storms when compared to the bare ground. Results from the volume analysis were more variable. Switchgrass retained the greatest volume of water from the 100 year storm event, but also released the largest fraction of water in the 2 and 10 year storms. Both sod and switchgrass planting considerably increased the time required for the soil samples to fail despite reducing the shear stress at failure. Where switchgrass grew long, woody roots, the sod developed a dense mat of interconnected thin roots. We suspect the different root patterns between sod and switchgrass to be a dominant factor in the response of the different containers.",

            "abstract": "Most rock-forming silicates are substitutional solid solutions. Over the years extensive research has been done to determine their structural and crystal chemical properties. Here, the distribution of cations, or order-disorder behavior, is of central importance. In the case of aluminosilicate garnet solid solutions (X3Al2Si3O12 with X = Mg, Fe2+, Mn2+ and Ca) it has been shown that both synthetic and natural crystals have random long-range X-cation disorder in space group Ia-3d, as given by X-ray single-crystal diffraction measurements. However, the structural state of natural garnets at the local scale is not known.\nGarnet from a grospydite xenolith from the Roberts Victor kimberlite, South Africa, was studied by 27Al and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. The research thrust was placed on measuring and analyzing paramagnetically shifted resonances to determine the local (short range) structural state of the X-cations in a grossular-rich ternary aluminosilicate garnet solid solution. The garnet crystals are compositionally homogeneous based on microprobe analysis, showing no measurable zoning, and have the formula Grs46.7Prp30.0Alm23.3. The garnet is cubic with the standard garnet space group Ia-3d.\nThe 27Al MAS NMR spectrum shows a very broad asymmetric resonance located between about 100 and -50 ppm. It consists of a number of individual overlapping paramagnetically shifted resonances, which are difficult to analyze quantitatively. The 29Si MAS NMR spectrum, showing better resolution, has two observable resonances termed S0 and S4. S0 is located between about -60 ppm and -160 ppm and S4 is centered at roughly 95 ppm. Both S0 and S4 are composite resonances in nature containing many overlapping individual peaks. S0 contains information on local cation configurations whereby an isolated SiO4 group in the garnet structure does not have an edge-shared Fe2+-containing dodecahedron. S4 involves local configurations where there is one edge-shared dodecahedron containing Fe2+. The measured intensity of the resonances S0 and S4 are roughly similar to calculated intensities assuming random cation mixing. These first results do not indicate any overt short-range cation order in grossular-rich grospydite garnet.",

As a result of this highly productive surface water, an intense subsurface oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) persists. Despite the import of the effect of OMZs due to their predicted increase with global warming, there is very little trace metal data from this region. Here we present dissolved trace metal data from the U.S. GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect over the Peru shelf and through the OMZ. Results suggest a sink of Pb, Cd, Sc, Cu and Ga in the suboxic region of the shelf, and a shelf source of Co and Fe. Trace metal concentrations within the OMZ will also be discussed. As many of these metals have not been analyzed in this region previously, this work can serve as a baseline for future comparison and adds to the understanding of global trace metal distributions.",

            "abstract": "Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential variable needed to monitor and understand climate change. The global coverage provided by polar orbiting satellites is seen as the basis of SST climate records (CDRs). Such CDRs require accurate and traceable determination of the uncertainty characteristics of the SST retrievals from the long time series of measurements, taken by a sequence of satellite radiometers of evolving design and capabilities. The most recent of these instruments is the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi-NPP (National Polar-orbiting Partnership). The results of continuing analyses of the first three years of VIIRS measurements of skin SST are presented. The analyses include assessments of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the uncertainties, and comparisons to other satellite-based infrared sensors. VIIRS that has a swath width >3000km is much wider than either the MODIS or AVHRR, offers potentially gap-free coverage between adjacent swaths. However, current algorithms for retrieving SST from the infrared have increased uncertainty, and typically larger cold biases, at higher viewing angles. Alternative algorithmic approaches were developed at Miami to overcome some of the shortcomings identified in operational algorithms and to provide more accurate retrievals across the entire swath width. Additional terms have been added to a VIIRS atmospheric correction algorithm to account for the effects of the high emission angle and long atmospheric path lengths. We conclude that reprocessed VIIRS SSTs using this enhanced algorithm would be capable of improving upon the accuracies of SSTs from the MODIS’s on Terra and Aqua, and AVHRR Pathfinder, and have the potential to contribute to the extension of the satellite-derived Climate Data Records of SST into the future.",

            "abstract": "As the climate at high latitudes continues to warm, permafrost is becoming increasingly vulnerable to thaw, particularly in the zone of discontinuous permafrost where mean annual air temperatures hover close to zero. Permafrost thaw has dramatic consequences on local hydrology, ecology, and the carbon (C) balance of these ecosystems. The degree to which permafrost peatlands become C sources or sinks following permafrost thaw remains a topic of much debate, owing to the difficulty in accurately dating cores from collapse-scar bogs and in understanding the vulnerability of the formerly forested peat to decomposition immediately following thaw and inundation. Here we use a combination of a chronosequence, paleoenvironmental, and modeling approaches from a permafrost peat plateau interspersed with collapse-scar bogs in Interior Alaska to address how C storage is impacted on timescales from decades to millennia following permafrost thaw. Our initial results indicate that C stocks are lowest in young (years to decades) and intermediate (decades to centuries) collapse-scar bogs, but that net C stocks in old (centuries to millennia) bogs can be as high as in permafrost plateaus. Thawed forested plateau peat is subject to rapid decomposition in the years to decades following thaw, but that rate of loss slows over time. We hypothesize that this is because the labile C pool is preferentially consumed and quickly exhausted by soil microbes. Meanwhile, post-thaw collapse-scar bog peat accumulates rapidly at the surface, and our data show that on longer centennial to millennial timescales, this near-surface C may offset initial post-thaw losses at depth. Collapse-scar bog peat accumulation rates outpace the former-plateau peat loss in a matter of years to decades. Older landscapes (i.e., those that began accumulating peat many thousands of years ago), are subject to greater C loss following thaw than are younger landscapes(i.e., those that initiated only a couple thousand years ago), leading to a much longer period of net C loss from the ecosystem in older peatlands.",

RAD also recorded the dose rate during the 253-day cruise phase of MSL from Earth to Mars. There, the variations of the GCR-induced dose rates during quiet time period without the influences of Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) were theoretically solely driven by the changes of heliospheric conditions (i.e., [c]).

            "abstract": "Kima’Kho Mountain is a 1.8 Ma (40Ar/39Ar of 1.82 +/- 40 ka) Pleistocene an alkali-olivine basaltic tuya situated in northern British Columbia. The volcanic edifice rises 460 m from its base and comprises a central vent, dominated by lapilli-tuff and minor pillow lava and dykes; and a surrounding plateau underlain by a sequence of dipping beds of basaltic tuff-breccia and capped by a series of flat-lying, subaerial lava flows. We present a 1:10,000 geological map for Kima’Kho Mountain building on the preliminary work of Ryane et al. (2010). We use the volcanic stratigraphy to explore the implications of three unique features. (1) The central cone comprises massive to crudely-bedded lapilli tuffs containing abundant armoured lapilli - cores of highly-vesicular pyroclasts coated with blocky to cuspate vitric ash. These units suggest an explosive origin from within an ice-enclosed lake, and deposited by wet, dilute pyroclastic surge events. (2) The entire stratigraphic sequence hosts at least two \"passage zones\" (cf. Jones, 1969); the presence and geometry of these passage zones constrain ice thicknersses at the time of eruption and inform on the englacial lake dynamics. (3) Lastly, our field-based stratigraphic relationships are at odds with the classic tuya model (i.e. an effusive onset to the eruption, forming pillow basalts, followed by explosive activity). Our field mapping suggests an alternative model of tuya architecture, involving a highly-energetic, sustained explosive onset creating a tephra cone that become emergent followed by effusive eruption to create lavas and a subaqueous lava-fed delta.\nJones, J.

            "abstract": "Coastal wetlands, which have immense potential to store carbon (C) in vegetation and sediments, are a vital part of the global C cycle. How C storage in coastal wetlands will be affected by accelerated sea level rise as a result of a warming climate, however, is uncertain. In oligotrophic wetlands such as the Everglades in the southeastern USA, saltwater intrusion will bring ions (Cl-, SO42-) and phosphorus (P), a limiting nutrient for ecosystem productivity. It is hypothesized that shifts in stressors and subsidies can shift the soil carbon balance from a net C sink to a source, stimulating peat collapse, which will, in turn, accelerate the effects of sea level rise. The objective of this study is to investigate how simulated saltwater intrusion into freshwater and oligohaline wetlands will change net ecosystem productivity and affect the soil C balance. Using coupled field and mesocosm experiments beginning in August 2014, we are examining how plant gross primary production, plant respiration, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem exchange in freshwater and oligohaline wetlands will change when exposed to saltwater and an increase in P loading. We predict that a higher saltwater load will increase ecosystem respiration while decreasing ecosystem productivity, possibly shifting the C balance of these marshes from a net sink to a source. In contrast, increased P loading has been shown to increase ecosystem productivity in oligotrophic wetlands; sawgrass, the dominant macrophyte in Everglades marshes, increases productivity with increased P, but periphyton decreases productivity. Therefore, it is still unknown how the interaction of an increased P subsidy coupled with saltwater intrusion will affect overall net ecosystem productivity and the C balance. Results from this study will reveal how the soil C balance in freshwater and oligohaline wetlands changes with saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise.",

A dramatic new example of this dynamism was found in images obtained in 2012-2014 by the cameras onboard the Cassini spacecraft. These data reveal periodic brightness variations extending across a 2000-km-wide swath of the inner D ring that was largely featureless prior to 2011. Furthermore, the radial wavelength of this pattern decreased by over a factor of four in eighteen months. Similarly periodic patterns with steadily decreasing wavelengths were previously observed in other parts of Saturn's and Jupiter's rings, and each of those structures appears to have been generated by some event that produced organized non-circular motions in the ring-particles' orbits. This new pattern seems to represent another example of this sort of structure. However, this new pattern is special because the ring-disturbing event required to produce the observed ring features must have occurred in late 2011, while the Cassini spacecraft was in orbit around Saturn. Images obtained before and after the event, as well as data from other instruments, could therefore help clarify the origin and nature of this disturbance.",

            "abstract": "Continent–continent collisional systems represent the largest orogens on Earth and provide locations to study processes that drive the transition from contraction and crustal thickening to extension and collapse. The Greater Himalayan Zone (GHZ) exposed along strike of the Himalayan orogen contains exhumed mid-crustal metasedimentary rocks. To better understand the history of burial, crustal flow, and partial melting during the early stages of Himalayan tectonics in the Eocene to ~40 Myr into its orogenic evolution, monazite was analyzed from five migmatitic gneisses and five host gneisses exposed across two transects within central and eastern Bhutan. Monazite was analyzed in situ by the split-stream laser-ablation (LASS) ICPMS technique, which allows simultaneous collection of U-Th-Pb isotopes and trace-element abundances. The migmatites from the eastern Bhutan transect yield monazite dates that record melt crystallization as young as ca. 15–13 Ma. The host gneisses yield similar to younger (down to ca. 11 Ma) dates, documenting coeval to continued metamorphism of the GHZ. In comparison, melt crystallization in the central Bhutan rocks ended by ca. 18 Ma, and metamorphic monazite from a metapelite record metamorphism until ca. 14 Ma. In the migmatite and host-rock samples from both transects, the trace-element data show an inverse correlation between date and the HREE concentration. This trend likely documents the breakdown of garnet, which probably coincides with the first stages of GHZ exhumation. Thus, the LASS data showed that garnet breakdown and GHZ exhumation occurred from ca. 18 to 14 Ma in eastern Bhutan and ca. 20 to 17 Ma in central Bhutan. The new monazite data suggest different histories for the melt crystallization, metamorphism, and exhumation of the GHZ rocks between central and eastern Bhutan, even though the present day rocks from the two transects are only exposed ~60 km apart. Moreover, in comparison to other parts of the eastern Himalaya, the new geochronometric data correlate with the previously-described trend in which melt crystallization and metamorphism occured at progressively younger times from west (ca. 26 Ma) to east (ca. 13 Ma).",

In order to investigate these and other questions, we are developing a three-dimensional model of the anisotropic velocity structure of the Pacific upper mantle. We use measurements of fundamental-mode dispersion for Rayleigh and Love waves traversing oceanic paths. These observations are drawn from the waveform dataset used to construct the global dispersion model GDM52. To supplement this global dataset, we make additional measurements of surface-wave dispersion on waveform data from the NoMelt experiment, a deployment of broadband ocean-bottom seismometers on ~70 Ma lithosphere between the Clarion and Clipperton fracture zones in the central Pacific. The shorter oceanic paths sampled by this dataset help improve the resolution of the velocity model in the Pacific by providing a regional constraint on the larger plate-scale model. We invert phase-velocity maps from the combined dataset for velocity structure at depth. An oceanic reference model is used to compute the sensitivity kernels. We invert simultaneously for isotropic velocity structure and radial and azimuthal anisotropy beneath the Pacific Basin. The resulting anisotropic velocity model will improve constraints on olivine fabrics and strain geometries in the oceanic upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "The most conventional and abundant tracers of biomass combustion in aerosol particles include potassium and biomarkers derived from thermally altered cellulose/hemicellulose (anhydrosugars) and lignin (methoxyphenols). However, little is known of the role of biomass combustion as a particulate source of major plant polymers to the atmosphere. Here, concentrations of “free” (solvent-extractable) anhydrosugars and methoxyphenols are compared to the yields of polymeric lignin oxidation products (LOPs) during a smoke plume event in Houston, Texas. Downwind aerosol samples (PM2.5) were collected prior to, during, and following a two-day wildfire event that burned ~5,000 acres of a spartina saltmarsh ecosystem in the McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge, 125 km southeast of Houston. In addition, charcoals of the burned plants were collected within a week of the fire at the wildfire site. HYSPLIT modeling shows that Houston was directly downwind of this wildfire during the peak of the burn, with an approximate travel time from source to aerosol sampling site of 12-16 hrs. Concentrations of all organic markers, K+, and Ca2+ jumped by a factor of 2-13 within 1-2 days of the start of the fire and dropped to pre-fire levels three days after the peak event. Source signatures of anhydrosugars and free methoxyphenols during the peak of the plume were identical to those of grass charcoals collected from the site, confirming the potential use of charcoals as endmembers for source input reconstruction during atmospheric transport. An enrichment factor of 20 in the anhydrosugar to methoxyphenol ratio of aerosols vs. charcoals can partially be explained by differences in degradation rate constants between the two biomarker groups. Polymeric LOP comprised 73-91% of all lignin material in the aerosols, pointing to fires as major sources of primary biogenic aerosol particles and confirming an earlier study that lignin phenols in atmospheric particles occur predominantly in polymeric form.",

            "abstract": "We apply various techniques to analyze seismic data from the 2009 – 2010 Ridge2000 Lau Spreading Center project to investigate the distribution of partial melt beneath the Tonga arc and Lau back-arc basin. The shear wave velocity structure is jointly inverted from the phase velocities of teleseismic and ambient-noise Rayleigh waves, as the former is inverted using the two-plane-wave method with finite-frequency kernels, and the latter is obtained from cross-correlation in frequency domain. Additionally, we determine the 3D attenuation structure from t* measurements of P and S waves from local earthquakes. In order to avoid the trade-off between t* and corner frequency, we analyze the spectral ratio of S coda to independently constrain the fc for each event. The QP and QS structures are inverted separately, and QP/QS is jointly inverted from QP and t*(S). Tomographic results show strong signals of low velocity and high attenuation within the upper 100-km of the mantle beneath the back-arc basin, suggesting perhaps the lowest shear velocity (VSV = 3.5 km/s) and highest seismic attenuation (QP < 35 and QS < 25) known in the mantle. These anomalies require not only the abnormally high temperature but also the existence of partial melt. The inferred partial melt aligns with the spreading centers at shallow depths, but shift westwards away from the slab, implying a passive decompression melting process governed by the mantle wedge flow pattern. The Tonga volcanic arc does not display as strong of velocity or attenuation anomalies as the spreading centers, suggesting less magmatism associate with the arc compared to the back-arc.",

            "abstract": "Tilt Current Meters (TCMs) provide accurate, cost effective measurements of near-bottom current velocities. Many studies in coastal environments require current measurements, which are frequently made with Acoustic Doppler Profilers (ADPs). ADPs are expensive, however, and may not be suitable for locations where there is significant risk of damage, loss, or theft or where a large spatial array of measurements is required. TCMs, by contrast, are smaller, less expensive, and easier to deploy. This study tested TCMs in three sites to determine their suitability for use in research applications. TCMs are based on the drag-tilt principle, where the instrument tilts in response to current. The meter consists of a buoyant float with an onboard accelerometer, three-axis tilt sensor, three-axis magnetometer (compass), and a data logger. Current measurements are derived by post processing the tilt and compass values and converting them to velocity using empirical calibration data. Large data-storage capacity (4 GB) and low power requirements allow long deployments (many months) at high sample rates (16 Hz). We demonstrate the utility of TCM current measurements on a reef at Dongsha Atoll in the South China Sea, and in Vineyard Sound off Cape Cod, where the TCM performance was evaluated against ADP measurements. We have also used the TCM to record waves during an overwash event on a Cape Cod barrier beach during a winter storm. The TCM recorded waves as they came through the overwash channel, and the data were in agreement with the water-level record used as a reference. These tests demonstrate that TCMs may be used in a variety of near shore environments and have the potential to significantly increase the density of meters in future studies were current measurements are required.",

            "abstract": "Modeling efforts supported by the few field observations available show that intense straining at the margins of Siple Coast ice streams (SCIS) can heat, and even partially melt, the ice adjacent to the bed. This enhances deformation in the margins and lowers the lateral resistance to ice stream flow. Combining a steady state 1D thermal model for a uniformly sheared column of ice with a temperature dependent ice rheology we solve for the average lateral shear stress in the column, showing that this stress has a triple-valued dependence on lateral strain rate. Using measured strain rates from Joughin et al. [2002] we show that for nearly all active SCIS margins the inferred shear stress sits in the low-strength valley of the triple-valued curve. This means that the margins support a lower lateral stress than the adjacent ice of the more rapidly moving stream, and thus the basal resistance must be enhanced near the margin. Such an enhancement could come from a channelized drainage system that develops to accommodate the melt generated within the temperate margin. To study this we develop a simple model for the subglacial hydrology in which water flows laterally in a thin film between the ice and till towards a channel that operates at a lower water pressure [Rothlisberger, 1972]. The resulting pore pressure profile is then used to calculate the basal resistance near the margin assuming a Coulomb plastic rheology for the till. We predict strengthening within 2 km of the margin. Finally we use a path-independent integral (Rice [1968]) to quantify how this additional basal resistance lowers the stress concentrated on the locked portion of the bed adjacent to the stream. We find that for realistic values of the film thickness the additional basal resistance can strongly reduce the stress concentration, allowing for a smooth transition from a deforming to an undeforming bed at the margin.",

            "abstract": "The mechanisms controlling the migration of mantle-derived, CO­2-rich fluids in early-stage continental rifts are poorly constrained, yet have important implications for processes occurring during the initiation of continental breakup. Within the East African Rift specifically, the role of normal fault structures in transporting fluids, and the role these fluids play in driving deformation, is yet to be addressed. The 7 Ma Magadi Basin of the EAR exhibits active hydrothermal fluid flow amongst an excellently exposed array of normal faults, providing a unique opportunity to test the mechanics of fault-controlled fluid migration at an early-stage continental rift setting.\nWe present a study utilizing both geochemical and structural data collected from active and fossilized fluid systems observed along faults in the Magadi Basin. The distribution and orientation of veins and systematic fracture sets around fault zones were recorded in the field, and fault throws were measured using a Trimble GPS. Larger faults were analyzed remotely using aerial imagery and the Aster GDEM v.2. Fault data were then compared with CO2 flux measured on soil and from gas-emitting fractures in and around fault zones using an accumulation chamber.\nOur data reveal that CO2-rich fluids travel along fault-parallel fractures within fault zones, and fault-oblique fracture sets in the accommodation zones between fault segments. Fluids rising through faults may additionally be diverted along lithologic boundaries in fault grabens, such as the contact between lavas and overlying sedimentary fill. The highest CO2 flux observed in the Magadi region occurs in the central axis of the rift, along faults with the highest observable throws (>150 m) as well as the 1998 earthquake rupture.\nThis study illustrates a direct link between fluid flow and faulting during the earliest stages of continental rifting. High CO2 soil flux and active hydrothermal fluid flow is, therefore, a potential indicator of faults with low earthquake recurrence intervals in continental rift settings. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that, in addition to volcanic systems, faults provide important pathways that facilitate the migration of mantle-derived CO2 to the Earth’s surface in the East African Rift.",

            "abstract": "Coupling strength is defined as the ratio of a system’s output to its input in steady state. The convolution theorem shows that this ratio is given by the area under the system impulse response function. The impulse response can be determined with linear prediction filters. We have developed an optimum coupling function for the AL index and used it to determine the solar cycle dependence of coupling strength. Coupling is weakest at solar maximum (120 nT/mV/m) and strongest at minimum (170). We speculate that this variation is caused by frequent saturation of the polar cap potential at solar maximum. We investigate this hypothesis using local linear filters where data are binned by driver strength. We find for very low driver strength the coupling strength increases with driver strength contrary to expectations. However, above 2 mV/m coupling strength decreases with increasing driver strength as expected from saturation. Averaged over cycle #23 our results show that in the linear regime AL ~212×VBs, and that the saturation electric field is about 12 mV/m. The initial rise in coupling strength for weak driver strength may be a consequence of the westward electrojet moving closer to the AE stations as the polar cap expands. The prediction efficiency of the local filters is never higher than 40% and falls rapidly as driver strength increases. The filters become very difficult to calculate above 10 mV/m.",

            "abstract": "We present the initial results of transitioning laboratory activities in an introductory physical geology course from passive to active learning. Educational research demonstrates that student-driven investigations promote increased engagement and better retention of material. Surveys of students in introductory physical geology helped us identify lab activities which do not engage students. We designed new lab activities to be more collaborative, open-ended and “hands-on”. Student feedback was most negative for lab activities which are computer-based. In response, we have removed computers from the lab space and increased the length and number of activities involving physical manipulation of samples and models. These changes required investment in lab equipment and supplies. New lab activities also include student-driven exploration of data with open-ended responses. Student-evaluations of the new lab activities will be compiled during Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 to allow us to measure the impact of the changes on student satisfaction and we will report on our findings to date. Modification of this course has been sponsored by NSF’s Widening Implementation & Demonstration of Evidence Based Reforms (WIDER) program through grant #1347722 to the University of Illinois.

            "abstract": "The Labrador Sea is one of the few locations in the world’s oceans where deep convection occurs. The convectively-formed Labrador Sea Water (LSW) contributes to the lower limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). In light of its link to the AMOC, it is important to understand the annual cycle of Labrador Sea convection and restratification, and the role that both atmospheric and oceanic conditions play for the formation of LSW.\nConvection in the Labrador Sea is highly variable in time, and observations indicate that also the location of deepest convection varies. It is obvious that the atmospheric heat loss is an important factor in governing these characteristics of wintertime convection. However, the story is probably more complicated than that. Over the year, the Labrador Sea loses heat to the atmosphere, and this loss is compensated by lateral eddy buoyancy fluxes originating from the boundary current. This implies that variations in the pattern and magnitude of these eddy fluxes may play a role as well for setting the preferred convection sites.\nIn this study, a highly idealized model is applied to investigate the competing impacts of surface heat loss and lateral buoyancy fluxes in setting the characteristics of Labrador Sea convection, and to assess how sensitive the convection is to variations in these two processes. In particular, the impacts of Irminger Rings shed near Greenland’s west coast are highlighted.",

Ambient measurements conducted on the west coast of Vancouver Island (BC, Canada) showed that the IN concentrations at -40C and RHice of 139±2% varied from 0.2 L-1 to 3.3L-1 in the sub-micron size range. The correlations of IN concentrations with other atmospheric variables are used to infer their source. In addition, sea surface microlayer (SML) and subsurface waters (SSW) were collected in the PO and AO. The ice nucleating abilities of the PO and AO samples were studied via deposition nucleation and immersion freezing, respectively. Both data sets showed that the SML samples are better IN than the corresponding SSW. The ice nucleating abilities of the SML particles are comparable with those of mineral dust particles and bioaerosol particles which are known to be efficient IN. Heating and filtering experiments suggest that the high ice nucleating efficiency of the SML aerosol particles could be due to the presence of biological material. Our results indicate that the oceans need to be evaluated as an IN source for climate modeling.",

            "abstract": "Typhoon Bopha (2012) originated unusually close to the equator and underwent three periods of rapid intensification (RI) during its lifetime. It made landfall on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao as a Category 5 super typhoon and caused widespread destruction and over 600 deaths.\nIn this study, the first 24-h RI process was reproduced reasonably well using the Advanced Research and Weather Forecasting model (ARW-WRF) with large-scale spectral nudging to ensure a good track simulation. Processes responsible for the RI were analyzed.\nOn the large scale, environmental vertical wind shear (VWS) stays below 6ms-1 throughout RI. On the storm scale, the simulated Bopha eyewall starts to contract rapidly 18 h before RI; and the radius of maximum wind (RMW) has shrunk from 40km to 20km by the end of RI. During RI, near the RMW, azimuthal mean tangential wind, radial wind and inertial stability increase rapidly, indicating a positive feedback between primary and secondary circulation. On the convective scale, in the presence of low shear, the rapid growth of the convective bursts (CBs) at the onset and early stages of RI is most likely buoyantly driven. It is suggested that as inflows continue to penetrate into the core, the supergradient winds start to transport high θe air from the eye to the eyewall, increasing the buoyancy and supporting the CBs. The high θ air detrained from the lower stratosphere surrounding the tall CBs can possibly contribute to the upper tropospheric warming and the RI onset. Trajectory analysis is currently being performed to further demonstrate this eye-eyewall exchange that leads to the onset of RI.",

Theory predicts that a DG-2 layer will be flexurally strong or weak depending on whether L<1 or L>4√3, respectively. Moreover, such a layer can manifest fold-like structures for 2<L<4√3, and fault-like ones for 1<L<2. Equivalent ranges of spherical harmonic degree l can be found using Jean's relation, such that l=2πr/Ld, where r is the radius of the planet. Admittance and degree correlation spectra, complete to degree and order 2160, exhibit characteristics which are not consistent, in detail, with simple isostatic models commonly used to interpret gravity-topography observations. We use global gravity grids to examine the spatial correlation of tectonic features, including subduction zones, fracture zones, glacial-isostatic depressions, ocean ridges, and continental slopes, with gravity anomalies in eleven discrete passbands A-K. On this basis we infer the regional mode of deformation and thickness of Earth's crust, lithosphere, asthenosphere, and mesosphere. The geoid-like pattern at the longest wavelengths (A-band, l=2-7) is consistent with folding of a slab-loaded mesosphere. Shorter wavelength anomalies (B-band, l=8-21) beneath ocean ridges show age-progressive patterns consistent with thermal subsidence, while those under the Tibetan Plateau are consistent with thickening of a weak upper mantle asthenosphere. Even shorter wavelength anomalies are consistent with the folding of a 255-km thick lithosphere beneath the Andes and the Alpine-Himalaya orogens (C,D-bands, l=22-57), and the presence of a strong 100-km thick lithosphere which is folded and faulted at subduction zones (E,F,G,H,I-bands, l=58-416). Admittance in the J-band (l=417-1389) is consistent with rigidly-supported topography, while at the shortest wavelengths (K-band, l=1390-2160) admittance appears to be enhanced by folding and faulting in a 25-km thick crust, particularly in the Alps, the Himalaya-Tibetan orogen, the American Cordilleras, and New Guinea. We conclude that Earth's density distribution is dihamonically controlled, as predicted by ThERM.",

            "abstract": "We integrate detrital zircon geochronology and 3D seismic-reflection data to reconstruct Oligo-Miocene paleogeography and sediment routing from the Alpine hinterland to Austrian Molasse foreland basin. Three-dimensional seismic-reflection data image a network of deepwater tributaries and a long-lived (>8 Ma) foredeep-axial channel belt through which predominantly southerly and westerly turbidity currents are interpreted to have transported Alpine detritus >100 km. We analyzed 793 detrital zircon grains from ten sandstone samples collected from the seismically mapped network of channel fill. Grain age populations correspond with major Alpine orogenic cycles: the Cadomian (750-530 Ma), the Caledonian (500-400 Ma), and the Variscan orogenies (350-250 Ma). Additional age populations correspond with Eocene-Oligocene Periadriatic magmatism (40-30 Ma) and pre-Alpine, Precambrian sources >750 Ma. The abundances of these age populations vary between samples. Sediment that entered the foredeep-axial channel belt from the west (freshwater Molasse) and southwest (Inntal fault zone) is characterized by statistically indistinguishable, well-distributed detrital zircon ages. Sandstone from a shallow marine unit that was deposited proximal to the northern basin margin consists of >75% Variscan (350-300 Ma) zircon, which is believed to have originated from the Bohemian Massif to the north. Mixing calculations based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff statistic suggest that the Alpine fold-thrust belt was an important source of detritus to the deepwater Molasse basin. We document east-to-west provenance dilution within the axial channel belt via one or more southern tributaries. Our results have important implications for sediment dispersal patterns within continental-scale orogens, including the relative role of longitudinal versus transverse sediment delivery in peripheral foreland basins.",

It collects solar occultation spectra in the visible and near infrared regions of the solar spectrum from 400-1010 nm with resolution of approximately 2 nm. MAESTRO is able to measure strong absorption features of the oxygen molecule in A- and B-bands at 762 nm and 690 nm, respectively, which are used to derive atmospheric temperature and pressure profiles. The retrieval algorithm is based on a global fit that simultaneously fits all spectra from a single occultation to determine a density profile, which is then used to determine pressure and temperature. The forward model uses a fast line-by-line calculation and correlated-k technique to accurately model atmospheric absorption and the nonlinear saturation effects in the occultation geometry. The O2 spectroscopic parameters formerly used in forward model were from HITRAN (high-resolution transmission molecular absorption database) 2004. O2 A- and B-band spectral features have been significantly improved in the most recent update of HITRAN (2012). This paper discusses the improvement of the retrievals and retrieval uncertainties with the new oxygen parameters. Temperature-pressure profiles derived using these new parameters are compared with previous profiles, the profiles retrieved from ACE_FTS (Fourier Transform Spectrometer) data, and coincident radiosonde measurements.",

The YTT is the most recent and largest of the four Mount Toba eruptions, and is the only super-eruption to have taken place during the Quaternary. The timing of the YTT approximately coincides with a hypothesized human genetic bottleneck. Several climate models have proposed an episode of global cooling following the YTT; however, the magnitude and duration of the cooling is much debated, ranging from just a few degrees of cooling to a state of volcanic winter. Cored sediments from Lake Malawi provide an excellent record of local variability in the lake’s watershed that may be linked to specific climatic events. To investigate the possible effects of the YTT in East Africa, we continuously sampled Lake Malawi drill core 2A-10H-2 at 2-4 mm (~6 yr) intervals above and below the first occurrence of the YTT. Poaceae phytoliths were grouped into plant functional types (C3, C4, xerophytic, mesophytic, arboreal, etc.), revealing mostly subtle changes in terrestrial vegetation over the ~400 yr time period examined. Abrupt increases in concentration values for phytoliths derived from riverine Podostemaceae plants appear to signal increased discharge from rivers draining the surrounding uplands. Perhaps most significant is the increasing trend in burned phytoliths and decreasing trend in tree phytoliths post-YTT. Although there appears to be a very weak cooling signal synchronous with the YTT, the most abrupt terrestrial vegetation changes appear to be better correlated with the deposition of a slightly older cryptotephra horizon derived from the local Rungwe Volcanic Province. A potential complication with this record is the existence of a turbidite pre-YTT that encompasses the Rungwe horizon.",

Goals of this student-run project include: 1) To monitor the rocky intertidal habitat and develop a baseline database of invertebrates and algal density and abundance; 2) To contribute to the conservation of the rocky intertidal habitat through education of students and visitors about intertidal species; 3) To increase stewardship in the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary; and 4) To contribute abundance and population data on key algae and invertebrate species to the national database, LiMPETS (Long Term Monitoring Program & Experiential Training for Students). Each fall student volunteers complete an intensive training course on the natural history of intertidal invertebrates and algae, identification of key species, rocky intertidal monitoring techniques, and history of the sanctuary. Students identify and count key invertebrate and algae species along two permanent transects and, using randomly determined points, within two permanent 200 m2 areas, in fall, winter, and late spring. Using data from the previous years, we will compare population densities, seasonal abundance and long-term population trends of key algal and invertebrate species, including Tegula funebralis, Anthopluera elegantissima, Cladophora sp. and Fucus sp.. Future analyses and investigations will include intertidal abiotic factors (including water temperature, pH and human foot-traffic) to enhance insights into the Duxbury Reef ecosystem, in particular, the high and mid-intertidal zones experiencing the greatest amount of human impacts.",

            "abstract": "The superposition of Mesozoic continental extension on convergent structure of the Appalachian mountain belt in the southeastern United States provides an opportunity to study the possible influence of reactivation tectonics on the break-up of Pangea. Major offset rift basins are located inboard of the continental margin beneath the Atlantic Coastal Plain (South Georgia, Riddleville), and Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) mafic dike swarms intrude rift strata and accreted terranes of the southern Appalachians. New P-to-S receiver function H-k stacking results from the 85-station SESAME array and EarthScope Transportable array provide additional constraints on Moho topography and average crustal Vp/Vs across the region. Previous crustal thickness estimates show that Moho depth gradually increases across strike of the Appalachians from ~37 km beneath the Carolina terrane to a maximum of ~55 km across the Blue Ridge Mountains. New crustal thickness estimates of 46-49 km in the southwest portion of the Inner Piedmont in Georgia also indicate significant along-strike complexity of Moho topography. Low Vp/Vs ratios (1.69-1.74) across a large region (~15,000 km2) spanning the Inner Piedmont and Carolina terrane indicate the crust has a relatively felsic composition, implying that bulk crustal modification by CAMP magmatism was volumetrically minor. Higher Vp/Vs ratios (1.75-1.80) across the Inner Piedmont, Blue Ridge, and Valley & Ridge correlate with regional crustal thickening (40-55 km), likely reflecting an increase in crustal root density unrelated to rift magmatism. Across the array, intra-crustal P-to-S conversions at 0.8-1.5 seconds (6-13 km) corresponding with the depth of the Appalachian décollement provide supporting evidence for the southeastward continuation of the detachment beneath the Carolina terrane and new constraints on the origin of reflectivity along the fault zone. This low-angle discontinuity between the Appalachian orogenic wedge and Grenville lower crust may have localized deformation and basin development within an upper crustal break-away during Mesozoic extension. Additional constraints on crustal thickness across the Atlantic Coastal Plain using the SsPmp phase will allow us to evaluate the extent of crustal thinning beneath rift basins in southern Georgia.",

            "abstract": "Updraft speeds of thermals have always been difficult to measure, despite the significant role they play in transporting pollutants and in cloud formation and precipitation. In this study, updraft speeds measured by Doppler lidar are found to be correlated with the observed planetary boundary layer (PBL) and surface properties in the buoyancy-driven PBL over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) site operated by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Program (ARM). Based on the found relationships, two approaches are proposed to estimate both maximum (Wmax ) and cloud base (Wb ) updraft speeds. The required input data are PBL height, 10-m horizontal wind speed, wind shear, surface skin temperature and 2-m air temperature. The application for remote sensing of updraft speeds in cloud-topped PBL from space was tested by using satellite-retrieved surface and cloud base temperature in combination with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Validation against lidar-measured updraft speeds indicates the feasibility of retrieving Wmax (root-mean-square error, RMSE, is 0.32 m/s) and Wb (RMSE is 0.42 m/s) for global coverage. This information is essential to advance the understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions. This method does not work for stable or mechanically-driven PBL.",

            "abstract": "Most immature crust must be refined to attain the composition of mature continental crust. This refining may take the form of weathering, delamination, or relamination. Although delamination and relamination both call upon gravity-driven separation of felsic rock into the crust and mafic rock into the mantle, delamination involves foundering of rock from the base of active magmatic arcs, whereas relamination involves the underplating/diapirism of subducted sediment, arc crust, and continent crust to the base of the crust in any convergence zone. Relamination may be more efficient than lower crustal foundering at generating large volumes of material with the major- and trace-element composition of continental crust, and may have operated rapidly enough to have refined the composition of the entire continental crust over the lifetime of Earth. If so, felsic rocks could form much of the lower crust, and the bulk continental crust may be more silica rich than generally considered. Seismic wavespeeds require that only ~10–20% of the lowermost 5–15 km of continental crust must be mafic; combined heat-flow and wavespeed constraints permit continental lower crust to have 50 to 65 wt% SiO2.",

            "abstract": "CO2 storage involves coupled processes that affect the migration and ultimate fate of injected CO2 over multiple length and time scales. Coupled thermal and mechanical processes may have implications for storage security, including thermally induced fracturing and loss of caprock integrity near the wellbore. This may occur when CO2 is injected at a different temperature from reservoir conditions, e.g. Snøhvit injection, potentially leading to large temperature, density and volume changes over space and time. In addition, thermally induced density changes impact plume buoyancy that may affect large-scale migration patterns in gravity-driven systems, e.g. Sleipner injection. This interaction becomes particularly important near the critical point. Therefore, thermal processes should be considered in order to correctly capture plume migration within the reservoir.\nA practical modeling approach for CO2 storage at the field scale is the vertical-equilibrium (VE) model, which solves partially integrated conservation equations for flow in two lateral dimensions. This class of models is well suited for strongly segregated flows. We extend the classical VE model to nonisothermal systems by integrating the heat transport equations, focusing on thermal processes that most impact the CO2 plume. The model allows for heating/cooling of the CO2 plume through heat exchange with the surrounding environment. The upscaling procedure assumes vertically constant temperature across the plume thickness for relatively thin plumes. Conduction across the plume boundaries, into the caprock above and brine below, is modeled by an analytical heat transfer function.\nAs a starting point, we investigate the validity of the simplifying assumptions and heat transfer boundary conditions for relatively simple systems. We find that the upscaled model compares well for systems where heat advection in the plume is the dominant heat transport mechanism. For high CO2 flux, improvements to the model can be made with more complex heat transfer functions. For lower CO2 flux, conduction within the surroundings becomes an important process that requires additional consideration. The results of this work demonstrate the potential for reduced models to advance our understanding of the impact of thermal processes in realistic storage systems.",

            "abstract": "The origin and source rock of alkali-rich and SiO2-undersatured magmas in the Earth`s upper mantle have been under debate for a long time. The garnet signature in rare earth element patterns of such magmas suggest a garnet-bearing source rock, which could be garnet lherzolite or garnet pyroxenite.\nPartial melting experiments were performed at 3 GPa and 1345-1445 °C in a piston-cylinder apparatus using mixtures of natural lherzolite with 0.4-0.7 wt% H2O and 0.4-0.7 wt% CO2 as starting materials. Different designs of AuPd capsules were used for melt extraction. Mineral and melt phases were analysed with electron microprobe and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.\nThe degree of partial melting in the experiments ranges from ~20% to ~4% and decreases with decreasing temperature and decreasing volatile content in the starting material. All samples contain olivine and orthopyroxene. Garnet is present in experiments performed below 1420 °C. The amount of clinopyroxene decreases with increasing degree of partial melting and volatile concentration in the starting material. Depending on the capsule design the melts quenched to glasses or to a mixture of quench crystals and residual glass.\nThe composition of the partial melts ranges from basalts through picrobasalts to foidites. The alkali concentration increases and the SiO2 concentration decreases with decreasing degree of partial melting and increasing volatile concentration in the starting material. The partial melts are similar in many aspects to alkali intraplate magmas (basanites to melilitites), although they are richer in MgO. Compositions closer to natural basanites could be obtained either at lower degree of melting (and lower volatile contents) or through olivine fractionation. Our results strongly suggests that.\nSiO2-undersaturated intraplate magmas can be generated by mantle melting of garnet-lherzolite in the presence of H2O and CO2 in the Earth`s upper mantle at 3 GPa (~100 km depth).",

            "abstract": "Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) occurs in minerals, metals, ice and impact on large scale mechanisms as seismic anisotropy, mechanical properties inside the Earth mantle, material forming and anisotropic flow in polar ice sheet, for instance. In this frame, ice can be considered as a model material due to a strong viscoplastic anisotropy and deformation heterogeneities, which are precursors of the recrystallization. During creep deformation at high temperature, DRX occurs from 1% strain and involves grain nucleation and grain boundary migration. As DRX induces an evolution of microstructure and texture, it strongly affects the mechanical behavior, and it is expected to modify the strain field at the grain and/or the sample scale. Creep test (σ=0.5-0.8 MPa) were performed at high temperature (T/Tf 0,98) on granular polycrystalline ice (grains size 1mm) and columnar polycrystalline ice (microstructure 2D 1/2 in plane grain size 10mm) up to 18 % strain. Columnar ice provides interesting feature as it contains only one grain through the thickness and the columns are parallel. Post-deformation texture analysis with an Automatic Ice Texture Analyzer (AITA) and with EBSD (Geoscience Montpellier) were used to investigate DRX impact on texture and microstructure, at different scales. With increasing strain texture evolves to a strong concentrated girdle with a preferential orientation of c-axis close to 35° from the compression axis. During the experiment, local strain field is measured on the surface of the sample by Digital Image Correlation (DIC) with a spatial resolution between 0.2 and 0.5 mm, and a strain resolution between 0.2% to 1%. Grain size being large, we obtain a relatively good intra-granular resolution of the strain field. Thanks to the 2D configuration of the columnar ice samples, we can superimpose the strain field measured by DIC. We will present an overview of the impact of DRX on the texture and microstructure, from the 3D configuration down to a close focus on a triple junction. In particular, we will provide original observations of strain-field evolution associated with the nucleation of new grains and subboundaries close to this triple junction. Associated with post-deformation analyses by AITA and EBSD, these observations enable to follow the strain redistribution due to the nucleation.",

            "abstract": "Accurate tree cover delineation is a useful instrument in the derivation of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) density estimates from Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery data. Numerous algorithms have been designed to perform tree cover delineation in high to coarse resolution satellite imagery, but most of them do not scale to terabytes of data, typical in these VHR datasets. In this paper, we present an automated probabilistic framework for the segmentation and classification of 1-m VHR data as obtained from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) for deriving tree cover estimates for the whole of Continental United States, using a High Performance Computing Architecture. The results from the classification and segmentation algorithms are then consolidated into a structured prediction framework using a discriminative undirected probabilistic graphical model based on Conditional Random Field (CRF), which helps in capturing the higher order contextual dependencies between neighboring pixels. Once the final probability maps are generated, the framework is updated and re-trained by incorporating expert knowledge through the relabeling of misclassified image patches. This leads to a significant improvement in the true positive rates and reduction in false positive rates. The tree cover maps were generated for the state of California, which covers a total of 11,095 NAIP tiles and spans a total geographical area of 163,696 sq. miles. Our framework produced correct detection rates of around 85% for fragmented forests and 70% for urban tree cover areas, with false positive rates lower than 3% for both regions. Comparative studies with the National Land Cover Data (NLCD) algorithm and the LiDAR high-resolution canopy height model shows the effectiveness of our algorithm in generating accurate high-resolution tree cover maps.",

The time has come to encourage cross-pollinization between earth science and computer science in dating paleorecords. This project addresses that need.\nThe CSciBox code, which is being developed by a team of computer scientists and geoscientists, is open source and freely available on github. The system employs modern database technology to store paleoclimate proxy data and analysis results in an easily accessible and searchable form. This makes it possible to do analysis on the whole core at once, in an interactive fashion, or to tailor the analysis to a subset of the core without loading the entire data file. CSciBox provides a number of 'components' that perform the common steps in age-model construction and evaluation: calibrations, reservoir-age correction, interpolations, statistics, and so on. The user employs these components via a graphical user interface (GUI) to go from raw data to finished age model in a single tool: e.g., an IntCal09 calibration of 14C data from a marine sediment core, followed by a piecewise-linear interpolation. CSciBox's GUI supports plotting of any measurement in the core against any other measurement, or against any of the variables in the calculation of the age model-with or without explicit error representations. Using the GUI, CSciBox's user can import a new calibration curve or other background data set and define a new module that employs that information. Users can also incorporate other software (e.g., Calib, BACON) as 'plug ins.' In the case of truly large data or significant computational effort, CSciBox is parallelizable across modern multicore processors, or clusters, or even the cloud.\nThe next generation of the CSciBox code, currently in the testing stages, includes an automated reasoning engine that supports a more-thorough exploration of plausible age models and cross-dating scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Doppler light detection and ranging (lidar) has been used for a few decades for the characterization of wind fields and turbulence structures in the atmosphere. More recently, due to the advances in fiber optic communications, all-fiber coherent Doppler lidars (CDL) have been developed and widely used as a primary instrument for probing the atmospheric boundary layer wind fields. Due to a variety of reasons, all-fiber CDLs have gradually replaced their counterparts benefiting from technologies other than fiber optics. Most CDLs suffer from a number of drawbacks inherent to their principle of operation. For instance, one of the main challenges in CDLs is extracting the signal information from noisy observations, which is common to most opto-electronic systems. Moreover, it is sometimes challenging to extract the sign of the measured radial velocity. Conventionally, CDLs have benefitted from an intermediate frequency (IF) heterodyne receiver architecture for the determination of the radial velocity. In such systems, either the transmitted or the local oscillator (LO) signal is shifted in frequency. Such architectures may suffer from increased noise and spurious effects due to the employment of additional active components, e.g., acousto-optic modulator (AOM), limited measurement bandwidth (BW), and a more sophisticated electronic front-end for signal detection. On the other hand, one of the main challenges in long-range (pulsed) CDLs is the limitations imposed on the pulse repetition rate (PRR) as well as the available transmit power. These restrictions are more significant in all-fiber pulsed CDLs in which Erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA) are employed for the amplification of the optical pulses. In this study, we propose an alternative reconfigurable opto-electronic front-end transceiver architecture in all-fiber CDLs where there is no compromise in the detection BW. Additionally, by benefiting from a polarization diversity architecture we show that both the PRR and transmit optical power can be doubled. Other benefits of the proposed system include, but not limited to, capturing additional information about the nature of aerosol particles, improvement of the signal-to-estimation-noise-ratio (SENR), faster scanning of the wind field, and improved measurement range.",

            "abstract": "The South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) is the largest component of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and its impact on global climate rivals that of the deep convection at the heart of the Western Pacific Warm Pool. Rapid glacial climate fluctuations, such as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) Events, would have triggered a reorganization of tropical systems such as the SPCZ, manifesting as significantly altered rainfall across the tropical south Pacific. However, a critical lack of high-resolution glacial records from this region means the dynamics of the SPCZ are largely unknown.\nWe present a decade-resolution, absolute-dated speleothem rainfall record from the Island of Niue in the southern Tropical Pacific spanning 25-45 ka. Sr, Mg, δ18O and δ13C variations show that Niue experienced large, rapid fluctuations in rainfall lasting up to 1200 years. Between 40 and 45 ka, these show a remarkable concordance with the timing, duration and shape of D-O events 9-11. Rapid warming in Greenland was accompanied by a sudden increase in rainfall in Niue, implying that the SPCZ was strongly coupled with climate in the high Northern latitudes. These changes are not consistent with a wholesale northward shift in the SPCZ, which would have resulted in drying in Niue, and instead imply that the SPCZ underwent a more complex reorganization, perhaps rotating around its western edge in a manner analogous to modern-day extreme ENSO events.\nThe speleothem record between 25-40 ka also shows large changes in rainfall, with D-O events identifiable. However, these changes are less well matched to Greenland, and include events not captured by the ice cores. It is clear that the SPCZ response to global climate change is complex: while it can closely couple with high-northern latitude climate for periods, this coupling may not be stationary with time. We speculate that this might result from changing precession, influencing which teleconnections dominate climate changes in the south tropical Pacific.",

            "abstract": "The enigmatic large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) identified by seismic tomography at the base of the Earth’s mantle have been proposed to be reservoirs of primordial mantle composition tapped by hot spot volcanism. The LLSVPs are characterized by anomalously low shear wave speed, VS, slightly elevated bulk sound speed, VB, and high density, ρ, in piles as thick as 1000 km above the core-mantle boundary. This combination of properties could be explained by a few percent dense melt, but the solidus of the lower mantle silicate and oxide assemblage may be too high to produce melt over the large extent of these regions. Iron-rich sulfur-bearing alloy may be molten at the conditions of the LLSVPs and ~1-2% of this component could satisfy both constraints on VS and ρ. An Fe alloy phase in the LLSVPs also has the potential to explain geochemical anomalies associated with hot spot volcanism, and its existence can be constrained by geochemical mass balance. Primordial noble gases such as 3He would be preferentially dissolved in Fe-rich melt rather than crystalline silicates. The reconstructed abundances of the moderately siderophile/chalcophile elements S, Cu and Pb in iron-alloy-bearing LLSVPs do not exceed predicted losses from volatilization, though this depends on the S-content of the alloy. The alloy phase would also be expected to incorporate W, and W isotope anomalies associated with hot spots are thus expected to have important implications for the timing of LLSVP formation.\nWe have developed a model, via CIDER-2014, for the origin and properties of LLSVPs incorporating geochemistry, mineral physics, and fluid dynamic constraints on the generation, capture, and thermoelastic properties of Fe-rich melt droplets. The solidification of a basal magma ocean would produce both solid silicates and metallic melt. The bulk of the alloy generated by this process would sink to merge with the core. However, once the density of the remnant liquid exceeds that of the solid, newly-formed crystals floating at the crystallization front may trap droplets of Fe-rich melt as inclusions or at grain boundaries. We find that a mixture of mantle silicates and ~1-2% molten Fe-rich droplets matches constraints on density and seismic velocities and could host the hidden 3He and other elements of the primordial mantle reservoir.",

            "abstract": "The recent devastating tsunamis having occurred during the last decades have highlighted the essential necessity to deploy operationnal warning systems and educate coastal populations. This could not be prepared correctly without a minimum knowledge about the tsunami history. That is the case of the Lesser Antilles islands, where a few handfuls of tsunamis have been reported over the past 5 centuries, some of them leading to notable destructions and inundations. But the lack of accurate details for most of the historical tsunamis and the limited period during which we could find written information represents an important problem for tsunami hazard assessment in this region. Thus, it is of major necessity to try to find other evidences of past tsunamis by looking for sedimentary deposits. Unfortunately, island tropical environments do not seem to be the best places to keep such deposits burried. In fact, heavy rainfalls, storms, and all other phenomena leading to coastal erosion, and associated to human activities such as intensive sugarcane cultivation in coastal flat lands, could caused the loss of potential tsunami deposits. Lots of places have been accurately investigated within the Lesser Antilles (from Sainte-Lucia to the British Virgin Islands) the last 3 years and nothing convincing has been found. That is when archeaological investigations excavated a 8-cm thick sandy and shelly layer in downtown Fort-de-France (Martinique), wedged between two well-identified layers of human origin (Fig. 1), that we found new hope: this sandy layer has been quickly attributed without any doubt to the 1755 tsunami, using on one hand the information provided by historical reports of the construction sites, and on the other hand by numerical modeling of the tsunami (wave heights, velocity fields, etc.) showing the ability of this transoceanic tsunami to wrap around the island after ~7 hours of propagation, enter Fort-de-France's Bay with enough energy to carry sediments, and inundate it. Helping with this discovery, we conclude that tsunami markers could have been simply buried and preserved by human earthmoving, leveling and other building activities. It also shows how a collaborative research involving geology and archaeology could chart a new course to greatly improve our tsunami databases.",

It provides precise astronomical azimuths within 15 minutes of observation time at night. Furthermore, observations in daytime conditions are a challenging requirement in practice of Astro-geodetic azimuth determination. In order to perform daylight measurements, the QDAEDALUS system has been improved by allowing precise azimuth measurements to Sun, Moon, and Planets in daylight conditions by expanding the processing software with precise solar, lunar, and planetary ephemerides. With such functionality the system has a unique capability to measure astronomical azimuths with an accuracy of 0.3-0.5 arcsecs in normal daylight conditions within 20 to 25 minutes of measurement time.",

            "abstract": "Volcanoes generate infrasound from incidental rock fall and from rock fall directly associated with eruptions. This study demonstrates that arrays of infrasound microphones are capable of surveillance and quantification of rock fall events, including their size, location, velocity and frequency of occurrence. The study performed at Volcan Santiaguito (Guatemala) in January 2014 made use of a three element infrasound array with 30 m aperture deployed ~500 m from the active vent and ~300 m from the slide path where numerous rock falls descend. Rock fall events were detected on average 5 to 10 times per hour and were easily distinguishable from vent activity (e.g., explosions) by their dynamic back azimuth projection. As blocks tumbled down the southwest flanks of Santiaguito, sources were tracked across an azimuthal range of nearly 30 degrees, consistent with the dome's slope. Back azimuths, determined with a [progressive] multichannel cross correlation technique, are projected to the volcano’s steep flanks and are used to precisely locate the source of infrasound (i.e., rocks impacting on the volcano slopes) and their velocity (10-30 m/s). Typical signals last about one minute and are characterized by cigar-shaped tremor envelopes with a predominance of energy above ~5 Hz this spectral content contrasts with Santiaguito eruption infrasound, which is peaked at ~1 Hz. Synchronous video records of the responsible rock fall confirm position and velocity and illustrate that even the smallest rock falls (estimated block size of ~1 m) are capable of producing a traceable signal. This study is a testament to the capabilities of infrasound array remote sensing for detecting volcanic unrest in the form of rock fall, which is common at most active silicic domes.",

            "abstract": "The Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) uses an airborne LiDAR system to measure basin-wide snow depth with cm-scale accuracy at ~1m spatial resolution. This is accomplished by creating a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) over snow-free terrain in the summer, then repeating the flights again when the terrain is snow-covered and subtracting the elevations. Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) is then calculated by incorporating modeled snow density estimates, and when combined with coincident spectrometer albedo measurements, informs distributed hydrologic modeling and runoff prediction. This method provides SWE estimates of unprecedented accuracy and extent compared to traditional snow surveys and towers, and 24hr latency data products through the ASO processing pipeline using Apache Tika and OODT software. The timely ASO outputs support operational decision making by water/dam operators for optimal water management.\nThe water-resource snowpack in the western US lies in remote mountainous terrain, spanning large areas containing steep faces at all aspects, often amongst tree canopy. This extreme terrain presents unusual challenges for LiDAR, and requires high altitude flights to achieve wide area coverage, high point density to capture small terrain features, and the ability to capture all slope aspects without shadowing. These challenges were met by the new state-of-the-art Riegl LMS-Q1560 LiDAR system, which incorporates two independent laser channels and a single rotating mirror. Both lasers and mirror are designed to provide forward, backward, and nadir look capability, which minimizes shadowing and ensures data capture even on very steep slopes. The system is capable of logging more than 10 simultaneous pulses in the air, which allows data collection at extremely high resolution while maintaining very high altitude which reduces complete region acquisition time significantly, and allows data collection over terrain with extreme elevation variation. Our experience to-date includes acquisition of data over terrain relief of more than 3500m, and ranges of up to 6000m in a single swath. We present data acquired during spring of 2013 and 2014 in western Colorado and the central Sierra Nevada, which demonstrates the capability of the new LiDAR technology and shows basin-wide measured snow depth and SWE results.",

The age model is based on the 405 kyr Milankovich climate cycle and pegging the sequence to high precision U-Pb dating of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) at 201.6 to 200.9 Ma [Blackburn+2013 Science], the initiation of which is practically coincident with the end-Triassic extinction level (formerly set to 202 Ma) and within a climatic precession cycle after magnetochron E23r. The resulting astrochronostratigraphic polarity time scale (APTS) has 66 Poisson-distributed polarity intervals from chrons E8r (~225 Ma) to H27n (~199 Ma) with a constant sediment-accumulation rate extrapolation to chron E1r (~233 Ma). Magnetostratigraphic correlations from the most complete and usually the thickest Tethyan marine sections suggest that the Carnian/Norian boundary occurs within ~E7n [Channell+2003 PPP; Muttoni+2004 GSAB] at an APTS age of 227.5 Ma and for the Norian/Rhaetian boundary anywhere from E16n [Husing+2011 EPSL] at ~210.5 Ma to E20r [Maron+2014 Geology] at ~205.4 Ma depending on choice of conodont taxa, whereas the Hettangian/Sinemurian boundary can be placed at ~199.5 Ma within the marine equivalent of H25r [Husing+2014 EPSL]. These APTS ages are in substantive agreement with available high-precision dates in marine strata for the late Carnian [231 Ma: Furin+2006 Geology], latest Norian [205.5 Ma: Wotslaw+2014 Geology], and the boundaries of the Triassic/Jurassic [201.3 Ma: Guex+2012 PPP] and the Hettangian/Sinemurian [199.5 Ma: Schaltegger+2008 EPSL]. Carnian magnetostratigraphy needs to be improved but attempts to make a composite magnetostratigraphic sequence for the Late Triassic by merging disparate marine and non-marine records have not produced a clearer signal. The Newark-Hartford APTS already provides a framework for long-distance correlation and dating, for example, the timing of dinosaur dispersal across Pangea [Kent+2014 PNAS].",

            "abstract": "The study of ecosystem properties and processes through remote sensing allows ecological questions to be answered more efficiently for large geographical expanses than field work alone, especially in areas that are relatively inaccessible. These properties and processes are often studied at coarse spatial scales with multispectral data; however, the use of hyperspectral data to ask plant community and species-level questions is still a developing field. Many applications, such as understanding the influence of disturbances and assessing management strategies, need finer-scale information than is currently available using multispectral data. In this study, we used hyperspectral data to examine vegetation community properties in preparation for addressing these finer-scale questions. Specifically, we examined the ability to assess vegetation composition and diversity using ground-level hyperspectral data for early successional and other non-forested fields in north-central Virginia. Twelve 5m by 5m plots were established at which a vegetation survey was conducted at the ground, understory, and canopy levels at 0.5m intervals. We additionally collected twelve spectra with approximately 1m footprints at each plot. We then ran ordinations to assess clustering of plots by similarity in species compositions and assessed the spectral bands most strongly correlated with clustering. We found that plots do cluster by species composition, but the most influential wavelengths varied by year of data collection. In 2012, the most influential bands were in the near-infrared plateau region followed by some influence from the red region. The most influential bands in 2014 were in the blue-green and red regions. The correlations between species diversity and spectral diversity also differed by year; however, when an outlier was removed from each of the years, there was a weak positive correlation between species diversity and spectral diversity during both years. These results are promising in that they give us a glimpse into the potential to use hyperspectral data to assess fine-scale ecosystem properties and processes; these techniques may in the future be used to study the role of disturbance and effectiveness of management practices across landscapes.",

            "abstract": "There is evidence of warming over recent decades in most regions of North America (NA) that affects ecosystem productivity and the past decade has been the warmest since instrumental records of global surface temperatures began. In this study, we examined the spatial and temporal variability and trends of warming across NA using climate data from the North America Regional Reanalysis (NARR) from 1979 to 2010 with a 3-hourly time-step and 0.250 x 0.250 spatial resolution as part of the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP). A comprehensive mathematical process model, ecosys was used to simulate impacts of this variability in warming on gross primary productivity (GPP). In a test of model results, annual GPP modeled for pixels which corresponded to the locations of 25 eddy covariance towers correlated well (R2=0.76) with annual GPP derived from the flux towers in 2005. At the continental scale long-term (2000 - 2010) annual average modeled GPP for NA correlated well (geographically weighed regression R2 = 0.8) with MODIS GPP, demonstrating close similarities in spatial patterns. Results from the NARR indicated that most areas of NA, particularly high latitude regions, have experienced warming but changes in precipitation vary spatially over the last three decades. GPP modeled in most areas with lower mean annual air temperature (Ta), such as those in boreal climate zones, increased due to early spring and late autumn warming observed in NARR. However modeled GPP declined in most southwestern regions of NA, due to water stress from rising Ta and declining precipitation. Overall, GPP modeled across NA had a positive trend of +0.025 P g C yr-1 with a range of -1.16 to 0.87 P g C yr-1 from the long-term mean. Interannual variability of GPP was the greatest in southwest of US and part of the Great Plains, which could be as a result of frequent El Niño–Southern Oscillation' (ENSO) events that led to major droughts.",

            "abstract": "I discuss the distribution of very low-TiO2 basaltic lava in the ocean basins, which petrologic and geologic evidence suggests originated from refractory mantle that was emplaced during continental rifting. Glass compositions have TiO2 ~0.3-0.8%, Na2O <2% and MgO ~8-9%, similar to some lava (e.g., boninite) in island arcs and ophiolites. Not well known is that it is a widespread component or actual eruptive at spreading ridges, some large igneous provinces (LIPs), and at volcanic rifted margins. It is an end component of the global MORB array. Although at high MgO it is rare, differentiates with higher TiO2 are regionally important. The most typical occurrence in usual MORB is as melt inclusions in calcic plagioclase phenocrysts (>An88), where its influence can also be inferred from low-TiO2 clinopyroxene. The crystals are incorporated into more typical MORB by magma mixing. In some cases, most of the global array can be inferred from crystallization histories of single samples. At ridges, low-TiO2 basalts approach calcic boninite in composition, and have similar mineralogy including presence of both low-Ca and high-Ca pyroxene. Type localities are basalt from DSDP Site 236 in the Indian Ocean and a dredge haul from the Danger Island Trough at Manihiki Plateau, a fragment of a large igneous province (LIP) in the SW Pacific. A third location is Padloping Island in the Labrador Sea, a part of the North Atlantic Igneous Province, where mixing relations in picrites entail a low-TiO2 component similar to boninite. This component is likely the source of forsteritic olivine (>Fo91) in these rocks and did not require either high eruptive or potential temperatures when such olivine crystallized. As with boninite, low-TiO2 magma in ridge settings is likely derived from a refractory (harzburgitic) and probably somewhat hydrous mantle source by extents of melting and temperatures comparable to those of typical MORB extracted from more fertile peridotite. Refractory mantle in oceanic settings probably resulted from incorporation of ancient mantle that was originally beneath island arcs or continental crust, but which was added to oceanic mantle by delamination or major stoping that occurred while continents were rifted. That mantle has geochemical attributes reflective of ancient melting events in the history of the planet.",

            "abstract": "The western Hellenic Arc is a well known place of active interplate deformation, where the convergence motion vector is perpendicular to the subduction front. On 12 October 2013 this area was hit by a strong (Mw=6.7) earthquake, occurred on a thrust fault onto the coupled part of the overriding and descending plates, with the compression axis being oriented in the direction of plate convergence. This was the first strong (M>6.0) event to have occurred onto this segment of the descending slab, which has accommodated the largest (M8.3) known earthquake in the Mediterranean area, and to be recorded by the Hellenic Unified Seismological Network (HUSN) that has been considerably improved in the last five years. The first 2–days relocated seismicity shows activation of the upper part of the descending slab, downdip of the plate interface and forming a relatively narrow aftershock area on map view. The less densely visited by aftershocks area, where the main shock is also encompassed, is considered as the high–slip area along the downdip portion of the subducting plane. Dense concentration of the intraslab aftershocks are probably due to the increase of static stress generated by the main shock. A spectacular feature of the aftershock activity concerns the lateral extension of the slipped area, which appears very sharply defined. This provides evidence on localized coupling and aseismically creeping areas, explaining the low coupling ratio in the Hellenic Arc, as it derives from comparison between relative plate motion and seismic energy release. Elucidating the issue of how far the associated large–slip zone might be extended along the plate interface during the main rupture is crucial in assessing future earthquake hazards from subduction events in the study area.\nThis research has been co–funded by the European Union (European Social Fund) and Greek national resources under the framework of the “THALES Program: SEISMO FEAR HELLARC” project.",

            "abstract": "A scientific career is often more than a 9-to-5 commitment, both in terms of time and passion. An important factor that fuels this passion is engaging with the community on many levels. In the history of education and professional development, there are numerous studies that emphasis the importance of surrounding groups and like-minded peers in one’s professional and personal development in a less constrained environment. In our experience, in modern days where students are surrounded with too much information and yet too little clear signal, the idea of mentor and advisor can no longer limit to one or two people. We strongly feel it is imperative to have the opportunity to share expertise on scientific issues, career options, develop presenting and writing skills, participate in professional volunteer activities with alike and advanced colleagues, share future opportunities, and successfully navigating life both inside and outside of graduate school in a relaxed environment. Most of the professional scientific and engineering communities put a lot of effort to create and maintain professional groups in masters and Ph.D. levels but the dynamics within these groups prove it to be very different and it is challenging to maintain both momentum and productivity. Authors of this report would present their experience in creating, running and maintaining various student groups in the discipline of physics, astronomy, planetary science, hydrology, and optical engineering in US, Europe and Middle East. The common factors and differences based on the supportive community, location, and the educational level would be discussed. An outline of potential helpful factors within the academic institutes and professional communities would be presented based on the examination on various successful and unsuccessful experiences.",

            "abstract": "Texas contains several distinct tectonic provinces, the Laurentia craton, the Ouachita belt, and the Gulf coastal plain. Although numerous geophysical experiments have been conducted in Texas for petroleum exploration, the lithosphere structure of Texas has not been well studied. We present here the Texas-wide shear wave structure using seismic ambient noise data recorded at 87 stations from the Transportable Array of the USArray between March 2010 and February 2011. Rayleigh wave phase velocities between pairs of stations are obtained by cross-correlating long ambient noise sequences and are used to develop phase velocity maps from 6 to 40 s. These measured phase velocities are used to construct 1-D and 3-D shear wave velocity models, which consist of four crust layers and one upper mantle layer. Shear wave velocity maps reveal a close correlation with major geological features. From the surface to 25 km depth, Positive anomalies coincide with the Laurentia craton, and negative anomalies coincide with the continental margin. The boundary of positive-negative anomaly perfectly matches the Ouachita belt. The Llano Uplift is imaged as the highest velocity through the mid-crust because the igneous rock forming the uplift has faster seismic velocity than the normal continental crust. Similarly, three small high-velocity areas exist beneath the Waco Uplift, Devils River Uplift, and Benton Uplift, even though surface geological traces are absent in these areas. The lowest velocity at the shallow crust appears in northeastern and southeastern Texas separated by the San Marcos Arch, correlating with thick sediment layers. An exceptional low velocity is imaged in southernmost Texas in the lower crust and upper mantle, probably caused by subducted wet oceanic crust before the rifting in the Gulf of Mexico. In the uppermost mantle, positive shear wave anomalies extend southeastward from the Ouachita belt to the Gulf coast, likely evidencing the subducted oceanic lithosphere during the Ouachita orogeny. This observation need be further tested using long period surface wave dispersions from earthquakes, which help to improve model resolution in the upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "Warming in the Arctic has resulted in changes in the distribution and composition of tundra vegetation in addition to a lengthening of the growing season. Past studies have mapped tundra vegetation at relatively coarse spatial scales; however, vegetation changes in the Arctic are occurring at spatial scales within a few meters. This research uses hyperspectral remote sensing data to differentiate among four vegetation communities at Ivotuk, Alaska (68.49°N, 155.74°W). Ivotuk is located on the North Slope, and is dominated by four plant communities including moist acidic tundra (MAT), moist nonacidic tundra (MNT), mossy tussock tundra (MT), and shrub tundra (ST). Hand-held hyperspectral data were collected during the 1999 growing season (5 June-27 August) at biweekly intervals using narrow, ~1.42 nm wavebands. Only wavebands within 400-1060 nm were used in analysis. Two sets of comparisons were conducted using stepwise discriminant analysis: 1) MNT and ST, and 2) all four tundra plant communities. MNT and ST classification accuracy ranged from 91.3-100%, with 100% classification and cross-validated accuracy occurring on 27 July. Classification accuracy for the overall growing season was 97.9% for MNT and 98.1% for ST. The stepwise function indicated 18 significant bands including 8 near infrared (NIR) and 4 blue bands. MAT, MNT, MT, and ST classification accuracy ranged from 58-100%, with greatest classification accuracy (100%) also occurring during peak growing season on 27 July. Overall classification accuracy for the growing season was 97.6% for MNT, 92% for MT, 84% for ST, and 70.8% for MAT. There were 14 significant bands including 6 NIR and 3 blue bands. The results presented here demonstrate that discriminant analysis can be useful in distinguishing among the dominant tundra vegetation communities in the Arctic, and can potentially help us to better understand and monitor arctic vegetation and ecosystem responses to environmental changes.",

            "abstract": "Strong variation of multiphase fluid properties and conduit geometry with depth are defining characteristics of magmatic conduits. This background stratification has important implications for the excitation and propagation of waves through conduits, and the coupling of these fluid motions to the surroundings to produce seismic and infrasonic radiation. We develop a spectral and time domain numerical method to study perturbations to a basaltic magmastatic column, including non-equilibrium degassing and conduit width changes with depth, with a free top surface to model an active lava lake. We show that resonant modes of such a conduit to first order reflect the total magma water content, which sets the depth of volatile exsolution. Above the exsolution depth, wave propagation through the multiphase fluid is strongly dispersive, due to gas exsolution effects at periods greater than the time scale for exsolution and gravitational restoring forces at wavelengths greater than the scale height. We also find a class of nonpropagating and highly attenuated modes. Due to background stratification, wave modes are localized spatially around the depth of exsolution. Below this depth, waves propagate at the pure fluid sound speed, which may be nearly two orders of magnitude faster than the multiphase sound speed.\nWe have also extended our model to couple waves in conduits to dikes and sills branching off of the conduit. This coupled model matches fluid pressure at the fracture mouth and accounts for mass exchange between the fracture and the conduit. It can be used to investigate how waves propagating down the conduit can excite resonant oscillation of dikes and sills as has been inferred in, for example, the shallow plumbing system at Kilauea, HI, where Very Long Period (VLP) seismic signals have been commonly although episodically observed since 2007. These signals commonly have source depths around 1 km depths, where source mechanisms suggest a sill intersects the conduit, but likely are triggered near the surface from some combination of degassing or rockfall that excites conduit resonant modes. We will explore the importance both of this coupled sill-conduit geometry, and of conduit modes localized at the water exsolution depth, on the seismic wave field generated by near surface fluid excitation of a magmastatic column.",

            "abstract": "The pitch angle distribution (PAD) of energetic electrons in the slot region and inner radiation belt received little attention in the past decades due to the lack of quality measurements. Using the state-of-art pitch-angle-resolved data from the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) instrument onboard the Van Allen Probes, a detailed analysis of 100s keV electron PADs below L =4 is performed, in which the PADs is categorized into three types: normal (flux peaking at 90°), cap (exceedingly peaking narrowly around 90°) and 90°-minimum (lower flux at 90°) PADs. By examining the characteristics of the PADs of 460 keV electrons for over a year, we find that the 90°-minimum PADs are generally present in the inner belt (L<2), while normal PADs dominate at L~3.5-4. In the region between, 90°-minimum PADs dominate during injection times and normal PADs dominate during quiet times. Cap PADs appear mostly at the decay phase of storms in the slot region and are likely caused by the pitch angle scattering of hiss waves. Fitting the normal PADs into sinnα form, the parameter n is much higher below L=3 than that in the outer belt and relatively constant in the inner belt but changes significantly in the slot region (2<L<3) during injection times. As for the 90°-minimum PADs, by performing a detailed case study, we find in the slot region this type of PAD is likely caused by chorus wave heating, but this mechanism can hardly explain the formation of 90°-minimum PADs at the center of inner belt. These new and compelling observations, made possible by the high-quality measurements of MagEIS, present a challenge for the wave modelers, and future work is still needed to fully understand them.",

The passive microwave (PM) measurements have been widely used and invested in order to obtain information about snowpack properties. In this paper, we utilize a snow data assimilation system to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Yampa River basin in the Colorado Rockies within the NASA Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) area of 2002-2003. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) observations were used. Forcing data were derived from the North American Land Data Assimilation v2 (NLDAS-2) dataset. Also, the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) was used to convert the snow state variables to brightness temperatures. The ensemble Kalman filter was directly employed to assimilate PM brightness temperature data into a land surface model snow scheme. Assimilation results are compared with SNOTEL and snow course observations.",

            "abstract": "This study contributes to the discussions on the future of the Amazon rainforest under a projected warmer-drier climate from the perspectives of land hydrology. Using IPCC HadGEM2-ES simulations of the present and future Amazon climate to drive a land hydrology model that accounts for groundwater constraint on land drainage, we assess potential hydrologic changes in soil water, evapotranspiration (ET), water table depth, and river discharge, assuming unchanged vegetation. We ask: how will ET regimes shift at the end of the 21st century, and will the groundwater help buffer the anticipated water stress in some places-times? We conducted four 10yr model simulations, at the end of 20th and 21st century, with and without the groundwater. Our model results suggest that, first, over the western and central Amazon, ET will increase due to increased potential evapotranspiration (PET) with warmer temperatures, despite a decrease in soil water; that is, ET will remain atmosphere or demand-limited. Second, in the eastern Amazon dry season, ET will decrease in response to decreasing soil water, despite increasing PET demand; that is, ET in these regions-seasons will remain or become more soil water or supply-limited. Third, the area of water-limited regions will likely expand in the eastern Amazonia, with the dry season, as indicated by soil water store, even drier and longer. Fourth, river discharge will be significantly reduced over the entire Amazon but particularly so in the southeastern Amazon. By contrasting model results with and without the groundwater, we found that the slow soil drainage constrained by a shallow groundwater can buffer soil water stress, particularly in southeastern Amazon dry season. Our model suggests that, if the groundwater buffering effect is accounted for, the future Amazon water stress may be less than projected by most climate models.",

            "abstract": "Recent seismicity and fault plane solutions of earthquakes that occurred along the Hellenic Arc–Trench system are engaged for approximating the geometry of the subducted oceanic plate. Seismicity and focal mechanisms confirm the gentle subduction (~15o–20o) of the oceanic crust reaching a depth of 20 km at a distance of 100 km from the trench. The slab is then bending at larger angles, and in particular at ~45o up to the depth of 80 km and at ~65o up to the depth of 180 km, when seismicity ceased. This geometry of the slab is shown in a bunch of cross sections normal to the convergence strike, up to ~25o (east Crete Island). To the east the sparse inslab seismicity reveals an almost vertical dipping of the lower part (from 80 km downdip) of the descending slab. The slab interface that accommodates hazardous earthquakes is clearly nonplanar with the main seismic moment release taking place on its up–dip side. The fore–arc, upper plate seismicity, is remarkably low in comparison with both subduction and back arc seismicity, and confined inside a seismogenic layer having a width not exceeding the 20km. Offshore seismicity is spatially variable forming distinctive streaks thus revealing that parts of the oceanic crust are probably slipped aseismically. This observation along with the fact that coupling in the Hellenic arc is only about a tenth of the plate motion, imply the presence of areas of lower and higher coupling across the subduction interface. Areas of high coupling imply areas of the slab interface subjected to high normal forces and correlate with earthquake asperities. Although asperity distributions vary substantially through time, identification of such characteristics in the seismogenesis can have a significant impact in the seismic hazard assessment.\nThis research has been co–funded by the European Union (European Social Fund) and Greek national resources under the framework of the “THALES Program: SEISMO FEAR HELLARC” project.",

            "abstract": "Reliable topographic information is critical to many applications in the riverine sciences. Quantifying morphologic change, modeling flow and sediment transport, and assessing aquatic habitat all require accurate, spatially distributed measurements of bed elevation. Remote sensing has emerged as a powerful tool for acquiring such data, but the capabilities and limitations associated with various remote sensing techniques must be evaluated systematically. In this study, we assessed the potential of hyperspectral imaging and bathymetric LiDAR for measuring channel morphology across a range of conditions in two distinct field sites: the clear-flowing Snake River in Grand Teton National Park and the confluence of the Blue and Colorado Rivers in north-central Colorado, USA. Field measurements of water column optical properties highlighted differences among these streams, including the highly turbid Muddy Creek also entering the Colorado, and enabled theoretical calculations of bathymetric precision (smallest detectable change in depth) and dynamic range (maximum detectable depth). Hyperspectral imaging can yield more precise depth estimates in shallow, clear water but bathymetric LiDAR could provide more consistent performance across a broader range of depths. Spectrally-based depth retrieval was highly accurate on the Snake River but less reliable in the more complex confluence setting. Stratification of the Blue/Colorado site into clear and turbid subsets did not improve depth retrieval performance. To obtain bed elevations, image-derived depth estimates were subtracted from water surface elevations derived from near-infrared LiDAR acquired at the same time as the hyperspectral images. For the water-penetrating green LiDAR, bed elevations were inferred from laser waveforms. On the Snake River, hyperspectral imaging resulted in smaller mean and root mean square errors than bathymetric LiDAR, but at the Blue/Colorado site the optical approach was subject to a shallow bias not evident in the LiDAR. Our results can help prospective users to select appropriate instrumentation for their study objectives and site characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Global High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) L2p products are available from many different satellite-based instruments. Assimilation and fusion of SSTs from multiple sources requires knowledge of the expected accuracy and uncertainly of a retrieval and confidence that a pixel is within the uncertainty required by the application. The GHRSST L2p files provide quality levels with labels such as “worst”, “acceptable”, or “best.” But what do these levels actually mean to a user in terms of uncertainty and bias? Does “acceptable” have the same meaning for data providers and users? Currently there is no standard or consensus for the accuracy requirement of a quality level. GHRSST providers rely on matchup databases of satellite and in situ SSTs to provide Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES). The GHRSST L2P MODIS SSES values currently are stored in a 6-dimensional Look Up Table (LUT) – often referred to as a hypercube. This LUT lists uncertainties stratified by quality level, season, latitude, viewing geometry, surface temperature, and “wet” or “dry” atmospheres. While this approach is more useful than a single aggregate SSES estimate, the coarse nature of the hypercube bins produces obvious discontinuities in uncertainty fields at some bin boundaries when geographically mapped. In reality, the SSES should vary more smoothly as a function of different combinations of factors influencing the accuracy of retrievals. We will present ongoing efforts to model the SST bias and uncertainty as a smooth function of some of the dimensions of the SSES hypercube. Additionally, we aim to classify pixels into quality categories with explicitly defined ranges of bias and uncertainty. The ultimate goal is to develop methods that could be deployed across multiple sensors to establish a standard for objective, quantitative definitions of SST retrieval quality.",

            "abstract": "The shell tectonic model assumes that 180 million years ago an expanding earth of radius 3370 km is entirely covered by a granitic crust which has today's volume. As growth of core and mantle continues, a relatively cool crust progressively breaks into northern and southern shells separated by a global oceanic ridge system (GORS) which, from its inception, has today's geographic coordinates. The ridge system, whose Pacific and Indian axes are related by a rotational symmetry of 180 degrees, is assumed to reflect internal forces which produce volume increase. From initial to final state the GORS maintains this symmetry.As mantle volume increases and the global oceanic ridge axis grows radially outward from the earth's center, northern and southern shells progressively separate symmetrically from ridge axes. Rifts formed by this separation are filled by new ocean crust which is symmetrical about ridge axes, and today's deep ocean basins are born. No old ocean crust or lithosphere is returned to the mantle.\nEarly in shell separation seas, which previously lie upon old granitic crust, drain into rift basins. During runoff and before basins fill with water canyons are excavated not only in continental slopes but also possibly in ocean floors. In some basins where evaporation exceeds inflow of water salt deposits are formed.\nIn the initial state at 180 Ma shared shell boundaries are those defined by the GORS and the fit is exact. Shell deformation from this state to observed, present day boundaries defined by continental slopes is described by a set of linear transformations. Because latitudes and longitudes of the GORS are invariant, calculations are performed in today's geographic coordinate system. The accuracy with which observed continental shapes and the distribution of new ocean are modelled is dependent on the number of points which describe shell geometry and by computing resources.",

Understanding of contaminant fate and the potential for natural attenuation can help protect aquatic resources.\nIn this study, the fate of chlorobenzene (MCB) and benzene was investigated in a contaminated canal sediment field site located in New Jersey, USA. Compound Specific Isotope Analysis (CSIA) was applied to sediment pore water samples collected with a peeper at high spatial resolution (3 cm) across the sediment – surface water interface (SWI). Samples were collected at three locations in canal sediments, all of which exhibited reducing redox conditions.\nThe largest concentrations were observed in the bottommost portions of the sediment profile, with concentrations ranging from 300 to 2000 µg/L for MCB, and 16 to 180 µg/L for benzene. Conversely, concentrations were below detection limit in the surface water and in the top 6 cm of the sediment.\nIn the zones of highest MCB concentrations, the δ13C values were -26.4 (location C) and -21.9 ‰ (location F), and became progressively more enriched in 13C while concentrations decreased, reaching -23.9 (at 12 cm below the SWI, location C) and -18.4 ‰ (at 16.5 cm below SWI, location F). Benzene was only detected in the bottom 6 cm of the sediment profiles. Benzene δ13C values were -27 (bottommost, i.e., 24 cm deep) to -29.7 ‰ (18 cm deep), in location C. Such significant isotopic enrichments in 13C (2.5 to 3.5 ‰) correlated with MCB and benzene concentration decrease are suggestive of in situ biodegradation.\nIn addition, benzene δ13C values were systematically more depleted in 13C than MCB, suggesting that benzene found in these zones was likely produced from MCB via reductive dechlorination.\nThis study combined for the first time CSIA with high spatial sampling resolution in surface water sediments. This setup enabled not only detection of contaminant loss across the SWI, but additional lines of evidence that among other mass dispersal processes, in situ biodegradation plays a significant role in contaminant attenuation.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is a key element of the human-induced land use land cover change (LULCC) that is influenced by climate and can potentially influence regional climate. Temperature and precipitation directly impact the crop yield (by controlling photosynthesis, respiration and other physiological processes) that then affects agricultural land use pattern. In feedback, the resulting changes in land use and land cover play an important role to determine the direction and magnitude of global, regional and local climate change by altering Earth’s radiative equilibrium. The assessment of future agricultural land use is, therefore, of great importance in climate change study. In this study, we develop a prototype land use projection model and, using this model, project the changes to land use pattern and future land cover map accounting for climate-induced yield changes for major crops in West Africa. Among the inputs to the land use projection model are crop yield changes simulated by the crop model DSSAT, driven with the climate forcing data from the regional climate model RegCM4.3.4-CLM4.5, which features a projected decrease of future mean crop yield and increase of inter-annual variability. Another input to the land use projection model is the projected changes of food demand in the future. In a so-called “dumb-farmer scenario” without any adaptation, the combined effect of decrease in crop yield and increase in food demand will lead to a significant increase in agricultural land use in future years accompanied by a decrease in forest and grass area. Human adaptation through land use optimization in an effort to minimize agricultural expansion is found to have little impact on the overall areas of agricultural land use. While the choice of the General Circulation Model (GCM) to derive initial and boundary conditions for the regional climate model can be a source of uncertainty in projecting the future LULCC, results from sensitivity experiments indicate that the changes in land use pattern are robust.",

            "abstract": "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are widely used to evaluate model probability for quantifying model uncertainty. In a general procedure, MCMC simulations are first conducted for each individual model, and MCMC parameter samples are then used to approximate marginal likelihood of the model by calculating the geometric mean of the joint likelihood of the model and its parameters. It has been found the method of evaluating geometric mean suffers from the numerical problem of low convergence rate. A simple test case shows that even millions of MCMC samples are insufficient to yield accurate estimation of the marginal likelihood. To resolve this problem, a thermodynamic method is used to have multiple MCMC runs with different values of a heating coefficient between zero and one. When the heating coefficient is zero, the MCMC run is equivalent to a random walk MC in the prior parameter space; when the heating coefficient is one, the MCMC run is the conventional one. For a simple case with analytical form of the marginal likelihood, the thermodynamic method yields more accurate estimate than the method of using geometric mean. This is also demonstrated for a case of groundwater modeling with consideration of four alternative models postulated based on different conceptualization of a confining layer. This groundwater example shows that model probabilities estimated using the thermodynamic method are more reasonable than those obtained using the geometric method. The thermodynamic method is general, and can be used for a wide range of environmental problem for model uncertainty quantification.",

            "abstract": "During the first billion years of the Sun’s history, the emission of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation varied from ~100 to ~6 times greater than its present level. The absorption of this intense radiation in the upper atmospheres of the terrestrial planets is believed to have driven rapid hydrodynamic escape, either in the form of energy-limited escape or transonic blow-off. The calculation of escape rates under these circumstances, and in particular the nature of the correct condition to apply at the upper boundary, depends on whether or not the flow remains subsonic below the exobase. If the flow remains subsonic, the kinetic Jeans equations may be applied at the exobase; otherwise, the radius of the sonic point must be located and then appropriate boundary conditions applied at this radius. This seems to suggest that the full hydrodynamic escape problem needs to be solved iteratively to determine where the sonic radius falls and the type of boundary conditions that should be applied. Such an arduous undertaking is generally impractical for standard application in chemical evolution models or related studies. Fortunately, a much easier but still accurate approach to determining whether the flow remains subsonic below the exobase for a given amount of energy deposition has been provided by Johnson et al. (2013, Ap. J. Lett. 768:L4), who base their results on rigorous Discrete Simulation Monte Carlo models. Their model provides the ratio of the escape rate to the energy-limited value as a function of the total XUV heating. The XUV heating, however, is itself coupled to the escape rate through the radial structure of the upper atmosphere, which can become greatly distended for large heating rates. Here we present a simple recipe for estimating the hydrodynamic escape rate that includes the coupling between the escape rate, the radial structure, and the XUV heating while avoiding the use of demanding numerical calculations. The approach involves an iterative semi-analytical method for determining the effective radius of energy deposition, from which the escape rate, radial structure, and other parameters can be derived. We test its performance against some more elaborate, rigorous calculations of primitive-atmosphere hydrodynamic escape that are available in the literature.",

            "abstract": "The end-Permian mass extinction was the most devastating taxonomic and ecological crisis in the history of life on Earth. The recovery lasted 5 My making it the longest in geologic history, although the cause of the delay is still heavily debated. We find that additional environmental changes during the recovery interval reset the attempts that marine communities made toward ecological complexity, resulting in the overall appearance of a stagnant recovery.\nThe extinction mechanisms during the end-Permian include extreme temperature change and low oxygen environments resulting from the volcanic emission of carbon dioxide and other toxic gasses to the atmosphere. The biotic response to ancient environmental change is a direct analog for the ecological impacts of modern anthropogenic climate change.\nWe applied an ecological recovery rubric to benthic, sea floor dwelling, communities throughout the Early Triassic recovery in two major ocean basins. Newly collected bulk fossil data from the Moenkopi and Thaynes Formations from the Southwest US and the Werfen Formation in Italy were analyzed along with literature data. In Italy, directly following the extinction, low oxygen environments prevented an ecological rebound. Once low oxygen conditions receded, 600 kyr after the extinction, taxonomic diversity, fossil body size, and trace fossil complexity rebounded. A little more than 1 My into the Early Triassic, an extreme temperature event resulted in a reset of community complexity in both Italy and the Southwest US. The body size of gastropods and the repopulation of echinoderms were significantly inhibited as was trace fossil complexity. Low oxygen conditions that developed in the last ~2My of the Early Triassic limited diversity and body size in the Southwest United States. The stagnant recovery is re-interpreted as dynamic resets and rapid rebounds driven by environmental perturbations throughout the Early Triassic.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 343 (JFAST) drilled through the plate boundary at the Japan Trench where potentially several megathrust earthquakes have occurred, most recently the 2011 Mw 9.1 Tohoku-oki earthquake. Here, we investigate structural features of the plate boundary at the JFAST site to determine their seismic history. Using trace element geochemistry as a tool to fingerprint sedimentary units, we develop a stratigraphy of the JFAST core that shows significant plate boundary complexity. To determine the seismic history of the faults identified in the core, we use a novel method to detect temperature rise along faults: the thermal destruction of organic molecules. We interpret the destruction of alkenones, a common biomarker found in marine sediments, along faults to be a result of coseismic heating. In order to constrain initial alkenone concentration, we use our trace element stratigraphy to correlate individual JFAST samples with their protolith in the DSDP Site 436 reference core. We find that at least three faults demonstrate significant destruction of alkenones, implying that these faults have experienced shallow seismic slip.\nIn the past, frictional work has been difficult to measure on faults due to a paucity of available coseismic temperature proxies preserved in the rock record. By coupling experimentally determined reaction kinetics of alkenone destruction with models of temperature rise during earthquakes, we convert the alkenone destruction measurements into estimates of maximum temperature rise on faults in the JFAST core. This novel measurement allows us to explore energy budgets at the subduction interface.",

            "abstract": "The Optimal Ranking Regime (ORR) method was used to identify 6-100 year time windows containing significant ranking sequences in 55 western U.S. streamflow reconstructions, and reconstructions of the level of the Great Salt Lake and San Francisco Bay salinity during 1500-2007. The method’s ability to identify optimally significant and non-overlapping periods of low and high rankings allows it to re-express a reconstruction time series as a simplified sequence of regime segments marking intra- to multi-decadal (IMD) periods of low or high streamflow, lake level, or salinity. Those ORR sequences, referred to here as Z-lines, can be plotted to identify common regime patterns in the analysis of numerous reconstructions. The Z-lines for the 57 reconstructions evaluated here show a common pattern of IMD cycles of drought and pluvial periods during the late 16th and 17th centuries, a relatively dormant period during the 18th century, and the reappearance of alternating dry and wet IMD periods during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Although this pattern suggests the possibility of similar oceanic modes in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, such centennial-scale patterns are not evident in the ORR analyses of reconstructed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), El Niño-Southern Oscillation, and North Atlantic seas-surface temperature variation. However, given the inconsistency in the analyses of four PDO reconstructions, the possible role of centennial-scale oceanic mechanisms remains uncertain. In future research the ORR method might be applied to climate reconstructions around the Pacific Basin to try to resolve this uncertainty.",

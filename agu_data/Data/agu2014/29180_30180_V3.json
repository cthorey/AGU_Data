            "abstract": "By combining laboratory and field studies we investigated how increased concentrations of dissolved sulfide in the Delaware inland bays affect the photochemical efficiency of several species of phytoplankton found locally. During the summer months some sites in the Delaware inland bays reach over one millimolar H2S. A Satlantic in situ FIRe (fluorescence induction and relaxation) sensor was used to monitor the changes in the photochemical efficiency, Fv/Fm, of PSII. An in situ voltammetry system was also deployed and used to monitor spatial and temporal changes in O2 and H2S using Au/AuHg microelectrodes. Data will be presented correlating seasonal changes in redox chemistry to in situ values of Fv/Fm, with decreases in Fv/Fm signifying organism stress. Laboratory studies will also be shown that specifically investigate the tolerance of several local phytoplankton species to varying sulfide concentrations and exposure time. Initial field data indicate significant stress in the presence of sulfide with large decreases in Fv/Fm observed. Laboratory data show the negative photochemical response of several local phytoplankton species to H2S concentrations similar to those observed in the Delaware inland bays. These data aim to help improve our understanding on how increasing sulfide concentrations effect photosynthetic processes in the Delaware inland bays, but can also have implications for other ecosystems that undergo seasonal stratification and sulfidic condtions.",

            "abstract": "Chesapeake Bay is a eutrophic ecosystem with periodic hypoxia and anoxia, algal blooms, diminished submerged aquatic vegetation, and degraded stocks of marine life. Knowledge of the effectiveness of actions taken across the watershed to reduce nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads to the bay (i.e. “best management practices” or BMPs) is essential to its restoration. While nutrient inputs from point sources (e.g. wastewater treatment plants and other industrial and municipal operations) are tracked, inputs from nonpoint sources, including atmospheric deposition, farms, lawns, septic systems, and stormwater, are difficult to measure. Estimating reductions in nonpoint source inputs attributable to BMPs requires compilation and comparison of data on water quality, climate, land use, point source discharges, and BMP implementation.\nTo explore the relation of changes in nonpoint source inputs and BMP implementation to changes in water quality, a subset of small watersheds (those containing at least 10 years of water quality monitoring data) within the Chesapeake Watershed were selected for study. For these watersheds, data were compiled on geomorphology, demographics, land use, point source discharges, atmospheric deposition, and agricultural practices such as livestock populations, crop acres, and manure and fertilizer application. In addition, data on BMP implementation for 1985-2012 were provided by the Environmental Protection Agency Chesapeake Bay Program Office (CBPO) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A spatially referenced nonlinear regression model (SPARROW) provided estimates attributing N and P loads associated with receiving waters to different nutrient sources. A recently developed multiple regression technique (“Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge and Season” or WRTDS) provided an enhanced understanding of long-term trends in N and P loads and concentrations. A suite of deterministic models developed by the CBPO was used to estimate expected nutrient load reductions attributable to BMPs. Further quantification of the relation of land-based nutrient sources and BMPs to water quality in the bay and its tributaries must account for inconsistency in BMP data over time and uncertainty regarding BMP locations and effectiveness.",

            "abstract": "The classic crustal strength-depth model of Brace and Kolhstedt (1980) (see figure) based on experimental rock mechanics depends in the brittle regime on the critical assumption of linearly increasing hydrostatic pore-fluid pressures. This leads to a predicted linearly increasing brittle strength that is well established based on deep borehole stress measurements in crystalline crust.\nIn contrast, fluid overpressures are widely documented in orogenic belts based on borehole data, seismic velocity analysis and analysis of veins, in some cases showing complex fault-valve pressure fluctuations between lithostatic and hydrostatic. Typical observed overpressure-depth relationships predict a brittle crustal strength that is approximately constant with depth in contrast with the classic model. This constant-strength behavior below the fluid-retention depth (ZFRD in figure) has been confirmed using deep borehole stress and fluid-pressure measurements (Suppe, 2014). Recent ductile-plastic modeling of disequilibrium compaction suggests that pressure solution promotes further increases in overpressure and weakening, promoting a very prolonged low-strength brittle-ductile transition.\nOverpressured conditions can be inferred to exist over a substantial fraction of crustal thickness, spanning the brittle-ductile transition, in several tectonic environments, most straightforwardly in shale-rich clastic sedimentary basins built to sea level on oceanic or highly thinned continental crust such as the US Gulf Coast and Niger Delta. These thick accumulations commonly deform into shale-rich plate boundary mountain belts (e.g. Bangladesh/Miyanmar, Makran, Trinidad/Barbados, Gulf of Alaska, southern Taiwan and New Zealand). There is deep geophysical evidence for near lithostatic pore-fluid pressures existing to depths of 20-30km based on Vp, Vs, Vp/Vs and Q observations. We present active examples from Taiwan and New Zealand, combining borehole data and seismic tomography.",

            "abstract": "Inverse modeling has become a common approach to infer the parameters of the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions from observations of the vadose zone state variables during dynamic experiments under varying boundary conditions.\nThis study focuses on the estimation and investigation of the feasibility of effective soil hydraulic properties to describe the soil water flow in an undisturbed 1m³ lysimeter. The lysimeter is equipped with 6 one-dimensional observation arrays consisting of 4 tensiometers and 4 water content probes each, leading to 6 replicated one-dimensional observations which establish the calibration data base.\nMethods of global sensitivity analysis and multiobjective calibration strategies have been applied to examine the information content about the soil hydraulic parameters of the Mualem-van Genuchten (MvG) model contained in the individual data sets, to assess the tradeoffs between the different calibration data sets and to infer effective soil hydraulic properties for each of the arrays. The results show that (1) information about the MvG model parameters decreases with increasing depth, due to effects of overlapping soil layers and reduced soil water dynamics, (2) parameter uncertainty is affected by correlation between the individual parameters. Despite these difficulties, (3) effective one-dimensional parameter sets, which produce satisfying fits and have acceptable trade-offs, can be identified for all arrays, but (4) the array specific parameter sets vary significantly and cannot be transferred to simulate the water flow in other arrays, and (5) none of the parameter sets is suitable to simulate the integral water flow within the lysimeter.\nThe results of the study challenge the feasibility of the inversely estimated soil hydraulic properties from multiple point measurements of the soil hydraulic state variables. Relying only on point measurements of the state variables, which is the usual case, inverse modeling can lead to promising results regarding the observations, while the model fails to simulate the integral soil water flow, which is hidden from the modeler. This underlines the need for more integral observation techniques in order to be able to estimate representative and robust effective soil hydraulic properties.",

            "abstract": "GeoBus (\nwww.geobus.org.uk\n) is an educational outreach project that was developed in 2012 by the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of St Andrews, and it is sponsored jointly by industry and the UK Research Councils (NERC and EPSRC). The aims of GeoBus are to support the teaching of Earth Science in secondary (middle and high) schools by providing teaching support to schools that have no or little expertise of teaching Earth science, to share the outcomes of new science research and the experiences of young researchers with school pupils, and to provide a bridge between industry, higher education institutions, research councils and schools. Since its launch, GeoBus has visited over 160 different schools across the length and breadth of Scotland. Over 30,000 pupils will have been involved in experiential Earth science learning activities by December 2014, including many in remote and disadvantaged regions.\nThe challenge with secondary school experiential learning as outreach is that activities need to be completed in either 50 or 80 minutes to fit within the school timetables in the UK, and this can limit the amount of hands-on activities that pupils undertake in one session. However, it is possible to dedicate a whole or half day of linked activities to Earth science learning in Scotland and this provides a long enough period to undertake field work, conduct group projects, or complete more complicated experiments. GeoBus has developed a suite of workshops that all involve experiential learning and are targeted for shorter and longer time slots, and the lessons learned in developing and refining these workshops to maximise the learning achieved will be presented.\nThree potentially unsurprising observations hold true for all the schools that GeoBus visits: young learners like to experiment and use unfamiliar equipment to make measurements, the element of competition stimulates learners to ask questions and maintain focus and enthusiasum, and role playing is an effective way to get learners to participate in group projects and to communicate with each other. Examples of our workshops and experiential learning activities for a range of ages will be presented along with feedback from teachers and young learners.",

            "abstract": "The MAVEN spacecraft enters Mars orbit four weeks before Comet Siding Spring's passage by the planet. If orbit insertion and commissioning go according to plan, MAVEN is poised to make once-in-a-lifetime remote sensing observations of the comet and its effects on Mars. MAVEN's Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph (IUVS) was designed to map emissions from common solar system gases and is therefore well suited to obtaining multispectral images of the comet at close range. IUVS's 115-340nm spectral range includes emissions from H, O, C, S, CO, CO2, and OH. The instrument includes the first interplanetary UV echelle which may be capable of measuring the D/H ratio given sufficient time on target. During IUVS's campaign on 17 October 2014, the comet's apparent size will increase 50% as it approaches.\nMAVEN's truly unique opportunity is the search for potential changes in the atmosphere due to the comet. Since MAVEN was conceived to measure the atmosphere's response to changing solar influences, it is perfectly situated to detect atmospheric changes due to the deposition of gas, dust, energy and momentum from the comet. MAVEN will obtain the \"before\" picture by observing Mars for approximately two days pre-comet, and the \"after\" picture starting soon after its closest approach. IUVS's multiple observing modes each present an opportunity to detect atmospheric changes. First, limb scans of atmospheric emissions from 70 to 225 km altitude could detect new species, including metal ions from the dust, as well as detect changes in the atmospheric scale height due to heating by incoming cometary gas and dust. Second, scans of the extended atmospheric corona up to 4500 km altitude will be sensitive to atoms and molecules ejected or rebounding from atmospheric collisions, especially H, O and OH. Finally, multispectral imaging of the planet's disk might even detect \"auroral\"-type influences on the segment of the nightside directed into the comet flow. The primary limitation on MAVEN's sensitivity to these changes may be the timing of its safe return to operations after the passage of Siding Spring's debris cloud.",

            "abstract": "As an end member of physical weathering, glaciers produce highly abraded, fine-grained mineral surfaces, which can readily undergo chemical weathering. Consequently, extensive chemical weathering can occur subglacially in water-filled cavities and till. Glacial weathering products may therefore alter the trace element and isotope composition of the ocean on glacial-interglacial time scales. For example, major changes in Earth’s glacial history may influence changes in marine 87Sr/86Sr, potentially as the result of radiogenic strontium being released from glacial weathering products. We investigate the 87Sr/86Sr of glacial meltwater discharging a large outlet glacier of the Greenland Ice Sheet during a 76-day time series sampling campaign in 2012. In order to assess potential chemical changes that might occur when glacial meltwater enters the ocean, samples were also collected across the freshwater-saltwater mixing zone in the downstream fjord. In glacial meltwater, substantial variations in 87Sr/86Sr were found in samples collected 12 hours apart (0.755 – 0.742) as well as between mid May and late July (0.755 – 0.733). Strontium concentrations ranged from 250 nM during low flows in May to 51 nM in late July during high flow. Fjord samples showed conservative mixing between glacial meltwater and seawater. These temporal variations are likely the result of changing subglacial water transit times and incongruent weathering of minerals at the ice bed. The large seasonal change likely reflects the evolution of subglacial meltwater flow paths from a groundwater- and linked cavity-dominated system in the spring to an efficient channelized system in mid summer. Daily changes likely reflect varying contributions from channelized and linked cavity groundwater systems controlled by surface meltwater inputs. Our findings suggest that 87Sr/86Sr in glacial meltwater is sensitive to the seasonal evolution of subglacial flowpaths and daily changes in meltwater sources.",

            "abstract": "We present field measurements of isoprene, its oxidation products, and an ensemble of other gas- and particle-phase measurements from the SLAQRS campaign during summer 2013 in Greater St. Louis. St. Louis lies near the ‘isoprene volcano’ in the Ozark Plateau, and oscillates between extremely high levels of isoprene and its oxidation products when winds are southerly, and low isoprene levels under northerly winds. During summer 2013 isoprene concentrations peaked at nearly 8 ppb, with the highest amounts occurring at night due to the associated transport time. In this presentation we interpret these measurements in terms of present understanding of isoprene chemistry, and examine their implications for daytime and nighttime chemistry in St. Louis. We pay particular attention to the measured abundance and variability of formic and acetic acids, and the relative importance of biogenic and anthropogenic precursors leading to their production.",

            "abstract": "The assessment of extreme hydrological events at sites characterized by short time series or where no data record exists has been mainly obtained by regional models. Regional frequency analysis based on the index variable procedure is implemented here to describe the annual maximum of rainfall depth of short durations in Tuscany region. The probability distribution TCEV - Two Component Extreme Value is used in the frame of the procedure for the parameters estimation based on a three levels hierarchical approach. The methodology deal with the delineation of homogeneous regions, the identification of a robust regional frequency distribution and the assessment of the scale factor, i.e. the index rainfall. The data set includes the annual maximum of daily rainfall of 351 gauge stations with at least 30 years of records, in the period 1916 - 2012, and the extreme rainfalls of short duration, 1 hour and 3, 6, 12, 24 hours. Different subdivisions hypotheses have been verified. A four regions subdivision, coincident with four subregions, which takes into account the orography, the geomorphological and climatic peculiarities of the Tuscany region, has been adopted. Particularly, for testing the regional homogeneity, the cumulate frequency distributions of the observed skewness and variation coefficients of the recorded times series, are compared with the theoretical frequency distribution obtained through a Monte Carlo technique. The related L-skewness and L-variation coefficients are also examined. The application of the Student t -test and the Wilcoxon test for the mean, as well as the χ2 was also performed. Further tests of subdivision hypotheses have been made through the application of discordancy D and heterogeneity H tests and the analysis of the observed and the theoretical TCEV model growth curves. For each region the daily rainfall growth curve has been estimated. The growth curves for the hourly duration have been estimated when the daily rainfall growth curve is not able to describe the sample cumulate frequency distribution. In order to define the index rainfall for each homogenous region and each duration, a multivariate model that combines the Mean Annual Precipitation, the elevation, the aspect and the sample mean of the annual maxima time series of the gauge sites has been used.",

Catahoula Lake is the largest valley-margin lake in the lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley and is hydrologically influenced by backwaters of the Mississippi and Red rivers and headwaters of the Little River. Our objective was to understand effects of hydrological management of the floodplain and the lake itself on lake sediments and recent changes in vegetation. Comparison of 137Cs profiles with prior 210Pb and 14C profiles indicates the recent deposition rate has been low (0.3 cm/yr) but triple that prior to settlement. Sediment chemistry profiles indicate dominance of acidic coastal-plain sediments from the tributary Little River in the past ~60 yr, but spatially mixed influence of acidic and neutral, Mississippi-Red sediments prior to that. We conclude that a century of increasing hydrologic management of the Mississippi and Red rivers has disconnected Catahoula Lake from their sedimentary influence and that the consequent change in chemical composition of surficial sediments may be contributing to ecologic changes in the lake.",

            "abstract": "Analysis of Apollo regolith samples showed that lunar dust grains consist of a diverse set of shapes. Consequently, the optical scattering properties of these grains will differ from those predicted using the Mie approximation, which strictly applies only for spheres. Because it is analytically convenient and without shape ambiguity, Mie theory has been used routinely to estimate the concentration of dust or it's upper limits in the lunar exosphere from brightness measurements acquired during orbital dust searches.\nUtilizing the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA), we have computed a more realistic set of scattering parameters for a collection of sub-micron grain shapes that represents the ultra-fine fraction of lunar soil. Included in this suite are spheroids (oblate and prolate) and irregular geometries resembling isolated grains observed in Apollo samples. A subset of these models includes the addition of nanophase iron, in order to examine the influence of space weathering. Wavelength coverage of the DDA scattering computations extends from far-UV to near-IR. This range is diagnostic of grain size and shape, since scattering efficiency depends on both of these parameters.\nThis collection of grain scattering models is used, together with an observing simulation code, to reexamine some prior estimates of exospheric dust concentration derived from Apollo-era limb brightness measurements (e.g., Apollo 15 coronal photography), as well as the subsequent Clementine star tracker search and a search for lunar horizon glow by LRO Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP). We compare our revised estimates of exospheric dust abundance with the results of these previous dust searches.",

            "abstract": "Climate is the average of weather over some time period and shows characteristic behavior in each time scale. In paleoclimatic research, values of climate variables are measured from proxies that give time series of time-averaged variables. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of time-averaged variable is important to investigate climate variations thorough different time scales.\nIn our recent study, we formulated how stochastic dynamics changes corresponding to averaging time intervals using one dimensional first order stochastic differential equation which contains parametrically controlled terms of deterministic single-well or double-well potential force and random force. The dynamics of time-averaged variable is described by conditional probability density function. In the case of single-well, the function is analytically derived as normal distribution with scaling parameters. In the case of double-well potential, the function is obtained as skew generalized normal distribution function through numerical simulations. The mathematical framework of stochastic dynamics of time-averaged variable is general and applicable to analysis of many kinds of climate time series data.\nIn this study, we apply the above framework to the analysis of proxy data from ice core and discuss about time scaling of the past climate variations. We test several models to infer the optimal model description for the data.",

            "abstract": "Recently the K-dominant tourmaline with microdiamond inclusions from the Kokchetav Massif, Kazakhstan (Shimizu & Ogasawara, 2005), has been approved by IMA-CNMNC as a new end-member species of the tourmaline supergroup, maruyamaite (IMA 2013-123, Lussier et al., 2014: Min. Mag. V. 78, p. 550). Maruyamaite has an ideal chemical formula of K(MgAl2)(Al5Mg)(BO3)3(Si6O18)(OH)3O and is a unique K-dominant tourmaline species. Currently the occurrence of maruyamaite is limited from the Kokchetav Massif. Moreover, no K-rich dravitic tourmaline has been reported from other UHP terranes. This rarelity is probably due to the large ionic radius of K with respect to the X-site of tourmaline. The first synthesis of K-dominant tourmaline by Berryman et al. (2014) indicated that K-incorporation in tourmaline structure requires high-pressure and high K/Na conditions. A number of studies (e.g., Hwang et al., 2005) have shown that K-rich fluid had been present at the Kokchetav UHP stages and played an important role for the formation of metamorphic diamond and other UHP minerals such as K-rich clinopyroxene.\nThe systematic chemical analysis combined with detailed inclusion study (Shimizu & Ogasawara, 2013) demonstrated that K in tourmaline decrease with pressure decrease in the diamond-bearing Kokchetav UHP rocks and the maruyamaite component can form continuous solid solutions with dravite–oxy-dravite–uvite tourmalines. The figure shows that microdiamond inclusions occur only in K-dominant core (maruyamaite) and the surrounding parts contain low-pressure minerals such as graphite and quartz. UHP partial melting was deduced for the genesis of the maruyamaite-bearing tourmaline-rich quartzofeldspathic rock from the heavy B-isotope composition of maruyamaite (Ota et al., 2008). Contrarily, Marschall et al. (2009) and Korsakov et al. (2009) insisted that K-rich tourmaline was not UHP phase because of the significantly young 40Ar/39Ar age compared to the peak metamorphism. However, the K-content of tourmaline used for their dating is not more than 1.6 wt% (i.e., the tourmaline was not maruyamaite but K-rich (oxy-) dravite), suggesting the age may represent a later event during exhumation.\nK-bearing tourmalines including maruyamaite could be a UHP indicator.",

            "abstract": "The common definition of metadata is “data about data”. NASA has developed metadata formats to meet the needs of its satellite missions and emerging users. Coverage of satellite missions is highly predictable based on orbit characteristics. Airborne missions feature complicated flight patterns to maximize science return and changes in the instrument suites. More relevant to the airborne science data holding, the metadata describes the airborne measurements, in terms of measurement location, time, platform, and instruments. The metadata organizes the data holdings and facilitates the data ordering process from the DAAC. Therefore, the metadata requirements will need to fit the type of airborne measurements and sampling strategies as well as leverage current Earth Science and Data Information System infrastructure (ECHO/Reverb, GCMD). Current airborne data is generated/produced in a variety of formats (ICARRT, ASCII, etc) with the metadata information embedded in the data file. Special readers are needed to parse data file to generate metadata needed for search and discovery. With loosely defined standards within the airborne community this process poses challenges to the data providers. It is necessary to assess the suitability of current metadata standards, which have been mostly developed for satellite observations. To be presented are the use case-based assessments of the current airborne metadata standards and suggestions for future changes.",

            "abstract": "It is becoming widely evident that hydraulic fracture stimulations in shale reservoirs can result in the generation of events with magnitudes M>0. These events are of concern both to the public as potential geo-hazards possibly affecting groundwater conditions and surface infra-structure, and to engineers for optimizing productivity and engineering design. Typically, in these environments, recording bandwidth limitations has resulted in a bias towards the consideration of events with M<0. This in turn has limited the observable fracture sizes to those constrained within lithological units. By extending the recording bandwidth to lower frequencies, the dimensions of the observable fractures are also extended to include larger fractures/faults activated during the stimulation. Our observations suggest that these larger-scale events can contribute upwards of 80% of the overall seismic budget or energy release associated with the stimulation process. Effective analysis of scaling relations independent of recording further suggests that breakdowns in scaling can be related to the presence of barriers to growth such as contrasts in rock properties associated with different lithological units. Generally, detected larger-magnitude events are associated with smaller-magnitude events, M<0, suggesting that these latter events can be used to characterize aspects of the rupture process whereas their associated signals observed with the low-frequency network can be used to characterize the overall fracture/fault behavior. By accounting for the presence of larger events, additional activated fracture surface area within the reservoir results in a significant increase in surface area. In an example provided, these events account for a further ~10 km2 of additional activated fracture surface area than estimated based on only utilizing high-frequency band-limited recordings. Overall, the identification of the actual discrete fracture network over many size scales allows for a better understanding of the fracturing processes and size scaling associated with stimulations and their impact on production.",

Previously, we implemented a novel shutterless continuous readout mode on the IMACS instrument, able to obtain high-speed photometry on multiple stars, simultaneously generating light curves for all targets with a 36 Hz cadence. Following our pilot study, we extended our observational campaign, improving our target selection methodology such that we can now simultaneously monitor thousands of stars in a crowded field-of-view. We were granted approximately 60 hrs observing time on Magellan in 2014, allowing us to increase our observational data set by almost an order of magnitude, giving us an inticipated 100,000 star-hours of light curves with per-point SNR > 10. We expect that these observation will result in the first ground-based detections of occultations by sub-km objects in the Kuiper-Belt, allowing us to verify and improve upon the sky plane density of sub-km diameter KBOs implied by the HST FGS detections reported by Schlichting et al.

According to the stratigraphy and structural analysis, the Complex in the ascending order can be divided into Chiuchu Marble, Paiyang Schist with Kuyuan Schist, and Pilu Formation. Based on Sr isotope dating, it is speculated that the formation age of Chiuchu Marble is closed to 250±20 Ma. Using the zircon U-Pb dating, the magnetic age of gneiss (I-type granite) yields 105- 86 Ma. The stratigraphic age of schist is difficult to define because of fossils are poorly-preserved. In our study, we use the detrital zircon U-Pb dating, by LA-ICPMS, to yield the maximum depositional age of the schist formation. We analyze fifteen samples in this study. The depositional age of the Kuyuan and Paiyang Schists would be not older than late Cretaceous, and the depositional age of the Pilu Formation may have formed in late Cretaceous and younger than Kuyuan and Paiyang Schists. Results from the above mentioned, we are interpreted as the tectonic setting of the Tananao Metamorpic Complex. The region was located on a passive continental margin that formed carbonate platform deposits during the late Permian period. The clastic sediments were unconformably deposited on Chiuchu Marble during the early Cretaceous. Then the paleo-Pacific plate subducted to the Cathaysia Block forming the granite at about 105-86 Ma. Afterwards, the clastic sediments were deeply buried caused by continuing subduction formed as schist rock. The metamorphic event is known as the Nanao orogeny.",

            "abstract": "The main focus of this study is to develop forecast consensus in the extended range prediction (ERP) of monsoon Intraseasonal oscillations using a suit of different variants of Climate Forecast system (CFS) model. In this CFS based Grand MME prediction system (CGMME), the ensemble members are generated by perturbing the initial condition and using different configurations of CFSv2. This is to address the role of different physical mechanisms known to have control on the error growth in the ERP in the 15-20 day time scale. The final formulation of CGMME is based on 21 ensembles of the standalone Global Forecast System (GFS) forced with bias corrected forecasted SST from CFS, 11 low resolution CFST126 and 11 high resolution CFST382. Thus, we develop the multi-model consensus forecast for the ERP of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) using a suite of different variants of CFS model. This coordinated international effort lead towards the development of specific tailor made regional forecast products over Indian region. Skill of deterministic and probabilistic categorical rainfall forecast as well the verification of large-scale low frequency monsoon intraseasonal oscillations has been carried out using hindcast from 2001-2012 during the monsoon season in which all models are initialized at every five days starting from 16May to 28 September. The skill of deterministic forecast from CGMME is better than the best participating single model ensemble configuration (SME). The CGMME approach is believed to quantify the uncertainty in both initial conditions and model formulation. Main improvement is attained in probabilistic forecast which is because of an increase in the ensemble spread, thereby reducing the error due to over-confident ensembles in a single model configuration. For probabilistic forecast, three tercile ranges are determined by ranking method based on the percentage of ensemble members from all the participating models falls in those three categories. CGMME further added value to both deterministic and probability forecast compared to raw SME's and this better skill is probably flows from large spread and improved spread-error relationship. CGMME system is currently capable of generating ER prediction in real time and successfully delivering its experimental operational ER forecast of ISM for the last few years.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the physics of water evaporation from saline porous media is important in many processes such as evaporation from porous media, vegetation, plant growth, biodiversity in soil, and durability of building materials. To investigate the effect of particle size distribution on the dynamics of salt precipitation in saline porous media during evaporation, we applied X-ray micro-tomography technique. Six samples of quartz sand with different grain size distributions were used in the present study enabling us to constrain the effects of particle and pore sizes on salt precipitation patterns and dynamics. The pore size distributions were computed using the pore-scale X-ray images. The packed beds were saturated with NaCl solution of 3 Molal and the X-ray imaging was continued for one day with temporal resolution of 30 min resulting in pore scale information about the evaporation and precipitation dynamics. Our results show more precipitation at the early stage of the evaporation in the case of sand with the larger particle size due to the presence of fewer evaporation sites at the surface. The presence of more preferential evaporation sites at the surface of finer sands significantly modified the patterns and thickness of the salt crust deposited on the surface such that a thinner salt crust was formed in the case of sand with smaller particle size covering larger area at the surface as opposed to the thicker patchy crusts in samples with larger particle sizes. Our results provide new insights regarding the physics of salt precipitation in porous media during evaporation.",

            "abstract": "Many areas of the world show an aerosol volume distribution with a significant coarse mode and sometimes a dominant coarse mode. The large coarse mode is usually due to dust, but sea salt aerosol can also play an important role. However, in many field campaigns, the coarse mode tends to be ignored, because it is difficult to measure. This lack of measurements leads directly to a concomitant “lack of analysis” of this mode. Because, coarse mode aerosols can have significant effects on radiative forcing, both in the shortwave and longwave spectrum, the coarse mode -- and these forcings -- should be accounted for in atmospheric models. Forcings based only on fine mode aerosols have the potential to be misleading.\nIn this paper we describe examples of large coarse modes that occur in areas of large aerosol loading (Mexico City, Barnard et al., 2010) as well as small loadings (Sacramento, CA; Kassianov et al., 2012; and Reno, NV). We then demonstrate that: (1) the coarse mode can contribute significantly to radiative forcing, relative to the fine mode, and (2) neglecting the coarse mode may result in poor comparisons between measurements and models. Next we describe -- in general terms -- the limitations of instrumentation to measure the coarse mode. Finally, we suggest a new initiative aimed at examining coarse mode aerosol generation mechanisms; transport and deposition; chemical composition; visible and thermal IR refractive indices; morphology; microphysical behavior when deposited on snow and ice; and specific instrumentation needs.\nBarnard, J.

            "abstract": "Lakes and reservoirs are hot spots for carbon cycling, processing C at rates up to an order of magnitude greater than that of terrestrial ecosystems per unit area. Substantial amounts of carbon may be buried in water body sediments, but burial rates are poorly constrained, with recent estimates for global C burial ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 Pg C yr-1. These fluxes are seldom considered in global carbon cycle models. In this paper, we will present results of an analysis of C burial rates in water bodies of the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) that takes advantage of recently developed national-scale data sets on sedimentation rates and sediment C concentrations. We relate these data to basin characteristics and land use to develop an empirical model of C burial for water bodies in the CONUS. Results indicate these water bodies sequester large amounts of carbon, and spatial patterns in carbon burial are strongly influenced by water body type, size, and abundance, as well as soil and vegetation characteristics in surrounding areas.",

            "abstract": "Climate, oceanographic and sea level history during last glacial cycle (LGC) and Holocene at the NW continental margin of the South China Sea (SCS) are investigated within the SECEB project. For that purpose two sediment cores (HDQ2 & 83PC) and single-channel seismic sections were selected to serve as a proxy data source for paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic reconstructions. The sedimentary facies is interpreted by multi-proxy approaches considering micropaleontological, sedimentological and geochemical analyses. According to 14C and OSL datings, sediments of shallow water drill core HDQ2 (88.3 m) cover a time span of ca. 115 kyr BP. Seismic images of the sampling site show a series of reflectors which can be correlated with coarse layers of core HDQ2. These layers are interpreted as transgression / regression horizons. Due to the age model it is possible to correlate these horizons with the general sea level dynamics within the SCS as it is displayed in relative sea level excursions for the MIS 5 to 2 from the Sunda Shelf (Hanebuth et al. 2011). Core 83PC (8.6 m) retrieved from the continental slope provide constant record and calm environment. Therefore, this core is used as a source for data proxy for environmental reconstructions. According to δ18O and paleomagnetic analysis, a good age model which indicate age of this core to ca. 110 kyr BP was elaborated and help correlate the paleoenvironmental data with core HDQ2. Alkenones, δ18O, the Mg/Ca ratio, and microfossil proxies serve for paleo-SST curves and monsoon variability reconstructions. δ15N and δ13C indicate nutrient supply to the marine environment. Diatomological analysis outlines the environmental evolution and interrelations between their parameters during the LGC. Interpretation of seismic profiling allowed identification of submarine paleo-delta. It’s anticipated that deposited sediments descent from the Hainan Island and allow correlation of the source and sink area.\nHanebuth, T.J.J, Voris, H.K., Yokoyama, Y., Saito, Y., Okuno, J., 2011.

Direct radiative forcing of BB aerosol is highly uncertain due to its complex composition, morphology and mixing state. Soot particles are the strongest light absorbing aerosols in BB smoke. In BB smoke, soot particles are normally internally mixed with other material and the mixing state can affect their optical properties. In this study we investigated morphology and mixing state of soot particles emitted from BB smoke from field and laboratory measurements. Smoke particles were collected 1) during the Las Conchas wildfire in New Mexico (June, 2011) and 2) at the U.S. Forest Service’s Fire Science Laboratory in 2012, during the fourth Fire Laboratory at Missoula Experiment (FLAME-4).\nSingle particles were analyzed with electron microscopy, and were categorized and characterized by their morphology, and mixing state. We found that soot particles were mostly heavily coated. Based on the characterization on field and laboratory samples, synthetic soot particles with various morphologies and mixing states were generated and their optical properties were numerically calculated using the discrete dipole approximation. We used organic material as a coating agent and investigated the spectral dependency of scattering and absorption for internally mixed soot particles. We found enhancement in scattering and absorption when most of the soot particle was embedded within the organic coating. The aim of this study is to improve our understanding of the effect of morphology and mixing on light scattering and absorption by soot particles and ultimately their effects on the direct radiative forcing.",

To quantitatively investigate the relationship between a range of environmental management approaches and sustainability, and the implications for Earth's future, we track the impact of management strategies on dissipation within the system and its externalities in a numerical model for the coupled economic, political/management and flooding dynamics of New Orleans.\nThe model simulates river floods, hurricane storm-surge-induced floods, subsidence, and agent-based market interactions leading to development of port services, hotels, homes and labor relations. Flood protection decisions for levee construction based on the baseline case of cost-benefit analyses designed to prevent short-term economic loss from future floods qualitatively reproduce historical expansion of New Orleans and increases in levee height. Alternative management strategies explored include majority voting, consensus-based decision-making, and variations in discounting of costs and benefits.\nEnhanced dissipation is measured relative to optimal economic development without floods. The focus of modern economies on commodification is exploited to track dissipation as a scalar representing value or power, but this approach might not be applicable to more complicated traditional/indigenous cultures or cultures of resistance.\nFor the baseline case, short-to-medium-term reductions in dissipation destabilize the coupled system, resulting in episodic bursts of externalized dissipation during flooding. Comparisons of results for a range of management options and generalizations of this approach for alternative cultural systems will be discussed.",

We generated records from a peat core from northern Norway (Tønsnes; 69.74°N, 19.12°E), and a lake sediment core from Svalbard (Amsterdamøya; 79.77°N, 10.76°E). At both locations, δD values were measured on long-chain n-alkanes (n-C29, n-C31) at centennial-scale resolution. Over the last 8 ka the records reveal similar trends and ranges of values. δD of n-C29 data from Tønsnes and Amsterdamøya range from -173 to -197‰ and -176 to -194‰, respectively. Both sites show a ~20‰ increase during the mid-Holocene (c. 8.0-2.8). This was followed by a ~10‰ decline during the late Holocene at both sites. The similarity in the absolute values and the trends of these spatially disparate δD records provides evidence that they are not strongly controlled by local environmental factors or changes in apparent fractionation between n-alkanes and source water. Therefore, we interpret the trends as a result of regional changes in precipitation isotopes. Most interesting is the disparity between regional temperature trends and our δD records during the mid-Holocene. In certain Arctic regions, temperature appears to be the primary control on precipitation isotopes. If the trends in our data were interpreted as a response to temperature, the records would suggest increasing temperatures through the mid-Holocene (c. 8.0-2.8 ka). This is at odds with regional air and sea-surface temperature reconstructions, which indicate decreasing temperatures during this period as a result of the reduction in insolation. Therefore, the increase in δD at these sites more likely reflects changes in the seasonality of precipitation, resulting from a progressive increase in the proportion of D-enriched summertime precipitation, or a change in the trajectory of air masses delivering precipitation to the region, an interpretation supported by historical measurements of precipitation isotopes from the region.",

            "abstract": "Huge earthquakes cause vastly stress field change around the rupture zones, and many aftershocks and other related geophysical phenomenon such as geodetic movements have been observed. It is important to figure out the time-spacious distribution during the relaxation process for understanding the giant earthquake cycle. In this study, we pick up the southern rupture area of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (M9.0). The seismicity rate keeps still high compared with that before the 2011 earthquake. Many studies using ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) have been doing since soon after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in order to obtain aftershock activity precisely. Here we show one of the studies at off the coast of Fukushima which is located on the southern part of the rupture area caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. We deployed 4 broadband type OBSs (BBOBSs) and 12 short-period type OBSs (SOBS) in August 2012. Other 4 BBOBSs attached with absolute pressure gauges and 20 SOBSs were added in November 2012. We recovered 36 OBSs including 8 BBOBSs in November 2013. We selected 1,000 events in the vicinity of the OBS network based on a hypocenter catalog published by the Japan Meteorological Agency, and extracted the data after time corrections caused by each internal clock. Each P and S wave arrival times, P wave polarity and maximum amplitude were picked manually on a computer display. We assumed one dimensional velocity structure based on the result from an active source experiment across our network, and applied time corrections every station for removing ambiguity of the assumed structure. Then we adopted a maximum-likelihood estimation technique and calculated the hypocenters. The results show that intensive activity near the Japan Trench can be seen, while there was a quiet seismic zone between the trench zone and landward high activity zone.",

            "abstract": "The proportion of women earning undergraduate geoscience degrees has remained about 40% for over a decade. Little research has investigated why women select and persist in a geoscience major. This study addresses why students major in the geosciences and why some programs are more successful at recruiting and retaining female students. We collected interview and survey data from faculty and students at six public US universities. Four sites had a low proportion of female degree recipients (< 38%) and two sites had a high proportion of female degree recipients (> 48%). 408 students (64% female) completed surveys. Interviews were conducted with 49 faculty members and 151 students. Survey data analysis showed that interest/identity and transformative experiences were significant predictors of students' decision to major in geoscience. Institutional barriers and supports were significant predictors of confidence in the major while connection to instructor predicted students' intent to major. Analysis of pre- and post-course surveys show that students with a greater connection to instructors and students whose instructors expressed more passion for the content also reported higher levels of transformative experiences. This effect was especially pronounced for women and was a significant predictor of persistence in the major. Qualitative data show differences in departmental practices and climate between low and high female graduation sites. High sites used many student-centered approaches to teaching, had extensive opportunities for and a high number of undergraduate students involved in research, and had many opportunities for faculty-student interaction outside of class. Low sites had few of these practices. Qualitative data also showed differences in the gendered equity climate between high and low sites. High sites had more positive gender equity climates and low sites had more negative gender equity climates. At this time, we do not fully understand the causal relationships among all of these findings and higher female graduation rates, but this research is ongoing and these relationships are a focus of our final year of this research project.",

            "abstract": "Fire is a major component of the global carbon cycle, with some estimates of the associated emissions reaching 2.5 PgC/yr. This and the other impacts of biomass burning have driven efforts to improve its simulation in Earth system models. Recent global fire models usually include both bioclimatic and anthropogenic drivers of fire, with the latter (via population density and sometimes economic status) serving to increase or suppress burned area. Some models have added the representation of fire used in deforestation and cropland management, the extent and seasonal timing of which may not be accounted for by the usual approach to anthropogenic influence.\nHuman land use can also limit fire by fragmenting landscapes, but this process is not included in most global models. Moreover, although people often use fire to manage grazing lands for livestock, these practices have not been explicitly modeled (except as performed by pre-industrial societies). This could be important for regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where the seasonality of pasture burning tends to differ from that of other lands, potentially influencing savanna-forest dynamics.\nRecent efforts elucidating the effects of cropland and pasture on fire regimes at regional scales provide insight into these processes. Using this new understanding, we have developed a fire model with structurally distinct modules for burning of croplands, pasture, and primary and secondary lands, as well as fire use for deforestation. Parameters for each are rigorously constrained using remote-sensing observations of burned area. This structure allows us to disentangle agricultural practices and fragmentation effects from the endogenous processes driving fire on non-agricultural land, resulting in a better ability to simulate how fire works at large scales. This is critical for modeling the future of fire and all the parts of the Earth system that it affects, including vegetation distributions, nutrient cycling, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions.\nIn this work, we introduce the structure of the fire model and how it was parameterized. We then compare its performance with observations of burned area and previous global fire models, with a focus on regions where cropland or pasture predominates and especially where people use fire in their management.",

            "abstract": "The pre-Cenozoic tectonic history of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) can be broadly described as Triassic rifting, followed by Jurassic seafloor spreading and post-rift igneous activity as well as domal uplifts and rapid subsidence during the Late Cretaceous. Igneous rocks, identified from geophysical data and outcrops, extend from the Uvalde and Balcones volcanic fields in Texas, through northern Louisiana and eastern Arkansas, to the Jackson Dome in Mississippi. How this widespread magmatic event affected the thermal and structural framework of the crust and the sedimentary system in the northern GoM basin, remain poorly understood.\nCompeting hypotheses exist regarding post-rift igneous activity: 1) Magmatism in the northeastern GoM basin is part of the Bermuda hotspot track; 2) The subduction of the Farallon plate caused distant lithospheric flexure and associated igneous activity in the northwestern GoM basin; 3) Edge-driven mantle convection produced melts at the continent-ocean boundary; 4) Grenville and Ouachita sutures led to opportunistic igneous activity.\nPreliminary results show that, instead of an eastward age progressive track, which is predicted by the Bermuda hotspot hypothesis, the spatial distribution and ages of igneous rocks follow the transition between continental and oceanic crust; it also roughly coincides with the Grenville and Ouachita sutures. It is also possible that the shallow-angle subduction of the Farallon plate could trigger magmatism ca. 1500 km from the trench; a modern analog is the subduction of the west Pacific plate and the Changbai volcano in northeast Asia. Here we emphasize the tectonomagmatic evolution of the northern GoM basin; and moreover suggest post-rift magmatism at passive continental margins is likely affected by both edge-driven convection and inherited lithospheric structures.",

Whipple will reach much deeper into the unexplored frontier of the outer solar system than any other mission, current or proposed. Whipple will look back to the dawn of the solar system by discovering its most remote bodies where primordial processes left their imprint.\nSpecifically, Whipple will monitor large numbers of stars at high cadences (~12,000 stars at 20 Hz to examine Kuiper Belt events; as many as ~36,000 stars at 5 Hz to explore deep into the Oort Cloud, where events are less frequent). Analysis of the detected events will allow us to determine the size spectrum of bodies in the Kuiper Belt with radii as small as ~1 km. This will allow the testing of models of the growth and later collisional erosion of planetesimals in the early solar system. Whipple will explore the Oort Cloud, detecting objects as far out as ~10,000 AU. This will be the first direct exploration of the Oort Cloud since the original hypothesis of 1950.\nWhipple is a Discovery class mission that will be proposed to NASA in response to the 2014 Announcement of Opportunity.

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection at the polar cusps of the magnetosphere is marked by strong asymmetries in plasma density and magnetic field strength in addition to a potentially strong bulk flow shear parallel to the reconnecting magnetic field caused by the solar wind. Much has been learned about the effect of either asymmetries or shear flow on reconnection, but only a handful of studies have addressed systems with both. We perform a careful theoretical, numerical, and observational study of such systems. It is known that an asymmetry in magnetic field offsets the X-line from the center of the diffusion region in the inflow direction toward the weaker magnetic field. A key finding is that this alters the flow profile seen at the X-line relative to expectations from symmetric reconnection results. This causes the X-line to drift in the outflow direction due to the shear flow. We calculate a prediction for the X-line drift speed for arbitrary asymmetric magnetic field strengths and show the result is consistent with two-fluid numerical simulations. These predictions are also shown to be consistent with recent observations of a tailward moving X-line in Cluster observations of reconnection at the polar cusp. The reconnection rate with a shear flow is observed to drop as in symmetric reconnection, and the behavior of the reconnection qualitatively changes when the shear flow speed exceeds the hybrid Alfven speed of the outflow known from asymmetric reconnection theory.",

            "abstract": "Observations of high-latitude ionospheric E-region turbulence with meter-scale irregularities are caused by the Farley-Buneman instability, also called the modified two-stream instability. In general, turbulence produces a complex spectrum of waves, and radars with wavelengths in the few-meter range can detect such irregularities when there is a component of the spectrum that is aligned with the radar line-of-sight (LoS) and has wavelength equal to half the radar wavelength. The angle between the radar LoS and the direction of electron ExB drift is called the flow angle. Previous studies have attempted to quantify the spectral width of backscattered power as a function of flow angle, but those studies required many simplifications and assumptions, including significant spatial and temporal averaging, to arrive at their results.\nWe have performed fully kinetic particle-in-cell plasma simulations with parameters typical of the E-region auroral ionosphere at multiple altitudes and with a range of driving electric fields, in order to quantify the expected relationship between backscattered power and flow angle. These simulations also show the relationship between spectral width and flow angle, a frequently measured relationship. We compare spectral widths from 2-D simulations to 3-D ones in order to assess the usefulness of 2-D results. Our results can be compared to existing measurements and used to design future radar experiments at auroral latitudes.",

            "abstract": "Amazonia is potentially an important region for future changes of the global climate system because its vegetation, the rainforests, is a large ‘labile’ carbon pool. This is particularly so given that the Amazon is warming fast and its hydrological cycle is becoming more variable over the last three decades with an increasing frequency of both severe floods and comparably dry conditions. A diagnostic of the state of these forests is their carbon balance. To observe carbon and more generally greenhouse gas balances of the Basin under these changing conditions we have started regular bi-weekly vertical profile measurements using small aircraft at four strategically selected locations in the Basin in 2009. We will report results from these measurements using a simple air-mass back-trajectory based flux estimation approach. We will first focus on 2010, which was a dry year and 2011, which was an unusually wet year. During both years temperatures were elevated by 1 to 2 degrees C compared to the 1981-2011 mean. We find that during 2010 the Amazon Basin lost substantial amounts of carbon (~0.5 PgC) mainly via fires while in 2011 it was approximately in balance with fire losses balanced by forest carbon uptake. Comprehensive monthly biometric carbon pool measurements at a small set of forest plots suggest productivity stalled during drought months in 2010 and promoted losses by fires. Our results for the wetter year 2011 are consistent with estimates based on censuses at approximately 100 – 150 1ha forest plots distributed widely spread across the Basin. We will extend these results to 2013 and discuss implications of the results for the future of the Amazon rainforests in a warming and higher precipitation world as well as for the global carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Improved information of seasonal variations in watershed hydrology in the tropics can strengthen models and understanding of hydrology of these areas. Seasonality in the tropics produces rainy seasons versus dry seasons, leading to different hydrologic and water quality processes throughout the year. We questioned whether stable isotopes in water can be used to trace the seasonality in this region, despite experiencing a “drier” season, such as in a Tropical Humid location. This study examines the fluctuations of stable isotope compositions (δ18O and δD) in water balance components in a small (<1 km2) coffee agroforestry watershed located in central Costa Rica on the Caribbean side. Samples were collected in precipitation, groundwater, and stream water for more than two years, across seasons and at an hourly frequency during storm events to better characterize spatial and temporal variations of the isotopic composition and of the respective contribution of surface and deeper groundwater to streamflow in the watershed. Isotope composition in precipitation ranged from -18.5 to -0.3‰ (∂18O) and -136.4 to 13.7‰ (∂D), and data indicate that atmospheric moisture cycling plays an important role in this region. A distinct seasonality was observed in monthly-averaged data between enriched dry season events as compared with the rainy season events. Streamflow data indicate that a deep groundwater system contributes significantly to baseflow, although a shallow, spring-driven system also contributes to stream water within the watershed. During storm events, precipitation contributes to stormflow in the short-term, confirming the role of superficial runoff. These results indicate that isotopes are helpful to partition the water balance even in a Tropical Humid situation where the rainfall seasonality is weak.",

            "abstract": "Combined U-Pb-Hf isotope studies of zircons provide new insights into the evolution of large-scale, long-term orogenic systems, applicable to understanding supercontinental cycles throughout Earth history. Three types of Hf arrays exist on Phanerozoic Earth: (1) long term isotopic contraction to positive epilson Hf values, reflecting circum-Pacific type orogenesis; (2) fanning isotopic array associated with ongoing collisional orogenesis involving repeated Wilson-cycles; (3) crustal reworking arrays typical of backarc opening and closing during slow convergence of continents, such as Phanerozoic Europe.\nEach Phanerozoic array has its Precambrian precursors, at least to 3.0 Ga. Global isotopic contraction similar to the Phanerozoic circum-Pacific system is also recorded between 2.0-1.6 Ga, and less obviously between 2.8-2.5 Ga, suggesting global scale symmetrical subduction systems dominated by accretionary orogenesis since the Late Archean. Fanning arrays between 2.2-1.8 Ga and 1.2-0.6 Ga reflect dominantly collisional processes associated with amalgamation of Nuna and Gondwana, whereas the Mesoproterozoic (1.6-1.2 Ga) produces a dominantly reworking array like that of Phanerozoic Europe.\nCircum-Pacific subduction reflects hemispheric-scale, whole mantle convection and probably began approximately 2.8 Ga ago. Global scale accretionary orogens associated with this arrangement include the widespread Late Archean greenstone belts and the circum-Nuna Late Paleoproterozoic orogenic belts. The Mesoproterozoic era possibly represents progressive, slow collapse of a Panthalassic ocean surrounding Nuna, ultimately forming the Grenvillean orogenic system. This climactic event rearranged global mantle convection patterns, observed in the Neoproterozoic “Pan-African” Hf arrays, triggering a peculiar toroidal-type mantle convective cell that transitioned Rodinia to Gondwana.",

For this purpose, a moment-based cloud parcel model is used to translate Doppler cloud radar vertical velocity spectra and radiosonde measurements into a statistical distribution of in-cloud saturation ratio, S. Because cloud droplet growth/evaporation rates are proportional to S-1, the statistical analysis of fluctuations in S yields, among other quantities, direct information on the time correlation function of droplet growth rate. From this information a Green-Kubo relation is used to determine the diffusion coefficient for fluctuations along the coordinate of cloud droplet size, D, a key turbulence parameter used in the kinetic potential theory of drizzle formation. Measurements from the Azores, SGP, and TCAP sites are analyzed and compared. A significant finding is that the probability distribution function for fluctuations in S tends to be both highly symmetric about the equilibrium saturation ratio (S=1) and non-Gaussian. Indeed the distribution has much broader tails than the Gaussian and, for the cases we have studied, turns out to be in excellent agreement with the Voight lineshape.",

            "abstract": "Within the LSBB National Underground Research Laboratory (France), we performed an in situ multidisciplinary and multi-scale analysis of a small fault zone intersecting a layered carbonates reservoir. The study area is located in a gallery at 250 m depth in the unsaturated and unaltered zone of the reservoir. In order to study the distribution of the fault zone properties, we took advantage of the gallery wall and of three vertical 20 m long boreholes located near the fault core, in the damage zone, and in the host rock. Geological, petrophysical (porosity observations and measurements), geotechnical (Q-value) and geophysical measurements (acoustic velocities, uniaxial compressive strength, electrical resistivity, borehole logging), and injection tests were conducted at various scales. We show that horizontal and vertical variations in hydromechanical properties within the damage zone are related to the initial petrophysical properties of the host rock. In the initial low-porosity and fractured layers, the deformations are accommodated by fractures and micro-cracks extending significantly from the fault core. In these layers, the Young modulus of the rock mass (Em) is low and the permeability of the rock mass (Km) is high. In the initial porous and low fractured layers, deformations are accommodated by micro-mechanical processes resulting in a decrease in micro-porosity near the fault core. There is a rapid attenuation of the damage zone. In these layers, Em is high and Km is low. The seismic signature of this kind of fault is complex and the seismic visibility low making them hard to detect. Finally, to assess fault zone stability in case of CO2 injection and the risk of CO2 leakage through the fault itself, we performed some geomechanical numerical simulations and some field hydromechanical tests. We show that the presence of hydromechanical heterogeneity favors the fluid accumulation but strengthen the fault zone and impede fluid migration upward along the fault.",

            "abstract": "The chromosphere and transition region constitute the interface between the solar surface and the corona and modulate the flow of mass and energy into the upper atmosphere. IRIS was launched in 2013 to study the chromosphere and transition region. The complexity of the chromosphere is due to various regime changes that take place across it, like: Hydrogen goes from predominantly neutral to predominantly ionized; the plasma behavior changes from collisional to collision-less; it goes from gas-pressure dominated to magnetically driven, etc. Consequently, the interpretation of chromospheric observations in general and those from IRIS, in particular, is a challenging task. It is thus crucial to combine IRIS observations with advanced radiative-MHD numerical modeling. Because the photosphere, chromosphere and transition region are partially ionized, the interaction between ionized and neutral particles has important consequences on the magneto-thermodynamics of these regions. We implemented the effects of partial ionization using generalized Ohm’s law in the Bifrost code (Gudiksen et al. 2011) which solves the full MHD equations with non-grey and non-LTE radiative transfer and thermal conduction along magnetic field lines. The implementation of partial ionization effects impact our modeled radiative-MHD atmosphere, such as producing chromospheric heating and diffusion of photospheric magnetic field into the upper-chromosphere. We will focus on which observables of these processes can be revealed with IRIS.",

Whereas D2O and H2O depolymerize the silicate melt to similar degrees, protium and deuterium intramolecular partitioning between different molecular sites within the glasses is very large and controlled by a strong preferential association of deuterons to sites with short O-D•••O distances. This preference is independent of total water content and D/H ratio. Substantial intramolecular D-H partitioning is also observed in a glass with a model hydrous basalt composition. Such large isotope partitioning cannot result from classic equilibrium fractionation because of the high synthesis temperature. Potential kinetic isotope effects are excluded via a slow quench experiment. The partitioning is likely governed by density/molar volume isotope effects, where deuterium prefers sites with smaller molar volume. Large intramolecular site partitioning in melts could lead to significant D-H partitioning between water saturated melt and exsolved aqueous fluid (where D/HW,Melt ≠ D/HW,Fluid) during crystallization of Earth’s magma ocean, potentially controlling the D/H content of the Earth’s oceans.",

            "abstract": "Lidar waveform instruments have been successfully used to quantify biophysical properties (e.g. height and biomass) of forests by examining the vertical profile of return laser energy from the surface. Although temporally consecutive lidar waveform data are feasible to detect abrupt changes such as clear-cut or forest fire in a large area, their application to study phenology or seasonal dynamics is novel and untested. A recent study, claiming no green-up in Amazon forests, suggested that Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)-derived metrics are potential candidates to capture seasonal variations in canopy structure and greenness. Those metrics are independent from sun-sensor geometry. Here, we focus on tests of three GLAS metrics, that is, (a) Waveform Centroid Relative Height (WCRH), (b) 1064 nm NIR apparent reflectance (AR), and (c) Leaf Area Index (LAI) for detecting seasonal dynamics in an already dense tropical rainforest. Our investigations show a seasonal green up in wet equatorial Amazonia (ΔLAI ~0.5 during the dry season). We highlight that the WCRH and AR are not explicitly sensitive over the high LAI condition (LAI ≥ 4.5), which may lead incorrect conclusions (e.g. consistent forest structure and greenness). In the case of WCRH, the metric would be useful to detect seasonal dynamics only when forests allow enough penetration of lidar energy (LAI from 0 to 4.0). On the other hand, AR is not recommended for identifying the seasonal greenness in Amazonian forests, whereas the metric could be used to screen invalid GLAS data.",

            "abstract": "The Mexican Central Pacific (MCP) is considered an oligotrophic area that holds important populations of different species with ecological and economic importance like marine mammals, billfish and tunas. Hydrographic mechanisms are responsible to interplay with the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients to support primary productivity for these food webs. It is argued that seasonal upwelling of bottom waters rich in nutrients generates distributed in patches of high-productivity, which are also linked to topographic continental forcing. The goal of this study is determine the presence of water masses, depth of the mixed layer, temperature, salinity, patterns of geostrophic currents and their influence on the spatiotemporal variability of inorganic nutrients. For that pupose, three oceanographic cruises were conducted in January, May-June, and October of 2010 off the coast of the MCP. Each campaign consisted of 15 stations in five perpendicular transects with stations at 2, 50 and 100 nm offshore. At each station samples were taken to determine the concentration of NO3-+ NO2-, NH4+, PO43- and SiO2 at 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150 and 200 m depth. CTD casts were made up to 500m to obtain profiles of salinity, temperature, water masses, and identify geostrophic currents (direction and intensity). Identified water masses were: Pacific Tropical Surface Water (PTSW), Pacific Equatorial Surface Water (PESW), Equatorial Pacific Water (EPW), California Current Water (CCW), Subtropical Subsurface Water (STSsW), and Pacific Intermediate Water (PIT); these water masses were present in all three seasons being more clear the presence of CCW during autumn and PTSW in winter. The interaction between coastal topography, geostrophic circulation, and the depth of the mixed layer (55m oceanic part in January and 10m coastal area in October) were the factors that determined the location of areas of high concentration of nutrients. The distribution of nutrients was heterogeneous, characterized by mesoscale structures beyond the continental shelf or coastal upwelling events; no significant difference between concentrations at different seasons of the year with the following ranges: 1.2-8.9 uM NO3-+ NO2-, NH4+ 0.8-12.4 mM, 0.1-5.0 mM PO43-, and 3.2-14.5 mM SiO2.",

Noble gas tracing is promising due to sensitivity of transport to: pore structure and sizes; phase partitioning between groundwater and liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons; and deformation from hydraulic fracturing and creation of surface area. A time-series of over thirty wellhead fluid samples were collected from two hydraulically-fractured wells with different oil-to-gas ratios, along with production data (i.e., flowrate and pressure). Tracer and production data sets can be combined to infer production flow regimes, to estimate reservoir transport parameters, and to improve forecasts of production decline.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

            "abstract": "Interest in the oceanic geochemistry of barium (Ba) stems from a variety of reasons including its use as a paleo-productivity indicator, its chemical similarity to Ra, and its utility as a water source tracer. To better constrain these uses of Ba, we have obtained trace element clean samples from both the North Atlantic and Eastern Pacific US GEOTRACES cruises. Analytical work on the Pacific samples is proceeding while work on the Atlantic samples is complete. For the Pacific, 36 stations were occupied from Peru to Tahiti. For the Atlantic, dissolved Ba was determined at 32 stations across the North Atlantic during US cruises GT10 and GT11 along the meridional transect from Lisbon to the Cape Verde Islands and the zonal transect from Cape Cod to the Mauritanian coast. In the Atlantic, the general distribution of dissolved Ba exhibits a vertical bifurcation at approximately 500 m into shallow versus deep water. The greatest variation is found on the eastern side of the basin with concentrations ranging from 35 nmol/kg at the near surface (100 m) to over 83 nmol/kg at depth. A reduction of Ba in excess of 20% compared to the average of mesopelagic depths less than 500 m is observed within the Canary Current upwelling zone east of the Cape Verde Islands and accompanied to some extent by a subsequent regeneration at depth. Below 500 m, dissolved Ba correlates well with dissolved Si, whereas the correlation with alkalinity is poor at depth and shows a decoupling above 500 m. There is evidence of hydrothermal Ba input at the TAG vent system of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge along transect GT11 as indicated by the rapid increase in the dissolved Ba below 2500 m in conjunction with increases in Fe and Mn. In addition to the hydrothermal source, a near surface (~40 m) maximum of 51 nmol/kg is found along the continental slope of North America in correspondence with a minimum surface salinity (34.75) and increased dissolved manganese indicating either fluvial or sediment input; however, a similar input is not evident along the North African continental margin. We will contrast the Atlantic distribution with the Pacific as data become available.",

            "abstract": "Lithium (Li) and boron (B) are incompatible light elements that preferentially partition into the fluid phase, whether melt or aqueous liquid, and thus are useful for tracking fluid-related processes in rocks. Currently, most of the Li isotopic data available on subduction-related rocks are whole-rock analysis; and the few B isotopic analyses on subduction material have been carried out on whole-rock or in-situ in accessory phase (tourmaline).\nThe new method presented here couples an ESI New Wave UP-193-FX ArF* (193 nm) excimer laser ablation microscope with a Neptune Plus (Thermo Scientific) MC-ICP-MS. In situ B and Li isotopic analyses were carried out on mica and pyroxenes from jadeitites and albite mica-rocks from a subduction-related mélange. These results have been compared with SIMS analyses for B on the same mineral samples and with MC-ICP-MS analyses for Li on whole-rock or a mineral separate from the same sample.\nThe results show that for B concentrations above 15 µg/g, the data obtained by LA-MC-ICPMS and by SIMS are similar within error, for both mica and pyroxene. The significant improvement of LA-MC-ICPMS compared to SIMS is the duration of measurements: one analysis takes 3 minutes by LA-MC-ICPMS, and 32 minutes by SIMS. Such a method therefore permits multiplying the number of isotopic analyses, providing a better interpretation of the studied samples, with a lateral resolution and an error on each measurement similar to those obtained with SIMS. The results show that for Li concentrations above 10µg/g, the data obtained by LA-MC-ICPMS and by MC-ICP-MS are also similar within error, for both mica and pyroxene. The significant improvement of LA-MC-ICPMS compared to MC-ICP-MS is better spatial resolution. Indeed, many of the mineral phases encountered in subduction-related rocks display a strong chemical zoning, and the analyses carried out by wet chemistry and MC-ICP-MS average the isotopic values of the different zones. This newly developed method permits in-situ analysis of B and Li isotopes in a short time in subduction rock-forming minerals, with an error equal or lower than methods used previously.",

This paper focuses on the development of web modules based on case studies in Coastal Louisiana, one of three ecosystems that comprise an ongoing hydrology education online system called HydroViz. The Chenier Plain ecosystem in Coastal Louisiana provides an abundance of concepts and scenarios appropriate for use in many undergraduate water resource and hydrology curricula. The modules rely on a set of hydrologic data collected within the Chenier Plain along with inputs and outputs of eco-hydrology and vegetation-change simulation models that were developed to analyze different restoration and protection projects within the 2012 Louisiana Costal Master Plan. The modules begin by investigating the basic features of the basin and it hydrologic characteristics. The eco-hydrology model is then introduced along with its governing equations, numerical solution scheme and how it represents the study domain. Concepts on water budget in a coastal basin are then introduced using the simulation model inputs, outputs and boundary conditions. The complex relationships between salinity, water level and vegetation changes are then investigated through the use of the simulation models and associated field data. Other student activities focus on using the simulation models to evaluate tradeoffs and impacts of actual restoration and protection projects that were proposed as part of 2012 Louisiana Master Plan. The hands-on learning activities stimulate student learning of hydrologic and water management concepts by providing real-world context and opportunity to build fundamental knowledge as well as practical skills. The modules are delivered through a carefully designed user interface using open source and free technologies which enable wide dissemination and encourage adaptation by others.",

            "abstract": "While well-developed magmatic and tectonic segmentation is observed in late-stage rifts, little is known about the controls on the initiation and development of magmatism and segmentation in young rifts. The Lake Malawi/Nyasa region in the East African Rift System (EARS) is a region of early rifting that exhibits tectonic segmentation and little volcanism. The only magmatism in this region occurs in an accommodation zone between segments at the northern end of the lake, in the Rungwe Volcanic Province, rather than in the segment center as observed in mid-ocean ridges and late-stage rifts. This phenomenon is also observed elsewhere in EARS and in other young rifts, but the origin and distribution of magma at depth and its role in extension and segmentation is unknown. In the initial phase of the SEGMeNT project, 14 broadband seismometers were deployed in the Rungwe Volcanic Province during August 2013. Data from teleseismic events recorded on these stations, in combination with data from previous seismic networks deployed in southern Tanzania, are being used to develop preliminary models of crust and upper mantle structure for elucidating the role of magmatism in early-stage rifting. Crustal structure is being investigated using H-k stacking of receiver functions and upper mantle structure is being modeled tomographically using P and S arrival times.",

            "abstract": "The end-to-end principle, enunciated by Clark and Saltzer in 1981 enabled an Internet implementation in which there was a symmetry among the network nodes in the sense that no node was architecturally distinguished. Each interface to the network had a unique and accessible address and could communicate on equal terms with any other interface or collection of interfaces. In this egalitarian implementation there was in consequence no architectural distinction between providers and consumers of content - any network node could play either role. As the Internet spread to university campuses, incoming students found 10 megabit Ethernet in the dorm - while their parents at home were still stuck with 56 kilobit dialup. In the two decades bisected by the millenium, this combination of speed and symmetry on campus and beyond led to a panoply of transformational Internet applications such as Internet video conferencing and billion dollar industries like Google, Yahoo!, and Facebook. This talk places early Internet history in a social context, elaborates on the social and economic outcomes, defines“middlebox friction”, discusses its erosive consequences, and suggests a solution to restore symmetry to the Internet-at-large.",

            "abstract": "Peak discharges estimates for a given return period are of primary importance in engineering practice for risk assessment and hydraulic structure design. Different statistical methods are chosen here for the assessment of flood frequency curve: one indirect technique based on the extreme rainfall event analysis, the Peak Over Threshold (POT) model and the Annual Maxima approach as direct techniques using river discharge data. In the framework of the indirect method, a Monte Carlo simulation approach is adopted to determine a derived frequency distribution of peak runoff using a probabilistic formulation of the SCS-CN method as stochastic rainfall-runoff model. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate a sample of different runoff events from different stochastic combination of rainfall depth, storm duration, and initial loss inputs. The distribution of the rainfall storm events is assumed to follow the GP law whose parameters are estimated through GEV's parameters of annual maximum data. The evaluation of the initial abstraction ratio is investigated since it is one of the most questionable assumption in the SCS-CN model and plays a key role in river basin characterized by high‑permeability soils, mainly governed by infiltration excess mechanism. In order to take into account the uncertainty of the model parameters, this modified approach, that is able to revise and re‑evaluate the original value of the initial abstraction ratio, is implemented. In the POT model the choice of the threshold has been an essential issue, mainly based on a compromise between bias and variance. The Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution fitted to the annual maxima discharges is therefore compared with the Pareto distributed peaks to check the suitability of the frequency of occurrence representation. The methodology is applied to a large dam in the Serchio river basin, located in the Tuscany Region. The application has shown as Monte Carlo simulation technique can be a useful tool to provide more robust estimation of the results obtained by direct statistical methods.",

            "abstract": "δ18O is a very common proxy used in palaeoclimate studies all over the world, but for most parts of the world and especially the Tibetan Plateau modern studies that trace the pathway of this isotope from sink to source are lacking. In this study, financed by the BMBF (German Ministry of Science and Education, Project CADY), we present data that fill this gap. The study was performed in the terminal lake Nam Co, the biggest lake on the central Tibetan Plateau and its catchment. Water of the main tributaries to the lake, lake water at three different stations and from different water depths, bulk carbonate collected from different water depths with sediment traps and shells of living ostracods were collected for one year at lake Nam Co in approx. monthly intervals and analyzed for their δ18O values.\nThe inflowing river waters mainly reflect the precipitation and show regional as well as seasonal variations depending on their location and on Monsoon or Westerly season but are in general on the global meteoric waterline. The lake water shows only minor vertical and spatial variations and is clearly off the meteoric waterline due to strong evaporation effects in this terminal lake. δ18O values of the bulk carbonate of sediment collected in sediment traps show only minor vertical and spatial variations during the year and the δ18O offset compared to the lake water is with around 1 ‰ quite small. Most probably this is attributed to chemical fractionation during formation of monohydrocalcite in the water column. In contrast δ18O values of ostracod shells are significant heavier than the lake water indicating isotopic fractionation (vital effect) during shell formation. In addition a seasonal variability is visible.\nThe data of this proxy calibration study give now for the first time the opportunity to validate δ18O proxy data measured on core material from Lake Nam Co for their palaeoclimatic significance.",

            "abstract": "Arid and semi-arid regions face serious challenges in the management of scarce water resources. This situation tends to become worse with the increasing population growth rates and consequently increasing water demand. Groundwater is the most important water resource in these areas and, therefore, the sustainability of its use depends on the effectiveness in which it is managed, both in terms of quantity and quality. The Caetité Experimental Basin (CEB), located in a semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil, faces not only the challenges associated with water scarcity, but also changes in landscape and potential contamination processes due to mining activity. The only active uranium production center in Brazil (URA) is located in this watershed and the sustainability of mining and milling operations as well as the survival of the local community are highly dependent on the availability of groundwater resources. Hydrogeological studies in this area are scarce, and the potential contamination and overexploitation of groundwater can not be ruled out. Therefore, a national project was launched in order to improve the understanding and quantification of the interaction between the hydrogeological system and human health. The methodological approach involved hydrological and geochemical monitoring and characterization of the CEB, use of isotopic techniques, groundwater modeling, water quality diagnosis and human health risk assessment due to water ingestion. The results suggested that the groundwater in the CEB are not totally connected, with evidence of a mixture of recent and old waters. The Na-Ca-HCO3-Cl is the dominant water type (50%) followed by Ca-Na-HCO3-Cl water type (17%). The relevant non-radioactive contaminants are Mn, F, NO3 and Ba, mostly from natural origin, with the exception of NO3 that could be associated with the livestock activities. The estimated effective doses due to groundwater ingestion containing radionuclides are below the recommended reference level (1 mSv/year) for drinking water in existing exposure situation and do not represent significant radiological impact.",

As Rosetta approached to and within 100 km of the comet, enhanced fluxes of electrons were observed at energies below a few hundred eV. In one case on Aug. 2, 2014, the enhanced fluxes were observed during a time when the comet activity (gas and/or dust ejections) was observed by the multispectral imager (OSIRIS), suggesting the start of coma development. In another instance on Aug. 7, 2014, a large enhancement of electron fluxes was at energies in the tens of eV range, indicative of possible photoelectrons emitted from the nucleus.

            "abstract": "The ready availability of remotely sensed imagery offers the potential to examine river dynamics and planform characteristics at global scales. The Landsat archive currently offers the greatest spatial and temporal coverage of the entire globe. However, at 30 meter multispectral resolution detailed and accurate examination of planform changes using Landsat imagery is restricted to intermediate (~ 500 m wide) to very large (~ 1 km wide) rivers or smaller rivers with very high rates of change. Many of these larger river systems exhibit multi-threaded or braided channel patterns that present significant challenges for many of the existing methodologies for quantifying changes developed for single threaded meandering river systems. In order to examine planform changes in river systems across all scales and morphologies we developed a set of algorithms for quantifying river mobility and planform attributes using raster-based river masks extracted from remotely sensed data. Unlike many prior methodologies for measuring river migration and erosion that rely on changes in the position of river channel centerlines, our methods adopt river banks as a frame of reference for quantifying change. The choice of a bank-centric reference frame was motivated by both a primary interest in the spatial and temporal patterns of bank change and the significant challenge of extracting and comparing channel centerlines in multi-threaded systems. Unlike prior vector-based analysis of river channels, our analysis retains a raster-based representation of the river from the original imagery source. At each bank pixel, our algorithms compute linear rates of bank change, local channel width, bank curvature, and bank aspect (used for examination of the influence of thermal processes such as freeze thaw and permafrost influence). The spatially distributed measurements are also aggregated along equally spaced river segments to examine spatial patterns in erosion/accretion rates, and channel widths (both mean and effective in multi-threaded systems). Using our set of algorithms, we have successfully analyzed rivers varying in width from 10s of meters to greater than 1000 meters. Imagery sources have included aerial photography, high resolution satellite imagery, and coarser imagery such as SPOT, ASTER, and Landsat.",

            "abstract": "This work focuses on the export of trace metals and combustion residues from land to ocean and on the Southeast continental margin of Brazil and its historical variability using stable lead isotopes. Two sediment cores were collected, one in highly impacted Guanabara Bay and the other on the Southeast continental shelf. Continental shelf samples were analyzed for trace element concentrations [Mn (117±50 ppm), Ni (6.5±2.3 ppm), Zn (5.0±1.5), (233±46 ppm), ], Pb (5.4±2.4 ppm), as well as Cu, Ag, Cd, Sr, Ba, Tl, U and Pb isotope ratios & Pb-210. Most of the elements show higher concentrations on the upper part of the core compared to the bottom. Downcore changes of the concentrations of these elements were similar. The sediments of adjacent rivers and bays around the upper section of the southeast continental shelf of Brazil are considered highly enriched with Pb, Zn, Cu and Cr such as Guanabara Bay, Sepetiba Bay and Paraíba do Sul River compared with the natural concentrations and other regions in the world. A [Pb] maximum is seen between samples from 24 to 43 cm (~8 ppm). Utilization of tetraethyl lead (TEL) gasoline in Brazil was phased out beginning in 1983 and was largely completed by 1988. Continental shelf Pb-206/Pb-207 varies between 1.174 near the core top to 1.190 at 100 cm, with a sharp difference between samples at 6 and 8 cm. Higher core top Pb, Zn, and Ni corroborate the recent anthropogenic influence on the southeast continental shelf of Brazil. For Guanabara Bay sediment samples [Pb] varies between 90 ppm near the top to 1 ppm at the bottom. Pb-206/Pb-207 varies between 1.161 near the core top to 1.165 near the bottom. Using triple isotope plots we can discern different sources of lead to the region and how these vary with time.",

            "abstract": "Pc1 Pearl Pulsations are a time-modulated electromagnetic wave in the Pc1 band of the ULF spectrum. They are believed to be a subclass of electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves, and so are generated through the ion cyclotron instability. There have been rare isolated in situ observations of these pearl pulsations in the past, but the location and sensitivity of the Van Allen Probes spacecraft have provided us with an unprecedented number of events. Roughly a third of observed wave activity within the EMIC frequency range exhibits pearl structure, which is consistent with ground-based observations. Analysis of the central frequency dependence on the background field and their occurrence probability with respect to magnetic activity indices implies that there may exist a fundamental difference between the generation mechanisms for structured and unstructured EMIC waves. These waves often exhibit a rising frequency tone with a frequency sweep rate on the order of that observed within EMIC-triggered emissions. This frequency sweep in time has recently been proposed as exhibiting a more efficient method of wave-particle interactions with ultrarelativistic electrons. As such, we will examine conjunction events with the Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite spacecraft suggesting EMIC-driven electron precipitation. As of August of 2014, the Van Allen Probes spacecraft will have undergone one full precession around Earth, allowing for observations spanning the full range in MLT. We will therefore present here a comparative statistical analysis of EMIC waves, both pearl pulsations and unstructured, compiled over full coverage of the near-equatorial magnetosphere from L=~2-6.5.",

Meteor wind data from Cariri and Cachoeira Paulista (Brazil) and medium Frequency (MF) radar wind data from Tirunelveli (India) are analyzed together with TIMED/SABER temperature in the 40 km – 100 km region to characterize the zonal and vertical propagations of these waves. Also analyzed are the F region evening vertical drift and spread F (ESF) development features as diagnosed by Digisondes operated at Fortaleza and Sao Luis in Brazil. The SABER temperature data permitted determination of the upward propagation characteristics of the FK (E1) waves with propagation speed in the range of 4 km/day. The radar Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) winds in the widely separated longitude sectors have yielded the eastward phase velocity of the both the FK and UFK waves. The vertical propagation of these waves cause strong oscillation in the F region evening prereversal vertical drift, observed for the first time at both FK and UFK periodicities. A delay of a few (~10) days is observed in the F region vertical drift perturbation with respect to the corresponding FK/UFK zonal wind oscillations, or temperature oscillations in the MLT region, which has permitted a direct identification of the sunset electro dynamic coupling process as responsible for the generation of the FK/UFK induced vertical drift oscillation. The vertical drift oscillations are found to cause significant modulation in the spread F/ plasma bubble irregularity development. The overall results highlight the role of FK/UFK waves in the day-to-day variability of the ESF in its occurrence season.",

            "abstract": "There is uncertainty surrounding the duration, magnitude and frequency of historical hydroclimatic extremes such as hydrologic droughts and floods prior to the observed record. In regions where paleoclimatic studies are less reliable, Global Climate Models (GCMs) can provide useful information about past hydroclimatic conditions. This study evaluates the use of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) GCMs to enhance the understanding of historical droughts and floods across the Canadian Prairie region in the Nelson-Churchill Watershed (NCW).\nThe NCW is approximately 1.4 million km2 in size and drains into Hudson Bay in Northern Manitoba, Canada. One hundred years of observed hydrologic records show extended dry and wet periods in this region; however paleoclimatic studies suggest that longer, more severe droughts have occurred in the past. In Manitoba, where hydropower is the primary source of electricity, droughts are of particular interest as they are important for future resource planning.\nTwenty-three GCMs with daily runoff are evaluated using 16 metrics for skill in reproducing historic annual runoff patterns. A common 56-year historic period of 1950-2005 is used for this evaluation to capture wet and dry periods. GCM runoff is then routed at a grid resolution of 0.25° using the WATFLOOD hydrological model storage-routing algorithm to develop streamflow scenarios. Reservoir operation is naturalized and a consistent temperature scenario is used to determine ice-on and ice-off conditions. These streamflow simulations are compared with the historic record to remove bias using quantile mapping of empirical distribution functions. GCM runoff data from pre-industrial and future projection experiments are also bias corrected to obtain extended streamflow simulations.\nGCM streamflow simulations of more than 650 years include a stationary (pre-industrial) period and future periods forced by radiative forcing scenarios. Quantile mapping adjusts for magnitude only while maintaining the GCM’s sequencing of events, allowing for the examination of differences in historic and future hydroclimatic extremes. These bias corrected streamflow scenarios provide an alternative to stochastic simulations for hydrologic data analysis and can aid future resource planning and environmental studies.",

Sampling efforts for modelling applications can be expensive and time consuming and can lead to the collection of large data sets that go unused. In this study, we assessed the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of model prediction of FIB concentrations (culturable and qPCR) using environmental data collected onsite vs. publicly available data (such as EnDDaT) with the goal of offering states and beach managers a cost efficient alternative for model development. Multilinear regression (MLR) models were developed to predict the concentration of enterococci in fresh and marine beaches using model input data from on-site monitoring equipment as well as publicly available, near-site data. False negative and false positive predictions of each model were calculated via a threshold analysis. Comparison of model performance at a Great Lake beach revealed that adding on-site data inputs yielded about a 38% higher adjusted R-square (indicating a better fit to the data) and better predictive performance compared to using only publicly available data inputs. Although the models using both datasets were 14% better at predicting regulatory exceedances, the model using only publicly available data was slightly better at predicting non-exceedances. We also compared MLR model input data requirements with the input data requirements needed to develop watershed process models. In a simulation where six different manure-based contaminant sources were evaluated to determine the health risk impacts to a receptor location downstream from the sources of contamination, the watershed model predicted the distributions of three waterborne pathogens (Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, and E. coli 0157) based on rainfall impacting the watershed. Although this type of analysis identifies which pathogens are important, when they are important, and which sources contribute to their presence, the effort is data intensive and might only be warranted when assessment of FIB or pathogen concentrations requires a continuous linkage between source and receptor, as is the case for tributary-impacted beaches.",

The submarine ice draft data are unique in providing high resolution measurements over long transects of the ice covered ocean. The data has been used to document a multidecadal drop in ice thickness, and for validating and improving numerical sea-ice models.\nA submarine upward-looking sonar draft measurement is made by a sonar transducer mounted in the sail or deck of the submarine. An acoustic beam is transmitted upward through the water column, reflecting off the bottom of the sea ice and returning to the transducer. Ice thickness is estimated as the difference between the ship’s depth (measured by pressure) and the acoustic range to the bottom of the ice estimated from the travel time of the sonar pulse. Digital recording systems can provide the return off the water-ice interface as well as returns that have penetrated the ice. Typically, only the first return from the ice hull is analyzed. Information regarding ice flow interstitial layers provides ice age information and may possibly be derived with the entire return signal. The approach being investigated is similar to that used in measuring bottom sediment layers and will involve measuring the echo level from the first interface, solving the reflection loss from that transmission, and employing reflection loss versus impedance mismatch to ascertain ice structure information.",

OBSIP is comprised of three Institutional Instrument Contributors each of whom contribute instruments and technical support to the pool and an OBSIP Management Office.\nIn the past year, OBSIP has provided instruments for five experiments and supported over 12 research cruises recovering and/or deploying instruments. The most extensive OBSIP experiment in the past few years has been the Cascadia Initiative. The Cascadia Initiative is an onshore/offshore seismic and geodetic experiment deployed in the Pacific Northwest to study questions surrounding the evolution of the Juan de Fuca plate and the Gorda plate. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), OBSIP IIC's built 60 new ocean bottom seismometers. Both LDEO and SIO designed new seismometer packages to withstand trawling by local fisherman for deployment in shallow areas. The Cascadia Initiative has required close cooperation between the OBSIP, the Deep Submergence Facility, the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (who coordinates ship schedules for the cruises), and the Cascadia Initiative Expedition Team.\nAt the recent ARRA Workshop, members from the scientific community met to discuss the future of the ARRA instruments and determine how OBS instrumentation can be best utilized to serve the scientific community. The OBSIP Management Office has developed a comprehensive Data Quality Plan that includes all steps of the data collection process, from instrument design to quality controlling data after it is uploaded to the Data Management Center. The OBSIP Management Office and the IICs are starting to review current data quality practices as the first step in the Data Quality Plan.

            "abstract": "Feeding the world requires 70 percent more food for an additional 2.3 billion people by 2050. The increasing competition for water resources prompts the modern consumer society to become more efficient with scarce water resources. The water footprint of agriculture is hundred times more than the footprint for domestic water use, yet we do not fully know how much water is used in relation to the amount of food being produced. Water Productivity describes the crop yield per unit of water consumed and is the ultimate indicator for the efficiency of water use in agriculture. Our basic understanding of actual and benchmark values for Water Productivity is limited, partially because operational measurements and guidelines for Water Productivity do not currently exist.\nRemote sensing algorithms have been developed over the last 20 years to compute crop yield Y and evapotranspiration ET, often in an independent manner. The new WatPro and GlobWat algorithms are based on directly solving the Y/ET ratio. Several biophysical parameter and processes such as solar radiation, Leaf Area Index, stomatal aperture and soil moisture affect biomass production and crop transpiration simultaneously, and this enabled us to simplify the schematization of a Y/ET model. Global maps of wheat, rice and maize were prepared from various open-access data sources, and Y/ET was computed across a period of 10 years.\nThe global distribution demonstrates that 66 percent of the world’s agricultural land cultivated with wheat, rice and corn performs below average. Furthermore, Water Productivity in most countries exhibits a significant spatial variability. Therefore, there is significant scope to produce the same food - or more food - from less water resources if packages with good practices are locally implemented. The global maps of water productivity will be demonstrated, along with some country examples. ",

            "abstract": "Although coastal zones represent important contributors to the increasing levels of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), it is still unclear which role benthic processes play and whether marine sediments represent sinks or sources for N2O, since interactions among closely associated microbial groups lead to a high degree of variability. In addition, coastal areas are extremely dynamic regions, often exposed to increased nutrient loading and conditions of depleted oxygen. We investigated benthic N2O fluxes and how environmental conditions affect N2O production in different sediments at 2 different geographical locations (German Wadden Sea, a California coastal lagoon). At each location, a total of 32 sediment cores were taken in areas that differed in sediment type, organic content and pore-water nutrient concentrations, as well as in bioturbation activity. Parallel cores were incubated under in-situ conditions, low oxygen and increased nitrate levels for 10 days. Zones of N2O production and consumption were identified in intact cores by N2O microprofiles at the beginning and end of the experiments. In a collaborative effort to determine the dominant sources of N2O, samples were taken throughout the course of the experiments for the determination of the isotopic composition of N2O (as well as nitrate, nitrite and ammonium). Our results indicate that both, nitrate addition and low oxygen conditions in the overlying water, caused an increase of subsurface N2O production in most sediments, with a high variability between different sediment types. N2O production in the sediments was accompanied by N2O consumption, reducing the fluxes to the water column. In general, organic rich sediments showed the strongest response to environmental changes with increased production and efflux of N2O into the overlying water. Bioturbation activity added to the complexity of N2O dynamics by an increase in nitrification-denitrification processes, as well as enhanced pore-water transport. The results will be used in a metabolic modeling approach that will allow numerical simulation and prediction of sedimentary N2O dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate rocks undergo karstic process and karst morphology is a key to understand the nature and genesis of caves. The primary energy source for the formation of karst landforms is hydrological cycle. Geomorphic features along with hydrological characteristics provide important information not only on karst formation but also climate and environmental conditions. In this paper, we present the tectonic and geomorphic features that played a role in evolution of caves located in Chhattisgarh and Orissa States of India. The geomorphic and tectonic aspects of Kotumsar, Kailash, and Gupteshwar caves are discussed in relation to the origin and evolution of these caves.\nCaves are located near the water falls. The area is folded and faulted along the Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt (EGMB) due to tectonic reactivation. Shaly-limestone beds exhibit vertical dipping near Gupteshwar cave, and steeply inclined near Kotumsar and Kailash caves. Indrāvati and Sabari/Kolab tributaries of the Godavari River drain the area.\nThe landscape evolution and the origin of caves in the region is a multistage process, where the lithology, orogeny, fluvial action, and monsoon are the main agents, which is similar to the four state model (Ford and Ewers, 1978). The river basin evolution and regional tectonism also caused the initiation of karstification in the region.\nThe evolution of caves is believed to have taken place in Pre-Pliocene under more humid conditions that coincided with the initiation of monsoon in India. Further, during the Quaternary wet-dry/cold-warm phases altered physical and chemical weathering of limestone rocks. Contrasting relief features of Bastar plateau have also helped the extensive cave formation in the region. The dissolution along weak planes initiated the openings of caves, further enlarged by geomorphic agents. Both monsoon and tectonics have caused fluctuations in water levels along river courses, which acted as active agents in evolution of caves.",

This presentation uses information based on the case study of a recent project that worked closely with water managers to incorporate stochastic climate conditions into two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (CE-QUAL-W2) in order to examine the downstream impacts of reservoir operations at Shasta Lake in northern California. The inclusion of reservoir operational rules was incorporated into the coupled model in order to better represent the operating conditions under which management decisions are made. Shasta Dam utilizes a unique temperature control device (TCD) that allows water releases from multiple levels of the reservoir in order to control downstream temperatures and meet management guidelines for Chinook salmon. The case study illustrates how three characteristics of a decision system influence the use of climate science: (i) the built structural components of ecosystem service delivery, (ii) institutional rule structures that include regulatory systems, operational rules, and informal decision criteria, (iii) decision systems used to manage competing demands on a natural resource. Additional cases are used to develop a general framework for understanding under what conditions climate science can provide information useful to decision makers.",

Winter cover crops (WCC) use has been highlighted for the reduction of nitrate leaching over the fallow season. Although various WCC practices are currently conducted in local croplands, the water quality improvement benefits of WCC have not been studied thoroughly at the watershed scale. The objective of this study is to assess the long-term impacts of WCC on reducing nitrate loadings using a processed-based watershed model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Remote sensing based estimates of WCC biomass will be used to calibrate plant growth processes of SWAT and its nutrient cycling. The study will be undertaken in two-paired agricultural watersheds in the Coastal Plain of CBW. Multiple WCC practice scenarios will be prepared to investigate how nitrate loading varies with crop species, planting dates, and implementation areas. The performance of WCC on two-paired watersheds will be compared in order to understand the effects of different watershed characteristics on nitrate uptake by crops. The results will demonstrate the nitrate reduction efficiency of different WCC practices and identify the targeting area for WCC implementation at the watershed scale. This study will not only integrate remote sensing data into the physically based model but also extend our understandings of WCC functions. This will provide key information for effective conservation decision making.\nKey words: Water quality, Chesapeake Bay Watershed, Winter Cover Crop, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)",

            "abstract": "We study wavefield effects in elastic isotropic 3-D seismic structures derived from the temperature field of a high resolution mantle circulation model. More specifically, we quantify the structural dispersion of traveltime residuals of direct P- and S-waves in a model with realistic length-scales and magnitudes of the variations in seismic velocities and density. 3-D global wave propagation is simulated using a spectral element method, and traveltime residuals are measured in four different frequency bands by cross-correlation of 3-D and 1-D synthetic waveforms. Intrinsic (dissipative) attenuation is deliberately neglected, so that any variation of traveltimes with frequency can be attributed to structural effects. Additional simulations are performed for a model in which 3-D structure is removed in the upper 800 km to isolate the dispersion signal of the lower mantle. One question that we address is whether the structural length-scales inherent to a vigorously convecting mantle give rise to significant body-wave dispersion.\nIn our synthetic dataset, the difference between long-period and short-period traveltime residuals generally increases with increasing short-period residual. However, we do not find an exact linear dependence, and in case of P-waves even non-monotonic behaviour. At largest short-period residuals, average dispersion is on the order of 2 s for both P- and S-waves and even larger when structure is confined to the lower mantle. Dispersion also appears to be asymmetric; that is, larger for negative than for positive residuals. The standard deviations of both P- and S-wave residuals also increase with increasing period and we discuss possible explanations for this behaviour. Overall, wavefield effects in both models are generally stronger for P-waves than for S-waves at the same frequencies.\nWe also find that for certain combinations of periods, the difference between the respective residuals is very similar between the \"whole mantle\" and the \"lower mantle\" model. Signals from upper mantle structure seem to mostly cancel in these cases, at least for certain length-scales. \"Differential-frequency\" traveltime residuals could thus represent a new seismological observable that may prove useful for tomographic studies of the lower mantle.",

            "abstract": "The area of Western Haiti is located between the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault (EPGF) and Ciabao-Oriente Septentrional fault systems. It has been investigated during the Haiti-SIS cruise (November-December 2012) by heat flow measurements and coring. These two strike-slip fault systems accommodate the relative motion between the Caribbean and North American plates. An aftershock study of the MW= 7, 12 January 2010 earthquake indicated that this event originated along the EPGF fault, while the septentrional fault has not been ruptured for about a century.\nWe focused coring operations on specific zones; faults, basin margins, ridge, deep basins delimated using structural/sedimentological surface data. The objective of the pore-fluid study was to determine both the pathways of the fluids and their origin in relation with the fault activity.\nA total of 14 Kullenberg cores were collected for fluid sampling and sedimentological analyses. Overall, 99 pore fluids were extracted, using Rhizon® samplers. Major and minor dissolved elements were analyzed. The resulting dataset allows us to identify several diagenetic processes occurring within the upper section of the sedimentary column. For the fault-crossing zones, the vertical chloride and sulphate profiles where the dissolved-element concentrations are close to that of normal seawater suggest seawater downward flow (infiltration). There the faults would then act as recharge zones for fluid circulation. On the opposite, for cores recovered in the basins, dissolved element profiles exhibit variable shapes with sulfate concentration decreasing with depth (indicating organic matter oxydation or anaerobic oxidation of methane) These results will be combined with those from the emerged segment of the EPGF (that can be observed on land in Haiti) in order to have a picture of the hydrologic regime of the fault system, its capacity to act as a recharge zone and conversely to supply deep-seated fluids to the surface (discharge zones).",

The expense and logistical challenges of field measurement campaigns can be cost-prohibitive and because of short funding cycles for research, access to consistent, stable study sites can be lost.

            "abstract": "Global warming is expected to increase the frequency and severity of droughts, extreme precipitation events and heatwaves. Recent studies have underlined the critical impacts of these extremes on the terrestrial carbon cycle, particularly on the dynamics of vegetation. Yet, the latest IPCC report reveals large uncertainties in extremes trends and biomass impacts. Conversely, new advances in satellite Earth observation have led to the recent development of consistent global historical records of crucial environmental and climatic variables – like surface soil moisture, soil water storage, terrestrial evaporation or vegetation water content. These datasets provide alternative means to unravel the processes driving past climate extremes, uncover the spatiotemporal scales at which these extremes operate and understand their impact on terrestrial biomass.\nThe SAT-EX project (funded by BELSPO) recently raised with the purpose of exploring the potential of the state-of-art remote sensing datasets to study the causes and consequences of the spatiotemporal changes in wet, dry and warm spells over the past three decades. Core methodologies involve the analysis of satellite-based climate extreme indices and vegetation characteristics through a novel combination of machine learning methods and fingerprint identification approaches. First results will show how droughts, heatwaves and extreme rain events have changed in frequency and intensity since the '80s, and attribute these changes to on-going processes like the widening of the tropical belt, ocean-atmospheric teleconnections, the intensification of land-atmospheric feedbacks or the overall rise in greenhouse gasses (and expected acceleration of the hydrological cycle). At the same time, our analyses will uncover the effects of climate extremes on large-scale vegetation dynamics.\nFurther phases in the project will involve the evaluation of IPCC Earth System Models on the basis of their skill to reproduce the effects of climate extremes on vegetation. In the long run, SAT-EX findings will advance towards the timely forecasting of climate extremes, provide valuable insights about the management of water resources during these events and reduce the uncertainty in long-term IPCC predictions of climate extremes and global vegetation variability.",

Utility of high resolution daily ET maps are large ranging from crop water management to watershed management. The aim of this work is to generate daily time series (10 years) ET and its components vegetation transpiration (T) and soil water evaporation (E) maps using Landsat 5 satellite data for Southern Great Plains forage–rangeland–winter wheat production system in Oklahoma (OK). Framework for generating these products included the two source energy balance (TSEB) algorithm and other important features were: (a) atmospheric correction algorithm; (b) spatially interpolated weather inputs; (c) functions for varying Priestley-Taylor coefficient; and (d) ET, E and T extrapolating algorithm utilizing reference ET. An extensive network of 140 weather stations managed by Oklahoma Mesonet was utilized to generate spatially interpolated inputs of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, pressure, and reference ET. Validation of the ET maps were done against eddy covariance data from two grassland sites at El Reno, OK suggested good performance (Table 1). Figure 1 illustrates a daily ET map for a very small subset of 18thJuly 2006 ET map, where difference in ET among different land uses such as the irrigated cropland, vegetation along drainage, and grassland is very distinct.

            "abstract": "On December 13, 2013, satellite imagery revealed a packet of internal waves propagating along the coast and was assumed to be connected to the Choctowachee Bay plume in the northern Gulf of Mexico. In situ profiles of current velocity, density and TKE dissipation were obtained to investigate the plume during the Surfzone Coastal Ocean Pathways Experiment. On December 17th, elevated river discharge, spring tidal velocities and weak winds (< 2.5 m/s) created a freshwater plume that propagated as a buoyant gravity front approximately 6.7 km west of Destin Pass inlet. Results revealed a subcritical gravity front that was dominated in the along-shore direction by Coriolis, pressure gradient, and friction forces. An unsteady trapped core (referred herein as a bolus) was observed ahead (westward) of the gravity front head. The bolus was identified by a bulge of westward near-surface flow that transported less-dense plume water in a turbulent trapped core. As the bolus propagated away from the gravity front head, momentum was reduced through turbulent mixing of the less dense fluid in the core with the ambient water at the trailing edge of the bulge. Eventually, the bolus arrested near the along-shore extent of residual stratification from a previous tidal plume. Bolus formation likely occurred when the gravity front decelerated below the first mode internal wave speed. This research posits that during wave fission, an internal wave radiated away from the gravity front head, transporting less dense plume water with it. The disturbance initially propagated as a surging front until it was arrested. We postulate that the bolus may eventually evolve into internal waves, similar to those observed in the SAR image, but only under the condition that ambient waters are stratified. These results expose an important coastal transport mechanism, particularly in context of an oil spill inside a bay.",

            "abstract": "Mature fault cores contain a finely ground powder termed fault gouge where most displacement occurs. If saturated, the gouge’s resistance to shear changes due to pressurization of pore fluid that occurs when the gouge compacts or dilates. If gouge compacts at the onset of shear, fluid pressure increases, causing frictional contacts to weaken. More commonly, granular material dilates upon shear, causing frictional resistance to increase due to decreased pressure (dilation hardening). Depending on the relative rates of fluid flow and deformation, these local pressure deviations can be large enough to effect gouge strength even in drained (permeable) fault zones. To understand the conditions under which this occurs, we use a grain-scale numerical model of saturated fault zones. We use the Goren et al. (2011) combined two-dimensional fluid flow/discrete element model to simulate earthquakes in a layer of unconsolidated grains. The periodic layer is 50 grains thick and 200 grains wide, and bounded by a fixed wall and a moveable wall. Shear stress is applied to the system by slowly pulling a spring attached to the moveable wall. When this stress exceeds the layer strength, rapid slip occurs relieving a portion of the stress. These slip events have displacements ranging from 102 to 103 grain diameters. To investigate how and when pore pressure affects the timing and characteristics of an earthquake, we conducted multiple experimental slip events on the same stressed configuration of grains, with different gouge permeability. We find that, even when gouge permeability is as high as 10-15 m2, pressure effects are large enough to change the evolution of a slip event. As the gouge dilates at the onset of slip, lower pressure raises the effective confining stress, which hardens the system and delays the slip event. In some cases, the slip continues at reduced velocities; in others, the slip is terminated altogether. In the latter case, very small events (“foreshocks”) can be present before the main slip occurs at a higher peak stress. We will present examples of individual events and a statistical comparison of different series of events run under a range of gouge permeability and confining stress.",

            "abstract": "The onset of a normal faulting event was observed in the late Holocene lagoon of the Matagorda Island, Texas. The faulting caused differential elevation changes across a transect perpendicular to the fault―much as it is doing in a present-day faulting event initiated after the 1940’s. The interpretation comes from assemblages of benthic foraminifera and supports other sedimentary evidence. A 115-m-long transect of seven vibracores was sampled across the active fault that cuts the Matagorda Island east of the Colorado River. Three cores lie on the upthrown block north of the fault, and four cores lie to the south on the downthrown block. The 1- to 4-m-long cores were split, described, and sampled at 20-cm intervals for foraminifera. Sediment subsamples of 0.25 cm3were washed on a sieve with 63-µm openings, split, and whole splits were picked until 100-300 specimens were recovered. Specimens were identified to species and tabulated. Samples were also taken at irregular intervals for radiocarbon dating.\nThe sediment section consists of lagoonal olive-brown (2. 5Y) mud and muddy sand intercalated by cleaner sand units (potentially overwash deposits) and oyster shell hash, all overlain by the brownish (10YR) subaerial sand of the barrier island. The mud and muddy sand contain high densities of foraminifera consisting of two assemblages: a diverse assemblage containing near equal numbers of miliolids and rotalids typical of a deep lagoon, and a low diversity assemblage dominated by Elphidiidae and Ammonia, a rotalid assemblage typical of lagoonal shoals. The latter is also associated with oyster shell hash and blades of the sea grass Halodule wrightii. The diverse assemblage is found throughout the muddy lagoonal sediment south of the fault up to the subaerial sands of Matagorda Island. In contrast, the foraminiferal assemblage grades upsection from the high- to the low-diversity assemblage after ~2500 yBP north of the fault, and is subsequently covered by the barrier sands. These data suggest that prior to ~2500 yBP the fault was inactive for a period, but activated soon afterward. The faulting allowed the lagoon to remain deeper on the southerly, downthrown side despite sediment accumulation accelerated by overwash from the transgressing barrier island. In contrast, the lagoon shallowed on the northerly upthrown block.",

According to the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method, we have theoretically analyzed a linear swept-frequency sine wave signal in an additive high Gaussian-distributed noise with a constant variance, which is a good approximation for the detector-noise-limited system or the solar background noise dominated space-borne IM-CW CO2 LAS. The general MLE equations for the amplitude and the phase of the swept-frequency IM_CW signal have been generated and solved by a nonlinear optimization procedure. The variances of the amplitude and the phase have been obtained by using the Cramer-Rao lower bound, a lower bound on the variance of the estimated parameters. Under the large sampling numbers, the SNR, signal amplitude divided by the square-root of the amplitude variance, increases as the square-root of the total sampling numbers. Thousands of numerical simulations with randomly generated uniform distributed Gaussian noise were completed for the statistical verification of the estimation. The estimation has also been applied to a space-borne IM-CW CO2 LAS with typical parameters under averaged daytime solar background to confirm the feasibilities of the instrument design of the space-borne IM-CW CO2 LAS.",

            "abstract": "The Naval Research Laboratory is conducting an interdisciplinary physics-based Space Weather model development and validation program called the Integrated Sun-Earth System for the Operational Environment (ISES-OE). In contrast to other geospace integration efforts, a key aspect of ISES is determining the extent to which current models capture the climate of the ionosphere and thermosphere. Until now, complementary long-term simulations using physics-based ionosphere models have not been performed. As part of this program, numerous runs of the physics-based SAMI3 model have been made and compared to global measurements of electron density. The data sets includes: 1) Ionosonde NmF2 and hmF2 measurements, 2) GPS Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements and others. This presentation compares electron density data with SAMI3 and other models during much of Solar Cycle 23 and the ascending phase of Cycle 24.\nPrevious work has concentrated on the Whole Heliospheric Interval (WHI) from February 19 - April 19, 2008 [Lean et al., 2014]. This solar minimum period with extremely low solar activity was used to test the validity of the SAMI3 simulations of the base-state ionosphere. Several modifications to SAMI3 were incorporated including updates to the Solar EUV fluxes, the NRL MSIS neutral atmospheric model parameterization at Solar Minimum and compensating for variations in the Sun-to-Earth distance. Data and model comparisons during times of higher solar activity will be presented with an emphasis on understanding the effects of coupling of the neutral atmosphere, neutral winds and driving electric fields on our ability to model the measured global electron density data. We examine responses to solar EUV radiation and geomagnetic activity, and semiannual and annual oscillations that all induce geospace variability.\nLean, J. L., S. E. McDonald, J. D. Huba, J. T.

            "abstract": "The U/Ca ratio of aragonite coral skeleton has been shown to correlate with both temperature and seawater carbonate chemistry. However, U/Ca has not been conclusively linked to carbonate chemistry and/or temperature in laboratory experiments. We have performed abiogenic precipitation experiments designed to evaluate the sensitivity of U partitioning between aragonite and seawater to temperature, pH, and the concentration of carbonate ion in seawater. Aragonite was precipitated from seawater by addition of carbonate alkalinity at rates set to maintain stable carbonate chemistry during precipitation. Experiments were conducted between 20-40 °C, pH 7.8-9.0, and carbonate ion concentration 600-2600 µmol kg-1. Mineralogies of the precipitates were identified by Raman spectrometry and U/Ca ratios of the bulk precipitate and fluid were determined by solution ICP-MS. Our results show that the U/Ca ratio of aragonite precipitated from an infinite reservoir of seawater decreases with increasing carbonate ion concentration, and is independent of pH and temperature. Using our abiogenic results as a basis for interpreting coral skeletal chemistry, we model the coral biomineralization process to show that the U/Ca ratio of coral skeleton reflects a calcifying fluid with carbonate ion concentration of at least 1000 µmol kg-1, several times greater than ambient seawater. Further, we show that the coral biomineralization response to environmental changes can be linked to changes in calcifying fluid composition via skeletal U/Ca ratios.",

            "abstract": "We present a physically-based flood hazard model that incorporates two main components: a hydrologic model and a hydraulic model. For hydrology we use TOPNET, a more comprehensive version of the original TOPMODEL. To simulate flood propagation, we use a 2D Godunov-type finite volume shallow water model. Physically-based global flood hazard simulation poses enormous computational challenges stemming from the increasingly fine resolution of available topographic data which represents the key input. Parallel computing helps to distribute the computational cost, but the computationally-intensive hydraulic model must be made far faster and agile for global-scale feasibility.\nHere we present a novel technique for hydraulic modeling whereby the computational grid is much coarser (e.g., 5-50 times) than the available topographic data, but the coarse grid retains the storage and conveyance (cross-sectional area) of the fine resolution data. This allows the 2D hydraulic model to be run on extremely large domains (e.g. thousands km2) with a single computational processor, and opens the door to global coverage with parallel computing. The model also downscales the coarse grid results onto the high-resolution topographic data to produce fine-scale predictions of flood depths and velocities. The model achieves computational speeds typical of very coarse grids while achieving an accuracy expected of a much finer resolution. In addition, the model has potential for assimilation of remotely sensed water elevations, to define boundary conditions based on water levels or river discharges and to improve model results.\nThe model is applied to two river basins: the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania, and the Ogeechee River in Florida. The two rivers represent different scales and span a wide range of topographic characteristics. Comparing spatial resolutions ranging between 30 m to 500 m in both river basins, the new technique was able to reduce simulation runtime by at least 25 fold, while keeping flood extent discrepancy within 10% and water height differences mostly in the range 10-25%.",

Specifically, this work reports on the potential i) hydrological response and ii) carbon and nitrogen pools of two watersheds, one in Colorado River Basin (arid) and the second one in Neches River Basin (humid), to brush management (uniform thinning vs. clear cutting) simulated using Regional Hydro-ecological Simulation System (RHESSys) model and site specific input data. The selected watersheds have similar potential evapotranspiration level, but their average elevations are 600 m and 250 m for the arid and humid watersheds, respectively.

            "abstract": "Vegetated filter strips (VFSs) have been recognized as an effective and environmentally-friendly beneficial management practice for preventing sediments from cropland to enter surface water. Their trapping efficiency depends on many parameters (characteristics of the filter, vegetation, flow and sediments) and may be balanced with other factors such as implementation, management and opportunity costs. The Vegetated Filter Dimensioning Model (VFDM) is a mathematical tool coupled with PHYSITEL and HYDROTEL that was successfully developed to determine the optimal dimensions and/or efficiency of vegetated filters with respect to vegetation characteristics, topographical and hydrological parameters.\nThe number of rills in a relatively homogeneous hydrological unit (RHHU, i.e. hillslope), the basic computational unit of VFDM, is a key parameter for the calculation of the surface runoff velocity, and therefore, the design of the vegetative filter. Until now, this parameter had been treated as a constant based on plan shape of each individual hillslope.\nThe main objective of this project was to develop an algorithm for determining a priori potential areas where rills could develop and implement the ensuing procedure in VFDM. With the proposed algorithm, the number of rills is determined by using physical and hydrological criteria. To study the influence of concentrated flow and diffuse flow in the filter dimensioning calculations, surface runoff is apportioned according to the way it reaches the primary stream network (concentrated, if through the aforementioned rills, or diffuse, otherwise, that is if discharging laterally). By considering actual land covers and identifying areas likely to generate sediments, results can lead to the building of hotspot maps that may be used as decision-making tools to guide the implementation of vegetated filter strips at the watershed scale.\nThe potential use of the algorithm was tested using data form a small (2.5 km2) agricultural watershed in Quebec (Canada) and a sensitivity analysis of the main outputs of VFDM, the width and efficiency of the filter strip, was performed with respect to key parameters (vegetation density, rill width among others).",

In particular, there is debate over the extent to which damages attributed to extreme heat are confounded with drought conditions. In a pair of studies, we examine the effect of extreme moisture conditions, both wet and dry, on maize and soybean yields in the U.S. We find significant effects of waterlogging during the planting season, when crops are most vulnerable to excess moisture, as well as evidence for a strong interaction between high temperatures and low moisture during during the critical stages of the summer growing season. Using both precipitation and model-derived soil moisture data, our results suggest that considering temperature and moisture independently will underestimate yield damages during hot, dry conditions. Many warming scenarios project increases in both extreme summer temperatures and soil dryness, and considering these effects jointly can be important in estimating future yield variability.",

            "abstract": "Subduction of continental rocks is necessary to produce ultra-high pressure (UHP) rocks but the mechanism bringing them to the surface is disputed. A major question is whether this involves fairly small diapirs of crust that move up through the mantle or it involves an entire subducted plate that undergoes coherent ‘reverse subduction’ (sometimes called ‘eduction’). Both mechanisms have been invoked to explain the only known region of on-going exhumation of UHP rocks, on the D’Entrecasteaux Islands of Papua New Guinea. Ductile flow fabrics in the island rocks have been used to argue for a diapiric model while constraints on the plate kinematics of the region require relatively large (>100 km) amounts of recent (>6 Myr) extension, supporting eduction as a primary mechanism.\nA self-consistent thermo-mechanical model of continental subduction shows that eduction can be accompanied by some ductile flow within the crust. Also we show, that subduction and stacking of continental crust can cause a subduction zone to lock up and lead to subduction initiation elsewhere. When this happens the region of earlier continental subduction can reverse direction causing exhumation of rocks from depth of ~100 km followed by localized extension and plate spreading. This can occur even if a region is in overall convergence. Applied to New Guinea our results are consistent with earlier suggestions that extension of the Woodlark Basin was caused by the initiation of the New Britain Trench, as indicated on the attached figure. We suggest that this subduction initiation event triggered eduction that led to exposure of the D’Entrcasteaux Islands and exhumation of the UHP rocks there. Our numerical results are broadly consistent with the recently refined seismic structure of the region around the islands. The model implies that the present-day basement of the ~70 km wide Goodenough Bay, south of the islands, was subducted then exhumed. This can be tested by drilling.",

Several climatic factors can impact peak flows such as precipitation intensity and duration, snowpack, and air temperature. However, precipitation-return periods are poor predictors of flow-return periods. We show that a primary mode of precipitation climatic change during spring months trends toward more consecutive wet days rather than more precipitation per day. While high duration, depth and intensity precipitation are associated with high flows, the increased persistence associated with regional climate change is shown to be another dominant predictor of increased springtime flood risk. Moreover we find summertime precipitation changes dominated by increasingly intense rainfall events, as expected from higher latent heat following increasing temperature. We show that prediction of high flows must be performed on a seasonal or monthly basis due to seasonally variable connections between precipitation and runoff. Discriminant analysis is used to confirm the role of both persistence and intensity as predictors of seasonal flood risk in the Mad River watershed in Vermont, suggesting seasonally variable modes of climatic change at high temporal resolution as dominant drivers of observed flow non-stationarity.",

            "abstract": "Fracture aperture is a primary control on flow in fractured reservoirs of low matrix permeability including unconventional oil and gas reservoirs and most geothermal systems. Guided by principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics, fracture aperture is generally assumed to be a linear function of fracture length and elastic material properties. Natural opening-mode fractures with significant preserved aperture are observed in core and outcrop indicative of fracture opening strain accommodated by permanent solution-precipitation creep. Fracture opening may thus be decoupled from length growth if the material effectively weakens after initial elastic fracture growth by either non-elastic deformation processes or changes in elastic properties.\nTo investigate the kinematics of fracture length and aperture growth, we reconstructed the opening history of three opening-mode fractures that are bridged by crack-seal quartz cement in Travis Peak Sandstone of the SFOT-1 well, East Texas. Similar crack-seal cement bridges had been interpreted to form by repeated incremental fracture opening and subsequent precipitation of quartz cement. We imaged crack-seal cement textures for bridges sampled at varying distance from the tips using scanning electron microscope cathodoluminescence, and determined the number and thickness of crack-seal cement increments as a function of position along the fracture length and height. Observed trends in increment number and thickness are consistent with an initial stage of fast fracture propagation relative to aperture growth, followed by a stage of slow propagation and pronounced aperture growth. Consistent with fluid inclusion observations indicative of fracture opening and propagation occurring over 30-40 m.y., we interpret the second phase of pronounced aperture growth to result from fracture opening strain accommodated by solution-precipitation creep and concurrent slow, possibly subcritical, fracture propagation. Similar deformation mechanisms are envisioned to govern fracture growth over shorter timescales in reactive chemical subsurface environments including CO2 reservoirs, organic-rich shales, and geothermal systems.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization is a dominant form of landscape change that affects the structure and function of ecosystems and alters control points in biogeochemical and hydrologic cycles. Green infrastructure (GI) has been proposed as a solution to many urban environmental challenges and may be a way to manage biogeochemical control points. Despite this promise, there has been relatively limited empirical focus to evaluate the efficacy of GI, relationships between design and function, and the ability of GI to provide ecosystem services in cities. This work has been driven by goals of adapting GI approaches to dryland cities and to harvest rain and storm water for providing ecosystem services related to storm water management and urban heat island mitigation, as well as other co-benefits. We will present a modification of ecohydrologic theory for guiding the design and function of green infrastructure for dryland systems that highlights how GI functions in context of Trigger – Transfer – Reserve – Pulse (TTRP) dynamic framework. Here we also apply this TTRP framework to observations of established street-scape green infrastructure in Tucson, AZ, and an experimental installation of green infrastructure basins on the campus of Biosphere 2 (Oracle, AZ) where we have been measuring plant performance and soil biogeochemical functions. We found variable sensitivity of microbial activity, soil respiration, N-mineralization, photosynthesis and respiration that was mediated both by elements of basin design (soil texture and composition, choice of surface mulches) and antecedent precipitation inputs and soil moisture conditions. The adapted TTRP framework and field studies suggest that there are strong connections between design and function that have implications for stormwater management and ecosystem service provision in dryland cities.",

            "abstract": "The volcanically active Jan Mayen Island is found on the northern tip of the Jan Mayen microcontinent, a continental fragment rifted from the Greenland coast 25 My ago following the ridge jump from Aegir to Kolbeinsey Ridge. The recurrent debate about the origin of Jan Mayen is partly due to the complex geological setting of the island. It is located directly south of the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone (JMFZ) and between the ultraslow Mohns and Kolbeinsey spreading ridges. Over the years, this intraplate volcanic suite has been diversely interpreted as an isolated hotspot, as Icelandic plume material dispersed in the northern Atlantic, as the result of melting of a sub-continental lithospheric mantle, or as a result from the coincidence of a continental fragment in the prolongation of a spreading center. However, recent U-series data (Elkins et al., 2011; 2014; in prep.) as well as geophysical high-resolution S-velocity model (Rickers et al., 2013) both indicate a high-temperature anomaly in this area, supporting the hotspot hypothesis.\nWe present new major, trace elements, Sr, Nd, Pb and Hf isotope data for samples collected near Jan Mayen and along Kolbeinsey and Mohns Ridges, together with a new bathymetry map. One of the most striking results from Jan Mayen area is the relative homogeneity in the geochemical signature around the island compared to other hotspots. These limited geochemical variations are surprising considering that these lavas are erupted on top of a fragment of continental crust in a ridge-hotspot-fracture zone context. Along Kolbeinsey and Mohns Ridges, we observed a radial dispersion and mixing of Jan Mayen signature within the local depleted upper mantle. The difference in the geochemical gradients on both sides of the JMFZ could be linked to the difference in ridge morphology between Kolbeinsey (orthogonal, symmetric spreading, shallow and high magma supply) and Mohns Ridges (oblique, asymmetric spreading, deeper and weaker magma supply).",

            "abstract": "Accurate measurement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the troposphere is critical for the understanding of emissions and physical and chemical processes that can impact both air quality and climate. Airborne VOC measurements have proven especially challenging due to the requirement of both high sensitivity (pptv) and short sample collection times (≤15 s) to maximize spatial resolution and sampling frequency for targeted plume analysis. The use of stainless steel canisters to collect whole air samples (WAS) for post-flight analysis has been pioneered by the groups of D. Blake and E. Atlas [Blake et al., 1992; Atlas et al., 1993].\nFor the 2013 Southeast Nexus Study (SENEX), the NOAA ESRL CSD laboratory undertook WAS measurements for the first time. This required the construction of three new, highly-automated, and field-portable instruments designed to sample, analyze, and clean the canisters for re-use. Analysis was performed with a new custom-built gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer system. The instrument pre-concentrates analyte cryostatically into two parallel traps by means of a Stirling engine, a novel technique which obviates the need for liquid nitrogen to reach trapping temperatures of -175C.\nHere we present an evaluation of the retrieval of target VOC species from WAS canisters. We discuss the effects of humidity and sample age on the analyte, particularly upon C8+ alkane and aromatic species and biogenic species. Finally, we present results from several research flights during SENEX that targeted emissions from oil/natural gas production.",

            "abstract": "A weakening of the Gulf Stream, the upper branch of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation system, has been hypothesized to accelerate sea level rise on the east coast of the United States, caused by changes in the Gulf Stream strength and, hence, sea level difference across the current. It still remains unclear if the Gulf Stream has in fact weakened or remains stable, along with the potential role of natural long-term variability. Tide gauges along the east coast show an accelerated sea level rise from Cape Hatteras to Cape Cod that is 3-4 times higher than global sea level rise. Satellite altimetry shows a weakening gradient in Gulf Stream sea surface height that is highly correlated (r=-0.85) with east coast sea level rise, however, direct velocity measurements showed no significant decrease in Gulf Stream strength over a similar time period. We introduce another in-situ dataset to examine the issues between these conflicting results. Expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) measure temperature at depth directly, and then depth and salinity can be inferred, along with geostrophic velocity and transport. XBT data has been used to measure transport in various current systems, however, the Gulf Stream transport has not been analyzed using the newest high-density XBT data made available since 1996. The trend in sea level difference is determined to be 3.3 +/- 3.2 mm/yr, resulting in an overall decrease of 5.2 cm in sea level from 1996-2013. This result agrees with satellite altimetry results that show a significant decrease in recent years. This data also shows a changing Gulf Stream core position, based on the 15°C isotherm at 200 m, of 0.03°N/yr that is negatively correlated with surface transport (r=-0.25). Issues remain in defining the core and width of the Gulf Stream and with eliminating the possibility of natural variability in the current system.",

            "abstract": "The recent CDPapua seismic array in the active D’Entrecasteaux-Woodlark Rift provides insights into how continental crust accommodates large extension. Here, >100 km of extension has occurred in the last 4-6 Ma, exhuming rocks from 100 km depth. To better understand the modes of deformation of the crust, we analyze shear wave velocity (Vs) distribution for a set of temporary land and ocean bottom broadband stations. We resolve the depth of the main velocity contrasts using receiver function (RF) analysis, alleviating the intrinsic trade-off between depth and velocity intrinsic by joint inversion with dispersion constraints (10 – 100 s) from earthquake surface waves and ambient noise. A transdimensional Bayesian scheme explores the model space (Vs in each layer, number of interfaces and their respective depths), minimizing the number of layers required to fit the observations given their noise level. Preliminary results suggest that the Moho is sharp in most places, with a depth of 28-38 km and 20-27 km below the Papuan Peninsula and the highly-extended D’Entracasteaux Islands, respectively. The mid-lower crust of these regions appears to be similar and consistent with felsic compositions, 3.25≤Vs≤3.5 km/s, and may represent the Owen-Stanley Metamorphic Belt or underlying continental rocks. A fast layer (3.75≤Vs≤4 km/s) is observed below the Papuan Peninsula in the 20-30 km depth range and may indicate more mafic lower crust. In contrast, faster velocities between 10 and 20km depth are modeled below the Goodenough Basin (3.75≤Vs≤4 km/s) and the Trobriand Basin (3.5≤Vs≤3.75 km/s) where rocks of the Papuan Ultramafic Belt have been suggested, although these results partly depend upon complicated signals from ocean-bottom seismometers. Well-located seismicity shows that active fault systems generally follow the boundaries between regions of different crustal velocity structure. Overall these results confirm a continental velocity structure for the onshore parts of the rift, but allow for much more mafic crust beneath intervening basins. Much of the rifting at crustal depths could have been accommodated by opening these basins.",

            "abstract": "As global climate cooled during the Mid Pleistocene Transition (MPT, ~1.1–0.6 Ma), the last great extinction of benthic foraminifera occurred. The so-called ‘Stilostomella Extinction’ saw the disappearance of almost two families of elongated uniserial species with distinctive apertural architecture. The stepwise extinction consisted of a gradual disappearance at different water depths and ocean basins over successive glacials. Understanding the causes of this extinction has proven difficult, in part because ecological preferences are not well known, and because their extinction has not been documented in high resolution along with other paleoenvironmental proxies. For instance, one hypothesis for the extinction is lowering bottom water temperature.\n  We present new high-resolution (~5 ka time step) benthic foraminiferal data from ODP Site 593 in the Tasman Sea (~1068 m water depth) through the MPT, and compare with new intermediate water temperature (benthic Mg/Ca) and surface water productivity proxies (nannofossil assemblages and sediment pigment analyses). Extinction group occurrences do not correlate with intermediate water temperature. There are, however, clear changes in surface water productivity associated with the final phase of the extinction, at ~0.85 Ma. Pigments increase in abundance, indicating elevated glacial productivity across the MPT. Coccolith assemblages shift towards small Gephyrocapsa spp., and extinction occurs within the Reticulofenestra, both of which are global events. Comparisons with the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean extinction data indicates 0.85 Ma as a critical time interval in the global Stilostomella Extinction. This evidence strengthens the hypothesis that changes in the type of organic carbon reaching the sea floor, driven by reorganization within marine phytoplankton communities, may have been linked to the disappearance of the extinction group.",

            "abstract": "The New England region is one of the few locations of the United States that is experiencing an increasing amount of annual precipitation over the last few decades. This increase in precipitation is not necessarily resulting in higher annual streamflow but is impacting the amount of water recharging subsurface reservoirs. In this contribution we present a quantitative analysis of instrumental data and use that to drive a regional modeling study of the interaction of recharge water and the distinct aquifers of the region. The region is characterized by four main aquifer recharge types, which are shown to have distinct hydraulic responses to recharge variability due to both their aquifer hydraulic properties and their hydrogeologic setting. Assessments of hydraulic properties allows the prediction of ground water storage changes from the water level changes. Modeling results show that the timing of recharge to the aquifer system has not necessarily changed but the amount precipitation during these times has increased significantly. The last ten years of ground water storage prediction shows a significant increase in the amount of time when positive storage conditions are present. Extreme precipitation events from tropical cyclones have resulted in some of the highest water tables recorded in the instrumental record. Comparison of these results to those from paleo-hydrological studies on lake levels suggest that this region is experiencing some of the wettest conditions recorded since de-glaciation. These results have significant implications for management approaches dealing with low flow stream requirements across the region.",

The shallow-water hydrothermal system of Milos Island is a unique study site with vents exhibiting steep geothermal gradients in the presence of light that allows the co-occurrence of photosynthesis and chemosynthesis. The active hydrothermal emissions of the Milos hydrothermal system support complex microbial mats, which are fundamental in engineering the environmental niche in which extremophiles thrive. Because of the shallow depth, the mat community is wiped out during every major storm, when swell and wave action increase, and then it reconstitutes itself over a brief period of time (days). While most studies are focused on the diversity of the community residing in the underlying sediments, little information is available on the diversity and functioning of the mat community, and how it responds to abrupt geodynamic events. Here we report the results of a joint geochemical and microbiological survey of the microbial mats of Milos island, and analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of the mat community following a major storm. Our results show that the community is dominated by Epsilonproteobacteria, although significant variability is present within the systemm. The observed variability correlates with spatial profiles and in situ measurement of temperature and sulfide carried out over a 6 days periods, showing that tides, winds, and abrupt geodynamic events generate intermittent mixing conditions lasting for several hours to days. Diversity and metagenomic analyses of the mature mat provide further information on the metabolic potential of the community and on the influence of environmental factors on ecosystem functioning. Our work lays the basis for studies aimed at resolving the spatial and temporal dynamics of chemoautotrophic microbial communities in shallow-water hydrothermal systems.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates the recovery of a prescribed flow regime through reservoir system reoperation, focusing on the associated costs and losses imposed on different power plants depending on flows, power plant and reservoir characteristics and systems topology. In large-scale reservoir systems such cost distribution is not trivial, and it should be properly evaluated to identify coordinated operating solutions that avoid penalizing a single reservoir. The methods combine an efficient stochastic dual dynamic programming algorithm for reservoir optimization subject to environmental flow targets with specific magnitude, duration and return period, which effects on fish recruitment are already known. Results indicate that the distribution of the effect of meeting the environmental flow demands throughout the reservoir cascade differs largely, and in some reservoirs power production and revenue are increased, while in others it is reduced. Most importantly, for the example system modeled here (10 reservoirs in the Parana River basin, Brazil) meeting the target environmental flows was possible without reducing the total energy produced in the year, at a cost of $25 Million/year in foregone hydropower revenues (3% reduction). Finally, the results and methods are useful in (a) quantifying the foregone hydropower and revenues resulting from meeting a specific environmental flow demand, (b) identifying the distribution and reallocation of the foregone hydropower and revenue across a large scale system, and (c) identifying optimal reservoir operating strategies to meet environmental flow demands in a large scale multi-reservoir system.",

The GPM Validation Network (VN) provides unique, detailed information on the performance of the new DPR on GPM. The GPM VN collects GPM orbit subset data products and coincident ground radar observations, performs a unique spatial matching of the space and ground radar observations, and provides a set of software tools to analyze and visualize the matched data sets. For GPM, a DPR/GR comparison algorithmhas been developed that defines the common volumes in terms of the geometric intersection of DPR and GR rays, where smoothing of the DPR and GR data are minimized and no interpolation is performed. The primary GR data source for the VN is a collection of National Weather Service WSR-88D S-band, dual-polarization radars located primarily in the eastern and central United States.\nThis paper will concentrate on the results of the space- and ground-radar comparisons, and present preliminary evaluations of the performance of the DPR Ku-band radar relative to the legacy TRMM Ku-band PR over the same times and locations. Both the direct measurements of radar reflectivity as well as derived measurements of rain rate from the space and ground radars will be compared, down to the scale of individual instrument measurements. Vertical profiles, site-specific time series, Probability Density Function, scatter plots, and other analyses of the comparison data will be shown. Results for both the Ku-band and Ka-band DPR radars will be presented. Visualizations of the volume-matched and original GPM and ground radar data that assist in the understanding of the DPR-GR volume matching and comparison methods and data coverage will be included. GPM DPR data are still in evaluation and algorithm refinement at the time of this writing and have not been released to the public, so we cannot provide descriptions or examples of the ongoing VN DPR analysis results in this abstract. It is expected that the DPR data will be released well in advance the AGU Fall Meeting and we will be able to present our results of the first 8-9 months of DPR observations in the meeting presentation.",

            "abstract": "Urban areas are said to be responsible for approximately 71% of fossil fuel CO2 emissions while comprising only two percent of the land area [IEA, 2008]. This limited spatial expansion could facility a monitoring of anthropogenic GHGs from atmospheric observations. As major sources of emissions, cities also have a huge potential to drive emissions reductions. To effectively manage emissions, cities must however, first establish techniques to validate their reported emission statistics. A pilot study which includes continues 13CO2 data from calibrated cavity ring-down spectrometers [Vogel et al. 2013] of two “sister sites” in the vicinity of Toronto, Canada is contrasted to recent observations of 13CO2 observations in Paris during significant pollution events. Using Miller-Tans plots [Miller and Tans, 2003] for our multi-season observations reveals significant changes of the source signatures of night time CO2 emissions which reflect the importance of natural gas burning in Megacities (up to 80% of fossil fuel sources) and show-case the potential of future isotope studies to determine source sectors. Especially the winter data this approach seems suitable to determine the source contribution of different fuel types (natural gas, liquid fuels and coal) which can inform the interpretation of other Greenhouse Gases and air pollution levels.",

            "abstract": "Cr stable isotopes record mass dependent fractionations that reflect changes in the element’s oxidation state. Weathering of igneous rocks on the continents releases Cr(III), which then reacts with manganese dioxide minerals to form Cr(VI) under oxidizing conditions. Cr(VI) is both soluble and mobile in continental weathering environments and eventually accumulates in the oceans. Laboratory experiments show that reduction of Cr(VI) causes light Cr isotopes to partition into the reduced Cr(III), which is insoluble, thus leaving the unreacted pool of soluble Cr(VI) enriched in the heavy isotopes. As Cr(VI) is the thermodynamically favoured species in oxygenated seawater, this leads to the hypothesis that drawdown of seawater Cr(VI) during ocean anoxic events should correlate with positive shifts in seawater derived Cr isotope values in marine sedimentary successions, if the fractionation factor and the various Cr input fluxes remained constant.\nTo test this hypothesis, we measured seawater δ53Cr values preserved in pelagic carbonate sediment deposited in the Western Interior Seaway during OAE 2. Our results show that the onset of ocean anoxia correlates with a decrease in sedimentary δ53Cr, which is opposite to the model prediction. The discrepancy may be reconciled if the sedimentation flux of light Cr isotopes into anoxic sediment was offset by an increase in the input flux of light Cr isotopes to the oceans. Eruption and weathering of the Caribbean Large Igneous Province (LIP) provides one such source.. Other studies have implicated LIP volcanism as a source of anomalously high trace metal abundances in the studied carbonates, as well as mantle-like initial Os isotope ratios in related black shales. We conclude similarly that the increased input of light Cr isotopes to the oceans during OAE 2 masked the expected isotopic response of the ocean Cr cycle to increased ocean anoxia.",

            "abstract": "In the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake, the seismic fault slip propagated to the trench axis and caused an extremely large tsunami (Ide et al., 2011). Ductile deformation of unconsolidated sediments is commonly prominent in the aseismic shallow parts of the subduction zone. It is unknown how the seismic rupture reached the nearby trench axis. Based on the result of Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 56 at site 436 (reference, 1977), it is expected that the subducting sediments at the Japan Trench mainly consist of vitric diatomaceous and radiolarian ooze with pelagic clay intervals. Opal and smectite in the pelagic sediments transform respectively into quartz and illite. Kinetic modeling demonstrated that these reactions will progress with active dehydration at 50–60 km horizontally away from the trench axis and with a temperature of 100–120°C. This region coincides with the plate-boundary marked by a prominent seismic reflector. It suggests that the main source of highly pressured fluids is the dehydration of pelagic sediments (Kimura et al., 2012). However, detailed dehydration processes are still unclear mainly due to lack of quantitative sediment composition data. Therefore, in this study, we examined whole rock composition including amorphous silica of the core samples recovered at site 436 as well as those from the Japan Trench by the IODP 343 Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project (JFAST). Analysis of amorphous silica at the drilling site of J-FAST documents that dehydration of the sediments is able to contribute to excess pressure at the shallow part of the megathrust if they underthrust as the same composition. At the drilling site of JFAST, a plate-boundary shear zone was identified around 820 mbsf (Chester et al., 2012). Our analysis showed that the shear zone is characterized by extremely high concentration of smectite (~70 wt%).These results suggest that the abundant smectite may have possibly fostered localized rupture and slip during the earthquake, because smectite has low frictional coefficient. In our presentation, we will also show the results of the permeability and porosity measurements for the core samples recovered at site 436.",

            "abstract": "Microseismic monitoring has been used for the last 20 years as a tool to understand the landslide mechanisms and to help develop a methodology able to provide real time information regarding landslide behavior. These studies involve deployment of seismic sensors at active slopes, with data usually analyzed and interpreted along with data obtained using other monitoring methods, e.g. geodetic/geotechnical monitoring. The interpretation of the records is based on a number of assumptions regarding the nature of the recorded signals resulting in big uncertainties.\nIn order to overcome this problem, we use an up-scaled sheer box to reproduce seismic signals as those emitted by the movement of a landslide. The experimental set up consists of a 65cm diameter and 50cm high concrete cylinder filled with unsaturated soil. The cylinder is pulled along a surficial corridor with the same type of soil under varying vertical loading conditions and the friction at the interface between the soil in cylinder and soil on corridor emits seismic signals. The signals are recorded by a network of 7 short period 3D seismic sensors at distances ranging from 4 to 15m from the cylinder.\nWe analyse the recorded signals in the frequency and time-frequency domain. The obtained significant frequencies range up to 120Hz. Their amplitude changes depending on the source-to-sensor distance (attenuation effect) and the applied vertical load (simulating different depths of the failure plane). The spectral characteristics of the emitted signals when compared to those of signals emitted from a vertical face failure in very similar geological and loading conditions at a nearby site are consistent. Therefore, this experimental set-up is a good analogue for the study of landslide induced seismicity.\nThe suggested methodology can be a powerful tool in studying the effects of the type of soil, the loading conditions on the failure plane, the degree of saturation and compaction of the soil on signals recorded during the microseismic monitoring of landslides. It allows for the study and understanding of landslide induced seismicity prior to any failure events allowing simulation of different failure scenarios and the creation of a database of signal characteristics that can be used for an accurate interpretation of the available microseismic records.",

            "abstract": "How can society place a value on clean air? I present a multi-impact economic valuation framework called the Social Cost of Atmospheric Release (SCAR) that extends the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) used previously for carbon dioxide (CO2) to a broader range of pollutants and impacts. Values consistently incorporate health impacts of air quality along with climate damages. The latter include damages associated with aerosol-induced hydrologic cycle changes that lead to net climate benefits when reducing cooling aerosols. Evaluating a 1% reduction in current global emissions, benefits with a high discount rate are greatest for reductions of co-emitted products of incomplete combustion (PIC), followed by sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and then CO2, ammonia and methane. With a low discount rate, benefits are greatest for CO2 reductions, though the sum of SO2, PIC and methane is substantially larger. These results suggest that efforts to mitigate atmosphere-related environmental damages should target a broad set of emissions including CO2, methane and aerosol/ozone precursors. Illustrative calculations indicate environmental damages are $410-1100 billion yr-1 for current US electricity generation (~19-46¢ per kWh for coal, ~4-24¢ for gas) and $3.80 (-1.80/+2.10) per gallon of gasoline ($4.80 (-3.10/+3.50) per gallon for diesel). These results suggest that total atmosphere-related environmental damages plus generation costs are much greater for coal-fired power than other types of electricity generation, and that damages associated with gasoline vehicles substantially exceed those for electric vehicles.",

Fire disturbances substantially modify ecosystem carbon dynamics both temporally and spatially. Ecosystems generally lose carbon for several years to decades following fire disturbance, but our understanding of the duration and dynamics of post-disturbance carbon fluxes remains limited. Owing to the prevailing collection of inventory data for fire burn area, intensity, distribution, and associated carbon-related parameters in North America, we are able to more accurately estimate carbon dynamics following fire disturbances. In our study, we integrated four major fire datasets (i.e., U.S. Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity dataset, Bureau of Land Management Alaska Fire Service dataset, and Canadian National Fire Database, and GFEDv3.1 fire dataset) and other auxiliary data to generate a comprehensive and continuous burned area history dataset, which covers the 1920 to 2012 time period and is gridded at quarter-degree resolution for the North American continent. Driven by this new dataset, we used the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM6.0) to simulate the impacts of fire disturbance on carbon dynamics across North American ecosystems. The results indicate that large amount of carbon was emitted due to fire disturbances during the study period, especially for the boreal ecosystems with slow recovery. The modeling results were also evaluated with the field measurements along a fire chronosequence and compared to estimates from other approaches.",

At the same time, it is an ocean region which is typically poorly simulated by models used for climate projections. One major source of uncertainty is the representation of the effects of ocean mesoscale processes, which are subgrid scale in current climate simulations. This project examines a suite of three simulations carried out with the same coupled climate model but varying spatial resolutions of the ocean: it consists of a coarse 1º-resolution where eddy effects are parameterized, a modest-eddying 0.25º-simulation lacking an eddy parameterization, and an actively-eddying 0.1º-simulation. Differences between the simulations are analyzed in a water mass framework, which is a “natural” approach given that water masses are inherently linked to ocean circulation and are sensitive to changes of their formation processes. The questions that will be examined are: first if the mesoscale processes in the Southern Ocean act to thin intermediate waters and second if they add zonal structure to the water masses. We will further examine the skill of the coarse resolution ocean model to reproduce these hypothesized effects of the mesoscale with a state-of-the-art parameterization.",

            "abstract": "Model integration bridges the data flow between modeling frameworks and models. However, models usually do not fit directly into a particular modeling environment, if not designed for it. An example includes implementing different types of models into the NASA Land Information System (LIS), a software framework for land-surface modeling and data assimilation. Model implementation requires scientific knowledge and software expertise and may take a developer months to learn LIS and model software structure. Debugging and testing of the model implementation is also time-consuming due to not fully understanding LIS or the model. This time spent is costly for research and operational projects.\nTo address this issue, an approach has been developed to automate model integration into LIS. With this in mind, a general model interface was designed to retrieve forcing inputs, parameters, and state variables needed by the model and to provide as state variables and outputs to LIS. Every model can be wrapped to comply with the interface, usually with a FORTRAN 90 subroutine. Development efforts need only knowledge of the model and basic programming skills. With such wrappers, the logic is the same for implementing all models. Code templates defined for this general model interface could be re-used with any specific model. Therefore, the model implementation can be done automatically.\nAn automated model implementation toolkit was developed with Microsoft Excel and its built-in VBA language. It allows model specifications in three worksheets and contains FORTRAN 90 code templates in VBA programs. According to the model specification, the toolkit generates data structures and procedures within FORTRAN modules and subroutines, which transfer data between LIS and the model wrapper. Model implementation is standardized, and about 80 – 90% of the development load is reduced.\nIn this presentation, the automated model implementation approach is described along with LIS programming interfaces, the general model interface and five case studies, including a regression model, Noah-MP, FASST, SAC-HTET/SNOW-17, and FLake. These different models vary in complexity with software structure. Also, we will describe how these complexities were overcome through using this approach and results of model benchmarks within LIS.",

            "abstract": "The central Argentine Andes exhibit variable morphology along-strike due to some combination of slab subduction angle, inherited crustal structure, and climate. Structural mapping and thermochronology has suggested minimal exhumation (~1 km), except perhaps along some major river valleys. However, few thermochronologic results have been reported. In order to better understand the variability of exhumation along-strike, we sampled 3 rivers for detrital zircon and measured both (U-Th)/He and U-Pb ages using laser ablation methods. The sample sites span the southern edge of flat-slab subduction. The northern- and southernmost watersheds each cover ~2000 km2 and include elements of both the Principal and Frontal Cordilleras. The central watershed (~200 km2) is largely restricted to the Frontal Cordillera. The geology of the Principal Cordillera is diverse, but the Frontal Cordillera is composed primarily of Permo-Triassic volcanic rocks of the Choiyoi Formation. Preliminary results (n = 27) from the smaller, central Arroyo Grande watershed show that zircons are almost always reset, in the sense that a given zircon’s (U-Th)/He cooling age is significantly younger than its U-Pb crystallization age. Of these, 2 grains have cooling ages <5 Ma, and 7 have ages <25 Ma. To the south, in the larger Rio Tunuyan (n = 27) watershed, 13 reset zircons have cooling ages <5 Ma, and 6 of these have U-Pb ages that are characteristic of the Frontal Cordillera (ranging from 220 to 272 Ma). To the north, in the upper Río de los Patos catchment (n = 30), only 3 reset zircons have ages <25 Ma, and these zircons lack Frontal Cordilleran U-Pb ages (17, 43, and 323 Ma). The abundance of reset (U-Th)/He ages is notable in all 3 watersheds. Laser (U-Th)/He closure temperatures vary according to the geometry of the zircon, the geometry of the laser spot, and the cooling rate. For an average zircon among our samples, at an assumed cooling rate of 10° C/Myr, the closure temperature is approximately 200° C. This implies at least several kilometers of exhumation, even if the geothermal gradient is very steep. Sections of the watersheds appear to have been exhumed very rapidly. These preliminary results suggest that the Frontal Cordillera, particularly in the southern and central watersheds, have accommodated much more exhumation than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "As part of the Surfzone Coastal Oil Pathways Experiment, 75 GPS-equipped drifters were deployed off the coast of Destin, FL for 5 days in December 2013 to examine surface material transport. The drifters were released as triplets from the edge of the surf zone to the outer edge of the inner shelf resulting in 382 drifter pairs. GPS data were obtained at 1 Hz for O(40 hrs). The experiment encompassed a synoptic storm event that provided differing wind and wave conditions. The nearshore region, composed of the surf zone and inner shelf, is also influenced diurnally by a freshwater, surface (<1m), buoyant plume that originates from the Choctawhatchee River that exits Destin Inlet.\nSurprisingly throughout each daily deployment regardless of separation, the drifters moved in coherent patterns suggesting the surface flow is nearly homogeneous. Wind measurements from a tower located onsite and surface velocity estimates from bottom-mounted acoustic Doppler current profilers indicate that local wind forcing controls the flow at the surface. Pathlines derived from the surface currents match drifter trajectories. However, there are subtle differences in drifter trajectories, which were found related to their individual deployment location. The bulk, relative, surface dispersion (D2) using two-particle statistics, when viewed in a logarithmic frame of reference, shows that the growth of particle separation is ballistic (D2 ~t2) with respect to time (t). This indicates that the region experiences local dispersion primarily driven by horizontal shear.\nThe goal here is to describe the evolution of dispersion and the corresponding controls on it using the linear frame of reference, which provides more detail often de-emphasized in the log-scale. This is important for understanding mixing in the nearshore environment owing to the rapidly changing conditions caused by the synoptic storm event, the location of the buoyant plume, and cross- and alongshore position of the drifters. At this higher-resolution scale, dispersion was found to vary temporally with changes in mean wind direction. In addition, the buoyant plume influenced dispersion, even though the drifter trajectories inside and outside of the plume were relatively similar. A discussion on these subtle changes in dispersion will be presented.",

            "abstract": "A 6-bottle serial gas-tight sampler (so-called “six-shooter”) was developed for application with deep-sea vent fluids. The new device is composed of a custom-made 6-channel valve manifold and six sampling bottles which are circularly distributed around the valve manifold. Each valve channel consists of a high-pressure titanium cartridge valve and a motor-driven actuator. A sampling snorkel is connected to the inlet of the manifold that delivers the incoming fluid to different bottles. Each sampling bottle has a 160 ml-volume chamber and an accumulator chamber inside where compressed nitrogen is used to maintain the sample at near in-situ pressure. An electronics chamber that is located at the center of the sampler is used to carry out all sampling operations, autonomously, if desired. The sampler is of a compact circular configuration with a diameter of 26 cm and a length of 54 cm.\nDuring the SVC cruise AT 26-12, the sampler was deployed by DSV2 Alvin at a cold seep site MC036 with a depth of 1090 m in the Gulf of Mexico. The sampler collected fluid samples automatically following the tidal cycle to monitor the potential impact of the tide cycle on the fluid chemistry of cold seep in a period of two day.\nDuring the cruise AT 26-17, the sampler was used with newly upgraded DSV2 Alvin three times at the hydrothermal vent sites along Axial Seamount and Main Endeavor Field on Juan de Fuca Ridge. During a 4-day deployment at Anemone diffuse site (Axial Caldera), the sampler was set to work in an autonomous mode to collect fluid samples according to the preset interval. During other dives, the sampler was manually controlled via ICL (Inductively Coupled Link) communication through the hull. Gas-tight fluid samples were collected from different hydrothermal vents with temperatures between 267 ℃ and 335 ℃ at the depth up to 2200 m.\nThe field results indicate unique advantages of the design. It can be deployed in extended time period with remote operation or working autonomously taking gas-tight fluid samples. If used with HOV or ROV, it will reduce basket space occupation and ICL communication cables compared to traditional single-bottle gas-tight samplers. This time serial gas-tight fluid sampler will be further developed into a 36 bottle system for remote operation with seafloor cabled observatory.",

            "abstract": "Experiments and numerical simulations are being performed to understand the transport behavior of carboxymethyl cellulose polymer stabilized nano-scale zero valent iron (nZVI) in a variable aperture dolomite rock fracture and a variable aperture glass replica of a fractured slate. The rock fracture was prepared by artificially inducing a fracture in a dolomite block along a stylolite, and the glass fracture was prepared by creating molds with melted glass on two opposing sides of a fractured slate rock block. Both of the fractures were 0.28 m in length and 0.21 m in width. Equivalent hydraulic apertures are about 110 microns for the rock fracture and 250 microns for the glass replica fracture. Sodium bromide and lissamine green B (LGB) serve as conservative tracers in the rock fracture and glass replica fracture, respectively. A dark box set-up with a light source and digital camera is being used to visualize the LGB and CMC-nZVI movement in the glass fracture. Experiments are being performed to determine the effects of water specific discharge and CMC concentration on nZVI transport in the fractures. Transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and UV-visual spectrophotometry were performed to determine the stability and characteristics of the CMC-nZVI mixture. The transport of bromide, LGB, CMC, and CMC-nZVI in both fractures is being evaluated through analysis of the effluent concentrations. Time-lapse images are also being captured for the glass fracture. Bromide, LGB, and CMC recoveries have exceeded 95% in both fractures. Significant channeling has been observed in the fractures for CMC transport due to viscous effects.",

            "abstract": "The Noachian southern highlands of Mars bear old crustal material which appears mostly unaltered (Bandfield, 2002; Bibring et al., 2005; Christensen et al., 2005) and contains phyllosilicate-rich material. Phyllosilicates are of particular interest, as they require the presence of liquid water over long terms and may represent habitable environments. Most phyllosilicates formed early in Mars’ history during the Noachian period (Bibring et al., 2006). However, a set of Hesperian–aged impact craters, Toro (Marzo et al., 2010) and Majuro (Mangold et al., 2012) bear evidence for impact–induced hydrothermal activity in the southern highlands. Phyllosilicate outcrops in the northern plains are exclusively found in and around impact craters. This could lead to the conclusion that they might form excavation products of preexisting, buried deposits, exposed by impacting and erosion (Carter et al. 2010; Bibring et al. 2006; Murchie et al. 2009). Nevertheless, when investigating alteration associated with impact craters, pre-, syn- and post-impact scenarios have to be considered (Osinski et al., 2013; Tornabene et al., 2013). We revisited a set of impact sites described by Carter et al. (2010) for further investigation and to test the theory of impact excavation of old preexisting strata versus impact-induced hydrothermal activity. This can be achieved as coverage of high resolution data has drastically increased during the time of that study. We here report the presence of uplifted, stratified, phyllosilicate-rich material in an impact crater, located in the northern plains of Mars, close to the dichotomy boundary.\n",

            "abstract": "It is well-known that large rivers develop a special type of multi-channel planform called anabranching. Although there are several studies related to single-channel rivers for different scales and conditions, very little is known about the dynamics of anabranching rivers. An anabranching river planform presents portions where the river is split in a main channel and one or more secondary channels. For this type of planform, the morphodynamics interaction between main and secondary channels such as bed morphology, lateral migration rates, or velocity patterns is still not well understood.\nThe purpose of this research is to explain the interaction of the bed morphology between main and secondary channels in an anabranching river planform. To that end, a physical model that resembles a typical anabranching structure in the Amazon River was built. The model includes a main channel and two sub-channels of different lengths. By setting four gates to control the flows in sub-channels, we were able to set several types of flowing conditions which include the main channel only, the main channel with one sub-channel and the main channel with two sub-channels. The results helped to find how the factors such as flow rates and the shape of sub-channels affect the bedform which can increase our understanding of the anabranching pattern’s development.",

Brey and several science researchers and educators. The text panels’ message is as much the focus of the show as the art--true interdisciplinarity! Waller and Brey’s history of art and earth science collaborations include the successful exhibition \"Layers: Places in Peril\". New in spBT is extended collaboration with other scientists in order to create awareness of geoscience and other subjects (i.e. soil, parasites, dust, pollutants, invasive species, carbon, ground water contaminants, solar wind) small in scale which pose significant threats.\nThe paintings are the size of a mirror, a symbol suggesting the problems depicted are those we increasingly need to face, noting our collective reflections of shared current and future reality. Naturalistic rendering and abstract form in the art helps reach a broad audience including those familiar with art and those familiar with science. The goal is that gallery visitors gain greater appreciation and understanding of both—and of the sober content of the show as a whole.\n\"small problems, Big Trouble\" premiers in Wisconsin April, 2015. As in previous collaborations, Waller and Brey actively utilize art and science (specifically geoscience) as an educational vehicle for active student learning. Planned are interdisciplinary university and area high school activities linked through spBT. The exhibition in a public gallery offers a means to enhance community awareness of and action on scientific issues through art’s power to engage people on an emotional level.\nThis AGU presentation includes a description of past Waller and Brey activities: incorporating art and earth science in lab and studio classrooms, producing gallery and museum exhibitions and delivering workshops and other presentations. They also describe how walking the paths of several past earth science disasters continues to inspire new chapters in their \"Layers: Places in Peril\" exhibit! A slide show includes images of paintings for \"small problems, Big Trouble\". Brey and Waller will lead a discussion on their process of incorporating broader collaboration with geoscientists and others in an educational art exhibition.",

Geophysical imaging has been used for monitoring tracer migration and infiltration, mapping zones of focused groundwater/surface-water exchange, and verifying emplacement of amendments for bioremediation. Despite the enormous potential for extraction of hydrologic information from geophysical images, there also is potential for misinterpretation and over-interpretation. These concerns are particularly relevant when geophysical results are used within quantitative frameworks, e.g., conversion to hydrologic properties through petrophysical relations, geostatistical estimation and simulation conditioned to geophysical inversions, and joint inversion. We review pitfalls to interpretation associated with limited image resolution, spatially variable image resolution, incorrect data weighting, errors in the timing of measurements, temporal smearing resulting from changes during data acquisition, support-volume/scale effects, and incorrect assumptions or approximations involved in modeling geophysical or other jointly inverted data. A series of numerical and field-based examples illustrate these potential problems. Our goal in this talk is to raise awareness of common pitfalls and present strategies for recognizing and avoiding them.",

            "abstract": "As a byproduct of energy extraction, wind turbines create a low-speed, turbulent wake that propagate downwind. When wind turbines are situated in a group, as in a wind plant, the interactions of these wakes with other turbines are important because wake effects decrease the efficiency of the wind plant, and they increase mechanical loads on individual turbines. Wakes propagate downstream differently depending on the inflow conditions, and these conditions are heavily dominated by atmospheric stability. For example, we know that wakes are more persistent in stable conditions than in unstable conditions. Also, stable conditions often have significant wind veer which skews wakes laterally. Different levels of turbulence intensity are associated with different atmospheric stability levels, and turbulence intensity acts to diffuse wakes and to cause wake meandering.\nWake physics are complex, and to understand them better, a high-resolution representation of the flow is necessary. Measurements are difficult with current sensing equipment because of the sheer size of wakes and the unsteady atmospheric environment in which they are found. Numerical simulations complement measurements and provide a high-resolution representation of the entire three-dimensional, unsteady flow field. In this work, we use large-eddy simulation (LES), the highest fidelity type of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) feasible for high-Reynolds-number wake flow. LES directly resolves the larger, energy-containing turbulent scales and models the effects of the subgrid scales that the computational mesh cannot resolve. Our solver is based on the OpenFOAM open-source CFD toolbox. Turbines are modeled using rotating actuator lines.\nHere, we present our LES of the wake behind a modern 1.5 MW turbine subject to different inflow atmospheric stability. We will present results of wakes subject to stable (strongly and weakly stable), neutral, and unstable conditions. We are particularly interested in how stability affects wake recovery, wake skewing, and wake meandering. Figure 1 shows horizontal slices of instantaneous contours of vorticity magnitude in the computed wake of a turbine subject to weakly stable atmospheric inflow. A multi-resolution mesh is used with the finest region of 1.25 m resolution surrounding the turbine and the wake.",

            "abstract": "The April 1, 2014 Pisagua earthquake in Chile is interesting because the preparatory period before the April 1 main shock was very distinct and longer than usual. As a result, study of this sequence should provide clues to the processes leading up to large slip events on subduction plate boundaries. Moreover, the relationship between pre-event geodetic strain accumulation and the 2014 earthquake sequence is especially well documented because the event occurred in a known seismic gap that has attracted intensive monitoring efforts by the Chilean/French/German IPOC (Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile) program and the Peru/United States CALTECH Tectonics Observatory for the past decade. Understanding of this sequence, however, is hindered by a lack of basic information from the offshore region, which is where most of the slip occurred. Even core information like swath bathymetry are lacking in most of the region. In this poster, we summarize current knowledge of continental margin structure in this region as inferred from low-resolution, bathymetrically-corrected satellite-derived gravity gravity and bathymetric data and a single seismic refraction profile located ~200 km south of the main shock epicenter. A strong qualitative correlation is observed between the temporal and spatial distribution of seismic activity leading up to, during and after the main shock, suggesting that the pre-event locking pattern and temporal pattern of earthquake activity are controlled by heterogeneity in the structure of the upper and/or lower plates. We also discuss the impact of the absence of offshore geodetic data on the resolution of the locking and slip distributions derived from onshore geodetic data and conclude that the value of this earthquake sequence as a natural laboratory for understanding the processes of strain accumulation and release through seismogenic slip and aseismic creep on plate boundaries would be greatly enhanced by acquisition of new offshore bathymetric, potential field, seismic and geodetic data.",

            "abstract": "Nighttime transpiration may have significant consequences on plant functioning and earth-atmosphere water fluxes, yet little is known about how this process can vary among species or with environmental changes, particularly in grassland ecosystems. We measured leaf-level nighttime transpiration and daytime photosynthetic rates, as well as whole-plant sap flow rates on eight grass, forb and shrub species in a Kansas tallgrass prairie. Measurements were made periodically across a single growing season (May-August 2014) on three C4 grasses (Andropogon gerardii, Sorghastrum nutans and Panicum virgatum), two C3 forbs (Vernonia baldwinii and Solidago canidensis), and three C3 shrubs (Cornus drummondii, Rhus glabra and Amorpha canescens). At the leaf level, nighttime transpiration rates varied among species and across the growing season. Nighttime transpiration was greater in the three grass species compared to the forbs and shrubs early in the growing season. As the growing season progressed, nighttime transpiration increased and then decreased in all species. These results are consistent with patterns of decreasing daytime stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rates as the growing season became hotter and drier. Nighttime sap flow rates also varied among species and typically accounted for over 10% of total daily water flux at the whole-plant level. These results show that nighttime transpiration is species specific and variable at a small spatial scale. Nighttime transpiration can therefore be a significant portion of a plant water budget in a tallgrass prairie, is highly variable within a community, and is dynamic in response to changing environmental conditions. Forecasts of future ecosystem responses to a changing climate must account for plant water use and loss at night.",

It is primarily designed to be used in junior/senior/graduate level courses on subjects related to hydrology and water resources engineering. HydroViz presents case-based, data- and simulation-driven learning experiences in the form of modules that use data, models and analysis to introduce hydrologic concepts in the context of solving real world problems. One of several modules currently under development is based on a case study of Dry Canyon in Logan, Utah, where a flood detention basin has recently been constructed to protect an area of urban development at the mouth of the canyon. The module leads students through the design process, introducing key concepts along the way. It begins by introducing students to the concept of a watershed and methods for determining watershed properties and precipitation inputs from NOAA and NCDC sources. Then soil properties and the concepts involved in infiltration and runoff generation are introduced in support of methods for evaluating the design flood hydrograph. It concludes by introducing the use of computer models to examine alternative designs for the detention basin. Each section of the module uses active learning through hands-on activities that build the hydrologic knowledge needed to address the problem of flood protection. We will introduce the Hydroviz system and present the design cycle used to create the Dry Canyon module, including classroom implementation, student assessments of the system, and changes to the module resulting from the assessments.",

            "abstract": "Although numerous studies have been completed on the Western Caspian side (e.g. mainly Azerbaijan), very little is known about the hydrocarbon plumbing system of the deepest and southernmost basin. This region has great potentials for hydrocarbon exploration and the study of mud volcanoes located here represents the opportunity to access to an open window to better understand the stratigraphy and the mechanisms ongoing at great depth as well as the origin and signature of the seeping fluids.\nThree so far unexplored mud volcano structures (Sofikam, Gharniarigh, and Naftliche) have been mapped and sampled in the Golestan region in the south eastern Caspian Sea. All the structures have negative morphology (i.e. “pockmark like”) with caldera collapse. A multidisciplinary workflow of analyses is being conducted including gas and water geochemistry, incubation of microbial colonies, petrography of the seeping mud and erupted mud breccia clasts.\nSofikam consists of 5 distinct pools up to 4-5 m in diameter that forms an E-W oriented alignment. All of the pools display vigorous seepage of fluids and are either water- or denser mud-dominated. Gharniarigh is a large mud volcano up to ~600 m in diameter with a bulging island in the internal part of the crater where eroded gryphons ridges witness a palaeo vigorous activity. The outskirts of the “island” are almost entirely flooded with water and/or covered with salt crusts in the summer. Here are distributed several small water and gas seeps. Naftliche (~400 m wide) is filled with water with a main seep in the centre of the lake.\nPreliminary gas geochemistry indicates the seepage of methane-dominated gas in all structures with additional small portions of ethane and propane as well as iC4 in Gharniarigh and Naftliche.\nAll samples collected for microbial colonies incubation reveal strong activity with CO2 production under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well as production of biogenic methane. In particular, samples from Gharniagirgh show high rates of sulfate-reducing microbes in agreement with the strong H2S smell. Here is also detected methane oxidation activity as the microbial community seems to have adapted to methane seepage. Water geochemistry shows enrichment in all elements that is typical of brines seeping at mud volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "Our goal is to develop and validate advanced optical measurement technologies to enable accurate quantification of greenhouse gas (GHG) sources and sinks with a well-characterized uncertainty. Our focus is the measurement of distributed-area sources with spatial scales ranging from of 1 km2 to 10 km2. A few examples of distributed sources include landfills, mines, gas and oil production sites, carbon sequestration sites, enhanced oil-recovery sites, etc. The goal is to measure both concentration and wind speed of the emitted gas to determine the emission flux.\nTo achieve our measurement goals we are developing several complementary differential absorption LIDAR (DIAL) systems. The systems are designed for the detection of methane and carbon dioxide, but they vary in the type of laser source, the range resolution, the wavelength tuning method, detector type, and expected use.\nA limiting component of DIAL systems in the short wave infrared is detector technology. There are four detectors currently being tested, three single-photon detectors, and one linear-mode, which include an 8 % quantum-efficiency photomultiplier tube, 300 pixel array of Geiger-mode APDs with an effective area of 200 μm, a 100 MHz linear mode APD with a diameter of 500 μm, and a single-pixel Geiger-mode APD gated at 1.25 GHz whose active-area diameter is < 50 μm.\nWe have also acquired a commercially produced mobile aerosol LIDAR system that has the following measurement capabilities: aerosol to molecular scattering ratio, molecular temperature, density, and line-of-sight wind velocity. The aerosol LIDAR system operates at three wavelengths 1064 nm, 532 nm, and 355 nm. Extinction, backscatter, and depolarization measurements are performed at 532 nm and 1064 nm. The wind velocity and temperature measurements are performed at 355 nm and use direct detection methods. The system is housed in a trailer with scanning capabilities. The presentation will provide an overview of the NIST LIDAR systems, recent results, a discussion of detector technology, and plans for deployment of the DIAL systems.",

            "abstract": "Cold pool remnants generated by deep convection serve as a stabilizing mechanism against further episodes of convection. Often overlooked, shallower precipitating congestus clouds also generate cold pools at scales ideal for observational study. This study investigates the interaction between showery cumulus congestus and convectively generated cold pools over the ARM SGP (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Southern Great Plains) research site using a multi-sensor observational approach and an ensemble of large-eddy simulation (LES) runs.\nOn 25 May 2011, the C–band and X-band ARM Precipitation Radars (CSAPR, XSAPRs) sampled a field of precipitating shallow convection and accompanying cold pools. The thermodynamic structure of these cold pools was captured by surface observations around the SGP site, including an AERI-based retrieval that yields lower-atmospheric profiles of temperature and moisture. For this event, observations from the ARM scanning radars and vertically pointing sensors (TSI, cloud radar, ceilometer) reveal cold pools produced by precipitating congestus clouds and suggest modest suppression of congestus development across the cold pool interiors. Viewing sequences from ARM scanning radars sensitive to drizzling clouds provide limited evidence for preferential cloud development along cold pool boundaries. The generated cold pools for this event are weak (~2–3 K), but not particularly shallow (~750 m in depth). LES results are employed to establish the joint relationships between cold pool and cloud properties, in particular the effect of cold pools on the shallow cumulus field and further generation of precipitating congestus clouds.",

After its 14-month orbit its instruments and science team produced maps from which geology, mineralogy, elemental composition and internal structure of Vesta were characterized. Using data from both the high altitude and low altitude orbits, we examine visible and infrared spectra from the Pinaria region which is located between 21°-66° S lat and 0°-90° E long in the Claudia coordinate system. We present data from the visible and near-infrared spectrometer to derive band parameter maps that are interpreted in terms of mineralogy and petrology. Within the Pinaria quadrangle is Matronalia Rupes, a rim of the ~505 km south polar basin, Rheasilvia. Spectra from this rim wall have band parameters of low-iron orthopyroxene that are a marker of diogenite meteorites. Studies of diogenites support their origin from the lower crust of the basaltic achondrite parent body, which has been demonstrated via analysis of Dawn’s data sets, to be Vesta. Regolith on the smooth plains Northwest of the rim has band parameters indicative of howardites, a mixture of lower crust diogenites and crustal eucrites. The regolith here has more of a diogenitic component than eucritic, suggesting that basin ejecta mixed with the eucritic crust after formation of Rheasilvia. Another aspect of the Pinaria region is that the spectral signature of 2.8 µm OH absorption is most often absent, making this region anhydrous compared to other regions more northerly and further east of Pinaria. Current analysis suggests that hydrated material is exogenic to Vesta. Examination of the spectra of the Pinaria crater’s floor compared to its wall shows a broader 1.9 µm band of varying absorption depth that indicates a range of pyroxene composition that is expected in a regolith consisting of mixed components from different depths. The lower, anhydrous crust of Vesta is revealed in the Pinaria region.",

In addition to measuring ozone concentrations throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere, this advanced lidar system simultaneously measures aerosol extinction and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 532 nm via the HSRL technique, as well as aerosol backscatter and depolarization at 355, 532, and 1064 nm in both nadir and zenith directions. The DIAL/HSRL measurements of lidar ratio (i.e., the ratio of extinction and backscatter), aerosol depolarization ratio, backscatter color ratio, and spectral depolarization ratio (i.e., the ratio of aerosol depolarization at the two wavelengths) provide information about the aerosol physical properties and so are combined to infer aerosol type. Aerosol extinction and optical thickness are apportioned to these aerosol types. Smoke from biomass burning is identified by the lidar data and the optical parameters along with the vertical and horizontal distributions are presented from the SEAC4RS campaigns. Mixed Layer (ML) heights, which are often good proxies for daytime Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) heights, are derived along the aircraft track by locating strong gradients in the aerosol backscatter profiles. The DIAL/HSRL measurements are used to determine the fraction of AOT due to smoke within and above the ML. In addition, the DIAL/HSRL measurements from the research flight on August 6, 2013 are used to quantify and characterize smoke above uniform stratus clouds.",

            "abstract": "The effective use of remote sensing products as guidance to emergency managers and first responders during field operations requires close coordination and communication with state-level decision makers, incident commanders and the leaders of individual strike teams. Information must be tailored to meet the needs of different emergency support functions and must contain current (ideally near real-time) data delivered in standard formats in time to influence decisions made under rapidly changing conditions. Since 2003, a representative of the University of Texas Center for Space Research (CSR) has served as a member of the Governor’s Emergency Management Council and has directed the flow of information from remote sensing observations and high performance computing modeling and simulations to the Texas Division of Emergency Management in the State Operations Center. The CSR team has supported response and recovery missions resulting from hurricanes, tornadoes, flash floods, wildfires, oil spills and other natural and man-made disasters in Texas and surrounding states. Through web mapping services, state emergency managers and field teams have received threat model forecasts, real-time vehicle tracking displays and imagery to support search-and-clear operations before hurricane landfall, search-and-rescue missions following floods, tactical wildfire suppression, pollution monitoring and hazardous materials detection. Data servers provide near real-time satellite imagery collected by CSR’s direct broadcast receiving system and post data products delivered during activations of the United Nations International Charter on Space and Major Disasters. In the aftermath of large-scale events, CSR is charged with tasking state aviation resources, including the Air National Guard and Texas Civil Air Patrol, to acquire geolocated aerial photography of the affected region for wide area damage assessment. A data archive for each disaster is available online for years following the event to assist forensic studies and local plans for recovery. The use of portable devices, including commodity smartphones and tablets, will soon permit even more responsive data delivery during future disasters through the expansion of wireless Public Safety Broadband (FirstNet) targeted to serve first responders.",

            "abstract": "Global drinking water access targets are formulated around “sustainable access.” Global climate change (GCC) and associated hazards threaten the sustainability of drinking water supply. Extensive literature exists on the impacts of GCC on precipitation and water resources. However, the literature lacks a credible analysis of the vulnerability of global drinking water access. This research reports on an analysis of the current vulnerability of drinking water access due to three climate-related hazardous events: cyclone, drought and flood.\nAn ArcGIS database was built incorporating the following: population density, hazardous event frequency, drinking water technologies in use and adaptive capacity. Two global grids were incorporated first: (1) LandScanTM global population distribution; and (2) frequency of cyclone, drought and flood from ~1980-2000 from Columbia University Center for Hazards Risk Research (CHRR). Population density was used to characterize cells as urban or rural and country-level urban/rural drinking water technologies in use were added based on the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme data. Expert assessment of the resilience of each technology to each hazardous event based on WHO/DFID Vision 2030 were quantified and added to the database. Finally, country-level adaptive capacity was drawn from the “readiness” parameter of the Global Adaptation Index (GaIn). ArcGIS Model Builder and Python were used to automate the addition of datasets.\nThis presentation will report on the results of this analysis, the first credible attempt to assess the vulnerability of global drinking water access to climate-related hazardous events. This analysis has yielded country-level scores and maps displaying the ranking of exposure score (for flood, drought, cyclone, and all three in aggregate) and the corresponding country-level vulnerability scores and rankings incorporating the impact of drinking water technologies and adaptive capacity (Figure 1).",

            "abstract": "We present a new model to monitor the cycle of erosion occurring on the seaward edge of salt marshes as sea level rises. In our model, a southern New England salt marsh edge is stable when the bank edge exhibits a normal slope, is fringed by the low-marsh grass Spartina alterniflora, and the ribbed mussel Guekensia demissa is abundant. As erosion proceeds, the seaward bank becomes vertical (Stage 1), then undercut (Stage 2), then slumped (Stage 3), and finally a detached island (Stage 4) to expose a new vertical bank. If erosion progresses relatively slowly, S. alterniflora will dominate and G. demissa will be abundant.\nWe applied this model to four sites at the Barn Island Salt Marsh in southeastern Connecticut. The central headland of the heavily mosquito-ditched Headquarters Marsh appears to be the most rapidly retreating: from 2006 to 2014, the seaward bank advanced two erosional stages and lost 3 m horizontally. This headland is dominated by low-marsh S. alterniflora, with mid-marsh grasses Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens also present on the seaward edge. By comparison, the nearby seaward edge of Wequetequock Point has only S. alterniflora and bare patches with no mid-marsh species. Wequetequock Point also appears more stable, with about one quarter of the seaward bank on a normal slope and abundant mussels (mean 4,500 m-2; max 20,000 m-2).\nRepeat surveys since 2006 show mussel vacancy rate is related to the rate of erosion. Open holes appear in normal slope banks due to wave erosion of rocks and other material embedded in the exposed peat. Banks that remain in the same erosion stage for multiple years show increased mussel occupation of these holes. In contrast, rapidly eroding banks at Barn Island Marsh have very few mussels (<100 m-2) and are typically fringed by grasses other than S. alterniflora. Much of the Barn Island Marsh bank is eroding too rapidly for mussel settlement and growth and normal marsh grass succession. In addition to documenting the recent rates and mechanisms of marsh loss, using a model that combines multiple indicators of marsh edge stability can help us assess the vulnerability of salt marshes to sea level rise and storms.",

            "abstract": "Observations from the last several decades show a significant expansion of the tropical Pacific oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). However, the underlying causes remain elusive, as the currently accepted effects of ocean warming and associated solubility decease cannot fully explain the observed oxygen trend. Here we show that anthropogenic pollution can change the pattern of biological productivity and oxygen trends consistent with observations in the tropics and extratropics. These effects are caused by the mobilization of iron in mineral dust by pollutants, where it is transported and deposited to the HNLC regions of the tropical pacific affecting primary productivity and oxygen consumption by bacterial respiration. In this study, it is shown that pollution-mobilized iron deposited to high latitude oceanic environments can profoundly impact subsurface oxygen and the extent of the OMZ through long-range oceanic transport. Together with the intensification of tropical upwelling since the 1990s associated with natural climate variability, our results can explain the expansion of the OMZ in the tropical Pacific in the late twentieth century. Unlike climate variability, however, anthropogenic pollution likely influences the long-term trends in marine biogeochemistry and further alters regional productivity and subsurface oxygen distributions with profound implications for marine habitats and nitrate inventory of the oceans.",

These predictions agree within a minute of the observed effects. We can observe the apparent conjugate sunrise with equivalent sensitivity.

            "abstract": "In many parts of the world, the frequency of large flood events appears to have increased. Although it is impossible to associate any particular event with climate change, there is a general perception that climate change may be at least part of the reason for changes in the statistical distribution of floods. The Red River, sometimes called the Red River of the North, originates at the borders of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota and flows north through the Province of Manitoba before emptying into Lake Winnipeg. There have been several severe spring floods on the Red River in recent years, creating speculation that increased greenhouse gas concentrations are changing the frequency of floods. In this study, we investigate whether this is a reasonable assumption based on global climate model output. A regression model has been developed to predict spring peak discharge on the Red River at a streamflow gage located at the border of the US and Canada. The predictor variables include antecedent fall precipitation used as a proxy for soil moisture at freeze-up, winter snow accumulation, and spring precipitation during the period of melt. Data from the CMIP5 GCM model ensemble are used to determine change factors for the predictor variables. The modified predictor variables are then used to produce scenarios of floods in a changed climate. The use of multiple GCMs and multiple Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) allows for an estimate of uncertainty to be associated with the results.",

            "abstract": "It has been proposed that the long term increase in Subantarctic opal export during glacial periods, centered around 1 Ma, is related to enhanced iron deposition and, potentially, carbon dioxide drawdown. New bulk sedimentary and diatom-bound nitrogen isotope records are used in combination with opal accumulation data from ODP Site 1090 to investigate controls on export production over the last 3 Ma. Sedimentary nitrogen content tracks opal during periods of high iron accumulation, especially after ~1 Ma. Bulk sedimentary nitrogen isotope trends are negatively correlated with sedimentary N-content and opal accumulation. This may be signal weaker nutrient consumption during times of high production, perhaps as a result of enhanced vertical nutrient supply. Alternatively, this variation in bulk, where high values occur in organic poor intervals, is consistent with other evidence for nitrogen isotopic alteration during periods of low export to the seafloor. The diatom-bound nitrogen isotope record does not have a clear relationship with opal or iron accumulation. A long term shift in the diatom-bound N isotope values is apparent, where the average diatom-bound δ15N from 0.5-1 Ma is 4.4 ‰, and from 2-2.6 Ma is 5.9 ‰. This decrease may reflect long-term changes in nitrate availability. A first order comparison to planktonic/benthic carbon isotopic gradients suggests that enhanced vertical mixing may explain the observed productivity peaks and lower overall diatom-bound N isotope values in the interval centered around 1 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Water molecules traverse myriad flow paths and spend different lengths of time on or within the landscape before they are discharged into a stream channel. The transit-time distribution (TTD) is a probability distribution that represents the range and likelihood of transit times for water and conservative solutes within soils and catchments, and is useful for comparative analysis and prediction of solute transport into streams. The TTD has customarily been assumed to be time-invariant in practical applications, but is understood to vary due to unsteady flow rates, changes in water-balance partitioning, and shifting flow pathways. Recent theoretical advances have clarified how the distribution of transit times experienced by water and solutes within a stream channel at any moment in time is conditional on the specific series of precipitation events preceding that time.\nObservations resolving how TTDs vary during a specific sequence of precipitation events could be obtained by introducing unique and conservative tracers during each event and quantifying their distinct breakthrough curves in the stream. At present, the number of distinct and conservative tracers available for this purpose is insufficient. Harman and Kim [Harman, C.J. and Kim, M., 2014, Geophysical Research Letters, 41, 1567-1575] proposed a new experimental method—based on the establishment of periodic steady-state conditions—that allows multiple overlapping breakthrough curves of non-unique tracers to be decomposed, thus enabling analysis of the distinct TTDs associated with their specific times of introduction through precipitation. We present results from one of the first physical experiments to test this methodology. Our experiment involves a sloping lysimeter (10° slope) that contains one cubic meter of crushed basalt rock (loamy sand texture), an irrigation system adaptable to controlled tracer introductions, and instruments that enable total water balance monitoring. We imposed a repeated sequence of rainfall pulses and achieved periodic-steady-state conditions over 24 days. Using systematic introductions of deuterium- and chloride-enriched water, and the PERTH method, we resolve the time-conditional TTDs associated with tracer injections that occurred during specific intervals of the overall rainfall sequence.",

            "abstract": "Plant uptake and cycling of nutrients is commonly the largest flux of nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems. Hydrologic and other losses are offset by inputs from atmospheric deposition and weathering. We measured elemental and isotopic compositions from soil solution, soil exchange complex, leaves and sapwater from two canopy species, soil and rock samples, and stream and ground waters at the Shale Hills CZO. Xylem fluid and leaf samples have similar Ge/Si < 1 µmo/mol, consistent with fractionation at the root-soil water interface. Ge/Si in soil waters is higher Ge/Si near the surface and increases over the growing season, indicating preferential uptake of Si. Ca/Sr in leaves of Quercus are significantly higher (450±150) than for Acer (200±100), and Ca/Sr is generally higher in leaves than in xylem, consistent with Ca uptake during transpiration. 87Sr/86Sr in both are similar for a given site, implying that the trees access similar pools of Sr and Ca, although there are site-to-site differences. Data on litterfall rates and transpiration rates yield similar estimates of plant cycling of Ca and Si. 87Sr/86Sr in soil solutions from ridgtop and swale sites are well explained by mixing Sr derived from shale and atmospheric deposition. Valley bottom soil solutions and stream and groundwater samples include Sr and Ca derived from dissolution of diagenetic carbonates, found in drill cuttings. A preliminary estimate of the Sr and Ca stream fluxes and isotopic mass balances imply propagation of a carbonate weathering front of ca. 200 m/Ma, faster than previously reported regolith weathering advance rates based on on cosmogenic nuclides and U series (Jin et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2010). These rates are not strictly comparable and differences are at least in part consistent with the greater depth of the carbonate weathering front (Brantley et al, 2013). The data for Ca, Sr, Si and Ge in soil, soil solutions and stream waters reflects the interaction of slower weathering processes with fast biologically driven cycling between soils and biomass.",

The predictions are performed under three main themes: 1) The majority of the field rotations can be simplified to the constant-alpha force-free (CAFF) flux model first implemented circa 1990. 2) The helicity will follow the Bothmer & Schwenn system that relies on a reliable helicity prediction of active regions during solar cycle. Which has been recently confirmed by Wang [2013 ApJ]. 3) The majority of the distortions, deflections and rotations will have already occurred within coronagraphic field of view, thereby allowing the creation of a projected “volume-of-influence” on the Sun, from which Earth’s position relative to the CME can be estimated. This presentation will compare predicted results to the observations from 7 CME events and then estimate the sources of uncertainty. As an example, the difference in robust statistics from 2 solar cycles of CAFF model fittings for the field magnitude will be compared to estimates generated from simulated CME-sheaths within forecasting Enlil runs.\nThe figure displays an example field vector forecast from the techniques employed above.",

            "abstract": "During the past 5 years two microwave remote sensing space borne missions have been launched at L-band (1.4GHz) responsible for making global soil moisture and sea-surface salinity measurements. The Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission was launched by ESA in November 2009 and the Aquarius mission was launched by NASA in June 2011. Another L-band mission the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission is slated to launch no earlier than January 2015. All of these missions are responsible for making accurate and precise measurements of global geophysical phenomenon. All missions have internal calibration sources and front-end losses that can be subject to drifts, offsets and glitches. In order to completely calibrate the brightness temperatures, external calibration sources such as modeled ocean brightness temperature and modeled galactic background (cold-sky) temperatures are used. Ocean brightness temperatures are a very stable source, but in some cases (such as Aquarius) it is undesirable to calibrate measured brightness temperatures to modeled brightness temperatures. Cold-sky brightness temperatures are extremely stable to 0.1K level. Cold-sky measurements though are infrequent in nature and are also impacted by back-lobe interference from the Earth that needs to be calibrated. In addition to noise-diode drifts, front-end losses, back-lobe interference there are other issues such as antenna spillover, antenna cross-pol contamination, RF back-end offsets that need to be considered when considering external calibration. These limitations put a requirement on the nature of additional calibration sources. In the following talk, we will present additional sources required for L-band calibration such as Antarctic ice-sheets, Amazonian rain-forests, cold-sky measurements with land crossings that need to be measured in order to back-out various inter-dependent calibration terms. We will present modeling issues of the rain-forest at L-band (due to transmissivity properties at low-frequencies) as well as suitability of the Antarctic regions for calibration. We will also discuss the suitability of the calibration sources with respect to absolute and relative calibration.",

The West Fork Fire Complex consumed 88,724 acres of forest in the state of Colorado during the summer of 2013. The majority (88%) of the burn area was comprised of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmanii) trees killed previously by Spruce Beetle (Ips spp.). Damage to the soils was of moderate to high severity in the majority of the area (60%). The recent fire surrounded the Rio Grande, affecting water quality and habitat critical to insects and fish. The water quality of the Rio Grande (above and below the burn) and some of the effected tributaries is currently being monitored for both quality and quantity. Parameters important to the survival of aquatic life, such as flow, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, turbidity, nutrients, and suspended and dissolved metals are being monitored along the Rio Grande and in tributaries. Macroinvertebrate and fish populations are sampled in the same locations. First year observations showed the ecosystem to be relatively resilient, with stable water quality and survival of insects and fish. However, an intense monsoon season this summer is driving extensive sediments into tributaries from steep, severely burned hillslopes. These monsoon events have caused acute and dramatic fish kills, where hundreds of trout were reported killed in one tributary in a single day event. Turbidity was observed as high as 488 NTU in the impacted stream with fish kill, whereas the turbidity was 25 NTU in a neighboring tributary outside of the burn area. Salmonids can be negatively impacted by relatively low turbidity, with prior studies noting that the turbidity threshold for rainbow trout is 70 NTU. Continued monitoring of water quality, macroinvertebrate populations, and fish populations is being undertaken to determine the key drivers of the acute fish kill events. This presentation will highlight the role of burn severity, steepness of slope, hill aspect, and storm intensity on water quality and aquatic response of fire-impacted streams of the Upper Rio Grande.",

And yet, our understanding of the baseline conditions of pre-settlement vegetation is generally weak. Many estimates of terrestrial carbon pools before Euroamerican settlement are based on hypothetical potential vegetation, and even data-derived estimates of biomass do not have statistical estimates of uncertainty. We fit a spatial statistical model to forest survey (PLS) data from the time of settlement across Midwesterm states from Minnesota to Indiana. Our spatial model scales diameter data from the PLS surveys by standard allometries to produce maps at 8km resolution of biomass with associated uncertainty for all major tree taxa and plant functional types and for total woody biomass. General trends in biomass are consistent with previous estimates, but fine scale heterogeneity is more revealed in our biomass product. A full accounting of uncertainty in settlement-era biomass allows us to assess the extent to which biomass has recovered across a vegetation gradient from subboreal forests to oak savannas and prairies and across land-use histories ranging from preserved old-growth forests through areas reforesting after intensive logging and agriculture to areas currently experiencing a range of intensive human activity.",

The combination of the measurements performed by these 3 subsystems provides: the number, the mass, the momentum and the velocity distribution of dust grains emitted from the cometary nucleus.No prior in situ dust dynamical measurements at these close distances from the nucleus and starting from such large heliocentric distances are available up to date. We present here the first results obtained from the beginning of the Rosetta scientific phase. We will report dust grains early detection at about 800 km from the nucleus in August 2014 and the following measurements that allowed us characterizing the 67P/C-G dust environment at distances less than 100 km from the nucleus and single grains dynamical properties.\n Acknowledgements.

            "abstract": "As climate changes, the final date of spring snowmelt is projected to occur earlier in the year within the western United States. This earlier snowmelt timing may impact crop yield in snow-dominated watersheds by changing the timing of water delivery to agricultural fields. There is considerable uncertainty about how agricultural impacts of snowmelt timing may vary by region, crop-type, and practices like irrigation vs. dryland farming. Establishing the relationship between snowmelt timing and agricultural yield is important for understanding how changes in large-scale climatic indices (like snowmelt date) may be associated with changes in agricultural yield. A better understanding of the influence of changes in snowmelt on non-irrigated crop yield may additionally be extrapolated to better understand how climate change may alter biomass production in non-managed ecosystems. We utilized parametric regression techniques to isolate the magnitude of impact snowmelt timing has had on historical crop yield independently of climate and spatial variables that also impact yield. To do this, we examined the historical relationship between snowmelt timing and non-irrigated wheat and barley yield using a multiple linear regression model to predict yield in several Idaho counties as a function of snowmelt date, climate variables (precipitation and growing degree-days), and spatial differences between counties. We utilized non-parametric techniques to determine where snowmelt timing has positively versus negatively impacted yield. To do this, we developed classification and regression trees to identify spatial controls (e.g. latitude, elevation) on the relationship between snowmelt timing and yield.\nMost trends suggest a decrease in crop yield with earlier snowmelt, but a significant opposite relationship is observed in some regions of Idaho. An earlier snowmelt date occurring at high latitudes corresponds with higher than average wheat yield. Therefore, Northern Idaho may benefit from planting wheat in years with early snowmelt timing. Barley grown in counties with low elevation and low topography may also benefit from early snowmelt timing. Despite the beneficial relationship in some counties, wheat and barley yield have been lower on average in past years with early snowmelt timing in most of Idaho.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands play a significant role on the hydrological cycle, reducing peak flows through water storage functions and sustaining low flows through slow release of water. However, their impacts on water resource availability and flood control are mainly driven by wetland types and locations within a watershed. So, despite the general agreement about these major hydrological functions, little is known about their spatial and typological influences. Consequently, assessing the quantitative impact of wetlands on hydrological regimes has become a relevant issue for both the scientific community and the decision-maker community. To investigate the hydrologic response at the watershed scale, mathematical modelling has been a well-accepted framework. Specific isolated and riparian wetland modules were implemented in the PHYSITEL/HYDROTEL distributed hydrological modelling platform to assess the impact of the spatial distribution of isolated and riparian wetlands on the stream flows of the Becancour River watershed, Quebec, Canada. More specifically, the focus was on assessing whether stream flow parameters, including peak flow, low flow and flow volume, were related to: (i) the percentage and the distribution of wetlands in the watershed, (ii) geographic location of wetlands, and (iii) seasons. Preliminary results suggest that: (i) integration of specific wetland modules can slightly improve HYDROTEL’s ability to replicate basic hydrograph characteristics; and (ii) isolated and riparian wetlands have individual space- and time-dependent impacts on the hydrologic response of the study watershed.",

            "abstract": "We describe the development of a model for landslide tsunami generation based on a depth-integrated, fully deformable lower layer, and apply the resulting model to several laboratory and field cases. The approach follows on earlier studies where models for the slide layer and overlying water layer are formulated in the depth integrated, shallow water approximation, with kinematic and pressure coupling between the layers. In the present study, we use the 3D nonhydrostatic model of Ma et al (2012) to retain fully dispersive behavior in the upper fluid layer. In perfect fluid applications for shallow or intermediate depth waves, the model has been shown to predict tsunami response to solid slides (Enet and Grilli, 2007) with good accuracy using only three vertical sigma levels, making it computationally competitive with weakly dispersive Boussinesq formulations using a single depth-integrated layer. The effect of non-hydrostatic acceleration effects in the lower, depth integrated layer (resulting from steep substrate slopes) is implemented using the approach of Yamazaki et al (2009), who used a layer-averaged approximation for vertical acceleration to correct the hydrostatic pressure distribution. The two coupled models are formulated using a finite volume, TVD approach. Lateral boundaries of the slide volume may be arbitrarily approached relative to the initial still water shoreline, and thus the triggering event may be either submarine, subaerial, or a combination of the two. In our first implementation, we assume the lower layer to be a simple, viscous Newtonian fluid, following the approach of Jiang and LeBlond (1994) as corrected by Fine et al (1998). An alternate model is also constructed based on a rheology model representing a granular or debris flow supported by intergranular stresses, following Savage and Hutter (1989) and Iverson (1997). Both models amount to the addition of a single mass and horizontal momentum equation to the three-layer perfect fluid model, and hence the added complexity over the solid slide case of Ma et al (2012) is minimal. Each model is then applied to a range of cases, including laboratory measurements of a rapid subaerial slide (Mohammed and Fritz, 2012), and a potential collapse of the the southern Great Bahama Bank platform margin (Schnyder et al, 2013).",

            "abstract": "Joints are the most common example of brittle tensile failure in the crust. Their genesis at depth is linked to the natural hydraulic fracturing, which requires pore fluid pressure in excess of the minimum in situ stress [Pollard and Aidyn, JSG1988]. Depending on the geological setting, high pore pressure can result form burial compaction of interbedded strata, diagenesis, or tectonics. Common to these loading scenarios is slow build-up of pore pressure over a geological timescale, until conditions for initiation of crack growth are met on favorably oriented/sized flaws. The flaws can vary in size from grain-size cracks in igneous rocks to a fossil-size flaws in clastic rock, and once activated, are inferred to propagate mostly subcritically [Segall JGR 1984; Olson JGR 1993].\nDespite many observational studies of natural hydraulic fractures, the modeling attempts appear to be few [Renshaw and Harvey JGR 1994]. Here, we use boundary integral formulation for the pore fluid inflow from the permeable rock into a propagating joint [Berchenko et al. IJRMMS 1997] coupled with the criteria for subcritical propagation assisted by the environmental effects of pore fluid at the crack tip to solve for the evolution of a penny-shape joint, which, in interbedded rock, may eventually evolve to short-blade geometry (propagation confined to a bed).\nInitial growth is exceedingly slow, paced by the stress corrosion reaction kinetics at the crack tip. During this stage the crack is fully-drained (i.e. the fluid pressure in the crack is equilibrated with the ambient pore pressure). This “slow” stage is followed by a rapid acceleration, driven by the increase of the mechanical stress intensity factor with the crack length, towards the terminal joint velocity. We provide an analytical expression for the latter as a function of the rock diffusivity, net pressure loading at the initiation (or flaw lengthscale), and parameters describing resistance to fracture growth. Due to a much slower rate of the crack volume expansion of short-blade joints compared to that of penny-shape joints, the former would propagate much faster than the latter under otherwise identical conditions. Finally, we speculate about possible relation of the predicted patterns of joint development with morphology of joint fracture surfaces observed in sedimentary rock.",

            "abstract": "The increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases such as CO2 has caused noticeable climate change. Since increased CO2 may contribute to carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems through the CO2 cycle between the atmosphere and vegetation, it is necessary to improve methods for measuring C in soil. In this study, we determined the total carbon concentrations of soils using a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The LIBS is a minimally destructive measurement technique that uses an ultra-short laser pulse to create plasma on the sample surface via the process of laser ablation. Compared with the traditional C measurements methods techniques such as wet oxidation and dry combustion, LIBS is known as a potentially elegant and promising solution for measuring C in soils. Although previous studies suggested the advantages of LIBS for measuring the C in soils, there are still challenging obstacles to be solved in measuring C. Previous studies have shown that the C in soil can be detected at wavelengths of 193.03 and 247.86 nm. The C line at 247.86 nm shows strong interference with Fe lines at 247.86 nm and 247.95 nm due to overlapping or self-absorption. To dismiss the problem of measuring the C line at 247.86 nm, the C line at 193.03 nm has been used to observe C emission. The C line at 193.03 nm can be quantified without interference from other elements, however, the ratio of Al line (198.90 nm) and Si line (212.40 nm) were used as standardizing factors to develop a significant calibration curve for soils. Although the wavelengths of both 193.03 and 247.86 nm presented the potential to measure C in soils, there has still been a lack of studies comparing the accuracy and effectiveness between the 193.03- and 247.8-nm C lines to analyze soil samples with different chemical and textural characteristics. In this study, we conducted extensive measurements of the C lines at 193.03 and 247.86 nm using LIBS to evaluate the C concentrations of Korean soils with different chemical and physical properties (i.e., wetland, forest, and sediment). The main objectives in this study are (1) to evaluate C concentrations using the C line at 247.86 nm, (2) to evaluate C concentrations using the C line at 193.03 nm and (3) to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of using the two C lines at 193.03 and 247.86 nm.\n ",

            "abstract": "Current interglacial development of a nearly continuous peat cover in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada has resulted in a globally significant carbon (C) reservoir. Yet, the fate of peatland C stores and related climate system feedbacks remain uncertain under scenarios of a changing climate and enhanced anthropogenic pressure. Here, we examine peatland development in the HBL in relation to Holocene C-dynamics, together with records of paleo- and modern climate, glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and paleoenvironmental change. We report that the timing of peat initiation is tightly coupled with GIA in the HBL, while peatland age, trophic status, and paleoclimate contribute to explaining some of the temporal variation in C accumulation rates (CARs). Our results show that CARs are greatest from younger, minerotrophic peatlands and in association with warmer Holocene climates. Peat initiation rates and CARs in the HBL were greatest during the mid-Holocene; however, model evidence indicates that two-thirds of the HBL C pool is stored in peat of late Holocene age, owing to long-term peatland expansion and development. Since mid-Holocene peat initiation, the HBL has been a net C-sink and currently stores ~ 30 Pg C, with spatial climate patterns accounting for up to half of the C-mass distribution. Yet, the HBL has also been a modest C-source since peat initiation, with 85% of the losses occurring during the late Holocene. Our results indicate that the HBL may have been a potential terrestrial source of 1 – 7 Tg CH4 y-1 to the late Holocene atmosphere, due to the decay of previously accrued peat, under wetter conditions than present, and from a landscape occupied by an abundance of minerotrophic peatlands. While the peatlands of the HBL may continue to function as a globally significant C reservoir, conservative climate scenarios predict a warmer and wetter HBL in the next century that may lie outside the range of past climate variability. Disproportionate hydroclimatic change may alter the net water balance in the HBL resulting in C losses that may have important implications for the global C budget and climate system. Further investigation regarding autogenic and allogenic controls on spatial-temporal C dynamics is warranted and may contribute to reducing the uncertainty concerning the HBL’s potential to remain a long-term net C-sink.",

General Circulation Models (GCMs) are the primary tools that are used in climate change impact studies. In this study evaluation of the new generation models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) was conducted for various characteristics of precipitation over the upper Blue Nile basin. This is based on over 20 GCMs and two emission scenarios from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The daily precipitation for the current period 1971-2000 was compared with future projections for the period 2071-2100. The performance of GCMs to project mean and total precipitation at different time scales and the frequency of occurrence of extreme precipitation are thoroughly assessed. About one-third of the models produced acceptable performance in terms of minimum root mean squared error and mean error although there is no clear correlation with the spatial resolution or the type of climate models. Wide uncertainty range comprising both increasing (~100%) and decreasing precipitation (~-30%) change is expected towards the end of the 21st century when considering all GCMs, indicating the need to carefully select models when conducting impact analysis studies.",

            "abstract": "Colloid retention and release is well known to depend on a wide variety of physical, chemical, and microbiological factors that may vary temporally in the subsurface environment. We present equilibrium, kinetic, combined equilibrium and kinetic, and two-site kinetic models of colloid release during transient physicochemical conditions. Our mathematical modeling approach relates colloid release under transient conditions to changes in the fraction of the solid surface area that contributes to retention. The developed models were subsequently applied to experimental colloid release datasets to investigate the influence of variations in ionic strength (IS), pH, cation exchange, colloid size, and water velocity on release. Various combinations of equilibrium and/or kinetic release models were needed to describe the experimental data depending on the transient conditions and colloid type. Release of E. coli D21g was promoted by a decrease in solution IS and an increase in pH, similar to expected trends for a reduction in the secondary minimum and nanoscale chemical heterogeneity, respectively. The retention and release of 20 nm carboxyl modified latex nanoparticles (NPs) were demonstrated to be more sensitive to the presence of Ca2+ than D21g. Specifically, retention of NPs was greater than D21g in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2 solution, and release of NPs only occurred after exchange of Ca2+ by Na+ and then a reduction in the solution IS. These findings highlight the limitations of conventional interaction energy calculations to describe colloid retention and release, and point to the need to consider Born repulsion and nanoscale heterogeneity. Temporal changes in the water velocity did not have a large influence on the release of D21g. This insensitivity was likely due to factors that reduce the applied hydrodynamic torque and/or increase the resisting adhesive torque. Collectively, experimental and modeling results indicate that episodic colloid transport in the subsurface is expected because of transient conditions.",

In this study, we use earthquakes in the Southeast Asia recorded at dense stations in the North and Central Americas (the USArray and permanent stations). The data provide dense samples of the inner core (at distances of less than 120 degrees to over 160 degrees) beneath the Northern-Northwestern Pacific across the boundary (180° in longitude) between the eastern and western hemispheres. We focus our attenuation on the PKIKP, PKiKP, and PKP(BC) phases, which have very similar ray paths through the mantle, thus most sensitive to the ICB structure. Our goal is to resolve the lateral and depth variations of the fine structures of the velocity and attenuation near the ICB and the transition of the structures across the hemispheric boundary.",

Unfortunately, there is still a lack of awareness on how the sun is capable of affecting Earth. The over all idea of “Reading The Sun” installation is to help demonstrate how the sun impacts the Earth, by compiling various data sources from satellites (SOHO, SDO, and STERO) with solar and solar wind models (MAS and ENLIL) to create a comprehensive three dimensional display of the solar environment. It focuses on the current solar maximum of solar cycle 24 and a CME that impacted Earth’s magnetic field on February 27, 2014, which triggered geomagnetic storms around the Earth’s poles. The CME was an after-effect of a class X4.9 solar flare, which was released from the sun on February 25, 2014. “Reading The Sun” is a 48” x 48” x 48” hanging model of the sun with color coded open opposing magnetic field lines along with various layers of the solar atmosphere, the heliospheric current sheet, and the inner planets. At the center of the xyz axis is the sun with the open magnetic field lines and the heliospheric current sheet permeating inner planetary space. The xyz axes are color coded to represent various types of information with corresponding visual images for the viewer to be able to read the model. Along the z-axis are three colors (yellow, orange, and green) that represent the different layers of the solar atmosphere (photosphere, chromosphere, and corona) that correspond to three satellite images in various spectrums related to a CME and Solar Flare and the xy-plane shows where the inner planets are in relation to the sun.\n The exhibit in which “Reading The Sun “is being displayed is called, The Rotation of Language at the Wheather Again Gallery in Rockaway, New York.

            "abstract": "We present an update on the progress made using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) next-generation radio telescope for space-weather related activities – namely observations of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) and the first tests of observing heliospheric Faraday rotation (FR). The former has been used for half a century for heliospheric science and much progress has been made in recent years for using IPS in space weather science and forecasting. The latter, typically an astrophysical technique that uses pulsars and extragalactic radio sources to study the Galactic magnetic field, is now being investigated for heliospheric studies. The determination of heliospheric FR, combined with observations of IPS, can provide essential information on the Sun’s extended magnetic-field structure out into the inner heliosphere, especially when also combined with other forms of remote-sensing/heliospheric imaging data, and in-situ measurements. Here, we will present recent observations of IPS using LOFAR, including preliminary highlights from the first LOFAR joint IPS and heliospheric FR science campaign and investigate pathways for determining Bzfrom, and an overview of the potential of, such observations. LOFAR is an interferometric phased-array radio telescope that can be used to observe between 10 MHz (depending on ionospheric conditions) and 240 MHz, and consists of many relatively-low-cost antennas. These antennas are organised into ‘stations’ located in an area of ~100km diameter in the Netherlands, with additional international stations spread across central and western Europe with several more in the planning stages.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric dust can be used to record climate change in addition to itself playing a role in several key climate processes, such as affecting Earth’s albedo, fomenting rain coalescence, encouraging biological productivity, and enhancing carbon export though particle sinks. Using deep sea sediments, it is possible to quantify and locate the sources and sinks of atmospheric dust. A key area of research is the shift in the inter-tropical converge zone (ITCZ), a thermally influenced area that shifts according to the northern and southern hemisphere temperature gradient. This ongoing project focuses on the changes of the ITCZ over the Central Equatorial Pacific (CEP) over the past ~25000 years. The research focuses on two cores taken from the Line Islands Ridge at 0° 29' N (ML1208-18GC), and 4° 41' N (ML1208-31BB). The main aim is to quantify the magnitude and provenance of windblown dust deposited in the CEP, and to address questions regarding the nature of the variations of dust through ice-age climate transitions.\nRadiogenic isotopes (Sr, Nd, Pb) have been successfully used to distinguish between different potential dust sources in the aluminosilicates fractions of Pacific Sediments. Our preliminary Pb isotope ratios suggest that, for modern deposition, the northern core’s (31BB) detrital sediment fraction is likely sourced from Asian Loess (average ratios are 206Pb/204Pb = 18.88, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.69, 208Pb/204Pb = 39.06). The equatorial core’s (18GC) detrital fraction has a less radiogenic Pb signature, which is consistent with South American dust sourcing (206Pb/204Pb = 18.62, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.63, 208Pb/204Pb = 38.62). This is indicative of a strong modern ITCZ that acts as an effective barrier for inter-hemispheric dust transport. Prior to Holocene time, the changes in Pb isotope ratios in both cores appear to be in anti-phase; the northern core becomes less radiogenic up to the LGM, while the southern core becomes more radiogenic. This is potentially due to a weakening of the ITCZ during glacial times. Future work on Nd isotope will shed additional light on subtle differences in dust isotopic composition within the source regions of interest, including the different volcanic zones of South America.",

Realistic representations of such systems have so far been hampered by technical limitations of most hydrothermal reactive transport codes, namely the ability to represent discrete fracture networks in a porous rock matrix. We present the first three-dimensional simulation results obtained from coupling a combined finite element – finite volume scheme of the revised CSMP++ flow simulation platform (1) with the GEMIPM3K (2) chemical equilibration code. In these, we represented fracture zones as thin, porous zones of higher permeability. The simulations demonstrate the effects of fracture zone orientation relative to the pressure field and fracture zone intersections on the differential advance of reaction fronts. We outline our numerical approaches for testing and comparing the effect of various ways of representing fractures and fracture zones in irregular meshes, namely the possibility of using layers of prism elements to represent fractures of finite thickness with internally varying properties and the possibility to represent thin fractures as lower dimensional (=2D) elements. We intend to make use of the “split node” capabilities of CSMP++ (3) to maintain sharp interfaces at material boundaries in order to be able to study the transient influence of reactive flow on fracture and matrix permeability in irregularly fractured rock masses.",

Limitation in existing measuring system to characterize this spatial variability, and its importance in various application have resulted in a need of reconciling spatially distributed soil moisture evolution model and corresponding measurements. Fully distributed ecohydrological model simulates soil moisture at high resolution soil moisture. This is relevant for range of environmental studies e.g., flood forecasting. They can also be used to evaluate the value of space born soil moisture data, by assimilating them into hydrological models. In this study, fine resolution soil moisture data simulated by a physically-based distributed hydrological model, tRIBS-VEGGIE, is compared with soil moisture data collected during the field campaign in Turkey river basin, Iowa.\nThe soil moisture series at the 2 and 4 inch depth exhibited a more rapid response to rainfall as compared to bottom 8 and 20 inch ones. The spatial variability in two distinct land surfaces of Turkey River, IA, reflects the control of vegetation, topography and soil texture in the characterization of spatial variability. The comparison of observed and simulated soil moisture at various depth showed that model was able to capture the dynamics of soil moisture at a number of gauging stations. Discrepancies are large in some of the gauging stations, which are characterized by rugged terrain and represented, in the model, through large computational units.",

We will focus on determining the strength of Es, their peak altitude and other parameters between the 90 – 110 km altitude ranges. Previous work has showed that the descending layers are dominated by the tidal influence that displays seasonal variability. To understand the reasons of this variability, we will fit Gaussian profiles to electron density concentrations to extract the layer parameters.

            "abstract": "The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) offers a vision for K-12 science education that has important differences from common and long-standing classroom practice in many ways. NGSS’s three dimensions (Scientific and Engineering Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Disciplinary Core Ideas), coupled with the recognition that it takes years to develop deep understandings of big ideas, do not mesh well with common K-12 (or K-16) teaching practices. NGSS also infuses systems and complexity into the K-12 curriculum.\nThe Critical Zone lies between the bottom of the groundwater and the tops of the trees -- the layer of the Earth system where most life resides. Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs) are NSF-funded observatories in markedly varied ecosystems throughout the US, where interdisciplinary teams study the interplay of geological, biological, physical, and chemical sciences. The work being done in CZOs is three-dimensional science that is both deepening the scientific community’s understandings of Earth systems and providing a cutting edge and highly relevant model for K-12 science education.\nVirtual Fieldwork Experiences (VFEs) are multi-media representations of actual field sites that are intended to mimic fieldwork by allowing for open-ended inquiry. The Paleontological Research Institution has developed tools and strategies to build VFEs of any site that use consistent formats, yet allow for inquiry to take multiple directions. Working together with CZO scientists, PRI staff are developing VFEs and accompanying curriculum materials for each CZO site. Ready-to-use VFEs act as models that teachers and students can use to create VFEs local to their schools. VFEs, like CZOs, facilitate use of interdisciplinary science to better understand the environment. A local VFE can be built up over time with contributions from students and teachers in middle school sciences, high school biology, Earth science, and environmental science -- classes where most curriculum units relate to processes outside the classroom door. A local VFE can also be used in chemistry and physics classes, where these sciences can be applied to understanding the environment. The Southern Sierra CZO draft VFE will be shown to demonstrate the concept and seek feedback.",

Because most people live in cities, urban streamflow patterns and precipitation events have a large impact on the global population. Urban environments can alter natural streamflow and precipitation patterns in a localized area. This study introduces a novel way to characterize this interference: the weekly hydrometeorological signature. Daily streamflow and precipitation data is collected from USGS gages around three climatically-different major American cities: Chicago, Los Angeles, and Charlotte. The following hypothesis is tested: a persistent weekly pattern (Monday through Sunday) exists in the hydrometeorological data which is unique to each city. All three cities appear to exhibit a persistent weekly pattern which is unique to that city for various climatological, industrial, and topographic reasons. Further study is needed; however these findings have important implications for understanding urban weather and can serve as a unique identifier, or fingerprint, for human interference to local streamflow and precipitation patterns.",

            "abstract": "Open-top chambers (OTCs) are widely used to passively increase soil and air temperature in various open habitats, such as alpine and arctic tundra, and temperate grasslands. Several studies report warming effects of 1-2 °C in arctic and alpine tundra, and up to 6 °C in temperate grasslands. The variation between studies can be mostly attributed to differences in the abiotic environment, such as snow cover and solar irradiance. Vegetation height and openness affects the amount of irradiance that reaches the ground and may therefore indirectly impact the effectiveness of OTCs. The use of OTCs in forested ecosystems might therefore be limited by reduced canopy openness, while their effect on changes in soil temperature and soil moisture content might additionally be affected by the understory vegetation type and cover. Nevertheless, OTC’s are an immensely useful tool in climate-change studies, and could benefit research in forest ecosystems. In this study we therefore investigated whether OTCs can be used to manipulate microclimate in the northern boreal forest and how tree canopy cover and understory vegetation influence OTC effects on air and soil temperature and on soil moisture content.\nWe compared OTC effects at ten sites that were situated along a fire chronosequence in the northern boreal forest in Sweden. Sites were dominated by Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies, and time since the last fire ranged from 47-367 years, resulting in varying degrees of tree canopy openness. We applied full factorial combinations of OTC warming and dwarf shrub removal and moss removal at each site. We measured canopy cover using hemispherical photography; air and soil temperature as well as soil moisture were measured hourly from June until September. Preliminary analyses indicate that OTCs increased monthly mean air temperatures by up to 0.9 °C across all treatments and forest stands. However, the degree of warming showed clear relations with the presence or absence of the understory vegetation and tree canopy cover. Our results show that OTCs can be used effectively in boreal forest ecosystems and will help design future experiments that will investigate effects of a changing climate on vegetation and soil processes.",

            "abstract": "Assimilation of active and passive (AP) microwave observations at L-band in the crop simulation models is able to improve estimates of soil moisture (SM) and crop growth in the models. These observations provide complementary information for dynamic heterogeneous landscapes. Active observations are more sensitive to soil surface roughness and vegetation structure, while passive observations are more sensitive to SM. These observations may be available at different spatial and temporal resolutions from different satellite platforms. For example, the present ESA Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission provides passive observations at 1.41 GHz at 25 km every 2-3 days, while the NASA/CONAE Aquarius mission provides L-band AP observations at spatial resolution of 150 km with a repeat coverage of 7 days for global SM products. The planned NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive mission (SMAP) will provide AP observations at 1.26 and 1.41 GHz at the spatial resolutions of 3 and 30 km, respectively, with a repeat coverage of 2-3 days, starting early 2015.\nThe goal of this study is to develop an Ensemble Kalman Filter-based methodology that assimilates synchronously and asynchronously available backscattering coefficients (σ0) and brightness temperatures (TB) at different spatial scales from SMOS and Aquarius. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) that contains a suite of crop simulation models will be linked to microwave emission and scattering models (DSSAT-A-P) for the assimilation. The methodology will be implemented in the rain fed agricultural region of the Brazilian La Plata Basin in South America, where soybean is the primary crop. The augmented state vector will include both model states and parameters related to soil and vegetation during the growing season. The methodology will be evaluated using a synthetic experiment and also using observations from SMOS and Aquarius. In preliminary results with synthetic experiment, using asynchronous observations improved SM by 0.05 and 0.04 m3/m3 and vegetation biomass by 0.2 and 0.27 kg/m2, using passive-only and both AP observations, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Headwater streams provide drinking water for millions of people and serve a significant nexus, contributing to the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of navigable waters. Long-term research sites, such as the Fernow Experimental Forest serve as the regions bellwether for ecological change. Nevertheless, few studies have quantified the long term impacts of forest treatment and climate change on streamflow for the catchments of the Fernow. This study serves this roll by accessing the change in water and energy balance of four catchments (WS-1, WS-4, WS-6, WS-7) subject to forest harvest, natural and suppressed regrowth, and stand conversion. We apply the Budyko framework to quantify the relative contributions of climate and land cover changes on annual streamflow between two time periods and over a five year interval spanning 1951-2011. Based on this analysis land-use, forest succession, and climate change-variability are differentially impacting streamflow. In the two-period analysis climate change is responsible for on average 3 % change in mean annual runoff (MAR). Forest harvest and/or succession caused changes in MAR of -0.8 % to -30.0 %. The Budyko decomposition method applied over five year intervals captured the influence of forest treatment on streamflow well. However, the reference (WS-4) is changing in ways that climate alone cannot describe. Overall, it is important to consider how climate, land-use disturbance, and forest succession corroborate by distinguishing their respective impacts.",

            "abstract": "Although agriculture accounts for about 80% of the global anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, large uncertainties exist in regional inventories of N2O emissions from agriculture. The uncertainties mainly include poorly quantified plant flux, large heterogeneity of direct N2O emissions from cropland, and underestimated N2O lost through leaching and run off.\nTo evaluate these uncertainties we conducted observations on three contrasting scales in the Midwest U.S., an agriculture dominated region (Zhang et al., 2014a). Observations at the plant, ecosystem, and regional scales include: 1) N2O flux measurements from the aboveground section of corn and soybean plants using newly designed plant chamber; 2) N2O flux-gradient measurements in a soybean-corn rotation field; and 3) N2O concentration measurements at 3 m and 200 m level on a communication tower (KCMP tower, 44°41'19''N, 93°4'22''W) that were used to estimate regional N2O fluxes with boundary layer methods (Zhang et al., 2014b).\nWith these observations we evaluated the uncertainties in two frequently-used N2O inventories: EDGAR42 (Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research, release version 4.2); and a national GHG inventory (U.S. EPA, 2014). The results indicate that EDGAR42 and EPA inventory underestimated N2O emissions for the region around the KCMP tower at least by a factor of three and two respectively. The underestimation is not likely caused by neglecting N2O flux from crops since N2O fluxes from unfertilized soybean and fertilized corn plants were about one magnitude lower than N2O emissions from the soil-plant ecosystem. The direct N2O emissions from cropland accounted for less than 20% of the regional flux, suggesting a significant influence by other sources and indirect emissions in the regional N2O budget.\n",

            "abstract": "Drylands and semi-arid ecosystems cover over 45% of the global landmass. These biomes have been shown to be extremely sensitive to changes in climate, specifically decreases in precipitation and increases in air temperature. Therefore, inter-annual variability in climate has the potential to dramatically impact the carbon budget at regional and global scales. In the Southwestern US, we are in a unique position to investigate these relationships by leveraging eight years of data from the New Mexico Elevation Gradient (NMEG), eight flux towers that span six representative biomes across the semi-arid Southwest. From C4 desert grasslands to subalpine mixed conifer forests, the NMEG flux towers use identical instrumentsand processing, and afford a unique opportunity to explore patterns in biome-specific ecosystem processes and climate sensitivity. Over the last eight years the gradient has experienced climatic variability that span from wet years to an episodic megadrought. Here we report the effects of this extreme inter-annual variability in climate on the ability of semi-arid ecosystems to cycle and store energy and carbon. We also investigated biome-specific patterns of ecosystem light and water use efficiency during a series of wet and dry years, and how these vary in response to air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, evaporative fraction, and precipitation. Our initial results suggest that significant drought reduced the maximum ecosystem assimilation of carbon most at the C4 grasslands, creosote shrublands, juniper savannas, and ponderosa pine forests, with 60%, 50%, 35%, and 50% reduction respectively, relative to a wet year. Ecosystem light use efficiency tends to show the highest maximum values at the low elevation sites as a function of water availability, with the highest annual values consistently at the middle elevation and ponderosa pine sites. Water use efficiency was strongly biome dependent with the middle elevation sites showing the highest efficiencies, and the greatest within year variability at the lower elevation sites, with strong sensitivities to vapor pressure deficit. By quantifying the biome-specific ecosystem processes and functional responses, this network provides valuable insight about how vulnerable this range of semi-arid ecosystems is to future climate scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Nadir images of Rayleigh scattered UV sunlight (265 nm) from the Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) instrument on the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite contain many periodic structures. These structures are believed to be the result of Gravity Waves (GW). In this work, we investigate the theoretical impact of GWs on the albedo imagery. We show that GWs are indeed capable of producing the observed structures. The sensitivity to GW perturbations peaks at an altitude of ~50 km with a FWHM of ~15 km with images taken at mid to polar latitudes. For vertical wavelengths greater than 15 km, this corresponds to GWs with momentum fluxes greater than ~0.1-0.01 mPa. Vertical wavelengths less than ~10 km require amplitudes larger than static stability considerations allow, so these GWs are not observable. Observable horizontal wavelengths range from approximately 20 to 300 km. These wavelength ranges correspond to a sensitivity to GWs with an intrinsic period shorter than ~2.5 hrs.\nExisting satellite GW studies in this altitude region use limb scanners or microwave nadir imagers, which are sensitive to much longer horizontal wavelengths. This tends to limit the sensitivity to longer period waves. Therefore, the addition of CIPS imagery to the existing coverage of GW measurements is complimentary - significantly expanding the spectral coverage of GWs near the stratopause. Short period GWs observed by CIPS carry significantly larger momentum flux than the climatological averages seen for longer period GWs, so important differences may exist. GWs are critically important to middle atmosphere dynamics, and their representation in global climate models is not well constrained by observations.",

            "abstract": "After greenhouse gases, aerosols are thought to have the largest contribution to total atmospheric radiative forcing, but they are frequently cited as the single largest source of uncertainty among all anthropogenic radiative forcing components. Remote sensing allows for global measurements of aerosol properties, however validation of these measurements and the climatological assumptions used in their retrieval algorithms require high quality in situ sampling. The Laboratory for Aerosols, Clouds and Optics (LACO) at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) has developed the Imaging Nephelometer, a novel and highly accurate instrument concept designed to significantly aid in situ optical scattering measurements.\nImaging Nephelometers allow for measurements of scattering coefficient, phase function and polarized phase function over a wide angular range of 2 to 178 degrees with an angular resolution of less than half of a degree. The simple layout of these devices also permits the construction of an instrument that is compact enough to be deployed on a variety of airborne platforms. Additionally, a version of this instrument that is capable of in situ sampling in open-air, free from sample biases potentially introduced by an inlet or containment apparatus, has recently been constructed. This instrument, known as the Open Imaging NEPHelometer (OI-NEPH), was flown on the P3 aircraft in the summer of 2014 during the Colorado portion of the Discover-AQ field mission (Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality).\nThis presentation will focus on the results of the OI-NEPH’s successful science flights during this field experiment. The P3’s flights during this mission focused primarily on vehicle, agriculture, biomass burning and industrial processing emissions over the Colorado Front Range. Emphasis will be placed on any observed differences in scattering properties between the measurements made by the inlet-free OI-Neph and a second cabin based instrument, the Polarized Imaging Nephelometer (PI-Neph). Additionally, phase function measurements made during spirals over AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) stations will be compared with AERONET retrieved phase functions in an effort to assess the quality of these inversions",

            "abstract": "In order to understand the paucity of high-energy solar energetic particle (SEP) events in solar cycle 24, we examined all major eruptions (soft X-ray flare size ≥M5.0) on the front side of the Sun during the period from December 1, 2008 to January 31, 2014. There were 59 such eruptions that were associated with CMEs. When a flux rope was fitted to the white-light CMEs observed by SOHO and STEREO it was found that the CME sources were on the disk only for 55 eruptions. There were 16 large SEP events (proton intensity ≥10 pfu in the >10 MeV channel) detected by GOES and 4 by STEREO-B in association with these eruptions. When the CMEs were grouped according to their speeds (<1500 km/s and ≥ 1500 km/s) it was found that only three of the <1500 km/s CMEs (or 11%) were associated with large SEP events compared to 17 or (61%) of the ≥ 1500 km/s CMEs. This result confirms the importance of CME speed for SEP association. In fact there were ten other large SEP events with flare size <M5.0, but associated with fast CMEs, suggesting that the flare size does not determine SEP association. In order to narrow down the properties of CMEs that produce GLE events, we divided the SEP-associated CMEs into a different speed range: ≥2000 km/s and 1500-1999 km/s. We also required that the CMEs originated from the longitudinal range of W20 to W90 (traditional GLE longitudes). There were sixteen such events, 6 with speed in the range 1500-1999 km/s and 10 with ≥2000 km/s. When we further applied the criterion that the latitudinal distance of the CME sources from the ecliptic must be within ±13o (Gopalswamy et al. 2013 ApJL 765, L30), we found that there were only four CMEs that met this criterion. One of the four was the GLE event of 2012 May 17 whose CME speed was only slightly less than 2000 km/s. The 2011 August 9 CME was ejected into a tenuous medium, which means the shock was likely weak due to higher ambient Alfven speed, even though the CME speed was well above 2000 km/s. The speed of the 2011 June 7 CME (1680 km/s) was well below the typical speed of GLE CMEs. The last one, the 2013 May 22 event was an interacting CME event, but the speed of the primary CME was only 1880 km/s. Thus we conclude that the CME speed, the ecliptic distance of the CME source, and the ambient conditions are all important in deciding whether an SEP event would have GLE particles.\nWork supported by NASA’s Living with a Star Program.",

            "abstract": "In the Amu Darya River Basin in Central Asia, the Vakhsh catchment in Tajikistan is a major source of hydropower energy for the country. With a number of large dams already constructed, upstream Tajikistan is interested in the construction of one more large dam and a number of smaller storage facilities with the prospect of supplying its neighboring states with hydropower through a newly planned power grid. The impact of new storage facilities along the river is difficult to estimate and causes considerable concern and consternation among the downstream users. Today, it is one of the vexing poster child studies in international water conflict that awaits resolution.\nWith a lack of meteorological data and a complex topography that makes application of remote sensed data difficult it is a challenge to model runoff correctly. Large parts of the catchment is glacierized and ranges from just 500 m asl to peaks above 7000 m asl. Based on in-situ time series for temperature and precipitation we find local correction factors for remote sensed products. Using this data we employ a model based on the Budyko framework with an extension for snow and ice in the higher altitude bands. The model furthermore accounts for groundwater and soil storage. Runoff data from a number of stations are used for the calibration of the model parameters.\nWith an accurate representation of the existing and planned reservoirs in the Vakhsh cascade we study the potential impacts from the construction of the new large reservoir in the river. Impacts are measured in terms of a) the timing and availability of new hydropower energy, also in light of its potential for export to South Asia, b) shifting challenges with regard to river sediment loads and siltation of reservoirs and c) impacts on downstream runoff and the timely availability of irrigation water there.\nWith our coupled hydro-climatological approach, the challenges of optimal cascade management can be addressed so as to minimize detrimental impacts on all sides if runoff forecast information at seasonal scales is taken into account for optimal operational multi-storage management.",

            "abstract": "Forests are important receptors of Hg deposition, and biological Hg hotspots occur mainly in forested regions, but few efforts have been made to determine the Hg content of trees. Mercury concentrations in stem tissue are lower than the foliage and bark, so low that they have often been below detection limits, especially in hardwood species. However, because wood is the largest component of forest biomass, it can be a larger Hg pool than the foliage, and thus quantifying concentrations in wood is important to Hg budgets in forests.\nThe objective of our study was to determine the methods necessary to detect Hg in bole wood of four tree species, including two hardwoods and two conifers. We also evaluated the effect of air-drying and oven-drying samples on Hg recovery, compared to freeze-drying samples prior to analysis, which is the standard procedure. Many archived wood samples that were air-dried or oven-dried could be appropriate for Hg analysis if these methods could be validated; few are freeze-dried. We analyzed samples for total Hg using thermal decomposition, catalytic conversion, amalgamation, and atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Method 7473, USEPA 1998).\nThe result of the method detection limit study was 1.27 ng g-1, based on apple leaf standards (NIST 1515, 44 ± 4 ng/g). Concentrations in the hardwood species were 1.48 ± 0.23 ng g-1 for sugar maple and 1.75 ± 0.14 ng g-1 for American beech. Concentrations were higher in red spruce and balsam fir. Samples that were analyzed fresh, freeze-dried, or oven-dried at 65 ˚C were in close agreement, after correcting for moisture content. However, Hg concentrations were 34 to 45% too high in the air-dry samples, presumably reflecting absorption from the atmosphere, and they were 44 to 66% too low in the samples oven-dried at 103 ˚C, presumably due to volatilization. We recommend that samples be freeze-dried or oven-dried at 65 ˚C for analysis of Hg in wood; archived samples that have been oven-dried at higher temperatures or stored exposed to the air may not be suitable for Hg analysis.",

A new dataset using 54 National Weather Service (NWS) and 101 military stations that continued to make human-augmented cloud observations after the 1990s has been adjusted using statistical changepoint detection and visual scrutiny. The adjustments substantially reduce the trends in U.S. mean total cloud cover while increasing the agreement between the cloud cover time series and those of physically related climate variables such as diurnal temperature range and number of precipitation days. For 1949-2009, the adjusted time series give a trend in U.S. mean total cloud of 0.11 ± 0.22 %/decade for the military data, 0.55 ± 0.24 %/decade for the NWS data, and 0.31 ± 0.22 %/decade for the combined dataset. These trends are less than half those in the original data. For 1976-2004, the original data give a significant increase but the adjusted data show an insignificant trend of -0.17 (military stations) to 0.66 %/decade (NWS stations). The differences between the two sets of station data illustrate the uncertainties in the U.S. cloud cover record.\nWe compare the adjusted station data to cloud cover time series extracted from several satellite datasets: ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project), PATMOS-x (AVHRR Pathfinder Atmospheres Extended) and CLARA-a1 (CM SAF cLoud Albedo and RAdiation), and the recently developed PATMOS-x diurnally corrected dataset. Like the station data, satellite cloud cover time series may contain inhomogeneities due to changes in the observing systems and problems with retrieval algorithms. Overall we find good agreement between interannual variability in most of the satellite data and that in our station data, with the diurnally corrected PATMOS-x product generally showing the best match. For the satellite period 1984-2007, trends in the U.S. mean cloud cover from satellite data vary widely among the datasets, and all are more negative than those in the station data, with PATMOS-x having the trends closest to those in the station data.",

In turn, these changes can lead to loss and dying of forests, droughts, low river levels and floods. If and when such degradation would occur, an Early Warning System (EWS) that would detect the imminent change would help to minimise its impacts. The EU-FP7 funded AMAZALERT project has investigated the likelihood and pathways of critical transitions in the Amazon and designed a blue-print for an EWS.\nThere is still much uncertainty on how robust the Amazon region is and how likely it is that it may collapse and ‘die-back’ within the foreseeable future. There is also uncertainty whether critical degradation would show any critical ‘tipping point’ behaviour, and whether such change would be associated with detectable early-warning signals, such as enhanced but slowing down variability in variables ahead of thresholds that are associated with the change. In the AMAZALERT project we performed a set of coherent climate, vegetation, hydrological, socio-economic and policy model evaluations to detect the sensitivities and potential critical change behaviour of the Amazon’s ecosystem services to climate and land-use change. We improved their parameterisation through field data analysis as well as through stakeholder interactions.\nA framework was designed to enable early warning and to assess implementation issues. A hierarchy of warning levels can be distinguished ranging from policy failure though fatal regional forcing conditions, to actual impact on ecosystems and ecosystem services. For each level, different sets of indicators can be identified and different observational and analysis tools are required. Model simulations of both low and high complexity show conflicting evidence whether indicators will be able to detect early warning signals in time. Since much of any critical change would occur through changes in the hydrological cycle, river levels, rainfall and soil moisture appear among the most important candidates for monitoring, along with biomass, carbon exchange and energy budgets.",

However, there is still lack of mechanistic understanding of the controls on tropical forest metabolism, particularly at individual tree level. In this study, we are interested in investigating (1) what is the seasonal pattern of woody growth for tropical trees and (2) what is the mechanistic controls onwoody growth at individual level?To explore the above questions,we use two data sources from an evergreen tropical forest KM67 site (near Santarem, Brazil). They are: (1) image time series from a tower mounted RGB imaging system, with images recordedin10 minutes interval since October 2013.Images near local noon homogeneous diffuse lighting were selectedfor leaf phenologymonitoring; (2) ground based bi-weekly biometry survey (via dendrometry band technique) for 25 trees from random sampling since September 2013. 12 among 25 trees are within the tower mounted camera image view. Our preliminary resultsdemonstrate that 20 trees among 25 trees surveyed significantly increase woody growth (or “green up”) in dry season. Our results also find thatamong those 20 trees, 12 trees reaches the maximum woody increment rate in late dry season with a mean DBH (Diameter at Breast Height) around 30 cm,while 8 trees reaching the maximum in the middle of wet season, with a mean DBH around 90 cm. This study,though limited in the sample size, mightprovide another line of evidence that Amazon rainforests “green up” in dry season. As for mechanistic controls on tropical tree woody control, we hypothesize both climate and leaf phenology control individual woody growth. We would like to link both camera based leaf phenology and climate data in the next to explorethe reason as to the pattern found in this study that bigger trees might have different seasonal growth pattern as smaller trees.",

            "abstract": "Natural gas from unconventional fossil energy sources such as shale and tight gas\nformations has a profound impact on US energy independence. The current state of\nproduction of methane and other hydrocarbons from low permeability shale involves\nprocesses such as hydraulic fracturing of rock, multiphase flow, and recovery of the gas\nvia these fractures. Although hydraulic fracturing has been used for the past couple of\ndecades, little is known about the underlying mechanisms behind the production curves\nthat are seen in the field, such as, reasons for 50-60% decline after the first year in typical\nproduction curves.\nNumerical experiments on a realistic fractured shale system are presented to\nidentify the effect of complex flow of gas in fractures and matrix diffusion on the\nproduction curve. For characterizing flow, including the characteristics and geometries\nfor the fracture networks, we use a methodology that incorporates a recently developed\ndiscrete fracture network meshing approach [1], which is combined with the highly\nparallel PFLOTRAN subsurface flow and reactive transport code [2] and a new particle\ntracking capability [3]. The results of this reservoir-scale methodology for analyzing the\ndecline in gas production rates indicate dominant flow in fractures in the initial high\nproduction rate. Increase in matrix diffusivity improves production recovery after the\ninitial production of gas from fractures. Moreover, it is observed that increasing aperture\nvariability within a single fracture has little effect on the production compared to\nvariations of the mean fracture aperture from fracture to fracture in a fracture network.\n[1] Hyman, J.D., Gable C.W., Painter S.L., and Makedonska N., Conforming\nDelaunay Triangulation of Stochastically Generated Three Dimensional Discrete\nFracture Networks: a Feature Rejection Algorithm f or Meshing Strategy, SIAM J.\nSci.

The local environmental authority has implemented several strategies to curb air pollution that have resulted in the decrease of PM10 concentrations since 2010. However, more activities are necessary in order to meet international air quality standards in the city. The University of Florida Air Quality and Climate group is collaborating with the Universidad de La Salle to prioritize regulatory strategies for Bogotá using air pollution simulations. To simulate pollution, we developed a modeling platform that combines the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), local emissions, and the Community Multi-scale Air Quality model (CMAQ). This platform is the first of its kind to be implemented in the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. The presentation will discuss development and evaluation of the air quality modeling system, highlight initial results characterizing photochemical conditions in Bogotá, and characterize air pollution under proposed regulatory strategies.\nThe WRF model has been configured and applied to Bogotá, which resides in a tropical climate with complex mountainous topography. Developing the configuration included incorporation of local topography and land-use data, a physics sensitivity analysis, review, and systematic evaluation. The threshold, however, was set based on synthesis of model performance under less mountainous conditions. We will evaluate the impact that differences in autocorrelation contribute to the non-ideal performance.\nAir pollution predictions are currently under way. CMAQ has been configured with WRF meteorology, global boundary conditions from GEOS-Chem, and a locally produced emission inventory. Preliminary results from simulations show promising performance of CMAQ in Bogota. Anticipated results include a systematic performance evaluation of ozone and PM10, characterization of photochemical sensitivity, and air quality predictions under proposed regulatory scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Global maps of near-surface soil moisture are currently being produced by the European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission at ~40 km. Within the next few months NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission will begin producing observations of near-surface soil moisture at ~10 km. Near-surface soil moisture is the water content of the first 3 to 5 cm of the soil. Observations of near-surface soil moisture are expected to improve weather and climate forecasts.\nThese satellite observations must be validated. We define validation as determining the space/time statistical characteristics of the uncertainty. A standard that has been used for satellite validation is in-situ measurements of near-surface soil moisture made with a network of sensors spanning the extent of a satellite footprint. Such a network of sensors has been established in the South Fork of the Iowa River in Central Iowa by the USDA ARS.\nOur analysis of data in 2013 indicates that SMOS has a dry bias: SMOS near-surface soil moisture is between 0.05 to 0.10 m^3m^{-3} lower than what is observed by the South Fork network. A dry bias in SMOS observations has also been observed in other regions of North America. There are many possible explanations for this difference: underestimation of vegetation, or soil surface roughness; undetected radio frequency interference (RFI); a retrieval model that is not appropriate for agricultural areas; or the use of an incorrect surface temperature in the retrieval process.\nWe will begin our investigation by testing this last possibility: that SMOS is using a surface temperature that is too low which results in a drier soil moisture that compensates for this error. We will present a comparison of surface temperatures from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) used to retrieve near-surface soil moisture from SMOS measurements of brightness temperature, and surface temperatures in the South Fork obtained from both tower and in-situ sensors. We will also use a long-term data set of tower and in-situ sensors collected in agricultural fields to develop a relationship between air temperature and the surface temperature relevant to the terrestrial microwave emission that is detected by SMOS.",

Visible to thermal optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems provided frequent observations of Sinabung. High resolution image data with spatial resolutions from 0.5 to 1.5m offered detailed measurements of early summit deformation and subsequent lava dome and lava flow extrusion. The high resolution data were captured by commercial satellites such as WorldView-1 and -2 visible to near-infrared (VNIR) sensors and by CosmoSkyMed, Radarsat-2, and TerraSar-X SAR systems. Less frequent 90 to 100m spatial resolution night time thermal infrared (TIR) observations were provided by ASTER and Landsat-8.\nThe combination of data from multiple sensors allowed us to construct a more complete timeline of volcanic activity than was available via only ground-based observations. This satellite observation timeline documents estimates of lava volume and effusion rates and major explosive and lava collapse events. Frequent, repeat volume estimates suggest at least three high effusion rate pulses of up to 20 m3/s occurred during the first three months of lava effusion with an average effusion rate of 6m3/s from January 2014 to August 2014. Many of these rates and events show some correlation to variations in the Real-time Seismic-Amplitude Measurement (RSAM) documented by the Indonesian Center for Volcanology and Geologic Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM).",

            "abstract": "We are working towards a forward-model reconstruction of the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) for the last millennium from the Quelccaya Ice Cap (QIC) d18O record. QIC receives precipitation almost exclusively during the SASM season. Initial efforts focus on dynamics that yield precipitation at this receding tropical ice cap, and how they relate to the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes.\nWe present over a decade of daily snow-height change observations from the summit of QIC. Accumulation of snow (~2 m yr-1) at the summit occurs October through April, peaking in December. Net monthly snow-height change is negative May through September, though positive snow height change days do occur throughout the year.\nSnow height change time-series are used to develop d18O age-models for annual snow collected in vertical profiles near the summit of QIC since 2003. Snow d18O decreases during austral summer from about -17 to -24 per mil VSMOW. Post-depositional alteration of late summer snow during austral winter elevates d18O from about -24 to about -15 per mil VSMOW.\nTiming of 90thpercentile positive snow-height change events at QIC corresponds with regional precipitation and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies that are dynamically triggered by cold air incursions propagating from the midlatitudes east of the Andes into the Amazon Basin. Precipitation and OLR anomalies migrate northwest in about 2-3 days from near Rio de la Plata to central Peru. The convective anomalies are the result of southerly horizontal wind anomalies in the lower troposphere that advect cold extratropical air equatorward.\nComposite analysis of satellite measurements shows that cold air incursions are associated with negative water vapor dD (~ -40 per mil) anomalies at QIC. We expect that snow stable isotope values from QIC are thus not only records of the deep overturning component of the monsoon circulation but also of synoptic scale monsoon disturbances. Cold air incursions into the South American subtropics account for positive snow-height change anomalies and negative stable isotope anomalies at QIC.",

            "abstract": "Magmatic systems beneath arc-volcanoes are often poorly resolved by seismic imaging due to the small spatial scale and large magnitude of crustal heterogeneity in combination with field experiments that sparsely sample the wavefield. Here we report on our continued analysis of seismic data from a line of densely-spaced (~300 m), three-component seismometers installed on Newberry Volcano in central Oregon for ~3 weeks; the array recorded an explosive shot, ~20 teleseismic events, and ambient noise. By jointly inverting both active and passive-source travel time data, the resulting tomographic image reveals a more detailed view of the presumed rhyolitic magma chamber at ~3-5 km depth, previously imaged by Achauer et al. (1988) and Beachly et al. (2012). The magma chamber is elongated perpendicular to the trend of extensional faulting and encircled by hypocenters of small (M < 2) earthquakes located by PNSN. We also model teleseismic waveforms using a 2-D synthetic seismogram code to recreate anomalous amplitudes observed in the P-wave coda for sites within the caldera. Autocorrelation of ambient noise data also reveals large amplitude waveforms for a small but spatially grouped set of stations, also located within the caldera. On the basis of these noise observations and 2-D synthetic models, which both require slow seismic speeds at depth, we conclude that our tomographic model underestimates low-velocity anomalies associated with the inferred crustal magma chamber; this is due in large part to wavefront healing, which reduces observed travel time anomalies, and regularization constraints, which minimize model perturbations. Only by using various methods that interrogate different aspects of the seismic data are we able to more realistically constrain the complicated, heterogeneous volcanic system. In particular, modeling of waveform characteristics provides a better measure of the spatial scale and magnitude of crustal velocities near magmatic systems.",

The chemical composition of emitted volcanic gases can be used to distinguish magmatic from hydrothermal degassing, as well as to identify magma recharge from depth. In this project we aim to use complementary geochemical and seismic datasets to identify possible correlations between volcanic gas composition and seismicity, in an effort to constrain seismic signatures of subsurface fluid movement. We present new datasets collected in July and August 2013 from three very seismically active and persistently degassing volcanoes within the Katmai Volcanic Cluster (KVC), Alaska: Mount Martin, Mount Mageik, and Trident Volcanoes. During the field deployment, high temporal resolution (~1 Hz) major-species (e.g. H2O, CO2, SO2, H2S) gas composition measurements were collected over four ~30 minute sample periods each day from the target volcanoes using campaign MultiGas instruments located adjacent to the primary degassing sources. These instruments were complemented with two co-located 6TD broadband seismometers on the crater rims of Mount Martin and Mount Magiek, as well as by the Alaska Volcano Observatory Katmai seismic network, which consists of nine short-period and two broad-band seismometers located within 30 km of the target volcanoes. Here we present a comparison of coincident timeseries gas geochemistry and seismic datasets from the three target volcanoes in an effort to provide insight into the types of fluids that may be triggering volcano-seismicity at these actively degassing volcanoes.",

The CALIPSO lidar (known as CALIOP) is adept at identifying isolated aerosol layers and provides information on their composition that is available for quasi-real time forecasting applications (routine browse images are available at www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov). This information can be used effectively to identify volcanic (and dust) plumes and forecast of aerosol dispersion when coupled with a trajectory model. On several occasions such as during the eruptions of Eyjafjallajokull in 2010 and Kelud in 2014, the CALIPSO data aided forecasters from aviation Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers with information on the location and height of volcanic plumes that helped with their hazard assessments.\nThis paper presents a prototype GUI that aids data users with identifying volcanic layers from CALIPSO browse imagery. A notable aspect of the tool is the ability to select individual features as a collection of individual profile observations and save them into a database or initiate a forward/backward trajectory model using coordinates obtained from the composite object. Examples will be presented that demonstrate the applicability of the GUI using the HySplit and NASA trajectory models. This tool will also be able to support lidar measurements expected from the new Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS) lidar that will be deployed on the International Space Station in the near future.",

            "abstract": "‘Electric cable bacteria’ are organisms of the family Desulfobulbaceaethat exhibit a novel method of electron transport. Cells form conductive filaments that function like electric wires, transferring electrons over distances of more than 1 cm from deep sulfidic sediments to oxygen or other electron acceptors near the soil/water interface. The rate of electron transfer across redox boundaries far exceeds that of diffusion limited processes and generates pH gradients that can significantly influence geochemical reactions, leading to the formation of distinct mineralogical profiles unlikely to be created by abiotic means. Electrically coupled sediments are characterized by carbonate and iron sulfide dissolution reactions occurring at depth and formation of carbonate and metal oxide crusts at the surface, exhibiting a reverse pattern compared to conventional sediment geochemistry. Our research seeks to address the following questions:\nHow prevalent are electric cable bacteria in diverse environments?\nHow do biogeochemical conditions such as ion concentration influence mineral formation?\nDo biogenic minerals participate in charge transfer?\nWhat is the importance of electric charge transfer in the subsurface or other low energy habitats?\nCan mineral banding patterns caused by cable bacteria activity be preserved in the geologic record?\nWith this research we hope to further elucidate the impact of biologically-induced electric fields on the mineralogy of sediments.",

            "abstract": "An integrated modeling methodology is proposed to analyze hydraulic fracturing jobs in the presence of the natural fracture network in the formation. A propagating hydraulic fracture may arrest, cross, or diverts into a preexisting natural crack depending on fracture properties of rock and magnitude and direction of principal rock stresses. Opening of natural fractures during fracturing treatment could define the effectiveness of the stimulation technique. Here, we present an integrated methodology initiated with lab scale fracturing properties using Double Cantilever Beam tests (DCB) to determine cohesive properties of rock and natural fractures. We used cohesive finite element models to reproduce laboratory results to verify the numerical model for the interaction of the hydraulic fracture and individual cemented natural fractures. Based on the initial investigations, we found out that distribution of pre-existing natural fractures could play a significant role in the final geometry of the induced fracture network; however in practice, there is not much information about the distribution of natural fractures in the subsurface due to the limited access. Hence, we propose a special optimization scheme to generate natural fracture geometry from the location of microseismic events. Accordingly, the criteria of evaluating the fitness of natural fracture realizations is defined as the total minimum distance squares of all microseismic events, which is the sum of minimum square distance for all microseismic events. Moreover, an additional constraint in this problem is that we need to set a minimum distance between fracture grids. Using generated natural fracture realizations, forward field-scale simulations are implemented using cohesive finite element analysis to find the best match with the recorded bottomhole pressure. To show the robustness of the proposed workflow for real field problem, we implemented this technique on available data from several well Chicontepec basin to forecast post-treatment production rate. Our results show a constructive approach to integrate microseismic maps with lab mechanical measurements and bottomhole pressure to estimate the geometry of induced fracture network in the subsurface which does not suffer from any limiting assumption about fracture geometries.",

            "abstract": "Subtropical cyclones over the Southwestern South Atlantic Ocean develop in a region where the sea surface temperature is below the required threshold for tropical development. However, there is a large moisture source region situated to the northeast of the most cyclogenetic area near the South American Coast. The South Atlantic Subtropical High flow advects water vapour originated from ocean evaporation in this region directly to the cyclogenetic area, suggesting that this horizontal moisture convergence balances the weaker fluxes below the cyclone (local source) and provide the necessary fuel to the convective activity. In order to investigate this hypothesis, the numerical model WRF version 3 is used to carry out sensitivity experiments where a subtropical cyclone is simulated first without the non-local moisture source (the moisture advected by the Subtropical High) and then without the local moisture source (evaporation from the underlying ocean). The case study is a subtropical cyclone developed in March 1999 near the South American Coast, associated to a mid-tropospheric cut-off low and strong low level moisture convergence. The model correctly simulates the hybrid structure of the cyclone and the synoptic environment where it is inserted. In the absence of non-local moisture source, the cut-off in 500 hPa fails to develop, due to changes in the horizontal temperature advection field. This prevents the strong atmospheric instability caused by the cold low aloft, and then there is no cyclogenesis. Without the local source of moisture, the cyclone is formed, but it is much weaker than in the control simulation, and lacks the low tropospheric warm core (a distinctive feature of the subtropical cyclones). In both cases, the tropospheric warming by cloud formation is strongly reduced, and the surface low does not deepen. The horizontal temperature advection is also decreased, and this impacts the incipient cyclogenesis. These results show that this subtropical cyclone depended on both local and non-local moistures sources acting together to destabilize the environment and provide the atmospheric latent heating. It is likely true for most of the hybrid cyclones in this region.",

            "abstract": "Releases of methane (CH4) from the natural gas supply chain in the United States account for approximately 30% of the total US CH4 emissions. However, there continues to be large questions regarding the accuracy of current emission inventories for methane emissions from natural gas usage. In this paper, we describe results from top-down and bottom-up measurements of methane emissions from the large isolated city of Indianapolis. The top-down results are based on aircraft mass balance and tower based inverse modeling methods, while the bottom-up results are based on direct component sampling at metering and regulating stations, surface enclosure measurements of surveyed pipeline leaks, and tracer/modeling methods for other urban sources. Mobile mapping of methane urban concentrations was also used to identify significant sources and to show an urban-wide low level enhancement of methane levels.  The residual difference between top-down and bottom-up measured emissions is large and cannot be fully explained in terms of the uncertainties in top-down and bottom-up emission measurements and estimates. Thus, the residual appears to be, at least partly, attributed to a significant wide-spread diffusive source. Analyses are included to estimate the size and nature of this diffusive source.\n ",

            "abstract": "Since the last decade, the global demand for biofuel production has been increasing every year due to the growing need for energy supply security and mitigation of greenhouse gases (GHG). Currently, sugarcane ethanol is one of the most widely used biofuels and Brazil is already the world’s largest sugarcane producer, devoting almost 50% of it to ethanol production. The state of São Paulo is the major sugarcane producer in this country, with a cultivated area of about 5.4 Mha in 2011. Approximately 2 million hectares were harvested annually from 2006 to 2011 with the pre-harvest straw burning practice, which emits trace gases and particulate material to the atmosphere. The assessment and monitoring of sugarcane burning impacts are fundamental in order to mitigate the negative impacts of pre-harvest burning and consolidate the environmental benefits of sugarcane ethanol. Although some official inventories created by the Brazilian government have indicated the prevalence of emissions from sugarcane straw burning in total agricultural residue emissions, specific information about emissions of gases and aerosols during pre-harvest burning of sugarcane is still scarce in Brazil. This study aimed to contribute to the improvement of estimates of emissions from sugarcane burning through the use of specific parameters for sugarcane straw burning and a method which has avoided underestimations resulting from the unique characteristics of this type of biomass fire. In this investigation, emissions of several air pollutants released by sugarcane burning during the harvest season were estimated through the integrated use of remote sensing based maps of sugarcane burned area and a numerical tool for the state of São Paulo from 2006 to 2011. Average estimated emissions (Gg/year) were 1,130 ± 152 for CO, 26 ± 4 for NOX, 16 ± 2 for CH4, 45 ± 6 for PM2.5, 120 ± 16 for PM10 and 154 ± 21 for NMHC (non-methane hydrocarbons). An intercomparison among annual emissions from this study and annual emissions from four other different approaches indicated that the estimates obtained by satellite fire detection or low spatial resolution approaches tend to underestimate sugarcane burned area. Overall, our results also indicated that government actions to reduce sugarcane straw burning emissions are becoming effective.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric deposition of trace constituents, both of natural and anthropogenic origin, can act as a nutrient source into the open ocean and affect marine ecosystem functioning and subsequently the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the global ocean. Dust is known as a major source of nutrients (Fe and P) into the atmosphere, but only a fraction of these nutrients is released in soluble form that can be assimilated by the ecosystems. Dust is also known to enhance N deposition by interacting with anthropogenic pollutants and neutralisation of part of the acidity of the atmosphere by crustal alkaline species. The link between the soluble iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) atmospheric deposition and atmospheric acidity, as well as anthropogenic sources, is investigated. The global atmospheric Fe, P and N cycle are parameterized in the global 3-D chemical transport model TM4-ECPL. Both primary emissions of total and soluble Fe and P associated with dust and combustion processes are taken into account, as well as inorganic and organic N emissions. The impact of atmospheric acidity on nutrient solubility is parameterised based on experimental findings. The model results are evaluated by comparison with available observations. The impact of air-quality changes on soluble nutrient deposition is studied by performing sensitivity simulations using preindustrial, present and future emission scenarios. The response of the chemical composition of nutrient-containing aerosols to environmental changes is demonstrated and quantified.

            "abstract": "To model quantitatively the response of Titan’s lakes and seas to Cassini’s RADAR instrument, and thus determine surface reflectivity, attenuation and penetration depth, it is necessary to constrain the dielectric properties of their liquids at ~14 GHz. Pre-Cassini estimates of methane loss tangents ranged from ~1.6 to 1.7 (real component) and ~10-5 to 10-3(imaginary components).\nWe present a new technique for measuring dielectric properties, used to measure the complex dielectric constant of relevant materials. A cylindrical cavity containing a cylindrical quartz tube, filled with pure methane or ethane situated along the cavity axis, was excited in TM0n0 modes, where the n= 2 mode had a resonant frequency of ~14 GHz at 90K. Calibration required measurement of cavity resonant frequency and quality factor for the empty cavity, the inserted empty tube, and the tube filled with a hydrocarbon liquid. These quantities were determined by fitting the measured amplitude versus frequency curve with a Lorentzian line shape.\nSeveral sets of measurements have been performed, giving complex dielectric constants (ε’ + ε” i) of 1.72 + 0.000049i for methane (tan δ = 2.8 x 10-5) and 2.00 + 0.000246i for ethane (tan δ = 1.23 x 10-4). Assuming that the dielectric properties of Ligeia Mare, as calculated by Mastrogiuseppe et al., are dominated by a nitrogen-saturated, binary methane-ethane mixture that obeys simple mixture modeling, our results are most consistent with pure methane-nitrogen. We can accommodate up to 13 vol% ethane, based on statistical uncertainties, or 19 vol% ethane, based on more conservative analytical uncertainties (incorporating uncertainties in measured quality factors, Lorentzian line shape fits, cavity radius, and quartz tube dimensions and calculated dielectric constant). All alternative compositions exhibit greater loss tangents, and so it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that methane is the dominant constituent of Ligeia Mare. We infer that ethane is either lost from or concentrated within Titan’s hydrocarbon cycle.",

In zones subject to tectonic forcing rivers steepen their gradients and in the case of a rapid increase in the rate of rock uplift, rivers form a knickpoint that propagates through the fluvial network conveying information of the new base­­–level. Here we exploited the use of the stream profile analysis to unravel the tectonic evolution of the Amatlán de Cañas half–graben (ACHG), a Pio-Quaternary extensional structure with ~1500 m of relief located in the northern sector of the Jalisco Block. We found that both the normalized channel steepness index (ksn) and relief are particularly high in the central part of the ACHG. We also identified two zones of high ksn values in several rivers where knickpoints are propagating. Our stream profile analysis indicates that the formation of the ACHG resulted from two rock uplift pulses. Projecting the longitudinal profile of reaches located upstream of knickpoints we estimate that the uplift in ACHG exceeded 0.5 km. Although the tectonic pulses built the relief of the ACHG, the incision of the Ameca River, which flows southeasterly, seems to be rejuvenating the relief as both the high ksn values and the distribution of knickpoints along the piedmont suggest.",

            "abstract": "Vast loess deposits in Europe and the US accumulated after the last glacial maxima (<20 kyrs). In Argentina, however, they gradually accumulated from dried riverbeds that carried sediments from the Andes over the last 12 myrs [1]. These 300m-thick loessoid deposits resemble the accumulations of unconformable deposits found on Mars, some exceeding 3km in thickness. While short-lived as surface materials on the Earth (e.g., <12 myrs in Argentina), they remain exposed for billions of years on Mars (since the Late Noachian).\nUnlithified loessoid deposits represent a special target type affecting both crater excavation and melt generation. Craters as large as 20km in diameter may not reach the underlying “basement” (e.g., cratered highlands). Porous targets also result in greater amounts of impact melt derived from different levels [2, 3]. Moreover, melt breccias can be soft captured, buried, and trapped until re-exposed [4]. In Argentina, some folded vesicular glasses as old as 9.3 myrs contain flash-heated yet well-preserved biomatter (down to < 5 microns) including plant materials [5] and even partially vitrified cartilage fragments [6]. The entrained plant materials also contain organic relicts such as derivatives of chlorophyll. This biomatter becomes trapped as the melt is rolled and folded during excavation or emplacement.\nExploratory impact experiments at the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range simulated this process at a much smaller scale (5km/s at 45 deg impact angle). Fragments of wetted Pampas grass and tardigrades buried near the surface were entrained within small, twisted and folded glasses. Grass positioned uprange of the impact, however, survived intact within a projectile radius of the impact point. Consequently, the low impact speeds available in the experiments could be more than offset by an uprange location for a much higher speed impact. While plant material should not be expected, other primitive forms could be mixed within seams and folds within proximal impact melts.\n[1] Zarate, M. A. (2003), Quat. Sci.

            "abstract": "Plant water uptake during summer is characterized by strong diurnal fluctuations. As a result a diurnal sink term is imposed on catchment storage, affecting the unsaturated zone, sometimes the saturated zone and even streamflow. Detecting this signal and understanding its propagation through the hydrological system may help to better quantify eco-hydrological connectivity.\nThe extent and strength of the propagation of this signal from plant to soil to ground- and streamwater was investigated with a unique setup of 46 field sites in Luxemburg and 15 field sites in Germany. These sites cover a range of geologies, soils, topographies and types of vegetation. Vegetation types include grassland, pine forest (young and old) and different deciduous forest stands. Available data at all sites includes information at high temporal resolution from 3-5 soil moisture profiles, matrix potential, piezometers and sapflow sensors (as proxy for plant water uptake) as well as standard climate data. At sites with access to a stream, discharge or water level is also recorded. Signal strength (amplitude of diurnal fluctuations) can thus be traced through the system and gives an indication of the physical sphere of influence of plant water uptake i.e. the “eco-hydro-connectivity”. The analysis of time lags (or phase shifts) between daily fluctuations in temperature, radiation, sapflow, soil water, groundwater and streamflow gives further insights into the processes driving and propagating these signals and inter-site comparison allows for the investigation of local controls.",

Regardless of the exact timing and nature of this new epoch, there is no doubt that human activities -- especially land use from agriculture, the loss of biodiversity from habitat destruction, changes in climate and ocean chemistry from greenhouse gas emissions, and changes to the hydrologic cycle from our water use -- are dominant forces in shaping the ecology of our planet. The question before us now is: How can we transition from an era of dominating the biosphere, as we do today, to learning how to be better stewards of our biosphere, helping to ensure a more sustainable and resilient future?\nIn this overview presentation, I will attempt to describe the many transitions we have seen in the Earth's biosphere during the Anthropocene transition, and discuss potential ways we can learn from natural systems to become better stewards of the biosphere. The lessons from Earth System Science will likely prove instrumental in informing the policies and practices society will ultimately need to build a more sustainable future.",

It has been shown recently that the wind speed and the solar global radiation had intermittent and multiscaling statistics on mesoscales range.\nThe emergence of electricity production units combining renewable wind and solar energy generation, need the understanding of the dependence between these two processes. The interest is to develop strategic tools in order to smooth the aggregate power output of this kind of electricity production unit.\nIn this study, we study their multi-scale dynamics and we investigate possible correlations at different scales using a new methodology called Time Dependent Intrinsic Correlation (TDIC) based on the EMD (Emiprical Mode Decomposition) method. For that, the Time Dependent Intrinsic Correlation method is applied to simultaneous wind and global solar radiation measurements. The two time series are collected with a sampling time t=1h during five years at Guadeloupean Archipelago (French West Indies) located at 16°15'N latitude and 60°30'W longitude. After decomposition of both times series in fast and slow fluctuations with the EMD method, the Hilbert spectra are estimated for the both time series. The time evolution and the scale dependence of their correlation are determined at different time scales and for different intrinsic modes functions.",

            "abstract": "To understand deep soil carbon stabilization and change during reforestation we sampled bulk subsoils and individual redoximorphic features from a network of two meter deep soil pits along a gentle catena (3% slope) in the Southern Piedmont of North Carolina, USA. Until 1910, the catena was under cultivation. Since then, half of the soils we excavated have supported deeply rooted pine forests while the other half have continued to support relatively shallow rooted grasses and forbs. Across the catena, accordant with the divergent rooting regimes, subsoil roots were three times more abundant under forest than grass, and Δ14C in bulk subsoil samples was enriched by an average of 123‰ under forest relative to grass (p=0.0267).\nBulk subsoils, however, were extremely heterogeneous and contained three well-defined redoximorphic feature microsites. Over the lifetime of these upland soils, coupled carbon-iron cycling during transient oxygen limitation created the microsites and thereby imparted subsoils with steep biogeochemical gradients millimeters to centimeters apart. Concentration of operationally defined crystalline iron-oxyhydroxides was on average ten times higher in Fe-enriched microsites (30.1 ± 2.5 mg/g, mean ± 1 SE) than Fe-depleted microsites (2.9 ± 0.3 mg/g) and gley microsites (3.3 ± 0.4 mg/g) across the catena. Under the deeply rooted forest Δ14C in gley microsites and Fe-depleted microsites was enriched by an average of 73‰ (p=0.0194) and 94‰ (p=0.0416), respectively relative to the same microsites under grass. Meanwhile, Δ14C in Fe-enriched microsites was unchanged by the divergent rooting regimes (p=0.1936). These microsite dependent patterns of radiocarbon enrichment indicate that subsoil C stabilization during reforestation of the catena was spatially conditioned by historic coupled carbon-iron cycling. We detail the mechanisms of this conditioning, and argue that similar long-term biogeochemical processes influence contemporary subsoil C stabilization and change more often than is commonly appreciated.",

            "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) play a critical role in the redox cycling of both toxic (e.g., Hg) and nutrient (e.g., Fe) metals. Despite the discovery of extracellular ROS production in various microbial cultures, including fungi, algae and bacteria, photo-dependent processes are generally considered as the predominant source of ROS in natural waters.\nHere we show that biological production of ROS is ubiquitous and occurs at a significant rate in freshwater and brackish water environments. Water samples were collected from three freshwater and one brackish water ponds in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, periodically from 2012 to 2014. Production of O2- and H2O2 were measured in dark incubations of natural water using a chemiluminescent and a colorimetric probe, respectively. Rates of biological ROS production were obtained by comparing unfiltered with 0.2-µm filtered samples. The role of biological activity in ROS production was confirmed by the cessation of ROS production upon addition of formaldehyde. In surface water, production rates of O2- ranged from undetectable to 96.0 ± 30.0 nmol L-1 h-1, and production rates of H2O2 varied between 9.9 ± 1.3 nmol L-1 h-1 and 145.6 ± 11.2 nmol L-1 h-1. The maximum production rates of both ROS were observed in mid-summer 2013, which coincides with peak biological activity. ROS production in the water from aphotic zone was greater than in the water from photic zone. Thus, non-light dependent biological processes are likely the major contributors to ROS production in this system. Moreover, O2- production appeared to be enhanced by NADH and inhibited by proteinase-K, suggesting the possible involvement of NADH oxidoreductases in this process. The potential role of different microbial communities in ROS production, and the implications of biological ROS production for mercury speciation will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Even with recent improvements in general circulation model (GCM) resolution, tropical cyclones (TCs) are typically underresolved, resulting in fewer or weaker storms than observed. In an effort to alleviate these issues, the use of limited area models (LAMs) allowing for higher resolutions has become popular. However, LAMs require lateral boundary conditions and typically lack two-way communication with the exterior domain. Variable-resolution GCMs can serve as the bridge between traditional global models and high-resolution LAMs. These models can reach 10 km or finer resolution in low-latitude ocean basins where TCs are prevalent. They do so while maintaining global continuity, therefore eliminating the need for externally-forced and possibly numerically and physically inconsistent boundary conditions required by LAMs.\nRecent developments allow the Community Atmosphere Model's (CAM) Spectral Element (SE) dynamical core to be run on unstructured, statically-nested, variable-resolution grids. We present deterministic CAM-SE model simulations of TCs during recent summers and compare the model's prediction of storm track and intensity to other global and regional models as well as observations. The simulations are run on a 55 km global cubed-sphere grid with additional refinement to 13 km over the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans. Forecasts are integrated for eight days and the period of analysis spans three months (August, September, and October) during 2012 and 2013. We compare these simulations to identically initialized model runs without mesh refinement to demonstrate the impact of high resolution on TC behavior in CAM. We also investigate cyclone genesis and whether locally high resolution in a global model leads to improved forecast skill at longer lead times. In addition, the impact of the localized refined patch on the remainder of the coarser global solution during the simulation period is discussed.",

NASA's goal in Earth science is to observe, understand, and model the Earth system to discover how it is changing, to better predict change, and to understand the consequences for life on Earth. The ASDC has collaborated with Science Teams to accommodate emerging science users in the climate and modeling communities. The ASDC has expanded its original role to support operational usage by related Earth Science satellites, support land and ocean assimilations, support of field campaigns, outreach programs, and application projects for agriculture and energy industries to bridge the gap between Earth science research results and the adoption of data and prediction capabilities for reliable and sustained use in Decision Support Systems (DSS). For example; these products are being used by the community performing data assimilations to regulate aerosol mass in global transport models to improve model response and forecast accuracy, to assess the performance of components of a global coupled atmospheric-ocean climate model, improve atmospheric motion vector (winds) impact on numerical weather prediction models, and to provide internet-based access to parameters specifically tailored to assist in the design of solar and wind powered renewable energy systems. These more focused applications often require Near Real-Time (NRT) products. Generating NRT products pose their own unique set challenges for the ASDC and the Science Teams. Examples of ASDC NRT products and challenges will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Watershed scale observations of snow water equivalence (SWE) are becoming increasingly important globally as the quantity and timing of snowmelt has become less predictable. In the Colorado River watershed, where dust deposition can hasten snowmelt by several weeks, the need for these observations is critical. While advances in measuring snow depth and albedo from the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory have greatly improved our ability to constrain snow depth and radiative forcing, we have yet to develop a method for remotely observing snow density, which is required for calculating SWE.\nWe evaluate measured and modeled variables of snow- infrared surface temperature, radiative forcing and snow depth as predictors of snow density. We use 10 seasons of in situ measured snow surface temperature, cumulative modeled dust in snow radiative forcing, snow depth and manually measured snow density from locations in the Rocky Mountains of southwestern Colorado. We also use measured snow depth and SWE from the 2013 and 2014 water years, from 23-35 locations stratified by modeled downwelling short wave radiation, and evaluate them as predictors of snow density.\nOur analysis shows that daily mean snow surface temperature (R2 0.61, p = <0.001) and cumulative radiative forcing (R2 0.54, p = <0.001) individually have significant coefficients of determination whereas snow depth alone was not significant. Multiple regression with all three variables (R2 0.84, p = <0.001) was the best predictor of density. Furthermore, when snowpack conditions were isothermal at 0° C, the diurnal coefficient of variation, of measured hourly surface temperature, exhibited consistently high variance. In 2013 we found significant correlations between spatially distributed measurements of snow density (R2 0.33, p = <0.001) and modeled downwelling short wave radiation. However, in 2014 the correlation was very low, supporting our hypothesis that seasonal differences in dust driven radiative forcing are also important for determining the density. These results suggest the properties of snow surface temperature and radiative forcing, when combined with snow depth, are highly predictive of snow density, indicating the potential for inference of SWE from remote sensing measurements of snow depth, snow infrared surface temperature and spectral albedo.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to characterize the geology and groundwater flow of the bog as well as the surrounding area, notably the Cedar Creek Watershed, a HUC (Hydrologic Unit Code) 12 watershed. The watershed is approximately 330 km2, and borders the sub-continental divide separating the Mississippi River Basin from the Great Lakes Basin. The Cedar Creek watershed is composed of mostly agricultural and urban land with a significant stress of groundwater withdrawal for both irrigation and residential use. This watershed has importance due to the contribution to both the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan, and is integral in the study of regional groundwater flow of Southeastern Wisconsin. Furthermore, the Cedarburg Bog, located in the northeast corner of the Cedar Creek Watershed preserves diverse ecology and is recognized by the U.S. Department of Interior as a National Landmark. Groundwater is the primary driver for the diverse and unique ecology that is contained within the bog.\nWithin the Cedar Creek Watershed, well data and glacial geology maps (Mickelson and Syverson, 1997) were integrated to develop a 3-dimensional subsurface map and watershed-scale groundwater flow model using the LAK3 and the SFR2 package to simulate surface water-aquifer interactions. The model includes 10 zones of the glacial sediments and the weathered and consolidated Silurian Dolomite bedrock. The hydraulic conductivity and storage parameters were calibrated with 203 head targets using universal parameter estimation code (PEST). Then, a series of future climate scenarios, developed by the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impact, were implemented to the USGS Soil-Water-Balance Code (SWB) to identify variations in recharge. The simulated recharge scenarios were adopted to predict the response of groundwater resources in the watershed and the Cedarburg Bog. Preliminary results produced from the MODFLOW model indicate the bog is acting as a recharge zone under current recharge conditions, approximately 12.7cm/year, with regional groundwater flow from the groundwater divide to Lake Michigan and a mean residual on calibration targets of 4.32m\nKnowledge acquired from this investigation can be used to better inform local agencies of potential threats, as well as predict future changes within this groundwater system.",

            "abstract": "Stable isotopes of water (δ18O and δD) are unique tracers for studying hydrological and associated processes. High spatial and temporal resolution measurements of water isotopes are necessary to follow the dynamics in rapidly changing systems and to map out the spatial heterogeneity of water circulation and mixing. Here we present results of the first commercially available Continuous Water Sampler Module (CoWS) that can be coupled to a Picarro L2130-i Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer (CRDS) for real-time measurements of water isotopes. The CoWS is a compact and fully automated system with its core method modified from that of Munksgaard et al. (2011). Liquid water is continuously pumped into an extraction chamber, where water vapor diffuses through a micro-poruous polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane. The vapor is then carried by a dry carrier gas to the L2130-i for high precision measurements of δ18O and δD. The inlet water, carrier gas, and surface of the ePTFE membrane are actively temperature controlled to maintain a stable amount of fractionation of water isotopes across the membrane, which minimizes measurement drift\u0007\b. We have tested the CoWS-CRDS system with various inlet water types (tap water, deionized water, and seawater), and under operational conditions with variable ambient water and air temperatures. CoWS-CRDS has high precision \u0007(< 0.05 and < 0.15 ‰ 1σ, 5 minute average for δ18O and δD, respectively)\b and low drift water isotope measurements, with short response time (<5 minutes to eliminate 98% of the memory). The CoWS software is user configurable; allowing automated sampling among up to four water sources with user defined sampling durations. Additionally, we will present isotopic measurements with high-temporal resolution of an \u0007\bestuarine system where tidal changes affected the isotopic composition of the estuary.",

            "abstract": "Due to it’s important role in the global water cycle, soil moisture is of great interest for the scientific community, policy makers, and the general public. Today, state-of-the-art satellite missions like SMOS or SMAP are able to provide global high-resolution (in both time and space) maps of top-layer soil moisture while air-bourne sensors can be applied for small-scale regional studies. However, in order to fully understand how soil moisture contributes to the water cycle, we also need to know about the deeper soils and highly vegetated areas. As remote sensing approaches are able to penetrate the first few centimeters only, we still need in-situ observations and modeling approaches in order to analyze e.g. root-zone or deeper soil moisture. When comparing the different data sources, we still detect large discrepancies between the remotely sensed products, in-situ measurements, and hydrological (or land surface) models in the spatial patterns, dynamics, and magnitude of soil moisture. In this study, we thus aim at a statistical data combination of all these data sources in order to provide a consistent, high-resolution estimate of soil moisture. This is achieved by applying a Copula-based assimilation technique, which makes use of the spatial and/or temporal dependency structure (i.e. the correlation) between different data sources. Due to the heterogeneity of soil moisture, we have to take other climate variables into account, if we want to conclude from single station observations to other locations. This can achieved by using tri (or higher) variate dependency structures, which is a logical and straightforward extension of the widely used bi-variate Copula approaches. In this study, we derive the dependence structure between observed soil moisture and other climatic variables like, e.g., precipitation or incoming radiation, which can then be used for correcting model estimates based on local climatic conditions. It is assumed that such an assimilation approach provides more realistic values compared to classical bias-correction methods, where only the dependency structure between modeled and in-situ observations is considered. We therefore present the methods and preliminary results and show comparisons to classic bias correction methods.",

Recent reports have stated (e.g., the National Climate Assessment) that climate change can impact and exacerbate a range of risks to the Great Lakes, including changes in the range and distribution of certain fish species, increased invasive species and harmful algal blooms, declining beach health, and lengthened commercial navigation season. In this study, we will examine the impact of climate change on the Laurentian Great Lakes through investigation of long-term lake surface water temperatures (LSWT). We will use the ATSR Reprocessing for Climate: Lake Surface Water Temperature & Ice Cover (ARC-Lake) product over the period 1995-2012 to investigate individual and interlake variability. Specifically, we will quantify the seasonal amplitude of LSWTs, the first and last appearances of the 4°C isotherm (i.e., an important identifier of the seasonal evolution of the lakes denoting winter and summer stratification), and interpret these quantities in the context of global interannual climate variability such as ENSO.",

            "abstract": "Transitioning to a new discipline can be challenging because of the need to quickly assimilate new skills and knowledge that others brought up in the field took years to develop. While reading and taking classes help to add knowledge, hands-on experience is key to developing your new skill set. Fieldwork is one obvious way to gain experience. Fieldwork provides intimate knowledge of your new found discipline, which is one component of your skill set. However, fieldwork is normally for a short period of time and very focused, which does not quickly provide the second component of your skill set, that is, insight into how your discipline fits in the big picture of solving problems. Academic workshops and internships can help provide the additional experience to bring any young researcher into this higher level of understanding. As a specific example, I'll talk about a summer workshop I recently attended called CIDER (Cooperative Institute for Dynamic Earth Research), which is open for students to apply for every year. This workshop provided the opportunity to learn a working knowledge of other disciplines in geology, and helped to expand my view of geophysics' place in solving real problems. The workshop is a month long, the first two weeks of which were lectures and tutorials of every discipline represented. The second two weeks consisted of new research on projects that were proposed by the attendees. The attendees select which of those projects to participate in, and join a team to work vigorously for two weeks. Teams may continue work after the CIDER workshop for presentations at AGU (as in my case) and has potential for publication later. Why this workshop succeeds in advancing young researchers' understanding is that different disciplines work side by side on their research project. Students need to be made aware of this workshop, and other workshops and internships like it, to provide this added hands-on experience.",

            "abstract": "The southeastern China in the mainland is characterized by moderate seismicity, which belongs to the southern China block. Few studies have been carried on to the seismotectonics for this region since most active faults are buried under the thick Quaternary sediments with low to moderately historical earthquake activity. However,many large earthquakes in the world that occurred at the unexpected tectonic regime without surface or known active faulting and large historic earthquake documentation alarm us that it should pay more attention to this region. In this paper, we investigate the buried active faults and the potential seismic hazard using the relocated background seismicity. The earthquakes occurred in the region from 106°E to 122°E and from 22°N to 35°N between 1990 and 2014 are relocated by using the doubble difference algorithm. In general, most earthqukes concentrate to the boundary regions of the southern China block, while distribute very scarcely in the central area. The relocated earthquakes mainly distribute to the depth between 0 and 15km in the west from 106°to 115°, while to 0-25km in the east from 115°to 122°,which indicates that the seismogenic zone may become deeper from west to the southeastern coast region. It is observed that many relocated clusters organized obviously to linear patterns, which may imply to the existence of the buried active faults that were not found ever before. The inferred buried faults mainly strike to northwest or northeast. The geometry parameters of the faults are obtained from the cross sectional profiles.In some regions, several seimic clusters align to a belt that may infer the existence of a large seismic zone, even stretching to more than 300km long, which may possess great potential seismic hazard we might not realize.",

The framework utilizes various multi-criteria decision making techniques, including the VIKOR method and the Shannon entropy-based weights. In this case study, the sustainability of TWW use is quantified with indicator-based approaches with the DPSIR framework, which considers both hydro-environmental and socio-economic aspects of the watershed management. Under the various climate change scenarios, the hydro-environmental responses to reusing TWW in potential alternative sub-watersheds are determined using the Hydrologic Simulation Program in Fortran (HSPF). The socio-economic indicators are obtained from the statistical databases. Sustainability scores for multiple scenarios are estimated individually and then integrated with the proposed approach. At last, the suggested framework allows us to prioritize adaptation strategies in a robust manner with varying levels of compromise between utility-based and regret-based strategies.",

            "abstract": "Prolonged droughts lasting decades – megadroughts – have occurred in the past throughout western North America as well as other parts of the world. In the US southwest, recent work suggests the risk of these events during climate change may be as high as 30% to 50% this century due to decreasing precipitation alone. However, this view is incomplete because it does not factor in changes in water availability from higher temperatures, nor does it address the risk of continent-wide megadrought. Here the current risk estimates for megadrought in the Western US, Australia, Southeast Asia, Sahel region of Africa, and the Amazon region of South America are revised by factoring in temperature demands as well as spatial covariance structures. It is found that previous estimates of 30-50% for most arid regions may be quite low, especially by the end of the 21st century. Further, there is a moderate risk of widespread megadrought encompassing most of western North America. Such an event would be similar in its spatial structure to the drought currently underway, but could last for decades. Finally, using the probabilistic methods employed here to estimate future megadrought risks from CMIP5 models, the statistics of past megadroughts are reassessed; it is found that the prolonged epochs of aridity that occurred during medieval climate anomaly (850-1300 CE) are extremely unlikely to have occurred simply by chance, supporting the claim that external or internal forcing mechanisms are needed to explain large scale hydrologic fluctuations of that period. Taken together, these findings argue that megadrought, like other kinds of emergent climate risks, need to be factored into regional adaptation strategies.",

We then reversed the search direction, starting with ground-based magnetometer records, for all THEMIS dayside passes. Initial results indicate that many large, “geoeffective,” events are in fact related to foreshock transients, but these events are not always captured in typical identification schemes applied to spacecraft data.",

            "abstract": "Following a decade with little growth, methane concentrations began to increase across the globe in 2007, and have continued to rise ever since. The reasons for this renewed growth are currently the subject of much debate. Here, we discuss the recent observed trends, and highlight some of the strengths and weaknesses in current “inverse” methods for quantifying fluxes using observations. In particular, we focus on the outstanding problems of accurately quantifying uncertainties in inverse frameworks. We examine to what extent the recent methane changes can be explained by the current generation of flux models and inventories. We examine the major modes of variability in wetland models along with the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR). Using the Model for Ozone and Related Tracers (MOZART), we determine whether the spatial and temporal atmospheric trends predicted using these emissions can be brought into consistency with in situ atmospheric observations. We use a novel hierarchical Bayesian methodology in which scaling factors applied to the principal components of the flux fields are estimated simultaneously with the uncertainties associated with the a priori fluxes and with model representations of the observations. Using this method, we examine the predictive power of methane flux models for explaining recent fluctuations.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric processing of fresh soot particles emitted by anthropogenic as well as natural sources alters their physical and chemical properties. For example, fresh and aged soot particles interact differently with incident solar radiation, resulting in different overall radiation budgets. Varying atmospheric chemical and meteorological conditions can result in complex soot mixing states. The Soot Aerosol Aging Study (SAAS) was conducted at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in November 2013 and January 2014 as a step towards understanding the evolution of mixing state of soot and its impact on climate-relevant properties. Aging experiments on diesel soot were carried out in a controlled laboratory chamber, and the effects of condensation and coagulation processes were systematically explored in separate sets of experiments. In addition to online measurement of aerosol properties, aerosol samples were collected for offline single particle analysis to investigate the evolution of the morphology, elemental composition and fine structure of sample particles from different experiments.\nCondensation experiments focused on the formation of α-pinene secondary organic aerosol on diesel soot aerosol seeds. Experiments were conducted to study the aging of soot under dry (RH < 2%) and humid conditions (RH ~ 80%). We present an analysis of the morphology of soot, its evolution, and its correlation with optical properties, as the condensation of α-pinene SOA is carried out for the two different RH conditions. The analysis was performed by using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission x-ray microscopy and atomic force microscopy for single particle characterization. In addition, particle size, mass, composition, shape, and density were characterized in-situ, as a function of organics condensed on soot seeds, using single particle mass spectrometer.",

            "abstract": "The carbon budget over water surfaces in the Amazon has an important role in the total budget of this greenhouse gas a regional and global scale. However, more accurate estimates of the spatial and temporal distribution of the CO2 flux over those water surfaces are still required. In this context, this study aims to understand the spatial distribution of CO2 flux in the Balbina hydroelectric reservoir, located at Presidente Figueiredo city, Amazonas, Brazil. The floating chamber method was used to measure and calculate the CO2 flux. This method coup a chamber of known volume with an infrared gas analyzer (LiCor, LI-840A). Measurements were performed at 1 Hz during 20-30 minutes at 5 different points of the reservoir, four upstream (two near the edge and two in the middle) and one downstream of the dam. At all locations the surface water was supersaturated in pCO2 and fluxes were from the water to the atmosphere. The maximum CO2 flux observed was 1.2 μmol m-2 s-1 at the center point of the reservoir upstream the dam. The minimum CO2 flux was 0.05 μmol m-2 s-1, observed near the edge on the upstream side of the dam. On average, CO2 fluxes were larger downstream of the dam, 0.7 μmol m-2 s-1, compared to upstream, 0.45 μmol m-2 s-1. This pattern is consistent with that found in previous studies at this site using other flux estimation methods, and is consistent with turbulent mixing promoted by the water turbine. However, the mean CO2 flux for all measured points using the chambers, 0.47 μmol m-2 s-1, was much lower than those previously found using other methods. The reason for the difference between methods is unclear. In situ deployment of multiple flux estimation methods would be valuable, as would longer periods of measurements.",

            "abstract": "Supra-arcade downflows (hereafter referred to as SADs) are low-emission, elongated, finger-like features usually observed in active-region coronae above post-eruption flare arcades. Observations exhibit downward moving SADs intertwined with bright, upward moving spikes. Whereas SADs are dark voids, spikes are brighter, denser structures. Although SADs have been observed for decades, the mechanism for formation of SADs remains an open issue. Using high-Lundquist-number three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations, we demonstrate that secondary Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities develop in the downstream region of a reconnecting current sheet. The instability results in the formation of low-density coherent structures that resemble SADs, intertwined with high-density structures that appear to be spike-like. Using SDO/AIA images, we highlight features that have been previously unexplained, such as the splitting of SADs at their heads, but are a natural consequence of instabilities above the arcade. Comparison with siumlations suggest that secondary Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities in the exhaust of reconnecting current sheets provide a plausible mechanism for observed SADs and spikes. Although the plasma conditions are vastly different, analogous phenomena also occur in the Earth's magnetotail during reconnection.",

One of the most challenging open problems in geodesy is to identify and distinguish different patterns of deformation and to define the interactions between contiguous areas and the known main fault systems. In this work we use the ALOS PALSAR images in the period 2007 – 2010 to analyze the time-space propagation of the ground deformation at the Eastern Flank of Mt. Etna. In particular we adopt techniques of image processing, based on neighborhood distances, to trace the movement of the displacements on the sequence of the InSAR images. We tested the robustness of the adopted techniques to evaluate the reliability of the results. Results suggest that the ground deformation propagation on Mt.

            "abstract": "The oceanic crust constitutes, possibly, the largest but most inaccessible habitat on Earth. Exchange of fluid between the permeable crustal environment and overlying sediments and bottom seawater transports electron donors and acceptors, which create redox gradients exploitable by microbial life. While the presence of microbial communities within the oceanic crust is strongly suggested, the structure of these communities, and survival mechanisms used within the hydrothermally-active basement aquifer remain unclear. Recently, crustal fluids from two subsurface borehole observatories (IODP CORKs U1362A and U1362B), located on the eastern flank of Juan de Fuca Ridge, were collected for both single cell genomic and metagenomic analyses. Both techniques revealed an abundance of motility and chemotactic genes. Single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) classified as Marine Benthic Group E had relatively more motility and taxis genes than any other publically available archaeal SAG. Furthermore, metagenomes from these sites had 3.5 times as many motility and taxis genes than those from sedimentary environments. Many of the detected chemotactic genes (such as tsr and aer) are known to monitor electron flow through the electron transport system, thereby serving as “energy receptors,” which direct organisms to the most fitting redox zone. Considering fluid advection occurring within the oceanic crust, the observation of chemotaxis suggests an adaptive lifestyle for crustal microbes.",

            "abstract": "Large volume pyroclastic silicic eruptions emit hundreds of megatons of SO2 into the troposphere and stratosphere that is oxidized into sulfuric acid (H2SO4) by a variety of reactions with mass independent oxygen signatures (MIF), Δ17O>0. Sulfuric acid is then preserved as gypsum in parental volcanic deposits. Diagenic effects are mass dependent and can dilute, but otherwise do not affect MIF ratios. Pleistocene Yellowstone and Bishop tuffs and modern volcanic eruptions preserved under arid climate conditions in North American playa lakes, preserve small amounts of volcanic sulfate as gypsum. This gypsum’s Δ17O>0, in combination with isotopic variations of δ18O, δ33S and δ34S is distinct from sedimentary sulfate and reveals its original MIF sulfate isotopic signal and the effect of super eruptions on the atmosphere, and ozone consumption in particular. We use linear algebraic equations to resolve volcanic versus sedimentary (MIF=0) sources. We have found that many large volume ignimbrites have very high initial Δ17O in volcanic sulfate that can only be acquired from reaction with stratospheric ozone.\nWe here investigate nine thick (>2 m) ash beds ranging in age from ~33-23 Ma in the John Day Formation of central Oregon, including massive 28.6 Ma Picture Gorge tuff of newly identified Crooked River supercaldera. The 28.6 Ma Picture Gorge tuff (PGT) has the highest measured Δ17O of 3.5‰, and other tuffs (Tin Roof, Biotite, Deep Creek) have +1.3 to 3.4‰ Δ17O excesses. Sulfate from modern smaller tropospheric eruptions studied for comparison have a resolvable 0.4‰ range consistent with liquid-phase based H2O2 oxidation. The PGT is coeval with the ignimbrite flare-up in western N. America, the 28-29 Ma eruption of the 5000 km3 Fish Canyon tuff and the 28 Ma Never Summer Field eruption in Nebraska-Colorado that have the highest measured Δ17O of 6‰ (Bao et al. 2003). We speculate on the climatic/atmospheric effects of these multiple ~28 Ma supereruptions in the N America semiarid paleoclimate. The strong mass independent signal of the 28-29 Ma ignimbrite flare-up suggests these super eruptions must have reached well into the stratosphere to record interactions with ozone and peroxide or created dry fog tropospheric conditions.",

The circular lake is a closed basin lake with a gradually sloping shoreline located within a caldera. The 300 cm core was taken in 2 m of water during March 2010. The core bottom was resting upon basement granitic rock with feldspar phenocrystals. The chronology is based upon five radiocarbon dates from terrestrial plant and wood remains. Pollen and charcoal were sampled at 10 cm resolution, diatoms at 5 cm and stable isotopes at 1 cm. The pollen profile shows four distinct terrestrial vegetation units. During the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), from AD 880-1485, the vegetation was sparse with high amounts of grass, Asteraceae and charcoal suggestive of grasslands with high rates of natural disturbance, including fire. With the onset of the Little Ice Age (LIA), during AD 1485-1570, the vegetation transitioned into an open dry forest characterized by Myrica and Anacardium with high seasonality in precipitation. At AD 1570, the climate became wetter as shown by the pollen typical of a moist tropical forest. This lasted until AD 1720 when a period of greater human disturbance began (as shown by increased sedimentation rates), with primary forest taxa cohabiting with grasses and secondary taxa. The first maize pollen appeared at ~AD 1700. The diatom record is dominated by a single eutrophic species, Fragilaria crotonensis; however from AD 880-1150 minor taxa such as Aulacoseira spp., indicative of increased turbulence appeared, supporting the pollen record of open canopy vegetation at this time. The sedimentary carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N) shows that the majority of the organic remains in the lake have always come from the surrounding basin. MTM spectral analysis of percent Fragilaria crotonensis, percent carbon, percent nitrogen, C/N, 13C and 15N shows common re-occurring peaks at 85 years, 50 years, 37 years and 30 years.",

            "abstract": "Circulation in subduction zones involves large-scale, forced-convection by the motion of the down-going slab and small scale, buoyant diapirs of hydrated mantle or subducted sediments. Models of subduction-diapir interaction often neglect large-scale flow patterns induced by rollback, back-arc extension and slab morphology. We present results from laboratory experiments relating these parameters to styles of 4-D wedge circulation and diapir ascent. A glucose fluid is used to represent the mantle. Subducting lithosphere is modeled with continuous rubber belts moving with prescribed velocities, capable of reproducing a large range in downdip relative rollback plate rates. Differential steepening of distinct plate segments simulates the evolution of slab gaps. Back-arc extension is produced using Mylar sheeting in contact with fluid beneath the overriding plate that moves relative to the slab rollback rate. Diapirs are introduced at the slab-wedge interface in two modes: 1) distributions of low density rigid spheres and 2) injection of low viscosity, low density fluid to the base of the wedge. Results from 30 experiments with imposed along-trench (y) distributions of buoyancy, show near-vertical ascent paths only in cases with simple downdip subduction and ratios (W*) of diapir rise velocity to downdip plate rate of W*>1. For W* = 0.2-1, diapir ascent paths are complex, with large (400 km) lateral offsets between source and surfacing locations. Rollback and back-arc extension enhance these offsets, occasionally aligning diapirs from different along-trench locations into trench-normal, age-progressive linear chains beneath the overriding plate. Diapirs from different y-locations may surface beneath the same volcanic center, despite following ascent paths of very different lengths and transit times. In cases with slab gaps, diapirs from the outside edge of the steep plate move 1000 km parallel to the trench before surfacing above the shallow dipping plate. “Dead zones” resulting from lateral and vertical shear in the wedge above the slab gap, produce slow transit times. These 4-D ascent pathways are being incorporated into numerical models on the thermal and melting evolution of diapirs. Models show subduction-induced circulation significantly alters diapir ascent beneath arcs.",

            "abstract": "An increase of volcanic activity over the past decade is thought to have contributed significantly to the global warming “hiatus”. Thus, it is important to improve our understanding of the microphysical and optical properties of even small volcanic plumes as well as their associated climate impacts. On February 13th, 2014, the Mt Kelud volcano, located near 4°S on the island of Java (Indonesia), injected volcanic gases and ash into the tropical stratosphere. An overpass of the CALIPSO lidar during the active phase of the eruption showed volcanic materials reaching 26 km with the main volcanic cloud near 18-19 km. This is the highest altitude volcanic injection since Mt Pinatubo in 1991. CALIPSO has tracked the dispersion of the Kelud plume throughout the tropical lower stratosphere (~20N-20S) since then. Depolarization lidar measurements (0.3-0.4) indicate that the plume was likely composed of irregularly shaped ash particles during the first few days after the eruption, and that sulfate aerosol (spherical droplets) formed thereafter, gradually lowering the mean depolarization to 0.1-0.2. In May, 2014, we mounted a 2-week campaign to Darwin (Australia) to measure several profiles of backscatter in red and blue channels, and one profile of aerosol size distribution using two optical particle counters, one with an inlet heated to 200°C. The purpose was to characterize particle sizes, optical properties, and sulfate fraction from a relatively fresh volcanic plume in the low stratosphere. Preliminary results from the campaign suggest the persistence of ash particles at the bottom of the Kelud plume 3 months after the eruption. This is significant because the climate impact of ash is neglected in most climate models.",

            "abstract": "Deciphering the timing and the inter-hemispheric phasing of former glacial fluctuations is critical for understanding the mechanisms and climate signals underlying these glacial events. Here, we present a detailed chronology of glacial fluctuations for Río Tranquilo glacier (47°S), since the LGM, including up to the present. Río Tranquilo is a small glacial valley located on the northern flank of Monte San Lorenzo, an isolated granitic massif, ~70 km to the east of the southern limit of the Northern Patagonian Icefield. Although Mt. San Lorenzo is located on the leeward side of the Andes, it is one of the most glacierized mountains in the region, with an ice surface area of ~140 km2. Geomorphic evidence suggests that during past episodes of climate change several small glaciers that today occupy the headwalls of Río Tranquilo valley expanded and coalesced, depositing a series of moraines complexes along the flanks and bottom of the valley. We used two independent dating techniques to constrain the age of the glacial history of the area. 10Be surface exposure ages from boulders located atop moraine ridges reveal that Río Tranquilo valley underwent glacial expansion/stabilization during at least the LGM (late LGM?), Late glacial (ACR and Younger Dryas) and Mid-Holocene. Within the Mid-Holocene limits, tree-ring based chronology indicates that Río Tranquilo glacier expanded during the Late Holocene as well. Our results are the first detailed chronology of glacial fluctuations from a single valley glacier, spanning the entire period from the (end of the) LGM up to the present, in southern South America. By identifying different glacial episodes within a single alpine valley, this study provides baseline data for studying the relative magnitude of the climate events responsible for these glacial events.",

            "abstract": "River morphology, surface slope and flow are some of the fundamental measurements required for surface water monitoring and hydrodynamic research. This paper describes a method of combining bathymetric lidar with space-time processing of mid-wave infrared (MWIR) imagery to simultaneously measure bathymetry, currents and surface slope from an airborne platform. In May 2014, Areté installed a Pushbroom Imaging Lidar for Littoral Surveillance (PILLS) and a FLIR SC8000 MWIR imaging system sampling at 2 Hz in a small twin-engine aircraft. Data was collected over the lower Colorado River between Picacho Park and Parker. PILLS is a compact bathymetric lidar based on streak-tube sensor technology. It provides channel and bank topography and water surface elevation at 1 meter horizontal scales and 25 cm vertical accuracy. Surface currents are derived from the MWIR imagery by tracking surface features using a cross correlation algorithm. This approach enables the retrieval of currents along extended reaches at the forward speed of the aircraft with spatial resolutions down to 5 m with accuracy better than 10 cm/s. The fused airborne data captures current and depth variability on scales of meters over 10’s of kilometers collected in just a few minutes. The airborne MWIR current retrievals are combined with the bathymetric lidar data to calculate river discharge which is then compared with real-time streamflow stations. The results highlight the potential for improving our understanding of complex river environments with simultaneous collections from multiple airborne sensors.",

            "abstract": "Fluid expulsion from accretionary convergent margins may be an important factor in global geochemical cycling and biogeochemical processes. However, the rates and distribution of fluid flow at these margins are not well known. To better understand these processes at the Cascadia margin, we collected 35 short (<1m) sediment cores and 23 Mosquito fluid flow meter measurements along a transect from the deformation front to the upper slope offshore of the Washington coast as part of a coupled heat and fluid flow survey. We identified two active seep areas, one emergent at 1990 mbsl, and one long-lived at 1050 mbsl. At both sites we observed carbonate deposits several meters thick and hundreds of meters in horizontal dimension. Thermogenic hydrocarbons measured in pore waters at the long-lived seep site indicate deeply-sourced fluids originating at >80oC, likely migrating along faults. In addition, pore water solute profiles from the emergent seep site suggest active shallow circulation in the upper sediment column, with implications for the seep biological community and fluid budget of the margin. Pore fluid advection rates along the transect are used to characterize the geographic distribution and geologic controls on active fluid pathways. Pore water solute profiles from the sediment cores are integrated with the measured fluid advection rates to calculate solute fluxes out of the margin. Our transect of fluid flow and pore water chemistry measurements from the Cascadia margin will help to better understand fluid and geochemical cycling at accretionary convergent margins.",

            "abstract": "Aqueous fluids released from the down-going slab in subduction zones are generally thought to be the cause of arc volcanism. However there is a significant discrepancy between the consistent location of the volcanic front with respect to intermediate depth earthquakes (e.g. 100+/-40 km; England et al., GJI, 2004, Syracuse & Abers, G-cubed, 2006) and the large depth range over which dehydration reactions are predicted to occur in the slab (e.g. 80-250 km; van Keken et al., JGR, 2011).\nBy coupling the fluid flow to the solid rheology through compaction pressure, recent numerical models (Wilson et al., EPSL, 2014) demonstrated a number of focusing mechanisms that can be invoked to explain this apparent discrepancy. Most notable among these were permeability channels within the slab. These were shown to be highly effective in transporting fluid from deeper fluid sources along the slab towards the shallowest source. In the presence of these channels the majority of the fluid is released into the mantle wedge far shallower and closer to the arc than it was originally generated.\nWhile observations consistent with free fluids in the slab have been reported (e.g. Shiina et al., GRL, 2013), it is possible that changing the rheology and reactivity of the slab can change the efficiency of in-slab transport. We present a series of simplified model problems of fluid flow within the slab and mantle wedge demonstrating the potential effect of these processes on fluid flux. In particular, pseudo-1D models show that if fluids can efficiently rehydrate slab minerals, then these reactions can shut down fluid pathways within the slab, resulting in deeper release of fluid into the mantle wedge. However, the behavior in full subduction zone models remains to be determined.",

            "abstract": "This multi-analytical study on a guano/clay sequence in Gaura cu Muscă Cave (GMC), supported by five 14C AMS dates, brings new insights to both vegetation dynamics and paleo-hydroclimate in a region of archeological and anthropological significance. GMC is located at the entrance to the Danube Gorge in SW Romania. The cave is short (254 m), consisting of a main gallery (along which an underground stream flows) that is bypassed by the Bat’s Gallery. GMC is a shelter for bats throughout the year and a hibernaculum for five species. Nowadays, the two major guano deposits belong to Myotis capaccinii; one is located underneath the largest colony in the Bat’s Chamber, whilst the other one is much smaller and is found in the Bat’s Gallery. From this latter location the investigated clay/guano profile was recovered from underneath a blanket of 2 to 3mm thick fresh guano. We provide sedimentological, geochemical, mineral magnetic, guano and charcoal δ13C data, and pollen-based evidence of fluctuating hydro-climate conditions from ~1230 BC to ~AD 1240. Between 1230 BC and AD 1000 the climate was wetter than present prompting the flooding of the cave, preventing bats from roosting and leading to slow-rate clay accumulation. The pollen diagram for this interval confirms a human presence and agriculture activities in the region. The second half of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP; after AD 1000) the climate became drier, which hydrologically translates in the cave being air-filled. At this time a maternity colony existed in the Bat’s Gallery, under which guano accumulated. One extremely wet event occurred ~AD 1170, when Fe/Mn and Ti/Zr ratios show the highest values and coincident with a substantial increase of sediment load in the underground stream. The mineral magnetic characteristics for the second part of the MWP indicate partial input of surface-sourced sediments reflecting the agricultural development and forest clearance in the area. Pollen and microcharcoal studies confirm that the overall vegetation cover and human land use have changed little in this region since medieval times. The recession in overall herbaceous pollen and increase in Artemisia and Tilia pollen at the top of the profile (after AD 1200) could be attributed to the demise of the MWP and the transition to Little Ice Age.",

The late Mesozoic-Cenozoic evolution of the Albanides has been strongly controlled by the relative movements of Adria or Apulia, a microcontinent with a West Gondwana affinity with respect to Eurasia. In northeastern Albania, the Internal Albanides consist of Paleozoic – Jurassic basement rocks, which involved subduction zone tectonics of the Pindos-Mirdita ocean basin. The External Albanides, on the other hand, represent a fold-and-thrust belt with deformation in a broad zone of oblique convergence. This tectonic domain is divided, from east to west, into five major structural zones: the Krasta-Cukali Zone, the Kruja Zone, the Peri-Adriatic Depression, the Ionian Zone, and the Sazani Zone, which is represented by the Apulian platform carbonates. The zone is characterized by NW-SE-running and SW-verging thrust fault systems that involve a thick series of Mesozoic – Tertiary passive margin carbonates, unconformably overlain by Oligocene clastic units. These two tectonic zones are dissected by the NE-SW-striking Vlora-Elbasan Transfer Zone, which extends eastwards into the Internal Albanides, affecting the structural architecture and the tectonic evolution of the entire mountain belt.

            "abstract": "For the past several years, I have been exhibiting images and videos of natural and laboratory geopatterns in art galleries and outdoor shows. I have also brought artists into my research lab for hands-on workshops. My experience shows that scientific images can be well received as art and generate wide-ranging discussions across traditionally separate disciplines. The art world offers an interesting new venue for outreach activities, as well as being a lot of fun to explore.\nArtists Statement:\nI am interested in self-organized, emergent patterns and textures. I take photos of patterns both from the natural world and of experiments in my laboratory in the department of Physics at the University of Toronto. Patterns naturally attract casual attention but are also the subject of serious scientific research. Some things just evolve all by themselves into strikingly regular shapes and textures. Why? These shapes emerge spontaneously from a dynamic process of growing, folding, cracking, wrinkling, branching, flowing and other kinds of morphological development. My photos are informed by the scientific aesthetic of nonlinear physics, and mathematics lurks behind every image for those who know where to look for it. But no special knowledge is required to appreciate the results. Each image shows an object, sometimes quite small and often familiar, with a self-composed regular structure. Some images are from laboratory physics experiments and some are from Nature, and all celebrate the subtle interplay of order and complexity in emergent patterns.",

            "abstract": "Climate change can lead to dramatic variations in hydrologic regime, affecting both surface water and groundwater supply. This effect is most significant in populated semi-arid regions where water availability are highly sensitive to climate-induced outcomes. However, predicting water availability at regional scales, while resolving some of the key internal variability and structure in semi-arid regions is difficult due to the highly non-linearity relationship between rainfall and runoff. In this study, we describe the development of a modeling framework to evaluate future water availability that captures elements of the coupled response of the biophysical system to climate change and human systems. The framework is built under the Envision multi-agent simulation tool, characterizing the spatial patterns of water demand in the semi-arid Treasure Valley area of Southwest Idaho - a rapidly developing socio-ecological system where urban growth is displacing agricultural production. The semi-conceptual HBV model, a population growth and allocation model (Target), a vegetation state and transition model (SSTM), and a statistically based fire disturbance model (SpatialAllocator) are integrated to simulate hydrology, population and land use. Six alternative scenarios are composed by combining two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) with three population growth and allocation scenarios (Status Quo, Managed Growth, and Unconstrained Growth). Five-year calibration and validation performances are assessed with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. Irrigation activities are simulated using local water rights. Results show that in all scenarios, annual mean stream flow decreases as the projected rainfall increases because the projected warmer climate also enhances water losses to evapotranspiration. Seasonal maximum stream flow tends to occur earlier than in current conditions due to the earlier peak of snow melting. The aridity index and water deficit generally increase in the irrigated area. The most sensitive area is along the Boise Foothill which is the transitioning zone from water deficit to water abundant. However, these trends vary significantly between scenarios in space and time. The outcome of the study will serve as a reference for local stakeholders to make decisions on future land use.",

An objective of the project is to design, adapt, and test non-seismic monitoring methods that have not been systematically utilized to date for monitoring CO2 storage projects, and to integrate the data from these various monitoring tools to obtain quantitative estimates of the change in subsurface fluid distributions, pressure changes and associated surface deformation. Monitoring methods being applied include satellite-, surface- and wellbore-based monitoring systems and comprise natural- and controlled-source electromagnetic methods, gravity monitoring, GPS, synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR), tiltmeter array analysis, and chemical tracer studies. Here we focus on the GPS monitoring of surface deformation. Five GPS monitoring stations were installed in 2012 and another six in 2013, some collocated on top of InSAR retroreflectors. The GPS data from these stations have been processed on a weekly basis in both baseline processing mode using the Bernese GPS Software and precise point positioning mode using CSRS-PPP. Here we present the first complete results with 1-2 years of data at all sites prior to CO2 injection. The time series of these sites are examined, compared and analysed with respect to monument stability, seasonal signals and estimates of expected regional ground motion. The individual weekly network solutions have also been combined together in a cumulative 4D network solution to provide a preliminary local velocity field in the immediately vicinity of the injection well. These results are also compared to those obtained independently from InSAR, in particular the direct comparison of GPS and InSAR at the retroreflectors.",

            "abstract": "Fluid flow tends to be restricted perpendicular to deformation bands through the combined effects of mechanical grain size reduction, porosity loss, and preferred cementation relative to the adjacent host rock. Deformation bands that occur in association with reservoir scale faults can impact reservoir-scale fluid flow and fault seal behavior, potentially imparting a permeability anisotropy to reservoir rocks. We use a combination of Hg-intrusion porosimetry, high-resolution 2D-image analysis of pore size distributions, and detailed compositional analyses obtained from integrating petrographic and SEM-based imaging techniques, including SEM-cathodoluminescence, backscattered electron imaging, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, to (1) assess the effects of coupled chemical and mechanical processes leading to deformation localization within various detrital compositions [Cedar Mesa, Navajo, and Entrada sandstones] and (2) to quantify the effect of these processes on single and multiphase fluid flow as a function of host rock properties, structural position, and deformation band textural and diagenetic properties. Within each sample, bands of differing kinematic properties and structural style, i.e. shear bands, shear enhanced compaction bands etc., were identified and pre-kinematic pore-filling cements, as well as syn- and post-kinematic cements including various clay minerals, were distinguished for both the host rock and associated deformation bands. Although the deformation bands display a variety of textures and diagenetic attributes, initial petrophysical results suggest that the flow properties – permeability and capillary pressure curves – of the bands in the formations studied are very similar. However, both individual and clustered deformation bands of the Navajo Sandstone contain open or partially cemented cross-cutting fractures that could act as flow pathways across the deformation bands.",

            "abstract": "Paleovegetation and paleontological data from East Africa suggest that over the last five million years, the evolution of mammals has been significantly influenced by the emergence and expansion of C4 grasslands. Isotopic data from soil carbonate and marine core biomarkers indicate increased C4 grasses on the landscape beginning in the late Miocene. However, most Plio-Pleistocene sediments at vertebrate fossil localities lack sufficient soil carbonates that could allow us to directly link organisms to the particular environment where they lived. Here we take advantage of the organic biomarker record of vegetation in East Africa to understand landscape variability, its long-term evolution, and the relationship to the fossil record. Biomarker isotope records from Omo Group sediments, a fluvial-lacustrine sequence in the Turkana Basin, differ from their marine core counterparts in that they provide a local vegetation signal that can be directly linked to fossil material from the same sediments; they differ from soil carbonate records in that they are not limited to the specific environmental conditions necessary for carbonate precipitation.\nWe present carbon isotope data from n-alkane and n-alkanoic acids from Omo Group sediments that span 3.6 to 1.1 Ma. The δ13C values from nC31 alkanes and nC30 alkanoic acids indicate high landscape variability ranging from C3-dominated to pure C4 environments. In both the Shungura and Nachukui Formations, biomarker data record significantly more C4 vegetation on the landscape than existing soil carbonate data. Biomarker data from the Shungura Formation indicate a more dynamic landscape than what is shown in the soil carbonate record. Biomarker samples come from sediments initially collected for pollen or paleomagnetic analyses that generally do not contain soil carbonates. They represent a wide variety of sediment types and therefore capture a broad range of depositional environments and environmental variability. Combined δ13C records from biomarkers and soil carbonates indicate a more dynamic landscape than what is recorded by a single proxy alone. The combined paleovegetation record from these two proxies suggests that East African fauna evolved in a highly variable landscape during the Plio-Pleistocene.",

            "abstract": "Partially molten rocks commonly develop textures that appear close to textural equilibrium, where the melt network evolves to minimize the energy of the melt-solid interfaces, while maintaining the dihedral angle θ at solid-solid-melt contact lines. Textural equilibrium provides a powerful model for the melt distribution that controls the petro-physical properties of partially molten rocks, e.g., permeability, elastic moduli, and electrical resistivity.\n We present the first level-set computations of three-dimensional texturally equilibrated melt networks in rocks with an anisotropic fabric. Our results show that anisotropy induces wetting of smaller grain boundary faces for θ > 0 at realistic porosities ϕ < 3%. This was previously not thought to be possible at textural equilibrium and reconciles the theory with experimental observations. Wetting of the grain boundary faces leads to a dramatic redistribution of the melt from the edges to the faces that introduces strong anisotropy in the petro-physical properties such as permeability, effective electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. Figure, on left, shows that smaller grain boundaries become wetted at relatively low melt fractions of 3% in stretched polyhedral grains with elongation factor 1.5. Right plot represents the ratio of melt electrical conductivity to effective conductivity of medium (known as formation factor) as an example of anisotropy in physical properties. The plot shows that even slight anisotropy in grains induces considerable anisotropy in electrical properties.",

            "abstract": "Given the inherent uncertainty in almost all of the variables involved, recent research is re-addressing the problem of calibrating hydrologic models from a stochastic perspective: the focus is shifting from finding a single parameter configuration that minimizes the model error, to approximating the maximum likelihood multivariate probability distribution of the parameters. To this end, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) formulations are widely used, where the distribution is defined as a smoothed ensemble of particles or members, each of which represents a feasible parameterization. However, the updating of these ensembles needs to strike a careful balance so that the particles adequately resemble the real distribution without either clustering or drifting excessively. In this study, we explore the implementation of two techniques that attempt to improve the quality of the resulting ensembles, both for the approximation of the model parameters and of the unknown states, in a dual calibration-data assimilation framework. The first feature of our proposed algorithm, in an effort to keep members from clustering on areas of high likelihood in light of the observations, is the introduction of diversity-inducing operators after each resampling. This approach has been successfully used before, and here we aim at testing additional operators which are also borrowed from the Evolutionary Computation literature. The second feature is a novel arrangement of the particles into two alternative data structures. The first one is a non-sorted Pareto population which favors 1) particles with high likelihood, and 2) particles that introduce a certain level of heterogeneity. The second structure is a partitioned array, in which each partition requires its members to have increasing levels of divergence from the particles in the areas of larger likelihood. Our newly proposed algorithm will be evaluated and compared to traditional MCMC methods in terms of convergence speed, and the ability of adequately representing the target probability distribution while making an efficient use of the available members. Two calibration scenarios will be carried out, one with invariant model parameter settings, and another one allowing the parameters to be modified through time along with the estimates of the model states.",

Long-term exposure to As contaminated water increases the risk of skin lesions and internal cancers. In 2000-2001, water samples from 61 villages distributed within a 25 km area of Araihazar, Bangladesh were collected and tested for As to better understand the spatial distribution of arsenic in groundwater. In 2012, village health workers returned to the same area and performed field kit tests for arsenic and resurveyed well owners. Of the 9,000 tubewells originally sampled in 2000-01, 760 of them have been identified as potentially still in existence by matching GPS coordinates, well depth, and well age information. The goal of this work is to determine whether arsenic concentrations along with groundwater chemistry have changed over the past 14 years in these tubewells. Archived water samples from the 2000-2001 sampling campaign are being assessed for sample storage integrity and village health workers are currently resampling these 760 tubewells. In 2000-2001, these samples were initially analyzed for As using Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption (GFAA). The 2000-2001 archived water samples are currently being reanalyzed with Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) to improve sensitivity, accuracy and precision of arsenic detection. ICP-MS will also be used to analyze for 13 other elements. Comparing ICP-MS with the GFAA As demonstrated that the long-term storage of these samples did not alter the water chemistry. Analysis of the samples currently being collected in Bangladesh will enable us to determine the stability of groundwater chemistry over time.",

Yet, far too often, the importance, meaning, and relevance of their discoveries are never shared with persons outside their discipline. Recognizing the need for scientists to communicate more effectively with the public, the Florida Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE Florida) saw an opportunity to connect the two through film. In the fall 2013, COSEE Florida launched the Ocean 180 Video Challenge to tap into the competitive spirit of scientists and inspire them to share their latest discoveries with the public. The competition encouraged scientists to submit short, 3-minute video abstracts summarizing the important findings of recent peer-reviewed papers and highlighting the relevance, meaning, and implications of the research to persons outside their discipline. Videos were initially screened and evaluated by a team of science and communication experts and the winners (from a field of ten finalists) were selected by more than 30,000 middle school students from 285 schools in 13 countries. Our presentation will review the outcomes and lessons learned from the 2014 competition and describe how contest videos are being used for professional development/training and educational purposes. We will also describe how video competitions can benefit both scientists and the target audience and be effective outreach strategies for encouraging scientists to share new discoveries and their enthusiasm for science with K-12 students and the public.",

            "abstract": "Presently there are no regional-scale morphometric analyses of Andean fluvial basins. Therefore, we created a continental-scale database of these basins. Our data covers over an area 1,000,000 km2 of the Andes, from Venezuela to Argentina. These basins are the source of some of the largest rivers in the world including the Amazon, Orinoco, Parana, and Magdalena. Morphometric parameters including shape factor, relief ratio, longitudinal profiles and different indices of basin elevation were calculated based on the CGIAR SRTM 4.1 DEM (~90 m resolution). FAO Hydrosheds were used to segment the DEM by major catchment and then manually cut at the Andean zone. In the North and Central Andes, this produced over 500,000 subcatchments, which we reduced to 619 by setting minimum catchment area to 100 km2. We then integrate lithologic data from DNPM geologic data. Our results indicate that sedimentary lithologies dominate Central Andean catchments (n=268,k=4), which cover an area 767,00 km2, while the Northern Andean catchments (covering 350,000 km2) are more varied, dominated by volcanics in the Pacific (n=78), a sedimentary (48%) dominant mix in the Caribbean (n=138) and 60% sedimentary in the Amazon-Orinoco subregion catchments (n=138). Elevation averages are smallest in the north Andes and average maximum elevations (6,026 m) in the Argentinian catchments (n=65) of the Central Andes are the highest. Shape factors range from 0.49 to 0.58 in the North and 0.52 to 0.58 in the Central Andes. There are clear differences in all categories between region and subregion, but that difference does not hinge on a single morphometric or geologic parameter. Morphometric parameters at a watershed scale (listed in Table) are analyzed and hydrologic data from gauging stations throughout the Andes (n=100) are used to compare morphometric parameters with lithology and characteristics from the basin hydrograph (peak discharge timing, minimum and maximum discharge, and runoff).",

            "abstract": "Many plants produce isoprene, a volatile organic compound that can mitigate damage to photosynthetic systems during short- or long-term increases in leaf temperature. After its production within leaves, isoprene is emitted to the atmosphere and influences regional atmospheric chemistry. Here, we use an urban-to-rural gradient to explore future effects of climate change on tree eco-physiology and feedbacks to atmospheric chemistry. Urban areas mimic many of the conditions expected to occur in the future; in particular, cities have warmer temperatures due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect, and less water availability relative to rural areas. Along a 90 km urban-to-rural gradient, we measured photosynthesis and isoprene emission from trees at three sites in eastern Texas: Houston (urban), The Woodlands (suburban) and Sam Houston National Forest (rural). Isoprene emission from post oak (Quercus stellata) was higher in Houston than the other sites, and when leaf temperatures were increased above ambient conditions, trees produced more isoprene. Leaves produced more isoprene at high leaf temperatures in early summer than in late summer, suggesting gradual acclimation of photosynthetic processes over the course of the summer. We also found that sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) emitted more isoprene than post oak, but when leaf temperatures were increased, isoprene emission was exhausted more quickly in sweetgum relative to post oak. At the same time, post oak maintained higher levels of photosynthesis seasonally and during short-term temperature increases. Both post oak and sweetgum are significant isoprene emitters and represent approximately two and four percent crown cover in the United States, respectively. Our results suggest that in a warming climate, we can expect trees to produce more isoprene seasonally and in response to short-term temperature extremes, and that species-specific differences in photosynthesis and isoprene emission may play an important role in forest dynamics, particularly in long-term forest growth and carbon storage. Further exploration of the interactive effect of increased CO2, temperature, and drought on tree physiology will improve our understanding of forest dynamics and forest-climate feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "How do you teach volcanology and volcanic hazards to students when there is no volcano nearby? You bring the volcano to them! At Michigan Technological University we have developed a four-lesson-unit for middle and high school students which incorporates virtual, analogue and numerical models to increase students’ interests in geosciences while simultaneously expanding the community of earth-science-literate individuals necessary for a disaster resilient society. The unit aims to build on students’ prior geoscience knowledge by examining the physical properties that influence volcanic eruptions and introduces them to challenges and methods of communicating hazards and risk. Lesson one engages students in a series of hands-on investigations that explore the “3-Vs” of volcanology: Viscosity, Volatiles and Volume. The students learn about the relationship between magma composition and viscosity and the influence on eruption style, behavior and morphology of different volcanoes. Lesson two uses an analogue model of a volcano to demonstrate the forces involved in an explosive eruption and associated hazards. Students think critically about the factors that affect hazards and risk as well as the variables (such as topography) that affect the eruption and the hazard. During lesson three students use Google Earth for a virtual field trip to Pacaya volcano, Guatemala to examine changes in the landscape over time and other evidence of volcanic activity to make interpretations about the volcano. The final lesson has the students use numerical models and GIS to create hazard maps based on probabilistic lahar scenarios. Throughout the unit students are engaged in an inquiry-based exploration that covers several Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) content and practices. This four lesson unit has been field tested in two school districts and during a summer engineering program. Results from student work and post-surveys show that this strategy raises interests in and knowledge of volcanic hazards.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental question in tsunami and storm studies is how to differentiate their deposits, which is key to the understanding of past events. Currently, there is no consistent differences due to wide variability of causative forces, topography, sediment source and post-depositional changes. One avenue to resolve these issues can potentially be numerical modeling. Conventional depth-averaged models help us learn general interactions between flow and sediments, but fail to reproduce small-scale depositional structures. We present a new meso-scale sediment transport model. The goal is to advance our knowledge of characteristic differences between storm and tsunami deposits and their relationship with the hydrodynamic processes in tsunamis and storms.\nOur transport model is based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM). While it is ideal to model every single sediment grains, contemporary computational power will be quickly exhausted due to the scale of interest. Therefore we employ the meso-scale method where a particle represents a group of grains. The volume of each particle is determined dynamically based on pickup rate from the bed and transport rate at the boundaries. During transport, it is assumed that the particle does not change. The motion of particles is governed by Newton’s Second Law, with wave motion superimposed on its settling velocities. Hindered settling is implemented to allow interactions between particles through changes of local sediment concentration. Particles are deposited when they reach the bed, and merged into the top layer. Deposits consist of layers that are of the same constant thickness. Bed avalanching could occur where slope exceeds a certain threshold.\nThe Nonlinear Shallow Water Equation (NSWE) is employed to model hydrodynamics. The system of NSWE is solved with a second-order upwind FVM numerical scheme. Wetting and drying is also implemented to handle inundation. In order to couple the depth integrated NSWE with DEM, a velocity profile is obtained.\nInitial results show that our model is capable of reproducing macroscopic depositional differences between tsunamis and storms. We will further analyze differences in deposit structures and their link to different wave and sediment transport processes.",

This is very important and indispensable problem for Japan and other high seismicity countries.\nBased on lessons learned from the 2004 Sumatra Earthquake/Tsunamis and the 2011 East Japan Earthquake/Tsunami, we recognized the importance of real-time monitoring of these natural hazards. As real-time monitoring system, DONET1 (Dense Ocean floor Network for Earthquakes and Tsunamis) was deployed and DONET2 is being developed around the Nankai trough Southwestern Japan for Seismology and Earthquake/Tsunami Early Warning.\nBased on simulation researches, DONET1 and DONET2 with multi-kinds of sensors such as broadband seismometers and precise pressure gauges will be expected to monitor slow events such as low frequency tremors and slow earthquakes for the estimation of seismic stage which is the inter-seismic or pre-seismic stage. In advanced simulation researches such as the recurrence cycle of mega thrust earthquakes, the data assimilation is very powerful tool to improve the reliability. Furthermore, tsunami inundations, seismic responses on buildings/city and agent simulations are very important towards future disaster mitigation programs and related measures. Finally, real-time monitoring data and advanced simulations will be integrated for precise Earthquake/Tsunami Early Warning and Estimation of damages in future compound disasters on Earthquakes and Tsunamis. \nWe will introduce the present progress of advanced researches and future scope for disaster mitigation researches on earthquakes and Tsunamis.",

New and potentially unfamiliar data types and associated processing methods, required to work with a growing diversity of available data, may warrant time and resources that present a barrier to classroom integration. Analysis of these big datasets may further present a challenge given large file sizes, and uncertainty regarding best methods to properly statistically summarize and analyze results. Finally, teaching resources, in the form of demonstrative illustrations, and other supporting media that might help teach key data concepts, take time to find and more time to develop. Available resources are often spread widely across multi-online spaces.\nThis presentation will overview the development of NEON’s collaborative University-focused online education portal. Portal content will include 1) videos and supporting graphics that explain key concepts related to NEON data products including collection methods, key metadata to consider and consideration of potential error and uncertainty surrounding data analysis; and 2) packaged “lab” activities that include supporting data to be used in an ecology, biology or earth science classroom.

            "abstract": "Some of the largest reductions in seasonal snow cover are projected to occur in temperate latitudes. Limited measurements from these ecosystems indicate that winter soil respiration releases as much as 30% of carbon fixed during the previous growing season. This respiration is possible with a snowpack that insulates soil from ambient fluctuations in climate. However, relationships among snowpack, soil temperature, soil moisture, and winter soil respiration in temperate regions are not well-understood. Most studies have infrequently sampled soil respiration and its drivers, and most measurements have been limited to the soil surface. We made near-real time, continuous measurements of temperature, moisture, and CO2 fluxes from the soil profile, through the snowpack, and into the atmosphere in a deciduous forest of New Hampshire, USA. We coupled these data with daily sampling of snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE). Our objectives were to continuously measure soil CO2 production (Psoil) and CO2 flux through the snowpack (Fsnow) and to compare Fsnow and Psoil with environmental drivers. We found that Fsnow was more dynamic than Psoil, changing as much as 30% over several days with shifting environmental conditions. Multiple regression indicated that SWE, air temperature, surface soil temperature, surface soil CO2 concentrations, and soil moisture at 15 cm were significant predictors of Fsnow. The transition of surface temperature from below to above 0°C was particularly important as it represented a phase change from ice to liquid water. Only air temperature and soil moisture at 15 cm were significant drivers of Psoil, where higher moisture at 15 cm resulted in lower Psoil rates. Time series analysis showed that Fsnow lagged 40 days behind Psoil. This lag may be due to slow CO2 diffusion through soil to overlying snow under high moisture conditions. Our results suggest that surface soil CO2 losses are driven by rapid changes in snow cover, surface temperature, and surface moisture while winter soil CO2 production is driven by subsurface moisture conditions. Our finding that subsurface moisture regulated winter soil respiration demonstrates the transformative power of sensors; winter measurements of soil CO2 concentrations and moisture levels would not be possible with traditional methods.",

            "abstract": "Naturally occurring production of molecular hydrogen (H2) by water radiolysis may be a fundamentally important source of electron donors (energy) for life in subsurface environments where organic matter is scarce. Previous studies with very high gamma radiation rates and wet mineral phases have reported high H2 production relative to production from water radiolysis in the absence of solid phases. Numerical calculations by other previous studies have predicted enhanced H2 production from seawater radiolysis relative to pure water radiolysis, due to the interaction of anions with hydroxyl radicals.\nGiven these reports, the potential catalytic influences of solid and dissolved chemical phases on radiolytic H2 production need to be carefully quantified in order to fully evaluate the role of radiolytic H2 as a microbial energy source.\nFor such quantification, we undertook gamma-irradiation experiments with pure water, deep ocean water and mixtures (slurries, φ = 0.85) of seawater with: North Pacific abyssal clay and calcareous oozes, coastal sediment, zirconium dioxide, and zeolite. We carried out our experiments at the Rhode Island Nuclear Science Center using a 37Cesium source at low dose rates (up to 0.1 Gy/hr).\nOur results to date include the following. First, the per-dose radiolytic H2 yield of pure water at low dose rates is directly comparable to the per-dose yield at much higher dose rates (ca. 1 kGy/hr); this result indicates that H2 production rate is linearly related to radiation dose rate across four orders of magnitude. Second, there is no statistically significant difference (90% confidence limit) between the radiolytic H2 yield from pure water and that from seawater; this result rules out influence of abundant seawater salts on H2 yield from water radiolysis. Third, H2 production from a mixture of abyssal clay and seawater is 25% higher than the yield from pure water. This enhanced yield is consistent with catalysis of radiolytic H2 production by zeolite.",

Laboratory experiments were patterned after the experiments of Childs and Poulovassilis (1962. The moisture profile above a moving water table, Journal of Soil Science, 13(2), 271-285) and conducted in a Wedron sand packed column (14.5 cm in diameter and 141 cm in length) using different upper boundary fluxes and varying water table velocities. A constant head tank reservoir suspended from a stepper motor was used to control water table movement. Time-domain reflectrometry (TDR) probes were used to measure water content at seven different depths, while tensiometers measured capillary pressures at three depths. Measured water contents and pressures indicated hysteresis effect. The retention curves were affected by the wetting/drying processes, soil surface rainfall conditions, and varied at different locations. A single set of van Genuchten parameters were identified that resulted in adequate description of soil water retention relations for both rising and falling water table cases. The water flow dynamics were simulated using the one-dimensional Talbot-Ogden (T-O) infiltration and redistribution method (Talbot and Ogden, 2008. A method for computing infiltration and redistribution in a discretized moisture content domain, Water Resources Research, 44(8), W08453, DOI: 10.1029/2008WR006815) modified to consider the influence of the groundwater table on the vadose zone. Simulation results agreed satisfactorily with measurements for the evolution of water content profile, though hysteresis effect was not considered in the T-O method. Predicted ponding/deponding times using T-O method were generally acceptable. The performance of T-O method was compared with the numerical solution of Richards' equation (RE). Results showed similar performance for both methods, however the RE solver performed better in cases with a falling water, while the T-O method performed better in cases with a rising water table. The performance of both T-O and RE were best when the water table velocity was less than 20 percent of the saturated hydraulic conductivity.",

            "abstract": "Coastal biogeochemical processes exert important controls on the net delivery of silicon to the ocean. Reverse weathering of biogenic silica by authigenic transformation has been suggested to be an important processes for silicon retention in coastal sediments. Many reported sediment biogenic silica measurements may underestimate this authigenically-transformed fraction; for example, the incorporation of metal hydroxides with the biogenic silica matrix suppresses the ability to distinguish it from mineral silica when using a traditional alkaline leach. Most studies demonstrating the importance of reverse weathering on biogenic silica have examined deltaic sediments in river dominated systems (e.g. Mississippi, Amazon), but this has not been examined in sediments which lack strong fluvial input. Using sediment cores from the outside the Mississippi River plume, we adapted a method which lessens the interference of metal hydroxides on biogenic silica by using an initial acid leach. The addition of this step increased the measured biogenic silica up to five-fold above that detected using a traditional alkaline digestion method. The magnitude of authigenically-altered biogenic silica in these cores was significant, representing a majority of the sediment biogenic silica pool at most depths. These findings confirm the importance of reverse-weathered biogenic silica as a mechanism for silicon retention and suggest the significance of this process may be more widespread.",

Shallow gas hydrates of Japan Sea occur in fine-grained muddy sediments of shallow subsurface of mounds and gas chimneys in the form of massive nodular to platy accumulation. Gas hydrate bearing mounds are often associated with active methane seeps, bacterial mats and carbonate concretions and pavements. Gases of gas hydrates are derived either from deep thermogenic, shallow microbial or from the mixed gases, contrasting with totally microbial deep-seated stratigraphically controlled hydrates. Shallow gas hydrates in Japan Sea have not been considered as energy resource due to its limited distribution in narrow Joetsu basin. However recently academic research surveys have demonstrated regional distribution of gas chimney and hydrate mound in a number of sedimentary basins along the eastern margin of Japan Sea. Regional mapping of gas chimney and hydrate mound by means of MBES and SBP surveys have confirmed that more than 200 gas chimneys exist in 100 km x 100 km area. ROV dives have identified dense accumulation of hydrates on the wall of half collapsed hydrate mound down to 30 mbsf. Sequential LWD and shallow coring campaign in the Summer of 2014, R/V Hakurei, which is equipped with Fugro Seacore R140 drilling rig, drilled through hydrate mounds and gas chimneys down to the BGHS (base of gas hydrate stability) level and successfully recovered massive gas hydrates bearing sediments from several horizons.",

            "abstract": "The productivity of hydroelectric dams along the Nile River is to a large extent determined by the level of Lake Victoria, which is primarily dictated by the rainfall and temperature variability over the lake basin. The hydrological balance of Lake Victoria is comprised of tributary inflow (15% of the water balance), rainfall over the lake (85%), evaporation from the lake (80%), and outflow from the lake (20%). The Agreed Curve Policy has been used to manage the outflow from Lake Victoria. It guarantees the natural flow of water out of the lake as if there were no dams. However, declining lake levels and population growth have resulted in chronic load shedding for residential and industrial consumers in the region, leading to the need to develop a new release policy.\nThe development of recently proposed water release policies for the hydroelectric dams at the outlet of Lake Victoria do not thoroughly account for projected climate change. We adopt a comprehensive approach using rainfall data from multiple CORDEX models to estimate lake levels and confidence levels for two different release policies. We then compare exceedence curves for the release rule policies based on observed rainfall data for recent decades. Exceedence curves indicate vulnerability to power supply reliability.\nFactors affecting precipitation in individual models are examined. There is a distinct dry-wet-dry-wet pattern of annual rainfall over the Lake Victoria basin, which is evident in a comparison of precipitation from rain gauge stations used in the water balance model. Previous studies have demonstrated that this feature is determined by a combination of orographic forcing, the thermodynamics of the lake, and the interaction between the prevailing wind flow and lake-land breeze circulation. ENSO has the most influence on precipitation over the lake basin in terms of annual climatology. We evaluate the CORDEX models based on how well they reproduce these metrics in addition to how well they perform in the water balance model. Based on this, we provide guidance on considerations for CORDEX models improvement in order to better serve the hydroelectric provider and management community for Lake Victoria.\nThis study will be incorporated into the Water Resources Sector Pilot Project of the proposed GEWEX Hydroclimate project for Lake Victoria (HyVic).",

            "abstract": "This paper explores the vulnerability of global hydropower generation to the variability in seasonal averages as well as changes in extreme conditions of precipitation, surface runoff, and temperature. A statistical model is used to estimate the elasticity of hydroelectricity generation to the historical variation (1962-2010) in precipitation or runoff, while controlling for potential confounding factors and temperature changes. The estimated elasticities, which informs about hydropower sensitivity to meteorological variations, are combined with changes in future exposure around 2050 in different warming scenarios as simulated by an ensemble of GCMs participating in the CMIP5 project (Taylor et al., 2012).\nWe use a panel regression model to estimate the parameters characterizing a reduced-form relationship between hydropower electricity generation at country level, a set of meteorological indicators, and number of other covariates that control for time-invariant country-specific heterogeneity (country effect), unspecified exogenous influences affecting all countries and units (time effects), and other confounding factors such the electricity generation mix.\nThe estimated model shows that total annual runoff has a significant impact on the annual generation from the small and medium-sized units, whereas large-sized units do not appear to be sensitive to the inter-annual variation in runoff. This finding is reasonably explained by the greater buffer effect of reservoir capacity, which sensibly increases the resilience of these plants to inter-annual runoff variability. In medium-sized units an increase in total runoff by 1% increases electricity generation by 0.028%. Small-sized units are more sensitivity to inter-annual variations in runoff, and the same change in total runoff (1%) increases electricity generation by 0.037%. Seasonal temperature has also a significant impact. A 1% increase in spring temperature reduces electricity generation by 1.63%, while a 1% increase in summer temperature reduces electricity generation by 1.58%. While an increased frequency of warm days has a positive coefficient. Including the SPI indicators reduces marginal effects of the inter-annual variation in total runoff from 0.028 to 0.022 for the medium units and from 0.037 to 0.031 for the small units.",

            "abstract": "Spatial patterns in many ecosystems arise from feedbacks associated with the potential for critical transitions and multiple stable states. Such systems may be susceptible to abrupt change, which could be indicated by early-warning signals, such as critical slowing down (increasingly long recovery from perturbation as a threshold approaches). Paleoecological data from ribbon forests, a type of subalpine parkland found in the Rocky Mountains, offer an opportunity to test these hypotheses. The forests consist of alternating strips of forest and meadow that form because bands of Picea and Abies trees act as snow fences with large snowdrifts forming on their lee sides. Drifts provide moisture for the adjacent trees, but also increase seedling mortality and shorten the growing season where drifts accumulate. The feedbacks between forest growth and snow accumulation maintain the ribbon forest-meadow pattern, and raise the potential for abrupt change if the feedbacks breakdown in response to factors like drought or fire.\nOur fossil pollen data from Summit Lake, located on the Continental Divide in the Park Range, northern Colorado, indicate that a closed forest transitioned rapidly to a ribbon forest state at ca. 1000 BP. Artemisia pollen increased (20 to 35%) and Picea and Abies pollen decreased (25 to 15%) within a century or less after a pair of charcoal peaks. Decreased charcoal influx (from 0.6 to 0.4 pieces/cm2/yr) and fire frequency (from 4.5 to 1.5 fires/ka) coincided with the pollen assemblage changes, and is consistent with decreased landscape biomass and fuel connectivity.\nInitial analyses show evidence of critical slowing down before the state change. After eight of eleven fires recorded by peaks in charcoal accumulation, Artemisia pollen percentages rise to a peak consistent with brief opening of the initially forested landscape. After 2000 BP, the magnitude and duration of the post-fire changes increases until no recovery is recorded after the shift at 1000 BP. The data provide the first evidence of leading indicators before state change in long-lived systems, such as forests, and suggests that current theory about patterning and multiple stable states may be accurate for such systems.",

The total surveyed area is up to 82000 km² including 65000 km² covering rift valley and flanges of the ridge.\nKnipovich ridge is classified as an ultra-slow oblique spreading center with spreading rate around 1,4 cm/y. Its large-scale morphological features are reduced in number comparing to other mid-ocean ridges. Eastern flange is buried under the continental slope sediments and only the rare highest peaks rise above this cover. Western flange is fully developed and consists of several ridges prolonged parallel to the rift valley. Ridges are supplemented with individual highs. Rift valley is 20-40 km wide and 500 km long. Its depth is 3300-3700 m. Valley slopes have terraces and ledges of different amplitudes. The bottom of the valley is echeloned by 5 volcanic axial highs rising 400 - 1000 m above it.\nSpreading obliquity is imprinted in the ridge morphology. The global models predict a plate motion vector of 307º. The main ridge axis has general orientation of 350º. Rift valley follows this direction from the South, and on the half way to the North turns to azimuth of 2º. The detailed bathymetry shows that small-scale features orientation differs. Rift axial highs and individual flange highs are prolonged NW-SE under azimuth of 30º. This orientation is sub-perpendicular to the plate motion vector (83º) and oblique to the ridge axes (40º). The multibeam bathymetry shows no sing of transform faults or non-transform discontinuities along the Knipovich ridge rift valley. There is one strong lineation in the northern part of the ridge. It includes flange and axial highs and continues from the eastern flange through the second northern axial high to the western flange under the azimuth of 320º. It is an indication of long-term magmatic activity in this segment.\nDetailed bathymetry reveals small-scale features that are important for our understanding of the ridge nature.",

This study will evaluate the suite of AMSR2 algorithms that are being developed for the operational retrieval of snow cover detection and snow depth using AMSR-E and AMSR2 data. AMSR-E data spans 10 years from June 2002 to September 2011; AMSR2 data spans 2 years from August 2012 to May 2014. The snow cover detection algorithm is based on the operational NOAA’s heritage microwave algorithm with snow climatology tests and wet snow filtering as new enhancements. The SD algorithm is adopted from the current version of the operational NASA AMSR-E SWE algorithm.

            "abstract": "The surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet is modulated in part by clouds through their interactions with the hydrologic cycle and influence on the surface energy budget. Furthermore, precipitation and post-depositional processes influence the isotopic composition of the ice, which is used for paleoclimatic reconstructions. Despite these important roles, relatively little is known of the properties of clouds over Greenland. Therefore, detailed observations are needed to constrain the influence that clouds have on the ice sheet and to support climate and weather modeling. This work focuses on observations of surface-based clouds from Summit, Greenland (72N 38W 3200m), including supercooled liquid radiation fogs, diamond dust, and blowing snow. Co-located measurements from a variety of sensors are combined to report on the prevalence of these clouds, their microphysical and radiative properties, the influence they have on the isotopic ratio of surface accumulation, and the meteorological conditions under which they occur. Observations include in situ measurements from particle imaging and scattering probes as well as meteorology at 2m and 10m and remotely sensed observations made at the surface from a cloud radar, an infrared spectrometer, and a suite of broadband radiation sensors. The period of study is June 2012 through October 2013. Surface-based clouds (Nd > 1 cm-3) occur between 20% and 60% of the time, more often in winter and less in summer. Supercooled liquid is identified throughout the year and at temperatures as low as -40 C. These types of clouds exhibit a range of radiative, dynamic, and hydrologic interactions with the surface and therefore are sensitive to changes in aerosols, the presence of other cloud types, temperature, humidity, and near-surface stability.",

            "abstract": "Models allow scientists and others to represent features and behaviors of environmental systems in order to promote inquiry, develop insights, test hypotheses, and consider solutions to problems. Environmental modeling also offers a way to include independent research on environmental issues in undergraduate classes, especially during winter when outdoor labs are more difficult. I will present on an Environmental Studies Topics course on Environmental Modeling taught at St. Olaf College during interim, including student feedback. The class used primary literature and hands on experiences with computer models to introduce environmentally relevant modeling tools. Topics covered in readings, lectures, or student presentations included process based models of disease, climate, ice, ecosystems, ecosystem services, hydrology, predator-prey systems, and competition among species for resources. Students conducted student-designed original research projects either by developing their own environmental model or by using existing models. Students participating in the class were environmental studies, economics, biology, math, or physics majors, although the class was open to all students who were “comfortable thinking quantitatively”. No prior programming experience was required as a prerequisite, although students who had previous experience with R or Matlab were able to design more complex models. The students were graded on their class participation in discussions, several modeling “checkpoint” assignments designed to monitor progress, and on 4 in-class presentations designed to foster a collaborative atmosphere and improve communication skills. While the course was taught over a month-long interim “semester”, students were evenly divided in their feedback about whether they would prefer the course in that format or in a semester-long format.",

            "abstract": "Mounting evidence shows that California is currently experiencing the most severe drought since 1580, and it is likely that extreme droughts will become more common as the climate changes. Any drought – particularly one of this magnitude – can elevate dust transport, from fallow croplands and bare natural ecosystems, to sometimes distant locations. The transported dust may bring nutrients and microorganisms, with unknown, but potentially transformational, impacts on the ecosystems where dust is deposited. In this project, we are measuring the mass, provenance (using isotopic chemistry), chemical makeup, and microbial composition of dust transported to the Sierra Nevada mountain range.\nDust is being collected at three sites along an elevational gradient in the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory (SSCZO), ranging from 400 m to 2000 m elevation. At each site, dust has been collected monthly in Summer 2014 from passive dust collectors and from filters (1 um pore size) on the eddy covariance tower active CO2 samplers. To complement dust collection, soil samples (10 cm depth) have been collected within the footprint of the towers. Dust fluxes were found to be highest at the 2000 meter-high site, with a maximum of 231 mg dust collected in July 2014. The lowest dust fluxes were found at the medium elevation site, at 1100 m, with 21 mg dust in July. The provenance of dust samples will be determined using radiogenic strontium (Sr) and neodymium (Nd) isotopic tracers. Nutrients and microbial composition of dust and soil samples will also be analyzed. This approach will allow us to identify the effects of mega-droughts on i) dust-related contributions to the geobiology and biogeochemistry of soils and ecosystems, ii) the role of local versus distant dust sources of microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea and fungi, and of nutrients to the Sierra Nevada, and iii) the role of elevation in determining the ecological effects of mega-drought-induced dust transport. In the future, we will endeavor to compare the data collected during this year of extreme drought to data collected in wetter years.",

            "abstract": "On June 1st 2014 (UTC), a M 3.2 earthquake occurred in Weld County, Colorado. Weld County is largely aseismic and this event was unexpected. There were no events in the ANSS Comprehensive Catalogue within 50 km of the earthquake. Weld County is the center of active oil and gas development, including many high-volume Class II wastewater injection wells. Injection wells have been linked to an increasing number of earthquakes throughout the US in recent years. Due to the lack of background seismicity in the area and the proximity of the earthquake to several injection wells, the University of Colorado requested seismometers from IRIS PASSCAL’s Rapid Array Mobilization Program in order to study further seismicity. Seismic stations were deployed within 3 days of the June 1st event.\nWe report on our ongoing findings from this deployment. To date, we have located 89 earthquakes and have detected over 600. These numbers continue to grow as we collect and analyze further data. Earthquake magnitudes remain small with only three earthquakes above M 2.0 recorded by our network, the largest of which was an M 2.6 earthquake on June 23rd 2014. Earthquakes locate in a small cluster (~2 km radius) centered near a high-volume injection well. This well operated at injection rates greater than 300,000 barrels/month since August 2013 and injects at a depth near the sediment-basement contact. Prior to our local deployment, the closest seismic station to the June 1st event was > 100 km away and therefore the evolution of seismicity prior the June 1st earthquake is poorly constrained. In order to better understand the temporal evolution of seismicity, we use match-filtering on data from these distant stations and find the earliest matching event on November 11th 2013. Due to the strong spatial and temporal correlation between these events and injection operations, we find it likely that these earthquakes are induced.\nIn response to the ongoing seismicity near the well, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) ordered the high-volume well shutdown for 20 days. The well has since restarted injection at lower rates, with the potential to increase injection rates over time. The shutdown and resumption of smaller injection volumes provides the unique opportunity to directly evaluate the seismicity’s relationship to well operations.",

            "abstract": "The region between the occurrence of slow slip events (SSEs) and large to great earthquakes has proven to be difficult to classify, particularly because the region is often located offshore and ocean bottom seismometer networks are sparse. It is a common observation that small earthquakes and microseismicity occur at the down-dip end of the seismogenic zone, such that the termination of this seismicity has been used as a potential indicator of the extent of future large to great earthquakes. Observations from the recent Mw 9.0 March 11, 2011 Tohoku-Oki and Mw 7.4 March 20, 2012 Ometepec earthquakes also indicate that small earthquakes and microseismicity at the down-dip end of the seismogenic zone occurred coincident with SSEs in the time period that led up to the large earthquakes. For this study we employ the earthquake simulator, RSQSim, to better understand the physical conditions necessary to produce small earthquakes and microseimicity at the down-dip end of the seismogenic zone similar to what has been observed. Additionally we seek to better understand the relationship between the small earthquakes and microseismicity, SSEs, and large earthquakes. Physical conditions to be explored include the effective normal stress, frictional properties, and slip speed, and the spatial distribution of these parameters necessary to reproduce the observations.",

A complete macroscopic picture of a multiphase porous medium systems must rely on averaged measures to describe the dynamic behavior of the phases, interfaces and common curves. We describe an approach for pore-scale simulation of multiphase flow in which macroscopic quantities defined by the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT) are directly measured in situ. The macroscopic quantities extracted include phase pressures and velocities, interfacial curvatures, interface velocities, common curve lengths, contact angles, orientation tensors, and phase connectivity information. We demonstrate how our approach can be applied to large-scale lattice Boltzmann simulations of two-fluid-phase flow to evaluate macroscopic modeling assumptions, providing specific examples for the case of capillary pressure dynamics.",

CERES provides the climate community the following parameters: coincident CERES observed TOA fluxes, computed profile and surface fluxes, as well as MODIS cloud and aerosol retrievals. As part of its suite of products, CERES has packaged its MODIS derived cloud properties in the ISCCP-D2 monthly format that can be compared against climate model diagnostics with ISCCP simulators. There are 4 CERES ISCCP-D2 like products: ISCCP-D2like-MODIS, ISCCP-D2like-geo, ISCCP-D2like-merge, and flux-by-cloud-type product. The flux product combines for the first time CERES measured TOA fluxes along with the associated MODIS cloud properties, which links radiative flux directly to a specific cloud type. This was achieved by dividing the measured flux for a footprint into clear-sky portion and two cloud layer parts of the 20-km CERES footprint. The fluxes from each cloud layer in a CERES footprint were estimated using MODIS radiances for both shortwave and longwave. The spatially distributed cloud properties within the footprint were retrieved from 2-km MODIS pixels. This presentation has three parts: algorithm, validation, and multi-year results.",

            "abstract": "Clouds play a crucial role in the Earth's radiative budget, yet their climate feedbacks are poorly understood. The advent of space-borne high resolution spectrometers probing the O2 A-band, such as the GOSAT and OCO-2 satellites, could make it possible to simultaneously retrieve several cloud parameters that play a vital role in the Earth's radiative budget, thereby allowing a reduction of the corresponding uncertainty due to clouds. \nThe hyperspectral, polarimetric response of the O2 A-band to optical thickness, top height and droplet size has been studied, revealing a different sensitivity to each for the varying atmospheric absorption strength within the A-band. Cloud optical thickness finds greatest sensitivity in both intensity and polarization measurements at non-absorbing wavelengths. Cloud height had a negligible effect on intensity measurements at non-absorbing wavelengths, but finds maximum sensitivity at an intermediate absorption strength, which increases with cloud height. The same is found to hold for cloud geometric thickness, except that the sensitivity is weaker. Sensitivity to droplet size is generally weaker than to cloud optical thickness to top height at non-absorbing wavelengths and diminishes further with increasing absorption strength. It has been shown that significantly more information on droplet size can be drawn from multiangular measurements. Our results show that, in the absence of sunglint, the backscatter direction is richer in information on droplet size, especially in the glory and rainbow regions. It has been shown that I and Q generally have differing sensitivities to cloud parameters. Thus, accurate measurements of both orthogonal components Ih and Iv (as in GOSAT) are expected to contain more information than measurements of only I, Ih or Iv (as in the case of OCO-2).",

The recent growth in analysis, visualization and mash-up applications that expect data stored in a standardized manner has brought the interoperability issue to the fore. On the other hand, producing interoperable data is often regarded as a sideline task in a typical research team for which resources are not readily available. The HDF Group is developing a software tool aimed at lessening the burden of creating data in standards-compliant, interoperable HDF5 files. The tool, named HDF Product Designer, lowers the threshold needed to design such files by providing a user interface that combines the rich HDF5 feature set with applicable metadata conventions. Users can quickly devise new HDF5 files while at the same time seamlessly incorporating the latest best practices and conventions from their community. That is what the term interoperability in the first mile means: enabling generation of interoperable data in HDF5 files from the onset of their production. The tool also incorporates collaborative features, allowing team approach in the file design, as well as easy transfer of best practices as they are being developed. The current state of the tool and the plans for future development will be presented. Constructive input from interested parties is always welcome.",

            "abstract": "Information about soil moisture is typically required at the field scale. Direct measurements of soil moisture at this scale are not possible, though there are a number of promising indirect methods (e.g. remote sensing methods and cosmic-ray neutrons). Methods for obtaining point scale measurements of soil moisture are well established. However, variability of soil moisture, in both space and time, makes accurately determining field scale soil moisture from point measurements difficult. Understanding sub-field scale variability is a key step in determining how to upscale point measurements, and in particular to identify the minimum number of point measurements necessary to represent field scale mean soil moisture. Objectives of this study are to: (1) examine the spatial variability of soil moisture with time, and (2) compare field scale soil moisture estimation methods. Nested soil moisture measurements provided observations covering a 5002m2 area within a semi-arid prairie pasture site in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. Complementary measurements of the water balance were measured using meteorological and flux instrumentation. Spatial variability of surface and root zone soil moisture were examined using data from gridded dielectric water content probe surveys and a neutron probe array. Field scale surface soil moisture was measured at the site using a cosmic-ray neutron probe. The field scale estimation methods compared are: (1) water balance, (2) upscaling by averaging point scale measurements, (3) upscaling by identification of average representative time stable sites, and (4) extrapolation of shallow soil moisture measured by cosmic-ray neutron probe. Variability of surface soil moisture was found to be smallest under extreme dry and wet conditions, and largest during intermediate moisture conditions. Large spatial variability was found in the root zone, with soil moisture being most temporally variable closer to the surface.",

            "abstract": "Parameterization of the atmospheric surface-layer turbulent fluxes in numerical model through flux-profile relationships has been the focus of significant research for the past 60 or more years. Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST 1954) has been the foundation for describing vertical gradients of mean winds and temperature. Vertical profiles of winds and temperature can be described through integration of these flux-profile relationships dependent on turbulent fluxes of momentum (u*) and heat (H). The turbulent transfer of heat and momentum can be obtained from relationships between the momentum drag coefficient (CM) and heat transfer coefficient (CH) where, CM and CH can be obtained through formulations relating each coefficient to the MOST stability z/L. Typically, relating u*, θ*, and L requires numerical iteration techniques.\nTo avoid this numerical iteration process solving for u*, θ*, and L, schemes have been developed relating the bulk Richardson number (RiB) to the MOST stability parameter z/L. One attraction of these schemes is that RiB can be easily calculated from routine observations. This study presents an evaluation of the relationship between z/L and RiB which incorporates a non-unity value for z0/z0h where z0 is the surface roughness and z0his the temperature surface roughness length. In particular, the utility of the formulation proposed by Li et al (2010) and implemented in WRF V3.6 is demonstrated. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division's (NOAA/ATDD) Summer 2014 Convective Initiation program provided the field measurement framework through which the required observations could be obtained.",

            "abstract": "In the US Cordilleran hinterland, Paleogene terrestrial strata independently constrain relative topography and provide information on the local depositional environment and regional drainage morphology necessary for interpreting stable isotope paleoaltimetry data. Volcanic glass hydration waters from fluvially interbedded ignimbrites record increasing δD values eastward from the paleo-coast, indicating that the region maintained demonstrably higher than modern elevations (3.5 +.7/-.3 km) through the Paleogene. This orogen had a distinct crest and continuous westward-draining slope extending to central California. To the east of this crest, Eocene strata consist of basal fluvial gravel conglomerate ≤ 200 m thick, overlain by interbedded fine-grained lacustrine strata up to 1 km thick, which record hydrologic closure. Conglomerates and sandstones display structures indicative of deposition primarily in gravel-bed braided rivers. Overlying interbedded laminated marl, siltstone, and carbonaceous mudstone containing abundant fossil flora, gastropods, and ostracods indicate a deep freshwater lacustrine depositional environment. Up section, alternating laminated kerogen-rich marl and calcareous mudstone, mud-cracked siltstone, stromatolites, and an absence of bioturbation record anoxic, saline bottom waters and fluctuating profundal to evaporative conditions. Tephras interbedded with lake strata have highly enriched δD values due to hydration by evaporative lake waters, supporting the interpretations that depositional environment controls δD values and that fully hydrated glass resists alteration on geologic timescales. Eocene stratigraphy indicates increased accommodation, continental drainage ponding, and basin closure. It is unlikely that local geomorphic damming provided the regionally extensive driver to create these deep, high elevation closed basins. Instead, migrating regional construction of topographic barriers resulting from the onset of extension and/or broad dynamic and thermal uplift associated with Farallon slab rollback likely drove basin formation. Late Oligocene δD values from fluvially interbedded tephras suggest < 500-900 m of uplift following rollback, while stratigraphy indicates a coincident westward shift in the locus of deposition.",

            "abstract": "Land use distribution are usually obtained by automatic processing of satellite and airborne pictures. The complexity of the obtained patterns which are furthermore scale dependent is enhanced in urban environment. This scale dependency is even more visible in a rasterized representation where only a unique class is affected to each pixel. A parameter commonly analysed in urban hydrology is the coefficient of imperviousness, which reflects the proportion of rainfall that will be immediately active in the catchment response. This coefficient is strongly scale dependent with a rasterized representation. This complex behaviour is well grasped with the help of the scale invariant notion of fractal dimension which enables to quantify the space occupied by a geometrical set (here the impervious areas) not only at a single scale but across all scales. This fractal dimension is also compared to the ones computed on the representation of the catchments with the help of operational semi-distributed models. Fractal dimensions of the corresponding sewer systems are also computed and compared with values found in the literature for natural river networks.\nThis methodology is tested on 7 pilot sites of the European NWE Interreg IV RainGain project located in France, Belgium, Netherlands, United-Kingdom and Portugal. Results are compared between all the case study which exhibit different physical features (slope, level of urbanisation, population density...).",

            "abstract": "The chemical and isotopic composition of the Earth is rationally understood within the context of the chondritic reference frame, without recourse to hidden reservoirs, collision erosion, or strict interpretation of an enstatite chondrite model. Challenges to interpreting the array of recent and disparate chemical and isotopic observations from meteorites need to be understood as rich data harvests that inform us of the compositional heterogeneity in the early solar system. Our ability to resolve small, significant compositional differences between chondrite families provide critical insights into integrated compositional signatures at differing annuli distances from the Sun (i.e., 1-6 AU). Rigorous evaluation of chondritic models for planets requires treatment of both statistical and systematic uncertainties – to date these efforts are uncommonly practiced.\nPlanetary olivine to pyroxene ratio reflects fO2 and temperature potentials in the nebular, given possible ISM compositional conditions; thus this ratio is a non-unique parameter of terrestrial bodies. Consequently the Mg/Si value of a planet (ie., olivine to pyroxene ratio) is a free variable; there is no singular chondritic Mg/Si value. For the Earth, there is an absence of physical and chemical evidence requiring a major element, chemical distinction between the upper and lower mantle, within uncertainties. Early Earth differentiation likely occurred, but there is an absence of chemical and isotopic evidence of its imprint. Chondrites, peridotites, komatiites, and basalts (ancient and modern) reveal a coherent picture of a chondritic compositional Earth, with compositionally affinities to enstatite chondrites. At present results from geoneutrino studies non-uniquely support these conclusions. Future experiments can provide true transformative insights into the Earth’s thermal budget, define compositional BSE models, and will restrict discussions on Earth dynamics and its thermal evolution.",

            "abstract": "Graduate students at Michigan Technological University developed the “Landslides!” activity to engage middle & high school students participating in summer engineering programs in a hands-on exploration of geologic engineering and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) principles. The inquiry-based lesson plan is aligned to Next Generation Science Standards and is appropriate for 6th-12th grade classrooms. During the activity students focus on the factors contributing to landslide development and engineering practices used to mitigate hazards of slope stability hazards. Students begin by comparing different soil types and by developing predictions of how sediment type may contribute to differences in slope stability. Working in groups, students then build tabletop hill-slope models from the various materials in order to engage in evidence-based reasoning and test their predictions by adding groundwater until each group’s modeled slope fails. Lastly students elaborate on their understanding of landslides by designing ‘engineering solutions’ to mitigate the hazards observed in each model. Post-evaluations from students demonstrate that they enjoyed the hands-on nature of the activity and the application of engineering principles to mitigate a modeled natural hazard. ",

An improved understanding of how ecosystems recover after fire is necessary so that land managers can plan for and mitigate the effects of these disturbances. Although several studies have attempted to link fire intensity with severity, direct links between spectral indices of severity and key physiological changes in vegetation are not well understood. We conducted an assessment of how two western conifer species respond to four fire radiative energy treatments, with spectra acquired pre- and up to a month post-burn. After transforming the spectral data into Landsat 8 equivalent reflectance, burn severity indices commonly used in the remote sensing community were compared to concurrent physiological measurements including gas exchange and photosynthetic rate. Preliminary results indicate significant relationships between several fire severity indices and physiological responses measured in the conifer seedlings.",

            "abstract": "Water availability often limits crop production, even in relatively humid climates, and crops vary in their water demand and water use efficiency. Crop production for biofuel (ethanol or biodiesel) offers an alternative to fossil energy sources but requires large amounts of land, and is therefore a more viable option if such crops could be produced on marginal lands that often have soils of poor water-holding capacity. The selection of an appropriate crop requires information on its water demand, water use efficiency, and drought tolerance, but such information is incompletely available for the suite of cellulosic biofuel crops currently under consideration. This study analyzed soil moisture profiles (time-domain reflectometry) to estimate evapotranspiration and water use efficiency of three leading candidate crops for cellulosic bioenergy production (switchgrass, Miscanthus, and maize) grown in a relatively humid climate (Midwestern United States) over four years (2010-13). These field observations of water use by these annual and perennial crops reveal their water use efficiency for biomass and biofuel production. Total growing season water use was remarkably consistent among crops and across years of varying soil water availability, including very favorable precipitation years as well as a drought year (2012). Water use efficiency was more variable and, for maize, depends on whether the maize serves for both grain and cellulosic biofuel production.",

Are they captured asteroids, detritus from Mars’ formation, or reaccreted impact ejecta from Mars? Using only orbital measurements, the Phobos ANd Deimos ORigin Assessment (PANDORA) Mission being proposed to the 2014 NASA Discovery AO, plans to measure the elemental make-up of both moons and create high-resolution global maps of composition and surface morphology and structure. In particular, PANDORA would investigate the characteristics and distribution of the “red” and “blue” units prominent on Phobos, with the goal of identifying which units represent original material or which may be exogenic contamination. PANDORA will compare the composition of Phobos and Deimos to determine if they have a common origin. After identifying appropriate material representative of their bulk composition, careful analysis of the mineralogical and elemental composition of this material would allow us to discriminate between the formation hypotheses for each Moon.

            "abstract": "Although a number of very effective P-wave automatic pickers have been developed over the years, automatic picking of S waves has remained more challenging. Most automatic pickers take a parametric approach, whereby some characteristic function (CF), e.g. polarization or kurtosis, is determined from the data and the pick is estimated from the CF. We have adopted a nonparametric approach, estimating the pick directly from the waveforms. For a particular waveform to be auto-picked, the method uses a combination of similarity to a set of seismograms with known S-wave arrivals and dissimilarity to a set of seismograms that do not contain S-wave arrivals. Significant effort has been made towards dealing with the problem of S-to-P conversions.\nWe have evaluated the effectiveness of our method by testing it on multiple sets of microearthquake seismograms with well-determined S-wave arrivals for several areas around the world, including fault zones and volcanic regions. In general, we find that the results from our auto-picker are consistent with reviewed analyst picks 90% of the time at the 0.2 s level and 80% of the time at the 0.1 s level, or better. For most of the large datasets we have analyzed, our auto-picker also makes far more S-wave picks than were made previously by analysts. We are using these enlarged sets of high-quality S-wave picks to refine tomographic inversions for these areas, resulting in substantial improvement in the quality of the S-wave images. We will show examples from New Zealand, Hawaii, and California.",

            "abstract": "The Northeastern United States (NE) relies heavily on thermoelectric power plants (90% of total capacity) to provide electricity to more than 70 million people. This region’s power plants require consistent, large volumes of water at sufficiently cold temperatures to generate electricity efficiently, and withdraw approximately 10.5 trillion gallons of water annually. Previous findings indicate that assessments of future electricity pathways must account for water availability, water temperature and the changing climate, as changes in these conditions may limit operational efficiency in the future. To account for such electric system vulnerabilities, we have created a link between an electricity system capacity expansion model (ReEDS) and a hydrologic model that is coupled to a power plant simulation model (FrAMES-TP2M) that allows for a new approach to analyze electricity system development, performance, and environmental impacts. Together, these coupled tools allow us to estimate electricity development and operations in the context of a changing climate and impacts on the seasonal spatial and temporal variability of water resources, downstream thermal effluents that cause plant-to-plant interferences and harm aquatic habitat, economic costs of water conservation methods and associated carbon emissions. In this study, we test and compare a business-as-usual strategy with three alternative water management scenarios that include changes in cooling technologies and water sources utilized for the years 2014-2050. Results of these experiments can provide useful insight into the feasibility of the electricity expansion scenarios in terms of associated water use and thermal impacts, carbon emissions, the cost of generating electricity, and also highlight the importance of accounting for water resources in future power sector planning and performance assessments.",

Deglaciation at 11.5 ka began with shallow pond deposition, reflecting regional warmth with the pioneers Alnus crispa subsp. sinuata, Salix, and ferns colonizing the fresh, mineral soils on the landscape. Continued early Holocene warming/melting of glaciers led to the foundation species Alnus dominance and peatland formation, surrounded by shrubs such as Rubus spectabilis, Sambucus racemosa, and wetland species such as Myrica gale and Potentilla palustris. As Sphagnum peat accumulated, the highest rates of carbon accumulation for a few centuries are represented at 50 g/m2/a, similar to short-term very high rates in the early Holocene throughout the circumboreal region but varying within the early Holocene due to development of local wet, bryophytic environments. A shift to sedge peat regionally along the South-Central Alaskan coast 7.6 – 3.7 ka is paralleled by a more evaporative, drier climate with Rhododendron groenlandicum presence, lower carbon accumulation (13 g/m2/a), and minimal macrofossil preservation, which is paralleled regionally in coastal muskegs both to the northwest and southeast and by a hiatus in a nearby lake record. A cooler, moister climate is evident in Corser Bog with the shift to Sphagnum peat at 3.7 ka, regional shifts from sedge to Sphagnum peat throughout the entire coastline from Yakutat to Girdwood, AK and the demonstration of glacial advances in the region. Alnus pollen markedly increases to 60% in the uppermost sample, indicative of a major signal for glacial recession in this region.",

            "abstract": "The efficient simulation of multi-phase multi-component flow through geologic porous media is challenging and computationally intensive, yet quantitative modeling of these processes is essential in engineering and the geosciences. Multiphase flow with phase change and complex phase behavior arises in numerous applications, including enhanced oil recovery, steam injection in groundwater remediation, geologic CO2 storage and enhanced geothermal energy systems. A challenge of multiphase compositional simulation is that the number of existing phases varies with position and time, and thus the number of state variables in the saturation-based conservation laws is a function of space and time. The tasks of phase-state identification and determination of the composition of the different phases are performed assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium.\nHere we investigate a thermodynamically consistent formulation for non-isothermal two-phase flow, in systems where the hypothesis of instantaneous local equilibrium does not hold. Non-equilibrium effects are important in coarse-scale simulations where the assumption of complete mixing in each gridblock is not realistic. We apply our model to steam injection in water-saturated porous media.",

            "abstract": "Headwater streams are known for playing a key role in sustaining hydrological connectivity between uplands, riparian areas and streams, and eventually structuring ecosystems up to the regional scale. In this context, connectivity stands out as a natural backbone onto which a multitude of heterogeneous sub-scale processes, functions or habitats map. However, hillslope connectivity to streams is modulated by riparian zones. Consequently, there is a pressing need to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of connectivity between uplands and valley bottoms.\nHere, we present new work that shows how diatoms can be used to increase our understanding of hydrological (water sources and flowpaths) and ecological (dynamics of terrestrial diatoms) connectivity and functioning of watersheds. We examine hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) systems across nested catchments in the Attert River basin (Luxembourg). Our main objective is to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of saturated areas, the onset/cessation of their connectedness, and eventually their contribution to the storm hydrographs via rapid flowpaths.\nOur results show that during storm events, terrestrial diatoms are systematically mobilized and flushed into the streams. Catchments exhibit specific diatom assemblages that are largely controlled by prevailing physiogeographic characteristics (e.g. geology, land cover, soil types, soil moisture, etc.) and that are different from the benthic and planktic diatom assemblages found in streamwater. Drift diatom assemblages in streamflow determined at the Attert basin outlet during storm hydrographs bear the distinct signatures of upstream catchments – eventually translating the onset and cessation of rapid flowpaths connectivity throughout the river network. The large heterogeneity in terrestrial diatom communities within the HRS continuum, their flushing to the stream, as well as the distinct diatom assemblages characterising catchments with specific physiographic characteristics demonstrate the potential for this microscopic biological tracer to address questions of hydrological connectivity.",

            "abstract": "Disturbance plays a critical role in shaping the structure and function of forested ecosystems as well as the ecosystem services they provide, including but not limited to: carbon storage, biodiversity habitat, water quality and flow, and land atmosphere exchanges of energy and water. As recent studies highlight novel disturbance regimes resulting from pollution, invasive pests and climate change, there is a need to include these alterations in predictions of future forest function and structure. The Ecosystem Demography (ED) model is a mechanistic model of forest ecosystem dynamics in which individual-based forest dynamics can be efficiently implemented over regional to global scales due to advanced scaling methods. We utilize ED to characterize the sensitivity of potential vegetation structure and function to changes in rates of density independent mortality. Disturbance rate within ED can either be altered directly or through the development of sub-models. Disturbance sub-models in ED currently include fire, land use and hurricanes. We use a tiered approach to understand the sensitivity of North American ecosystems to changes in background density independent mortality. Our first analyses were conducted at half-degree spatial resolution with a constant rate of disturbance in space and time, which was altered between runs. Annual climate was held constant at the site level and the land use and fire sub-models were turned off. Results showed an ~ 30% increase in non-forest area across the US when disturbance rates were changed from 0.6% a year to 1.2% a year and a more than 3.5 fold increase in non-forest area when disturbance rates doubled again from 1.2% to 2.4%. Continued runs altered natural background disturbance rates with the existing fire and hurricane sub models turned on as well as historic and future land use. By quantify differences between model outputs that characterize ecosystem structure and function related to the carbon cycle across the US, we are identifying areas and characteristics that display higher sensitivities to change in disturbance rates.",

This effect is an important component of global tropospheric chemistry-climate interaction, and its understanding is thus essential for predicting the feedback of climate change on tropospheric chemistry. Our previous studies showed that cloud vertical distributions and optical depths in the meteorological data sets used to drive tropospheric chemistry simulations often vary from model to model, contributing substantially to intermodel discrepancies in key tropospheric oxidants, especially hydroxyl radical (OH), which largely defines the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. While the differing magnitudes of column cloud optical depths explain part of these discrepancies, the differing vertical distribution of clouds plays a more important role. In this study, we evaluate GEOS-Chem/MERRA model clouds and their vertical distributions with CCCM, a unique 3-D cloud data product developed at NASA Langley Research Center merged from multiple A-Train satellite (CERES, CloudSat, CALIPSO, and MODIS) observations. We constrain the model cloud vertical and latitudinal distributions and cloud optical depths with those of CCCM, and quantify the biases in model-estimated direct radiative effect of clouds on photolysis frequencies (J[O1D]and J[NO2]), key tropospheric oxidants (ozone and OH), and related species. This approach can be used in other chemical transport or chemistry-climate models to reduce biases in model-simulated OH.",

For examples, the Yellow River Delta has been retreating since 1990s when its annual sediment load has kept below 300 million tons. The Yangtze River delta kept growing before Three Gorges Dams was operating, and began to be eroded from the year 2003 to 2009, and then prograded locally due to the Deep Water Navigation Project. The Mekong Delta shoreline has also been dynamically changing with the sediment flux variation, eroding from 1989 to 1996 and prograding from 1996 to 2002.

            "abstract": "Inland surface water is essential to terrestrial ecosystems and human civilization. The distribution of surface water in space and its change over time are related to many agricultural, environmental and ecological issues, and are important factors that must be considered in human socioeconomic development. Accurate mapping of surface water is essential for both scientific research and policy-driven applications. Satellite-based remote sensing provides snapshots of Earth’s surface and can be used as the main input for water mapping, especially in large areas. Global water areas have been mapped with coarse resolution remotely sensed data (e.g., the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)). However, most inland rivers and water bodies, as well as their changes, are too small to map at such coarse resolutions. Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) and ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) imagery has a 30m spatial resolution and provides decades of records (~40 years). Since 2008, the opening of the Landsat archive, coupled with relatively lower costs associated with computing and data storage, has made comprehensive study of the dynamic changes of surface water over large even global areas more feasible. Although Landsat images have been used for regional and even global water mapping, the method can hardly be automated due to the difficulties on distinguishing inland surface water with variant degrees of impurities and mixing of soil background with only Landsat data. The spectral similarities to other land cover types, e.g., shadow and glacier remnants, also cause misidentification. We have developed a probabilistic based automatic approach for mapping inland surface water bodies. Landsat surface reflectance in multiple bands, derived water indices, and data from other sources are integrated to maximize the ability of identifying water without human interference. The approach has been implemented with open-source libraries to facilitate processing large amounts of Landsat images on high-performance computing machines. It has been applied to the ~9,000 Landsat scenes of the Global Land Survey (GLS) 2000 data collection to produce a global, 30m resolution inland surface water body data set, which will be made available on the Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) website (http://www.landcover.org).",

            "abstract": "Statistical properties of plasma and magnetic field fluctuations exhibit features linked with the dynamics of the targeted system and sometimes with the physical processes that are at the origin of these fluctuations. Intermittency is sometimes discussed in terms of non-Gaussianity of the Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) of fluctuations for ranges of spatio/temporal scales. Some examples of self-similarity have been however shown for PDFs whose wings are not Gaussian. In this study we discuss intermittency in terms of non-Gaussianity as well as scale dependence of the higher order moments of PDFs, in particular the flatness. We use magnetic field and plasma data from several space missions, in the solar wind (Ulysses, Cluster, and Venus Express), and in the planetary magnetosheaths (Cluster and Venus Express). We analyze Ulysses data that satisfy a consolidated set of selection criteria able to identify \"pure\" fast and slow wind. We investigate Venus Express data close to the orbital apogee, in the solar wind, at 0.72 AU, and in the Venus magnetosheath. We study Cluster data in the solar wind (for time intervals not affected by planetary ions effects), and the magnetosheath. We organize our results in three solar wind data bases (one for the solar maximum, 1999-2001, two for the solar minimum, 1997-1998 and respectively, 2007-2008), and two planetary databases (one for the solar maximum, 2000-2001, that includes PDFs obtained in the terrestrial magnetosphere, and one for the solar minimum, 2007-2008, that includes PDFs obtained in the terrestrial and Venus magnetospheres and magnetosheaths). In addition to investigating the statistical properties of fluctuations for the minimum and maximum of the solar cycle we also analyze the similarities and differences between fast and slow wind. We emphasize the importance of our data survey and analysis in the context of understanding the solar wind turbulence and complexity, and the exploitation of data bases and as a first step towards developing a (virtual) laboratory for studying solar system plasma turbulence and intermittency.\nResearch supported by the European FP7 Programme (grant agreement 313038/STORM), and a grant of the Romanian CNCS –UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-ID-PCE-2012-4-0418.",

Model architectures that attempt to capture these processes and feedbacks in a physically realistic way must be able to bridge spatial scales from meters to kilometers. To represent these processes across continental domains modeling systems must fully embrace high performance computing. Also, because there are both scientific and computational trade-offs in modeling many terrestrial hydrologic and land-atmosphere exchange processes, it is often highly advantageous to support multiple physics options in order to test competing hypotheses and apply scale-appropriate parameterizations for different prediction problems. In this talk we provide an update of new developments to the WRF-Hydro system in meeting these needs from both a process representation and high performance computing perspective. A key feature of these developments centers on new multi-scale modeling capabilities recently added to WRF-Hydro. We will discuss prediction and computational performance metrics for several recent large river basin and continental scale applications of the WRF-Hydro system over the coterminous U.S. and over Mexico in modes both coupled and uncoupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. We will also provide updates on new developments to the WRF-Hydro system in the areas of water management applications and hydrologic data assimilation.",

Constructed during the austral summer seasons between 2003-4 and 2010-11, it searches for very high energy neutrinos produced in some of the most extreme environments in the Universe. In 2013, the first evidence for astrophysical high energy neutrinos was published, and Physics World named IceCube the Physics Breakthrough of the Year. The combination of a new way to explore, the exotic South Pole locale, and science success might lead one to believe that outreach would be trivial. However, we have found that it is difficult to ensure a successful event without involving partners who have connections to the desired audiences. Examples of education and outreach efforts and the lessons learned from the last decade will be discussed.",

A number of studies have shown the human impact on oceanic Pb in many parts of the world ocean, but little Pb data has been available for the Southeast Pacific Ocean.\nIn this presentation, we will show the dissolved Pb (<0.2µm) results from the US GEOTRACES cruise in October – December 2013, which sailed from Manta, Ecuador, to Tahiti along around 12 degrees south. Dissolved Pb concentrations from all 36 surface stations and deep (>1000m) Pb profiles from 18 stations will be presented, and the results will be also compared to our unpublished data from the BiG RAPA cruise in 2010, whose cruise track from Arica, Peru, to Easter Island is slightly south of the US GEOTRACES cruise. The BiG RAPA data showed that dissolved Pb concentrations of the southeast Pacific Ocean are relatively low, varying in the range of 8-20 pmol/kg at the surface with a slight maximum (14-22 pmol/kg) at around 400m depth, and 2-10 pmol/kg in deep waters below 1000m depth. The Pb concentrations were found to be higher at a marginal station off Peru, reaching 45 pmol/kg at the surface and 65 pmol/kg in the subsurface maximum at 150m depth, and varying between 17 and 23 pmol/kg in deep waters.\nOur dataset, along with the results from the BiG RAPA cruise, will provide the first overview on the dissolved Pb distribution of the southeast Pacific Ocean, which will further our understanding on the human impact on the global ocean.",

            "abstract": "Impervious surfaces are land cover features through which water cannot penetrate into the soil. As an indicator of urban land use, impervious surface cover (ISC) is disproportionally important to human beings−although covering only 0.5% of the Earth’s terrestrial surface, cities support over 50% the Earth’s population. The increasing demand for built-up space by a growing urban population has been driving land use change in urban areas worldwide. An increase in ISC can significantly impact the biophysical characteristics of land surface, such as altering the local surface energy balance, or transforming regional hydrological systems. Remotely sensed data is commonly used as the primary data source for extracting impervious surface information for monitoring urban growth, but current studies often lack the sufficient temporal resolution or thematic detail to reveal the long-term, nonlinear development of impervious surfaces over time. In a previous study (Sexton et al. 2013), we created an annual stack of 30-m percent ISC estimates for the Washington DC-Baltimore metropolitan region from 1984 to 2010 by compositing all available Landsat images in the USGS archive. Here we developed a robust time-series method to detect impervious surface change. The method employs a customized logistic function for every pixel to model the continuous process of urban growth. It quantifies the fractional intensity of ISC change at the sub-pixel level and also characterizes the timing and length (in years) of urban development. The new method detects change based on a sequence of observations before, during and after change and thus is highly resistant to random noises. Our results showed that the DC-Baltimore metropolitan region experienced an accelerated growth pathway from the late 1980s to the late 2000s. The majority of urban and sub-urban development occurred at scales finer than the Landsat resolution (30 m), with a region-wide mean intensity of 46% ISC increase. Our study demonstrates the value of the long-term and fine temporal resolution data offered by the Landsat archive, and also highlights the possible limitations of Landsat’s spatial resolution in characterizing continuous urban development.",

            "abstract": "The ecosystem services (ES) approach is increasingly used in research and policy, with the Common International Framework on Ecosystem Services (CICES) “cascade” gaining traction as a framework for conceptualizing the production of ecosystem services by the natural environment, and then people consuming these services and obtaining benefits depending on their values. However, uptake of the ES concept on the ground by ecosystem managers, and understanding by everyday citizens, is still limited. One barrier is the challenge of providing tangible, examples of everyday benefits and values that people can readily connect with the biophysical structures and functions that underlie their provision.\nWinegrowing offers one promising case to illustrate the linkages all along the chain of production and consumption of ecosystem services. The sensitive winegrape has long been known for its properties of terroir, where the taste of wine reflects the environmental conditions of the place where it is grown, a feature valued by consumers. Here the CICES framework is illustrated with the case of winegrowing, demonstrating that the current linear model of natural production and human consumption of ES needs to be modified for this case because people influence each of the five stages by shaping and responding to their environment, producing a two-way interaction between people and the environment throughout.\nFor example, while natural drivers such as climate and soils are key to the provision of the service of winegrape yields, landowners modify the biophysical environment through site selection and growers modify plant ecophysiological function through farming practices such as pruning and irrigation in order to influence the final service. Similarly, winemakers’ expertise is needed to transform the service of winegrape yields into the product of wine that can be enjoyed and valued by consumers, whose preferences shape wine styles as well. This case illustrates how incorporating both natural and human factors all along the chain of production and consumption of ecosystem services can better represent the potential services provided, and highlights the need to identify relevant decisionmakers at each stage to better understand and manage ecosystem services under environmental change.",

            "abstract": "Satellite retrievals (e.g. MODIS) show that the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) is generally high along the US west coast (~300cm-3), while it drops to smaller values further offshore (~50cm-3). The Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model does not explicitly predict CDNC. For instance, the WRF single moment 6-class (WSM6) microphysics scheme uses a physically based auto-conversion scheme with a tunable CDNC. By default, CDNC is set in WSM6 to a constant value. In this study, we investigate the potential benefits of adding a varying CDNC in WSM6. We run two WRF simulations over the northeast Pacific in 2005. In the first, we use a constant CDNC (default value). In the second one, we implement a spatially and seasonally varying CDNC, which is tuned according to the observed climatology from MODIS. In our results, we show that biases in shortwave fluxes are drastically reduced when the varying CDNC is used. We can attribute the better performance of the simulation with a varying CDNC to more accurate quantification of cloud droplet auto-conversion into raindrops. Thus, our study suggests that in order to represent clouds and their radiative effects in the northeast Pacific realistically, it is necessary to implement an auto-conversion scheme that accounts for the variability in CDNC.",

            "abstract": "The search for life on Mars is a cornerstone of international solar system exploration. In 2018, the European Space agency will launch the ExoMars Rover to further this. The key science objectives of the ExoMars Rover are to: 1) search for signs of past and present life on Mars; 2) investigate the water/geochemical environment as a function of depth in the shallow subsurface; and 3) to characterise the surface environment. ExoMars will drill into the sub-surface to look for indicators of past life using a variety of complementary techniques, including assessment of morphology (potential fossil organisms), mineralogy (past environments) and a search for organic molecules and their chirality (biomarkers).\nThe choice of landing site is vital if the objectives are to be met. The landing site must: (i) be ancient (≥3.6 Ga); (ii) show abundant morphological and mineral evidence for long-term, or frequently reoccurring, aqueous activity; (iii) include numerous sedimentary outcrops that (iv) are distributed over the landing region (the typical Rover traverse range is a few km, but ellipse size is ~ 100 by 15 km). Various ‘engineering constraints’ also apply, including: (i) latitude limited to 5º S to 25º N; (ii) maximum altitude of the landing site 2 km below Mars’s datum; and (iii) few steep slopes within the ellipse.\nIn March 2014, the first ExoMars Landing Site Selection Workshop was held, during which about ten different landing sites were presented and discussed. At the end of the workshop a poll of the workshop participants highlighted four sites as highest priority: Mawrth Vallis, Oxia Planum, Oxia Palus and Hypanis Delta. Of these, our team led proposals for the Oxia Palus and Hypanis Delta sites. The Oxia Palus site has since been renamed “Aram Dorsum” – the name the IAU designated to the inverted channel system that is the most prominent feature of the site. This is inferred to be the remnants of a long-lived, widespread alluvial system that was buried and then recently exhumed. The Hypanis site contains layered terminal deposits from the Hypanis and Sabrina Valles and is inferred to be an ancient environment.\nSince the workshop, further mapping and geological studies of these sites have been performed. Here we describe the latest results for these two sites, and why they are appropriate for meeting ExoMars’ goals.",

            "abstract": "A collaborative high-density seismic survey using broadband and short period seismic sensors was conducted March 7 - April 30, 2014 near Sweetwater, TX. The objective of the survey was to use a combination of controlled source shot slices and passive seismic recordings recorded by multiple types of sensors with different bandwidths and sensitivities to image the subsurface. The broadband component of the survey consisted of 25 continuously recording seismic stations comprised of 20 Trillium Compact Posthole sensors from Nanometrics and 5 Polar Trillium 120PHQs from the IRIS/PASSCAL Instrument Center (PIC). The broadband stations also utilized 25 Centaur digitizers from Nanometrics as well as 25 polar quick deploy enclosures from the PIC. The broadband array was designed to maximize horizontal traveling seismic energy for surface wave analysis over the primary target area with sufficient offset for imaging objectives at depth. The short period component of the survey consisted of 2639 receiver locations using Zland nodes from NodalSeismic. The nodes are further divided into 3 sub-arrays: 1) outlier array 2) active source array 3) backbone array. The outlier array consisted of 25 continuously recording nodes distributed around the edge of the survey at a distance of ~5 km from the survey boundary, and provided valuable constraints to passive data analysis techniques at the edge of the survey boundary. The active source patch consisted of densely spaced nodes that were designed to record signals from a Vibroseis source truck for active source reflection processing and imaging. The backbone array consisted of 292 nodes that covered the entirety of the survey area to maximize the value of the passive data analysis. By utilizing continuous recording and smartly designed arrays for measuring local and regional earthquakes we can incorporate velocity information derived from passive data analysis into the active source processing workflow to produce a superior subsurface image. We also expect this data to be extremely valuable to the development of new concepts and techniques associated with large-N style surveys that eliminate spatial aliasing of the recorded wavefield. Furthermore, this dataset is open-source and available to download through the IRIS Data Management Center.",

            "abstract": "Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) is the scientific basis for many engineering and social applications: performance-based design, seismic retrofitting, resilience engineering, insurance-rate setting, disaster preparation, emergency response, and public education. The uncertainties in PSHA predictions can be expressed as an aleatory variability that describes the randomness of the earthquake system, conditional on a system representation, and an epistemic uncertainty that characterizes errors in the system representation. Standard PSHA models use empirical ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) that have a high aleatory variability, primarily because they do not account for the effects of crustal heterogeneities, which scatter seismic wavefields and cause local amplifications in strong ground motions that can exceed an order of magnitude. We show how much this variance can be lowered by simulating seismic wave propagation through 3D crustal models derived from waveform tomography. Our basic analysis tool is the new technique of averaging-based factorization (ABF), which uses a well-specified seismological hierarchy to decompose exactly and uniquely the logarithmic excitation functional into a series of uncorrelated terms that include unbiased averages of the site, path, hypocenter, and source-complexity effects (Feng & Jordan, Bull. Seismol. Soc. Am., 2014, doi:10.1785/0120130263). We apply ABF to characterize the differences in ground motion predictions between the standard GMPEs employed by the National Seismic Hazard Maps and the simulation-based CyberShake hazard model of the Southern California Earthquake Center. The ABF analysis indicates that, at low seismic frequencies (< 1 Hz), CyberShake site and path effects unexplained by the GMPEs account 40-50% of total residual variance. Therefore, accurate earthquake simulations have the potential for reducing the aleatory variance of the strong-motion predictions by about a factor of two, which would lower exceedance probabilities at high hazard levels by more than order of magnitude. Realizing this gain in forecasting probability would have a substantial impact on the prioritization and economic costs of earthquake risk-reduction strategies.",

            "abstract": "The Hydrostratigraphic Drilling Record Assessment (HyDRA) project is a three-year study to develop improved methods for building groundwater flow models from drillers’ logs. Lithologic logs recorded by water well drillers represent a voluminous source of information regarding hydrostratigraphy. However, developing quantitative models from drillers’ logs is challenging due to the idiosyncratic nature of each driller’s approach to describing sediments and lithologies as well as variability in the amount of care invested in the description process. This presentation uses three approaches to assess the consistency and utility of drillers’ logs from 250 wells in the vicinity of a continuously monitored “index” well in the High Plains Aquifer in Thomas County, Kansas. The first assessment procedure will examine logs from wells in the vicinity of the index well to determine whether they show evidence of lateral confinement of a region immediately surrounding the index well, as seems to be indicated by the index well hydrograph. The second will apply a cross-validation procedure to determine the degree of consistency among logs at different wells and identify logs that are most out of keeping with logs at nearby wells. The logs are cast in quantitative terms by first representing the sediment descriptions using 72 standardized lithology terms, further categorizing the standardized lithologies into five hydraulic property categories, and then computing the proportions of the hydraulic property categories over regular ten-foot-intervals in each well. The cross-validation procedure involves using a cross-entropy measure to compare the actual category proportions in each well to those interpolated from neighboring wells. Finally, results of a groundwater flow model using property fields developed from the drillers’ logs will be briefly discussed. Comparisons between observed and simulated water levels at the index well and other continuously and annually monitored wells in the area serve as a basis for assessing the utility of the drillers’ logs in development of groundwater flow models.",

            "abstract": "The National Weather Service (NWS) Office of Hydrologic Development (OHD) has developed a distributed hydrologic model which incorporates the concept of threshold frequency (TF). The TF represents flood flows for each grid translated to their equivalent flood frequency, or recurrence interval. It is intended to provide a more understandable representation of the criticality of the flows in terms that forecasters and the general public can better understand. The OHD has developed procedures for estimating the TF values which involve long term simulations of surface runoff using gridded precipitation data sets. This approach requires extensive data compilation and computer processing which can be difficult and time consuming.\nThis study addresses a quick way to derive the gridded TF estimates using the US Geological Survey (USGS) flood frequency estimation approach based on regional regression analysis of basin characteristics (Gotvald et al 2012). The USGS approach used generalized least squares regression to develop a set of equations for estimating flows with 50-, 20-, 10-, 4-, 2-, 1-, 0.5-, and 0.2-percent annual exceedance probabilities for ungaged basins in California. These equations for the North Coast region of California were applied to each grid of the RDHM model, each of which has a drainage area and mean annual precipitation value. Simulated flows for each grid output from the RDHM for a moderate flood event in December 2012 were then translated to the corresponding flow frequency to generate a time series of TF for the event. The approach applied is considered a feasible and efficient way to generate the TF values for any location where the USGS regression analyses have been developed.",

This necessity ---- similar need for climate models with different resolutions ---- poses a great challenge because all of these processes tend to be scale-dependent in ambient clouds, a topic poorly understood and studied itself. This work aims to understand the scale-dependence of these processes/properties from both observational and theoretical perspectives, and to explore the potentials for developing scale-dependent parameterizations. We will examine the dependence of entrainment-mixing mechanisms and microphysical properties on the averaging scale in clouds using data collected during the RACORO and other field campaigns. A new measure is introduced to quantify the entrainment-mixing processes. The relationships between the entrainment-mixing measure and microphysical properties and their scale dependence will be examined as well. We will also seek to connect the observational phenomenology to the systems theory on droplet size distributions, to explore ways to parameterize the scale-dependence for models of various resolutions, and to test with atmospheric models.",

            "abstract": "The planimetric shape of an individual landslide area is controlled by factors such as terrain morphology, material involved and speed, with landslide shapes varying in total area (AL), type of shape, and their length-to-width (L/W) ratios. Here, we abstract landslide shapes to ellipses, and examine how the corresponding L/W ratios vary as a function of AL in two substantially complete triggered landslide inventories: (i) 11,111 landslides triggered by the 1994 (M = 6.7) Northridge Earthquake, USA (ii) 9,594 landslides triggered by heavy rain during the 1998 Hurricane Mitch in Guatemala. For each landslide, an ellipse with equivalent area (AL) and perimeter (PL) of the original shape was created and a non-dimensional value of the ratio of the ellipse length-to-width (L/W) then calculated. Using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, the statistical distribution of landslide L/W ratio values were then considered for ten landslide area (AL in m2) categories: 0–99, 100–199, 200–399, 400–799, 800–1599, 1600–3199, 3200–6399, 6400–12,799, 12,800–25,600, and ≥25,600 m2. We find that for each of the landslide area categories considered separately, the probability density function p(L/W) as a function of (L/W) approximately follows a three-parameter inverse gamma distribution, which has a power-law decay for medium and large L/W values and exponential rollover for small L/W values. The ‘rollover’ value where p(L/W) is at its maximum, tends to increase with increasing AL category, from approximately L/W = 1.7 for landslides in the smallest AL category (0 < AL < 99 m2), to L/W = 7.5 for landslides in the largest AL category (AL ≥25,600 m2). Broadly, this suggests that as AL increases, L/W increases, i.e. as landslide areas increase, the probability of observing a more elongated shape increases. There is generally good agreement between the two inventories’ statistical distributions in spite of differences in location, triggering mechanism and geology. This work will aid in stochastic modelling of triggered landslide event inventories, where it may not be feasible to deterministically define each landside shape. Using these trends, landslide shape can be approximated as an ellipse, and the length to width ratio of that ellipse selected from a general statistical distribution.",

            "abstract": "The Metropolitan Tracer Experiment (METREX) was conducted throughout 1984 over the Washington DC area and consisted of hundreds of passive tracer releases with air samples collected at many downwind locations. The experiment included intensive 4-hour tracer releases conducted once per month starting in April of 1984. We simulate several of these intensive releases that had good air sampling coverage using the HYSPLIT Lagrangian particle dispersion model driven by meteorological fields generated by WRF on grids as fine as 1 km and utilizing an urban canopy model (UCM) to parameterize the bulk impacts of buildings within the DC urban airshed. Results indicate that 1 km meteorology generated with the UCM dramatically improve the dispersion simulation compared to those using coarser meteorological inputs generated without the UCM for the November 8th intensive release. This improvement is due to better representation of the vertical mixing at night in WRF. However, for other cases the impact of resolution and the UCM is not as significant as the dispersion was influenced by other factors. We also investigate the sensitivity of the dispersion calculations to the topographic wind speed correction available in WRF 3.6 and several WRF planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations.",

            "abstract": "Isotope-based hydroclimate records from the mid-continental United States that span the late Holocene with sub-decadal resolution are rare. As a result, the relationship between temperature and hydroclimate for this region is not well constrained. Pollen-based temperature reconstructions from North America suggest that the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 650 to 1050 CE) was warmer than the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1550 to 1850 CE), but that both were cooler than the current warm period (CWP; last 100 years). It has further been suggested that much of the mid-continental US experienced drought during the MCA and pluvial conditions during the LIA. This is supported by modern correlations between seasonal temperatures and precipitation, which are anti-correlated for much of the Midwest; however, for portions of the continental core, which includes the study region, the opposite relationship exists between temperature and precipitation (i.e., warmer is wetter and colder is drier). Within the context of this and previous paleoclimate work in the Midwest, including at Pretty Lake, we present initial geochronology, sedimentology and oxygen isotopic results from a new 12 m composite core from Pretty Lake, a 25 m deep kettle lake in LaGrange County, northeastern Indiana. Here we focus on the last 2000 years of the 16,000-year record in order to explore hydroclimate variability in response to temperature anomalies during the MCA and LIA. Pretty Lake is well suited for this type of investigation because the closed surface hydrology of the lake basin renders it sensitive to evaporation. This is reflected in oxygen isotope (δ18O) measurements of surface waters from the lake, which show that it is approximately 4‰ higher than meteoric precipitation and the surface waters of nearby, hydrologically-open Martin Lake. High-resolution down core δ18O measurements, therefore hold tremendous potential for reconstructing regional hydroclimate during the last 2000 years, particularly when combined with isotopic records of local precipitation and modeling approaches.",

            "abstract": "The exposure of serpentinite to CO2-rich fluids leads to a sequence of carbonation reactions involving the formation of soapstone and listvenite. Since CO2-rich springs, serpentinite, and listvenite outcrops co-occur along the San Andreas Fault between Cholame Valley and San Juan Bautista, we hypothesize that this sequence explains both the high creeping rates and frequent micro-earthquakes along this section. To test this hypothesis we studied the frictional behaviors of powdered magnesite and mineral assemblages representative of soapstone (magnesite:talc = 1:1, 1:9, and 9:1 by weight) and listvenite (magnesite:quartz = 1:1), and their implications for fault stability, in a suite of experiments using a rotary-shear apparatus. Dry powders were sheared between sandstone forcing blocks at a normal stress of 60 MPa, and subjected to order-of-magnitude step changes in slip rate in the range of 0.1 to 10 μm/s, over sliding displacements of 0.15-0.5 m.\nExperiments on magnesite reveal velocity-strengthening friction at all sliding displacements up to ~200 mm. Intriguingly, mixtures of magnesite and talc reveal an evolution of frictional behavior, from velocity-strengthening friction at the onset of sliding, to velocity-weakening friction and subsequently to velocity-neutral behavior with increasing slip. The transition to velocity-weakening friction is unexpected, given the velocity-strengthening behavior of end-member powders (talc, V. Scruggs, unpubl.). We also observe that magnesite:talc mixtures yield peak values of the friction coefficient µ ≥0.8, well in excess of values of µ for magnesite, ~0.6, and talc, <<0.4 (Moore and Lockner, 2007). Tests on the quartz-magnesite mixture reveal a transition from velocity-strengthening to velocity-weakening friction over a displacement of ~100 mm, followed by a transition to velocity-strengthening behavior at larger displacements. This behavior contrasts with that of pure quartz gouge, which exhibits velocity-weakening friction over the entire displacement range, following the initial velocity-strengthening behavior at the onset of sliding (D. Goldsby, unpubl.). The friction data suggest that for sufficiently mature slip zones comprised of the mineral assemblages tested to date, sliding would be intrinsically stable.",

            "abstract": "The simulation of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) remains a significant challenge in climate models. The primary difficulty lies in relating MJO skill to parameterized physical processes - the main access point for model development. One theory of the MJO relies on scale-interactions from small to large scales. The expectation is that GCMs should reproduce the correct relationships at the smallest resolved scales and this will translate through increasing scales and lead to a skillful simulation of the MJO. So-called 'process-based' diagnostics have recently been applied to simple model fields in order to relate accurate simulation of the MJO to accurate, small-scale process-level relationships (Kim et al., 2014). In this presentation we will take this technique further to provide greater insight into how the underlying physical parameterizations in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) conspire to provide the process-level responses in the model, particularly as it relates to precipitation and humidity dependent processes. This provides the potential for a range of dependencies between parameterization tendencies and MJO skill. Furthermore, these dependencies are examined to quantify the effect of model biases. This entails performing the same process-level analysis on simply initialized and nudged CAM simulations that make use of YOTC analysis. These techniques enable diagnosis of the relationship between degrading model simulation (basic state and MJO) and changes in the parameterized response at the process level. In summary, this talk will show the most promising relationships between MJO simulation performance and the fidelity with which the parameterized physics produce observed process-scale relationships.",

Greater amounts of 230Th are contained in fine grained particles, which, if fractionated from coarser grained counterparts may lead to biasing of 230Th-derived mass accumulation rates (MARs) and sediment focusing factors. We examined sediments that span the past 25 kyr from four new sediment cores retrieved from two different localities close to the ridges that bound the Panama Basin. Each locality contained paired sites that were seismically interpreted to have undergone sediment redistribution, i.e., thick focused sites versus thin winnowed sites. Two sediment cores were retrieved from the northern part of the Panama basin, Cocos Ridge, (MV1014-01-“4JC”, 5° 44.7’N 85° 45.5’ W, 1730 m depth; MV1014-01-“8JC”, 6° 14.0’N 86° 2.6’ W, 1993 m depth), and two were retrieved from the southern part of the basin, Carnegie Ridge, (MV1014-02-“11JC”, 0° 41.6’S 85° 20.0’ W, 2452 m depth; MV1014-02-“17JC” 0° 10.8’S 85° 52.0’ W, 2846 m depth). Cores 4JC and 11JC lie closer to the ridge tops of the Cocos and Carnegie Ridges, respectively, and have thin sediment drapes, while deeper cores, 8JC (Cocos) and 17JC (Carnegie), have thicker sediment drapes and lie downslope from the ridge top cores. Age-model-derived sand MARs, which likely represent the vertical rain of particles that cannot be transported by bottom currents, are similar at each of the paired sites in Holocene and glacial time slices. However, 230Th-normalized MARs are about 50% lower, on average at each of the paired sites during the same time slices. Both Holocene and glacial samples from “thin” cores (4,11JC) contain, surprisingly, significant amounts (up to 50%) of the 230Th within the coarse grained (>63 μm) fraction which makes up 40-70% of the bulk samples analyzed. On the contrary, Holocene and glacial samples from “thick” cores, (8,17JC), contain the greatest amounts of 230Th (up to 49%) in the finest grain-sized fraction (<4μm), which makes up 26-40% of the bulk samples analyzed. Although, redistribution of sediment has taken place, our analysis indicates that 230Th-derived focusing factors are being overestimated at thick sites and underestimated at thin sites.",

            "abstract": "This study explores possibility for seamless seasonal to decadal prediction of surface air temperature (TAS), El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) using decadal hindcast/prediction experiments of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). Long-lead prediction skill is evaluated by computing the anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) and mean squared skill score (MSSS) of multi-model ensemble with respect to the observations and reanalysis data over the period of 1981-2012. The MSSS of global-mean TAS shows a prediction skill for a lead time of up to one year. This is much shorter than the one estimated from the ACC, indicating that the predicted global-mean TAS has a significant conditional bias. It is also found that prediction skill is highly sensitive to the season considered. The lowest prediction skill is found during the boreal winter when the long-term trend and inter-annual variability of TAS are not well reproduced especially over the Eurasian continent. This contrasts to the enhanced prediction skill over the oceans for a year. In most models, wintertime ENSO index is predictable at least one year in advance. Both PDO and AMO indices are also highly predictable on decadal time scales. Although their prediction skills vary in seasons, prediction lead time is still up to 6 years for PDO index and 9 years for AMO index in cold seasons. This result suggests that the two dominant low-frequency climate variabilities in the Northern Hemisphere are predictable on decadal time scales at least in their signs. With this finding, it is predicted by the CMIP5 decadal prediction experiments initialized in 2009 that the PDO and AMO will stay in their present phases for the next few years.",

            "abstract": "Research suggests that broad-scale increases in temperature facilitated an abrupt initiation of upper treeline advance beginning in the 1950s at climatic treelines throughout a large portion of the southern and central Rocky Mountains. Despite this regional trend, patterns of finer scale variability often imply the likely influence of both wind-snow interactions and temperature on driving regeneration dynamics in these climatically-sensitive ecotones. This is particularly true for mountain ranges subject to consistently strong winds, such as the Medicine Bow Mountains of southeast Wyoming. A rich history of treeline work exists for this area, yet questions remain regarding how influential wind and snowpack variability are in governing climate-vegetation interactions within upper treeline ecotones and whether this varies according to the level of wind exposure. Here we present a coupled examination using dendroecology and remote sensing to test the hypothesis that sufficient snow cover is required in order for the ecological manifestation of increasing temperatures to appear at upper treeline; namely treeline advance. We used dendroecological methods to reconstruct the history of colonization on the two highest peaks in the range (Medicine Bow Peak Massif and Kannaday Peak). We sampled a total of six sites by placing nested-belt transects on two south-facing and one north-facing site for each peak. To gauge the influence of wind-snow interactions at each site, we analyzed remotely-sensed images. We selected three sets of LANDSAT images for each mountain peak based on years with maximum, minimum, and mean snowfall conditions to capture the entire range of variability. Results demonstrate that snow cover can be a critical modifier of treeline advance, especially on wind-exposed slopes and on mountain peaks with a relatively dry hydroclimatology, where a protective snow layer is only evident during high snow years. Overall, this research suggests that the role of wind-snow interactions in mediating upper treeline advance is contingent on local hydroclimatology and that future changes in these environments will most likely be driven by changes in both temperature and snowpack conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Superior Province Rifting Earthscope Experiment (SPREE) completed its field recording phase last fall with over 96% data return. While 60% of the stations returned data 100% of the time, only 9 performed below 90% and one station had questionable timing. One station was vandalized, another stolen. One station continued recording after its solar panels were pierced by a bullet, while another two stations survived a wildfire and a blow-down, respectively. The blow-down was an extreme wind event that felled hundreds of thousands of trees around the station. SPREE stations recorded many hundreds of earthquakes. Two regional earthquakes and over 400 teleseismic earthquakes had magnitudes over 5.5 and three, smaller local earthquakes had magnitudes over 2.5.\nWe have calculated power spectral estimates between 0.1-1000 s period for the ~2.5-year lifespan of all 82 SPREE stations. Vertical channels performed quite well across the entire frequency range, falling well below the high noise model of Peterson (1993) and usually within 10-15 dB of nearby Transportable Array stations.\nSPREE stations' horizontal components suffer from long-period (> 30 s) noise. This noise is quietest at night and becomes up to 30 dB noisier during the day in the summer months. We explore possible causes of this variation, including thermal and atmospheric pressure effects. One possibility is that stations are insulated by snow during the winter, reducing temperature variations within the vault. Spring snowmelt creates instability at many of the SPREE stations, evidenced by frequent recenterings and enhanced long-period noise.\nFor all channels, power in the microseismic band (4-16 s) is strongest in the winter, corresponding to storm season in the Northern Hemisphere, and approximately 20 dB weaker during the summer. The power spectrum and temporal variation of microseismic energy is consistent across the entire SPREE array.",

            "abstract": "Traditional transect-based methodology for determining hydraulic geometry relationships depends on a complex set of opaque fieldwork and computational decisions that sometimes go unexplained. The fields of river hydraulics and fluvial geomorphology are in the midst of a transformation from considering limited cross-sectional data to using an abundance of spatially explicit data. Hydraulic geometry is one of the classic tools of fluvial geomorphology that is ripe for re-envisioning so it can continue to be useful in the spatially explicit era. This study developed a new method for analyzing discharge-dependent hydraulics coined “hydraulic topography” that not only increases the accuracy of the tool, but also should eliminate several sample- and assumption-based inconsistencies from traditional hydraulic geometry analysis. Hydraulic topography relied on detailed, near-census river surveying and served as the standard by which to assess cross sectional methods. Both hydraulic topography and uniformly spaced cross sectional hydraulic geometry sample approaches were applied to a series of high resolution 2D hydrodynamic simulations of the gravel-cobble bed lower Yuba River- their associated results were analyzed. More specifically, the power functions fit to discharge-dependent average width, depth, and velocity for three spatial scales were visually inspected and their corresponding exponents and coefficients were compared. Average cross sectional hydraulics at the segment scale spanned up to 1.5 orders of magnitude for a given discharge. Transect-determined rates of reach scale depth and velocity increase with changing discharge were consistently over- and underestimated, respectively, relative to the near-census benchmark. Both methods showed that relative to riffles, pools had lower velocities at low discharges but a higher rate of velocity increase with increased flows. Overall, 73 percent of cross sectional power regression parameters assessed fell between 10 and 50 absolute percent error with respect to the spatially explicit hydraulic topography approach. Although traditional transect-based sampling may be viable for certain uses, percent errors of this magnitude could still compromise engineering applications in river management and training works.",

            "abstract": "Recent paleoclimate proxy records, particularly cave and lake records, have reconstructed the precipitation changes in past. It was generally believed that such records from East to Southeast Asia reflected local precipitation, which is closely associated to summer monsoon strength. In present day meteorology, the mid-to-late July summer monsoon onset is associated with the northward shift of the Western North Pacific high pressure controlled by the thermal gradient between Asian continent and Pacific Ocean that closely linked to seasonal insolation heating. The concept of insolation control over monsoonal circulation was well accepted in the paleoclimate community. However, the dynamical adjustment of insolation driven large-scale circulation changes have yet to be discussed in further detail for the Western North Pacific region.\nIn this study we explore the impact of insolation on large-scale atmospheric circulation changes using idealized numerical model simulations and data from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase III (PMIP3). We findthat the orbital forcing had a significant influence on the Western North Pacific summer monsoon. The Western North Pacific monsoon trough was weaker in the early-to-mid-Holocene when at precession maximum; the strength of South Asia and East Asia monsoon undergoes anti-phasing changes. The insolation driven monsoonal precipitation change, however, is not spatially uniform. For example, precession maximum was found to be associated with enhanced precipitation over the Himalayas and East Asia but not Southwestern Asia. Our results may provide information for interpreting regional paleoclimate records.",

            "abstract": "Light use efficiency (LUE) models are used to estimate gross and net primary production (GPP, NPP). Earlier approaches have used one or more of the following factors impacting LUE to model GPP: (i) light climate, (ii) temperature, (iii) water stress, and (iv) phenology. In this study we seek to incorporate all four inputs as scalars for up- or down-regulating LUE in a daily GPP model. Traditional methods using satellite data are limited by cloudy conditions and revisit times. They require the use of interpolation to achieve daily estimates of GPP. Some parameters can vary greatly within a few days (i.e. light climate, temperature) and thus, reduce the accuracy of interpolations between scenes. Alternatively, methods that can combine spatially interpolated gridded meteorological and satellite data for parameters that change over the course of days to weeks (i.e. phenology) provide the best opportunity for a continuous daily estimate of GPP. This study seeks to develop the framework for such a model. Three Nebraska AmeriFlux sites between 2001 and 2012 (maize: 26 field-years; soybean: 10 field-years) were used to develop and validate a daily GPP model based on ground measurements of incoming photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and leaf area index. This model was calibrated using eddy covariance data from 2001 to 2008 (RMSE = 2.2 g C m-2 d-1; MNB = 4.7%) and validated with 2009 to 2012 data (RMSE = 2.6 g C m-2 d-1; MNB = 1.7%). Modeled GPP was generally within 10% of measured growing season totals in each year from 2009 to 2012. Cumulatively, over the same four years, the sum of error and the sum of absolute error between the measured and modeled GPP, which provide measures of long-term bias, was ±5% and 2 to 9%, respectively, among the three sites. The inclusion of AmeriFlux cropland sites in Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota will support this approach and provide additional validation sites for a daily GPP model using gridded meteorological and remote sensing products.",

            "abstract": "Semi-arid regions store approximately 568 Gt of carbon, roughly 18% of the global carbon reserves. Drought remains one of the largest sources of climatic stress in semi-arid regions globally. The impacts of these expansive, severe droughts on terrestrial productivity can be substantial and difficult to quantify spatially. The semi-arid Southwestern US suffered an expansive drought in 2011 which precipitated significant decline in ecosystem function and woody mortality across the region. We used the New Mexico Elevation Gradient (NMEG) cluster of flux towers, which provided in-situ measures of carbon flux via eddy-covariance to estimate the decreases in gross primary production across six dominant vegetation types in the region. Relative to a wet year, the largest decrease in cumulative carbon uptake we measured was 60% (a reduction of 200 g C /m2 annually) at the ponderosa pine site. The pattern of decreased carbon sequestration was consistent across the gradient, with the C4 grasslands shifting from carbon neutral to a source of 50 g C / m2 in response to the drought and desert shrublands sink strength reduced by 100%, (~50 g C /m2 annually). Juniper savannas, PJ woodlands, and mixed conifer subalpine woodlands all showed a decrease in carbon sequestration of roughly 100 g C /m2 annually. Rough scaling of these results suggest this drought could have resulted in a reduction of carbon uptake of 20 Tg C in NM alone. To more realistically estimate the decrease in carbon sequestration due to drought, we used results from the NMEG to parameterize the Temperature-Greenness model, a remote sensing based approach to scale these estimates to the region, focusing on the six dominant vegetation types represented by the NMEG (accounts for 60% of total land area in NM). This model is driven by 16-day averages of MODIS land surface temperature and the enhanced vegetation index. We used the Southwest Regional GAP analysis classification data to bin NM landcover into representative classes to most closely match the vegetation types measured by the NMEG. Given the spatial variability in vegetation structure and function within biomes, this approach provides more robust estimates of statewide carbon uptake patterns. We discuss these results in the context of recent droughts, future climate projections, and previous regional modeling results.",

            "abstract": "The Hangay Mountains stand 1.5 - 2 km above adjacent lowlands and the timing and cause of their high elevation is debated. As part of a broad collaborative project, we synthesize several data sets that collectively suggest the Hangay increased in elevation during the mid-to-late Miocene, while topographic relief, one metric commonly associated with active mountain ranges, remained largely unchanged.\nThe topographic crest of the Hangay forms the drainage divide between the Selenga River and internal drainage of the Mongolian Depression of Lakes (MDL) and northern Gobi. Synthetic drainage divides for the Hangay were created by filtering digital topography in the spectral domain (50 – 200 km wavelengths) using a 2D-FFT function. The co-location of the synthetic and modern divides suggests that the Hangay divide is in a stable, equilibrium configuration. This assumption is corroborated by chi-maps of steady-state river channel elevations that exhibit nearly equal values across water divides. An exception to both of these metrics occurs in the northwest Hangay where the Bulnay fault crosses a low divide between the western Selenga basin and the MDL.\nRecent basalt vesicle paleoaltimetry results allow for ~1 km of surface uplift of the central Hangay in the past ~ 10 Ma. These same basalt flows in-filled late Miocene valleys cut into basement with a minimum of 800 m of local relief; similar to the amount of modern, post-glacial relief along the drainage divide. mtDNA analyses from > 250 combined Stone Loaches (Barbatula), Grayling (Thymallus), and Eurasian Dace (Leuciscus) samples from both sides of the continental drainage divide are supportive of Miocene surface uplift. Molecular genetic differences between the loach populations across the divide suggest that they separated from a common ancestor between 20 and 11 Ma. This date is consistent with the timing of surface uplift and valley incision preserved in the Miocene basalt flows. The dace and grayling populations on either side of the divide separated more recently, at ~ 2 Ma and < 1 Ma, respectively. We speculate that either (1) Quaternary climate change via glacial drainage reorganization or (2) drainage capture in response to slip along the Bulnay fault forced these more recent separations. These topo-genetic constrains are needed inputs for regional geodynamic models.",

            "abstract": "What is the role of ocean coupling in the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO)? Consensus thinking holds that the essential physics of the MJO involve interactions between convection, atmospheric wave dynamics, and boundary layer and free troposphere moisture. However, many modeling studies demonstrate improved MJO simulation when an atmosphere-only general circulation model (AGCM) is coupled to an ocean model, so feedbacks from the ocean are probably not negligible.\nAssessing the importance and processes of these feedbacks is challenging for at least two reasons. First, observations of the MJO only sample the fully coupled ocean-atmosphere system; there is no \"uncoupled\" MJO in nature. Second, the practice of analyzing the MJO in uncoupled and coupled GCMs (CGCMs) involves using imperfect tools to study the problem. Although MJO simulation is improving in many models, shortcomings remain in both AGCMs and CGCMs, making it difficult to determine if changes brought about through coupling reflect critical air-sea interactions or are simply part of the collective idiosyncracies of a given model.\nFor the atmosphere, ocean feedbacks from intraseasonal sea surface temperature (SST) variations are communicated through their effects on surface fluxes of heat and moisture. This presentation suggests a set of analysis tools for diagnosing the impact of an interactive ocean on surface latent and sensible heat fluxes, including their mean, variance, spectral characteristics, and phasing with respect to wind, SST, and MJO convection. The diagnostics are demonstrated with application to several CMIP5 models, and reveal a variety of responses to coupled ocean feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "Low-albedo down-slope streaks that form repeatedly within weekly time-scales and subsequently fade over seasonal to decadal periods are commonly observed in the tropical and mid-latitudes of Mars. ‘Dry’ mass-wasting processes vs. ‘wet’ modification of the surface by aqueous phases are the mechanisms typically considered to explain their formation. Recently, high frequency HiRISE image time-series of seasonal recurrence, incremental growth and fading of small (meter-decameter scale) slope streaks, also termed ‘recurring slope lineae’ (RSL), have been presented in support of a ‘wet’ origin likely associated with brine seepage. Here, we present new results that demonstrate comparable recurrence, incremental growth and fading characteristics over yearly time-scales for decameter-kilometer scale low-albedo slope-streaks in Lycus Sulci, Amazonis Planitia and Arabia Terra. These dynamic characteristics support the previous association of low-albedo slope streaks with brine seepage based on their geomorphic and spectral relations with surrounding unaffected slopes.\nLow-albedo slope streaks are typically not associated with detectable erosion or terminal, down-slope depositional activity at the resolution of 25 cm/pixel HiRISE images. CRISM observations consistently indicate that darkened slope-streak surfaces are spectrally enriched in FeOx and are void of detectable water/ice spectral absorption bands. Thus, the liquid seeps considered for the formation of meter to kilometer scale slope streaks are likely low-volume transient events that evaporate and/or freeze and sublime leaving behind a meta-stable dry precipitate that ‘stains’ the surface dark and may provide insights into the possible composition of such brines.\nSlope streak formation through a ‘wet’ brine seepage mechanism supports the possible presence of pressurized sub-surface aquifers that may be released via faults or cracks able to produce recurring transient discharge events during favorably warm daily/seasonal surface conditions. First-order calculations for the liquid volumes that would be associated with such transient brine extrusions suggest the presence of regional-scale extensive aquifers and/or effective recharge mechanism for local-scale aquifers perhaps during high obliquity periods.",

            "abstract": "Given the strong influence of volatiles on mantle melting processes, it is critical to understand the behaviour of volatiles (such as H2O) in subducted oceanic crustal material (eclogite) during subduction and subsequent recycling and mantle melting processes, and their impacts on volcanism.\nAs natural samples from subduction zones from the deep Earth’s interior are largely inaccessible, the only way to determine the H2O content of eclogite is to simulate high pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions equivalent to conditions of the Earth’s interior using high-P experimental facilities.\nA particular interest is to determine the H2O content of eclogitic nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs; such as garnet, clinopyroxene) at the conditions where hydrous phases (such as phengite) are breaking down to release H2O that would then leave the slab.\nAs a starting material, we use average oceanic basalt (GA1, representative of recycled oceanic crust [1]) with varying bulk %H2O (≤7 wt.%). We conducted experiments using GA1 at different P’s (6-10 GPa), T’s (850-1500°C) and bulk %H2O (up to 7 wt.%) using multi anvil apparatuses.\nThe run products at each P, T, and bulk H2O contents show well-equilibrated eclogitic phase assemblages of garnet ± clinopyroxene ± coesite/stishovite ± rutile ± phengite ± melt ± vapour. Runs (>0.5 wt.% H2O) at 6 GPa and up to ~950°C, and at 8-9 GPa and up to ~1050°C are subsolidus, while towards higher T small melt fractions appear.\nSimilar to previous studies [e.g. 2-6], the stability of phengite varies as a function of P, T, buffering mineral paragenesis and bulk H2O concentration. Phengite breaks down >9 GPa. Eclogitic NAMs and phengite also break down at subsolidus conditions in the presence of excess of hydrous fluids. For instance, K2O in phengite and clinopyroxene decrease with increasing bulk H2O content at subsolidus conditions at given P, T, suggesting a leaching role of K2O by a vapour-rich fluid.\n[1] Yaxley, G.

During IODP 337 expedition, we have obtained in-situ temperature datasets for several times by using geophysical logging tools. A common procedure to estimate the undisturbed maximum underground temperature is by approximating that the ‘build-up’ pattern of measured values in the borehole should reach to the equilibrium temperature. At the Shimokita site, this was 63.7 oC at a depth of 2466 m. We have much more measurement dataset and all of these were used to analyze detailed in-site temperatures at various depths. The result shows a non-linear temperature profile to the depth and this may be reflected by the thermal properties of the surrounding rocks.",

The mass flux per unit area in 1D flow maximizes when the flow speed equals the compound sound speed, including the effects of the Alfven wave pressure. We discuss the analogue of the Laval nozzle for the solar wind flow, and the dependence of the effective nozzle area as a function of radial distance, and the relationship of the nozzle area to the momentum equation and the Mach number of the flow. An analysis is carried out of the effects of heat and momentum addition to the wind, using a thin slice approximation, which leads to Rankine Hugoniot relations for weak deflagrations and detonations (i.e. the combustion Hugoniot). The linearized Hugoniot is used to analyze the effects of small momentum and energy addition to the wind in the thin slice approximation. We obtain the fully nonlinear Rankine Hugoniot equation solutions. The analysis also holds in the presence of Alfven waves, in which the wave energy exchange equation yields the wave action flux conservation law when their contribution to the compound sound speed is taken into account. The effective polytropic index\nγ\nand flow speed relative to the compound flow speed ahead of the slice play crucial roles in determining whether local acceleration or deceleration results. Some results are at first sight unexpected since\nγ\nfor Alfven waves ranges from -1/2 (in sub-Alfvenic flow) to 3/2 in super-Alfvenic flow.",

Unlike typical cases where the aurora is nearly conjugate, the Y-component of Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF By) during this storm ranged from +20 to +32 nT, causing the polar cap to shift towards the dusk in the Southern hemisphere and towards the dawn in the Northern. Using satellite images in the 130 nm to 160 nm wavelength range, we have been able to identify the polar cap boundary in both hemispheres throughout the event, and calculated the Dawn-Dusk Offset, ∆L, which ranged from 0° to 15° latitude. We then found correlations of 0.90 in the Northern Hemisphere and 0.83 in the Southern Hemisphere between ∆L and IMF By. ∆L also correlated well against IMF Clock Angle (ϴC) and the Epsilon parameter (ϵ = vB2sin[ϴC/2]) when using specific time averages of these parameters. The same methods are then applied to compute the polar cap boundaries in the BATSRUS, OpenGGCM, and LFM-MIX models that were run to simulate the event. We find that none of the models accurately describe the observed open-closed field line boundary during this event, with BATSRUS producing boundaries that are too ideal and symmetric, whereas OpenGGCM and LFM-MIX produced boundaries that are highly distorted and random. The LFM-MIX model gave the best average offset but did not match the observed variation with solar wind parameters.",

            "abstract": "Prediction of environmental response to global climate change is paramount for regions that rely upon snowpack for their dominant water supply. Temperature increases are anticipated to be greater at higher elevations perturbing hydrologic systems that provide water to millions of downstream users. In this study, the relationships between large-scale climatic change and the corresponding small-scale hydrologic processes of mountainous terrain are investigated in the East River headwaters catchment near Gothic, CO. This catchment is emblematic of many others within the upper Colorado River Basin and covers an area of 250 square kilometers, has a topographic relief of 1420 meters, an average elevation of 3266 meters and has varying stream characteristics. This site allows for the examination of the varying effect of climate-induced changes on the hydrologic response of three different characteristic components of the catchment: a steep high-energy mountain system, a medium-grade lower-energy system and a low-grade low-energy meandering floodplain. To capture the surface and subsurface heterogeneity of this headwaters system the basin has been modeled at a 10-meter resolution using ParFlow, a parallel, integrated hydrologic model. Driven by meteorological forcing, ParFlow is able to capture land surface processes and represents surface and subsurface interactions through saturated and variably saturated heterogeneous flow. Data from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), land cover, permeability, geologic and soil maps, and on-site meteorological stations, were prepared, analyzed and input into ParFlow as layers with a grid size comprised of 1403 by 1685 cells to best represent the small-scale, high resolution model domain. Water table depth, soil moisture, soil temperature, snowpack, runoff and local energy budget values provide useful insight into the catchments response to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) temperature projections. In the near term, coupling this watershed model with one describing a diverse suite of subsurface elemental cycling pathways, including carbon and nitrogen, will provide an improved understanding of the response of the subsurface ecosystems to hydrologic transitions induced as a result of global climate change.",

            "abstract": "Climate-soil-vegetation dynamics are among key research focuses in the emerging ecohydrology discipline. Topographic relieves on landscapes provide various hydroclimatic conditions to examine vegetation functions and its responses to climate variation and changes in a short distance. In this study, we investigate ecohydrologic processes on two slopes of contrasting orientation and soil conditions in a native vegetation catchment with mean annual precipitation of 716 mm in South Australia, using water and carbon stable isotopes.\nThroughfall, soil water, twig water, and groundwater stable isotopes were measured and integrated into an isotope incorporated soil-plant-atmosphere model to examine different plant water use patterns on two slopes with different environmental conditions. The focuses are on how ecosystems on the two slopes receive, store, and use soil moisture in different manners.\nOn these two slopes, trees are under different water stresses. Both leaf and soil 13C/12C ratio were measured for the two slopes to examine if δ13C can be used as an water stress indicator in this small catchment, and if the potential difference in δ13C can be observed in the soil organic matter. We monitored one-year leaf δ13C of two tree species, Eucalyptus leucoxylon and Acacia pycnantha. Our results indicate that leaf δ13C reflects different water stress conditions between slopes, seasons, and different locations on the slopes.",

            "abstract": "The geologically short (days to centuries) timescales associated with thermochemical changes in magma chambers during the prelude to eruption are typically beyond the resolution of long-lived radioisotopic geochronometers but can be resolved by “geospeedometry” that quantifies the relatively rapid diffusional relaxation of compositional zoning in igneous phenocrysts. When combined with absolute dating, geospeedometry can reveal long-term chronologies of compositional and thermal oscillations in magma chambers. The ability to accurately constrain timescales via geospeedometry is limited in part by the spatial resolution of commonly used analytical techniques and the derivative chemical profiles, especially in the case of very short timescales or very slow diffusing elements, where the chemical profile is often approximated as a step-function. We present geospeedometry of chemical profiles collected with the NanoSIMS ion microprobe in multi-collection mode with sub-micron resolution (e.g., 0.3 micron spacing). This data facilitates a comparison of how well the timescales calculated with the different experimentally-determined diffusivities and collected along the same profile agree and an interrogation of commonly made model assumptions in geospeedometry. For example, electron probe profiles across internal sanidine zone boundaries from a ca. 250 ka rhyolite lava from Yellowstone Caldera reveal a step function in anorthite content at 10 micron spacing and evidence for earlier dissolution prior to new zone growth, yet we find no observable difference in the width of Ba, Sr and Mg diffusion profiles collected via NanoSIMS for the same profile. These observations support the hypothesis that very little to no diffusive relaxation has affected the initial concentration profile that was produced by crystal growth during magma mixing. Our results highlight the need to quantitatively constrain initial conditions when applying geospeedometry to intermediate to silicic magmatic systems where the timescales of mixing between the intruding magma and that in the existing reservoir may not be approximated as instantaneous compared with the timescales of crystal growth.",

            "abstract": "Tracing volatiles through the subduction system is pivotal for understanding the long-term evolution of the Earth’s atmosphere. To this regard, the ratio of molecular nitrogen over one or more of the noble gases is a commonly employed method, but is based on the assumption that nitrogen is a highly incompatible element and behaves as a noble gas. Thus, to compare nitrogen/noble gas data from volcanic arcs on a global scale requires the behaviour of nitrogen relative to the noble gases to be constant. We have calculated the speciation of nitrogen in equilibrium with eclogite (jadeite + kyanite + coesite) and peridotite (enstatite + forsterite) under lower crustal and upper mantle conditions (500-1,000°C & 1-5 GPa) and over several redox states (QFM +3 to -6) and pH values (0-8).\nOur data demonstrates the duality for the behaviour of nitrogen during subduction, where nitrogen can either behave either as a noble gas (N2) or as a moderately compatible element in K-bearing phases (NH4+). Estimations for volatile abundance and fluxes based on N2/noble gas systematics are potentially flawed, and datasets for N2/noble gas systematics between different arc systems are not intuitively comparable (on the global scale). These data are also used to discuss the partitioning behaviour of nitrogen relative to other volatiles, such as carbon, and the noble gases.",

The Araguaia River is a particularly sandy anabranching system that has been suffering geomorphologic and sedimentary changes because of the effect of extensive deforestation and land use, affecting the fluvial dynamics and leading to an accelerated erosion and sedimentation in the middle reach where the river flow through a wide alluvial plain.\nThis work presents the general geomorphic and hydrologic characteristics of the Araguaia and describes systematic results on bed load and wash load transport. We demonstrate that the river is undergoing a substantive increase in bed load transport and changes in its geomorphology. This is an outstanding current example of short term geomorphic response to deforestation in a large pristine tropical fluvial system without direct human interventions in the channel.",

            "abstract": "Lithologic heterogeneity across catchments is thought to be a key control on the style of incision, whether dominated by vertical or lateral processes, but little field evidence is available to support the claims. Map and field observations from the Buffalo National River (BNR) indicate that valley width is related to variation in lithology along the length of the river. The BNR is a gravel-mantled, ingrown meandering, bedrock river that incises through a sequence of Pennsylvanian, Mississippian, and Ordovician carbonate and clastic sedimentary rocks. Using GIS, valley width was measured at 250 m intervals along the entire length of the river through two sequences of limestone and sandstone reaches that represent the dominant lithologies of the catchment. Preliminary results show measurable and statistically significant differences in valley width between limestone and sandstone reaches. Where limestone strata is exposed at river level the mean width is ~ 360 m and is highly variable with a standard deviation of 227 m. The mean width in sandstone strata is ~240 m with a standard deviation of 88 m. At each transition from limestone to sandstone there is a greater than 20% decrease in valley width downstream, with no visible change in channel width at map scales. It is possible the atypical pattern in valley width in the BNR is due to variation in lithologic resistance. These results support the assumption that lithologic heterogeneity exerts control on stream valley evolution.",

            "abstract": "Organic matter buried in Arctic soils and permafrost will become accessible to increased microbial degradation as the ground warms due to climate change. The rates of organic matter degradation and the proportion of CH4 and CO2 greenhouse gasses released in a potential warming feedback cycle depend on the microbial response to warming, organic carbon structure and availability, the pore-water quantity and geochemistry, and available electron acceptors. Significant amounts of iron(II) ions in organic and mineral soils of the active layer in low-centered ice wedge polygons indicate anoxic conditions in most soil horizons. To adapt and improve the representation of these Arctic subsurface processes in terrestrial ecosystem models for the NGEE Arctic project, we examined soil organic matter transformations from elevated and subsided areas of low- and high-centered polygons from interstitial tundra on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (Barrow, AK). Using microcosm incubations at fixed temperatures and controlled thawing systems for frozen soil cores, we investigated the microbiological processes and rates of soil organic matter degradation and greenhouse gas production under anoxic conditions, at ecologically relevant temperatures of -2, +4 or +8 °C. In contrast to the low-centered polygon incubations representing in situ water-saturated conditions, microcosms with unsaturated high-centered polygon samples displayed lower carbon mineralization as either CH4 or CO2. Substantial differences in CH4 and CO2 response curves from different microtopographic samples separate the thermodynamic controls on biological activity from the kinetic controls of microbial growth and migration that together determine the temperature response for greenhouse gas emissions in a warming Arctic.",

The documentary is about the impact of ocean acidification, but is told as a personal story and extends well beyond the cruise itself. This documentary was an independent effort supported entirely by a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign that ran from Nov - Dec, 2013. The campaign attracted over 200 donors and was ultimately successful in raising the funds necessary to bring the film crew on board. By involving so many people in the funding of the project, we attracted a core audience for the outreach efforts during the cruise. These efforts included daily posts on various social media sites, both personal and scientific, as well as exclusive “sneak peeks” of the film for the Kickstarter backers. In addition, live interactions from the cruise included an interview with public radio from the submersible, and a public seminar from the back deck of the ship. All of these efforts resulted in the development of an audience that remains engaged in the progress of the science and the film, long after the cruise has concluded.",

            "abstract": "Lightning emissions have long been recognized as an important source of nitrogen oxides (NOx) on a global scale, and an essential emission component for global atmospheric chemistry models. However, only in recent years have regional air quality models incorporated lightning NOx emissions into simulations. The growth in regional modeling of lightning emissions has been driven in part by comparisons with satellite-derived estimates of column NO2, especially from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard the Aura satellite.\nWe present and evaluate a lightning inventory for the EPA Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Our approach follows Koo et al. [2010] in the approach to spatially and temporally allocating a given total value based on cloud-top height and convective precipitation. However, we consider alternate total NOx emission values (which translate into alternate lightning emission factors) based on a review of the literature and performance evaluation against OMI NO2 for July 2007 conditions over the U.S. and parts of Canada and Mexico. The vertical distribution of lightning emissions follow a bimodal distribution from Allen et al. [2012] calculated over 27 vertical model layers.\nTotal lightning NO emissions for July 2007 show the highest above-land emissions in Florida, southeastern Texas and southern Louisiana. Although agreement with OMI NO2 across the domain varied significantly depending on lightning NOx assumptions, agreement among the simulations at ground-based NO2 monitors from the EPA Air Quality System database showed no meaningful sensitivity to lightning NOx. Emissions are compared with prior studies, which find similar distribution patterns, but a wide range of calculated magnitudes.",

            "abstract": "There is considerable interest and uncertainty regarding the expected fate of the Amazon over the coming century in face of the combined impacts of climate change, rising atmospheric CO2 levels, and on-going land transformation in the region. In this analysis, we explore the fate of Amazonian ecosystems under projected climate, CO2 and land-use change in the 21st century using three state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models (ED2, IBIS, and JULES) driven by three representative, bias-corrected GCM climate projections (PCM1, CCSM3, and HadCM3) under the SRES A2 scenario, coupled with two land-use change scenarios. We assess the relative roles of climate change, CO2 fertilization, land-use change, and fire in driving the projected changes in Amazonian biomass and forest extent. Our results indicate that the impacts of climate change depend strongly on the direction and severity of projected changes in precipitation regimes within the region: under the driest climate projection, climate change alone is predicted to reduce Amazonian forest cover by an average of 14%; however, the models predict that CO2 fertilization will enhance vegetation productivity and alleviate climate-induced increases in plant water stress, and as a result sustain high biomass forests, even under the driest climate scenario. Land-use change and changes in fire frequency are predicted cause additional aboveground live biomass loss and changes in forest extent. The relative impact of land-use and fire dynamics versus the impacts of climate and CO2 on the Amazon varies considerably, depending on both the climate and land-use scenarios used and on the terrestrial biosphere model, highlighting the importance of improved understanding of all four factors -- future climate, CO2 fertilization effects, fire and land-use -- to the fate of the Amazon over the coming century.",

This is a study to connect the recorded extreme cold season surges with the storms in the past, spanning from the early 20th Century.\nWe find the 20th century reanalysis data (20CR) useful for this study, for its temporal coverage sufficiently overlaps with the modern tidal records. The storm tracks are obtained from the cold season (NDJFMA) sea level pressure field from 20CR, using the popular tracking algorithm by K.Hodges. In seeking for fidelity in the storm data, we made two major efforts: The climatology and the known climate signals imbedded in the track data are verified against those of ERA-interim reanalysis, and against the storms tracked by an independent algorithm (GISS-MCMS). In addition, it is statistically confirmed that the storm tracks and the sea level pressure fields based on 20CR around the east coast area exhibit temporal homogeneity.\nIn the Battery, we select top 100 cold season water displacement events from the 6-hour mean water height data from 1927 to 2012, with linear trend and tide removed. Among the tracks passing close enough to the Battery, we found 91 matches. Distinctive track characteristics stand out when the positive surge events are separated from the negative surge events. More characteristic parameters of the storms are investigated according to further surge classification.",

            "abstract": "Subtropical precipitating shallow cumulus are important not only for local vertical moisture transport, but also for the large scale horizontal transport of moisture into the tropics. Previous studies suggest that increases in lower and midtropospheric water vapor due to shallow convection could result from increases in cloud frequency, increases in cloud water, increases in cloud areal extent, increases in cloud depth, or decreases in precipitation efficiency. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Feature (PF) database is used to explore the relationship between subtropical precipitating convection and lower tropospheric humidity. The PF database is first used to identify warm precipitating convection, defined here as any PF with infrared brightness temperatures greater than 273 K and echo top heights less than 5 km. The climatological mean, interannual, and seasonal variability in subtropical shallow PF characteristics, such as size, height, rain rate, and frequency, are first examined. The relationship between shallow PF characteristics and tropospheric humidity is then explored using TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) column water vapor estimates and ERA-Interim reanalysis humidity profiles. Preliminary results show a strong correlation between lower tropospheric water vapor and warm rain feature frequency, height, and rain rate, however feature sizes lag increases in water vapor. Anomalies in subtropical lower tropospheric water vapor are most correlated with the height of shallow precipitating convection. Further analysis using other datasets to include subtropical non-precipitating shallow convection is also planned.",

The program is implemented by a Science Team, comprised of over 100 investigators on 60+ projects funded by NASA, NOAA, NSF, and DoE. The Science Team meets annually to share research advances, foster collaborations, and determine near-term priorities to address four objectives: implementation and evaluation of an AMOC observing system; assessment of AMOC state, variability, and change; assessment of AMOC mechanisms and predictability; and assessment of the role of AMOC in the global climate and ecosystems. The US AMOC program also seeks to develop and strengthen collaborations with the broader Earth system community, particularly with: paleo-oceanography to enable centennial-scale reconstructions and fingerprinting of AMOC; cryospheric sciences to understand the accelerating changes in Arctic sea ice extent and Greenland ice sheet mass, and the impact of fresh melt water on North Atlantic circulation and regional sea level rise; and ocean biogeochemistry for understanding carbon cycle changes and ecosystem impacts.

In this study, we use a global climate model to examine both the local and remote impacts of US irrigation on surface air temperature and precipitation distributions, with a particular focus on the tails of these distributions. We use two model configurations to understand irrigation-induced changes within the context of natural climate variability. The first configuration has monthly climatological sea surface temperatures (SSTs), while, in the second, monthly SSTs vary from year-to-year. We analyze differences in temperature and precipitation for two irrigation ensembles (each with three 50-year simulations) relative to two control ensembles. We find significant shifts in seasonal temperature and precipitation distributions for major agricultural regions in California and the US Great Plains, with more limited effects downwind. Notably, these shifts include changes in extreme values, which underscore the importance of understanding the impacts of land-use activities on regional climate.",

            "abstract": "Low-altitude observations of ion energization (below 1000 km) provide important constraints on models of ion outflow. As the first step in the chain of energization, this low altitude region is sensitive to a wide range of processes that heat and accelerate ions, including frictional heating, current-driven instabilities, shear-driven instabilities, and ambipolar effects. We have in situ measurements from missions such as Akebono, DE, Freja, and FAST, as well as sounding rockets, focused on the processes that give rise to ion acceleration. In addition, ISRs have measured ion upflows and frictional heating. From these measurements, climatological models of ion outflow have been built up.\nThe detailed time variation of ion outflows has been difficult to measure, until now. The advent of low energy neutral atom imaging in the last two decades has opened a new view into low-altitude ion acceleration processes, by affording the capability to image ion outflow over a large area. IMAGE, while providing the first global view, was not able to fully resolve the low-altitude region due to its orbit geometry, high orbital velocity, and operating parameters such as integrating period and spin rate.\nA low energy neutral atom imager developed at NASA GSFC has flown on two missions, most recently on the VISIONS sounding rocket, launched in February 2013 from Poker Flat, Alaska. VISIONS was launched into an auroral substorm, and combined a short integration time, high sensitivity, and slow rocket velocity to provide the best-resolved images to date of ENAs produced by accelerated ions below 1000 km.\nVISIONS has revealed important clues about low-altitude ion acceleration, which were hinted at by previous studies, but are revealed in a new light by ENA imaging. These include: 1) strong association of ion acceleration with regions of intense soft electron precipitation, 2) the fact that upwards ENAs dominate over horizontal ENAs imply either low-altitude wave processes or a “pressure cooker” geometry, which would have significant implications on the total ion outflow rate and its estimation from low-altitude measurements, and 3) the detailed temporal and spatial evolution of ion outflow during a 10 minute period can be used to estimate the ion outflow rate from a single substorm, to a much higher accuracy than previous efforts.",

            "abstract": "Recent global backwards-in time models of mantle convection have resulted in vastly different interpretations of the transient state of dynamic topography on the U.S. Atlantic passive margin over the past 30 Myr (Moucha et al., 2008; Spacejovic et al., 2008; Rowley et al., 2013; Liu, 2014) . A promising way of benchmarking these geodynamic models is by reconciling them with the observed offshore sedimentary record. However, it is difficult to deconvolve the erosional response produced by changes in dynamic topography from other sources of landscape change because the erosional response is a convolution of dynamic topography changes, tectonic uplift/subsidence, flexural response to erosional unloading and depositional loading, rock properties, and climate. Herein, we present results from a new landscape evolution model that is capable of producing simulations that are required at the scale and resolution necessary to quantify the landscape response to various models of dynamic topographic change on the U.S. Atlantic passive margin in the presence of flexural unloading and loading due to erosion and deposition. We perform a sensitivity study on the effects of geodynamic modeling parameters including effective elastic thickness, climate and rock properties. We find that, while models of dynamic topography are difficult to discern from the available sedimentary record at the scale of the continent in part due to induced topologic (stream geometry) change, at the catchment scale deposition rates are vastly different through time with differing dynamic topography models. At this scale, all models show distinct peaks in deposition rates, and varying elastic thickness has a significant effect on altering the timing of peak deposition.",

            "abstract": "Lava flow morphology and texture can provide insight into rheological and other physical properties of the flow. Studies of terrestrial and extra-terrestrial lava flows rely heavily on remotely sensed observations. This research aims to quantify micromorphology and texture of a Holocene lava flow in the Cima volcanic field (eastern California) using digital elevation models and radar backscatter imagery. We are testing the hypothesis that spatial patterns in morphometry and backscatter roughness correspond with varying rheological conditions during emplacement. The site is ideally suited for morphological study owing to the youthfulness of the flow, as well as the lack of vegetation and minimal surface erosion resulting from the high desert climate. The studied lava flow spans approximately 2.5 km and exhibits well defined lobate forms and lava ropes with clear A’a’ to Pahoehoe transitions. This study assesses lava flow micromorphology using a very high resolution (5 cm pixel) digital elevation model (DEM). The DEM was constructed from low-altitude aerial photos acquired using a remotely-controlled model aircraft. In addition to the DEM, the resulting orthoimagery provided a basis for distinguishing pristine lava flow surfaces from areas covered by vegetation and/or eolian deposits. Longer-wavelength morphology (spatial scales greater than 1 meter) is analyzed using a 50 cm pixel DEM produced using stereoscopic NAPP aerial photographs. Roughness estimates are compared with radar backscatter images including steeply incident C-band (5.6 cm wavelength) and L-band (24 cm wavelength) satellite data, as well as shallow incidence Ku-band data (1.7 cm wavelength) acquired using a ground-based imaging radar from an adjacent cinder cone. Photogrammetry and radar provide complementary information on lava flow morphology and micromorphological roughness, which are assessed at different spatial scales using general statistics, as well as the local hypsometric integral.",

            "abstract": "The difference between precipitation and stream discharge over annual periods provides an indication of the total water loss to evaporation and evapotranspiration. The response of evaporative water loss to climate variability and change affects groundwater recharge, stream flow, and lake levels, and is a topic of ongoing debate in the upper Midwest US region and elsewhere. This study examined the watershed water balance for Augusta Creek, which drains a 95-km2 glacial landscape in southwestern Michigan covered by cropland, grassland, forest, and wetlands. The climate is humid and temperate; between 1964-2012 the water-year precipitation averaged 947 mm and ranged from 695-1386 mm. Comparison of precipitation on the upland watershed to baseflow discharge (USGS data; baseflow estimation by WHAT model) across the 49-year record shows that total evaporative water loss averaged 562 +/- 104 mm and ranged from 385-897 mm, with no apparent trend over the record. The evaporative water loss accounts for a mean (s.d.) of 59 +/- 6% of precipitation (range, 48-70%). Evaporative water loss was positively related to total precipitation (r2 = 0.73), but the percentage of precipitation lost to evaporation was only weakly (r2 = 0.12) related to total precipitation. This water balance approach to infer evaporative water loss compares well with direct measurements in the same watershed since 2009 using eddy covariance (grasslands and crops) and soil moisture monitoring by time-domain reflectometry (grasslands, crops, and forest). Thus the evaporative water loss, which is predominantly by evapotranspiration, is linearly related to total precipitation, leaving a relatively consistent proportion for groundwater recharge and streamflow.",

            "abstract": "Many studies use optical properties to infer dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition and origin; however, there are few controlled studies which examine the effects of environmental processing on different DOM sources. Our goal was to better understand the roles DOM plays in wetland environments of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Therefore, five endmember sources of DOM from this region were selected for use in this study: peat soil (euic, thermic Typic Medisaprists); three aquatic macrophytes (white rice (Oryza sativa); tule (Schoenoplectus acutus); cattail (Typha spp.)); and one diatom (Thalassiosira weissflogii). We measured DOM concentrations (mg C/L) and optical properties (absorbance and fluorescence) of these sources following biological and photochemical degradation over a three month period. DOM concentration decreased by over 90% in plant and algal leachates following 3 months of biodegradation, while photoexposure had negligible effects. The fluorescence index (FI), humic index (HI), specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA), and carbon-normalized fluorescence of Peaks C and A increased with biodegradation, whereas Peak T decreased. Photoexposure resulted in a decrease of the FI, HI and SUVA values. Our results emphasize the need to better understand how environmental processing affects DOM properties in aquatic environments; the frequently opposing effects of biodegradation and photodegradation, which occur simultaneously in nature, make it challenging to decipher the original DOM source without considering multiple parameters. This dataset can help us better identify which optical properties, either individual or in combination, can provide insight into how biogeochemical processes affect DOM in aquatic environments.",

            "abstract": "Turbidite paleoseismology requires careful consideration of site context, temporal interval of interest, sediment supply, and the flow dynamics before interpretations can be drawn. These factors are predicated on precise navigation so that the context of the core within modern bathymetric, sub-bottom, sidescan, and backscatter data are known. In Cascadia, numerous channel systems exist and cover a range of time intervals since the Early Pleistocene. During high stands, many of these systems are relict, with limited terrigenous sediment supply. Holocene paleoseismic records may depend on recycled materials from failure of local slopes to supply channels, slope basins, or fans. Local failures may serve to supply sediment at any point along a canyon system under expected shaking levels of ~ 1.0 g with or without recent sediment recharge. Recharge by active terrigenous sedimentation is apparently not required in Cascadia or Sumatra, where site locations, without this recharge possibility have excellent records correlable to other paleoseismic sites. By comparison to Pleistocene fan-building currents, Holocene currents are weak, rendering most areas of fan systems inactive. Core and backscatter data show the Astoria and Nitinat Fans have little Holocene activity outside the main channels. Pleistocene channels are crosscut by active Holocene incisions and levees, restricting their role as depocenters. In the main channels, the most recent currents are largely confined closely within their levees. Recent proposals for alternate Holocene pathways in Cascadia attempt to integrate data from inactive fans, pose implausible pathways over the top of the growing accretionary wedge, or use other inactive channels. Resolution of observations is also critical and simple visual core logging is inadequate when compared to modern CT data. Thus for Holocene paleoseismology, cores must be collected from within main channels or near enough to local slopes (1-2 km) to receive unchannelized sediment flows. High resolution core, site, and regional geophysical data are required. This appears to hold true for both Sumatra and Cascadia. The outcome of paleoseismic investigations depends critically on these considerations, and collecting numerous cores to test these sensitivities is highly desirable.",

Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are ubiquitous and essential on coral reefs, providing both ecological and structural benefits to the reefs. However, CCA are adversely affected by low pH water, with severe reductions in recruitment, survival, growth and productivity.\nThe ability of different species of CCA to adapt to low pH waters was tested using a system of natural submarine springs (called “ojos”) near Puerto Morelos on the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. These ojos continuously discharge groundwater that is close to seawater salinity but more acidic (pH 6.70-7.30) and under saturated (0.3 Ω to 0.97 Ω) than the ambient seawater (pH 8.03, 3.60 Ω ). Both corals and coralline algae grow in the water from these springs, suggesting that some calcifying species differ in their tolerance to low pH waters. Corallines were sampled along a pH gradient at five springs in December 2013 using underwater transects.

            "abstract": "The Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment (ATTREX) aims to quantify the impact of the slow ascent of tropospheric air through the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) on the water vapor content of the stratosphere, including better understanding of the relationship between TTL ice and water vapor. In situ and remote sampling of very high-altitude clouds in the coldest part of the tropopause from the Global Hawk provides a set of unique microphysical data to combine with regional Cloud Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR) observations from the CALIPSO satellite. The goal here is to upscale bulk cloud properties derived from the measured microphysical data to regional statistics of TTL sub-visible cirrus cloud extinctions and ice water content (IWC). If this can be credibly done then one can take advantage of 8 years of CALIPSO observations to characterize inter-annual variability and to study the impact of changes in the total water budget of the TTL on lower stratospheric composition and ultimately, on climate.\nBefore ATTREX, very few cold TTL cloud microphysical data sets were available. NASA’s ATTREX EV-1 mission used Global Hawk (GH) to sample between about 14 – 18 km in the Tropical Northern Hemispheric (NH) Eastern Pacific in Jan/Feb 2013, and Western Pacific in Jan/Feb 2014. The GH flew with a suite of modern, fast-response optical cloud probes (Hawkeye) and a particle imager (CPI), a \"total water\" instrument (NOAA), a diode laser hygrometer (DLH), and the Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL). In this presentation we use the geometric optics approximation to relate the measured ice particle projected area from Hawkeye to the extinction coefficients retrieved by CPL and CALIOP from attenuated backscatter. Where we have coincidences, we compare the CALIOP Version 3 and newer temperature-dependent IWC parameterizations with the NOAA total water and DLH measurements, to evaluate the accuracy of the CALIOP area to mass conversion for cold, TTL clouds. We also compare the measured size distributions from Hawkeye with the IIR microphysical parameter and effective diameter for TTL single layer high altitude cirrus clouds. Informed by these comparisons, we give an overview of the regional characteristics of TTL sub-visible cirrus cloud layers in the NH Western Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Since the mid-1990s, outbreaks of aggressive bark beetle species have caused extensive forest morality across 600,000 km2 of North-American forests, killing over 17,800 km2 of forest in Colorado alone. This mortality has resulted in a widespread, spatially heterogeneous decline of forest canopies, which in turn exerts strong controls on the accumulation and melt of the snowpack. In the Western United States, where approximately 70-80% of total annual runoff originates as mountain snowmelt, it is important to monitor and quantify changes in forest canopy in snow-dominated catchments.\nTo quantify annual values of forest canopy cover, this research develops a metric from time series of daily fractional snow covered area (FSCA) from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow covered area and grain size (MODSCAG) algorithm. In areas where soil and rock are completely snow-covered, a land pixel is composed only of forest canopy and snow. Following a snowfall event, FSCA initially rises rapidly, as snow is intercepted in the canopy, and then declines, as snow unloads from the canopy. The lower of these local minima form a threshold representative of snow-free canopy conditions, which serves as a spatially explicit metric of forest canopy. Investigation of a site in southern Colorado with over 40% spruce beetle mortality shows a statistically significant decrease of canopy cover, from 76 (±4)% pre-infestation to 55 (±8)% post-infestation (t=-5.1, p<0.01). Additionally, this yearly parameterization of forest canopy is well correlated (ρ=0.76, p<0.01) with an independent product of yearly crown mortality derived from U.S. Forest Service Aerial Detection Surveys. Future work will examine this relationship across varied ecologic settings and geographic locations, and incorporate field measurements of species-specific canopy change after beetle kill.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol scattering and absorption are still among the largest uncertainties in quantifying radiative forcing. Brown carbon has a wavelength-dependent absorption that increases in the UV spectral region, and its major atmospheric sources include biomass burning, anthropogenic combustion of fossil fuels, and secondary organic aerosol. The rural Southeastern U.S. is influenced by high isoprene concentrations and varying concentrations of biomass burning aerosol, making it an ideal place to compare the relative contributions of these two sources to the brown carbon absorption budget.\nDuring the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study in summer 2013, we deployed a new field instrument that uses cavity enhanced spectroscopy with a broadband light source to measure aerosol optical extinction as a function of wavelength. The instrument consists of two broadband channels which span the 360–390 and 385–420 nm spectral regions using two light emitting diodes (LED) and a grating spectrometer with charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. We combine these data with direct absorption measurements of water-soluble organic carbon obtained from a novel UV/VIS-WSOC instrument, and with aerosol composition measurements.\nWe examine these data sets to determine: 1) the optical closure between measured dry aerosol extinction and values calculated from aerosol composition and size distribution; 2) the magnitude of brown and black carbon absorption; 3) the relative contributions of biomass burning, anthropogenic, and secondary organic aerosol contributions to brown carbon absorption in the Southeast U.S. during the summer. We conclude that biomass burning is a major contributor to optical absorption by organic aerosol in the rural southeastern U.S.",

Accordingly enhanced understanding of climate change impacts on nutrient mobilization in recently glaciated terrains will factor importantly into accurate predictive models for future ecosystem health. Lithologic variation can lead to differences in geomorphic processes and thus influence landscape evolution [1]. Heath ecosystems in the region are developed on thin soils which place them close to parent material bedrock. Given the abundance of thin soils mantling bedrock, we assessed how bedrock geochemical content links with foliar composition of key macronutrients. We focused our studies on four sites near Abisko, Sweden (68°21’N 19°02’E) in metamorphosed sedimentary bedrock. In our sites the average annual air temperature has crossed the 0o threshold and has been linked to many cryospheric and ecological impacts [2]. Sites were chosen at the same elevation (700 m absl) and shared similar vegetation coverage. Three dominant species across our sampling sites include Betula nana, Empetrum nigrum, and Salix lapponum. E. Nigrum had consistent concentrations of foliar magnesium (Mg) and phosphorus (P) across the bedrock compositional gradients. B. nana and S. lapponum had consistently higher foliar Mg and P concentrations than E. nigrum across the gradients. Across a soil calcium (Ca) gradient, dominant species had a weak correlation between soil Ca and foliar Ca contents, R2 = 0.106. Soil Mg and P gradients were similarly poorly correlated with foliar abundances, R2 = -0.0228, and R2= -0.034 respectively. Expansion of our work into other lithologies will contribute towards improved predictive biogeochemical models of macronutrient acquisition and ecological evolution across changing Arctic ecosystems.",

Here we report on IO observations by the CU Airborne MAX-DOAS instrument aboard the NSF/NCAR GV aircraft during the CONvective TRansport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) and Tropical Ocean tRoposphere Exchange of Reactive halogen species and Oxygenated VOC (TORERO) field campaigns. We have measured IO vertical profiles over the tropical and sub-tropical Western and Eastern Pacific Ocean, including a detection of IO in the UTLS and lower stratosphere. Our measurements indicate IO abundances that are 2-3 times higher in the Southern hemisphere than in the Northern hemisphere free troposphere. Measurements in the lower stratosphere and tropical UTLS provide the first quantification of IO in these layers by limb observations of scattered sunlight.

Each of these instruments provides unique information on the state of aerosols; however, due to the difference in techniques there is no consistent, long-term record of global, stratospheric aerosols spanning the previous three decades. One of the instruments currently taking measurements is the Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imaging System which was launched in 2001 and measures limb scatter radiance profiles in the UV to NIR range. OSIRIS produces hundreds of measurements a day covering the majority of the sunlit portion of the globe, providing near global coverage of stratospheric aerosols.\nThis work merges the SAGE II and OSIRIS aerosol data products to produce a 30 year, near global, 525nm stratospheric aerosol record with approximately 2 km vertical resolution. Agreement between the two datasets is typically within 10% in the bulk of the stratosphere, however saturation of the OSIRIS instrument at lower altitudes, especially in the tropical UTLS, likely leads to low biases in the aerosol optical depth in this region. To correct these issues it would beneficial to incorporate this merging with other instruments such as CALIOP and GOMOS, which do not suffer from this issue, but would benefit from inclusion of the OSIRIS data in other regions.",

            "abstract": "A hallmark of science in the Anthropocene is the increasing use of synthesis efforts to distill ever-growing data into the best available scientific knowledge. Thousands of scientists contribute substantial amounts of time towards these efforts, with the aim of producing authoritative work as a basis for informing both further research priorities and policy decisions. Organizations such as the IPCC are increasing their efforts to disseminate their scientific findings to broader audiences, for example, using text and video summaries targeted for policymakers. However, the results of such synthesis efforts have rarely been disseminated further back in the pipeline, in the classrooms where scientific literacy is shaped.\nHere, I will describe an emerging initiative to develop a program to translate state-of-the-art scientific synthesis findings into a modular, flexible climate change curriculum. This initiative is envisioned to compliment rather than compete with existing curriculum development efforts. Examples from innovation labs in healthcare delivery and other fields will be used to demonstrate a model for how a small, interdisciplinary team of early-career experts can use their content and pedagogical knowledge to transform synthesis results into ready-to-use teaching materials. The benefits of such a curriculum include improved student learning through constructive alignment of thoughtfully designed teaching and learning activities and assessment activities to promote intended learning outcomes, as well as the real-world illustration of the method of scientific inquiry applied to socially relevant problems. The curriculum can also improve teaching experiences through increased efficiency in course preparation, and in sharing best practices with participating colleagues. Initial scoping will examine the needs of university teachers of climate change courses as the constituents of this curriculum, and possible support models to mainstream such efforts. Ultimately, using scientific syntheses as the basis for university curricula would help close the gap between research and classroom learning, promote increased scientific understanding, and help ensure that the resources devoted to scientific synthesis efforts are translated to broader benefits for society.",

General results of this evaluation are illustrated in the attached figure, which includes data from 84 permanent AERONET sites and 64 DRAGON sites. There are indications of positive retrieval error in the AOD over the continental U.S. for Dark-Target and merged AOD parameters, such that slopes are greater than one, and the percentage of observations above the error envelope (EE, ±(0.05 + 0.15*AERONET AOD) is greater than the percentage below. In contrast, Deep-Blue has a large number of values within the error envelope. However, the correlation with ground observations is poor (r=0.73), the bias is relatively high (0.03) and the slope is below 1 (0.77). While coverage for Deep-Blue retrievals has been improved in Collection 6, the 10 km merged parameter, while partially dependent on Deep-Blue retrievals, performs poorly with regards to coverage, particularly for lower confidence values. For this parameter, an average of only 40.2% of pixels in a valid AERONET-MODIS collocation has any retrieved values. This is in comparison to 72.9% of Deep-Blue pixels and 59.5% of Dark-Target pixels in the same 10 km product. Correlation coefficients between MODIS and AERONET AOD over the Western U.S. are significantly lower (between 0.67 and 0.71) than those in the East, (between 0.84 and 0.93). However, Dark-Target and merged AOD parameters from the West do not show overall positive retrieval errors, and have regression slopes against AERONET observations between 0.98 and 1.02. MODIS aerosol products are further combined with information from the MODIS 16-day gridded NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) product, Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data (GMTED2010), and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) to elucidate ground conditions which could affect both the accuracy and coverage of AOD retrievals, providing a more nuanced picture of MODIS AOD data over the US. In addition, the spatial pattern of AOD at the national scale is evaluated against simulated AOD by atmospheric chemistry models GOCART and GEOS-Chem.",

Recent work has shown that alkalinity fluxes from rivers are not always dominated by inorganic carbon species, and can instead be composed somewhat or mostly of non-carbonate, presumably organic species. Concentrations and proportions of organic alkalinity (O-Alk) are correlated to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and fluxes, which are predicted to rise as Arctic permafrost thaws and the hydrologic cycle intensifies. We have scaled results from watershed studies to develop a process-based model to simulate and aggregate Arctic river exports of total alkalinity, DOC, and O-Alk to the coastal sea. Total alkalinity, DOC, and O-Alk were loaded to a river network and routed through a 6-minute hydrologic model (FrAMES).

            "abstract": "Klyuchevskoy volcano is the highest active volcano in Europe and Asia (~4800 m). Morphologically it is a classic stratovolcano, but its edifice consists entirely of mafic rocks (up to 55% of SiO2). The absence of andesites and dacites suggests that Klyuchevskoy does not have a crustal magma chamber. This is supported by seismological studies, the results of which have shown that stable crustal structures (magma bodies) are not found. However, [2] petrological barometry, indicates the existence of a magma chamber near the base of the crust beneath Klyuchevskoy at pressures of 5 – 9 kbar, (~ 18-33 km). In later studies, [1] and [4] proposed a model of decompression crystallization during continuous magma ascent in the conduit (from 50-60 km depth to the surface), which explains the genesis of the whole variety of Klyuchevskoy mafic rocks without the magma chamber requirement. The most recent detailed seismological studies combined with petrological barometry [3] suggest the existence of a sub-crustal volume (magma chamber) beneath Klyuchevskoy volcano (25-35 km depths) where processes of magma accumulation most likely occur.\nIn this study we attempt to confirm the presence of a sub-crustal magma chamber using Ni zonation in primitive olivines, which may preserve information about mixing between distinct primitive melts in the magma chamber. Moreover, olivine Ni diffusion rates could help to estimate the rate of magma ascent (from the 35 km depths to the surface) beneath Klyuchevskoy using the approach of [5]. Ni concentration in olivines were measured by the electron microprobe high-precision technique (20kV, 300 nA) developed in [6].\n[1] Ariskin et al.

            "abstract": "The two-dimensional (longitudinal, vertical) water-quality model CE-QUAL-W2, version 3.7, was enhanced with new features to help dam operators and managers efficiently explore and optimize potential solutions for temperature management downstream of thermally stratified reservoirs. Such temperature management often is accomplished by blending releases from multiple dam outlets that access water of different temperatures at different depths in the reservoir. The original blending algorithm in this version of the model was limited to mixing releases from two outlets at a time, and few constraints could be imposed. The new enhanced blending algorithm allows the user to (1) specify a time-series of target release temperatures, (2) designate from 2 to 10 floating or fixed-elevation outlets for blending, (3) impose maximum head constraints as well as minimum and maximum flow constraints for any blended outlet, and (4) set a priority designation for each outlet that allows the model to choose which outlets to use and how to balance releases among them. The modified model was tested against a previously calibrated model of Detroit Lake on the North Santiam River in northwestern Oregon, and the results compared well. The enhanced model code is being used to evaluate operational and structural scenarios at multiple dam/reservoir systems in the Willamette River basin in Oregon, where downstream temperature management for endangered fish is a high priority for resource managers and dam operators. These updates to the CE-QUAL-W2 blending algorithm allow scenarios involving complicated dam operations and/or hypothetical outlet structures to be evaluated more efficiently with the model, with decreased need for multiple/iterative model runs or preprocessing of model inputs to fully characterize the operational constraints.",

Recently, climate change has increased stress on the water supply, intensifying the vulnerability of the essential link between energy and water. Our study assesses the USA water-energy nexus vulnerability to climate change. Each year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects and analyzes the future of energy production in distinct regions of the United States under several economic scenarios. These scenarios support the evaluation of policy proposals in terms of energy security and emissions. In order to estimate the impact of climate change on the water-energy nexus, we coupled the EIA energy scenarios with predictions by global circulation models. Specifically, we quantified the stress imposed on fresh-water availability by energy production in the United States under different climate scenarios. One interesting aspect of our study considered the uncertainties derived by climate models and technologies adopted in energy production and how these uncertainties propagate through the impact analysis. We assessed the impact of different policies scenarios under the climate scenarios developed by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the United States.",

            "abstract": "EarthLabs, an exemplary series of lab-based climate science learning modules, is a model for high school Earth Science lab courses. Each module includes a variety of learning activities that allow students to explore the Earth’s complex and dynamic climate history. The most recent module, Climate Detectives, uses data from IODP Expedition 341, which traveled to the Gulf of Alaska during the summer of 2013 to study past climate, sedimentation, and tectonics along the continental margin. At the onset of Climate Detectives, students are presented with a challenge engaging them to investigate how the Earth's climate has changed since the Miocene in southern Alaska. To complete this challenge, students join Exp. 341 to collect and examine sediments collected from beneath the seafloor. The two-week module consists of six labs that provide students with the content and skills needed to solve this climate mystery. Students discover how an international team collaborates to examine a scientific problem with the IODP, compete in an engineering design challenge to learn about scientific ocean drilling, and learn about how different types of proxy data are used to detect changes in Earth's climate.\nThe NGSS Science and Engineering Practices are woven into the culminating activity, giving students the opportunity to think and act like scientists as they investigate the following questions: 1) How have environmental conditions in in the Gulf of Alaska changed during the time when the sediments in core U1417 were deposited? (2) What does the occurrence of different types of diatoms and their abundance reveal about the timing of the cycles of glacial advance and retreat? (3) What timeline is represented by the section of core? (4) How do results from the Gulf of Alaska compare with the global record of glaciations during this period based on oxygen isotopes proxies? Developed by educators in collaboration with Expedition 341 scientists, Climate Detectives is a strong example of how learners can engage in authentic research experiences using real data in the secondary science classroom. In this session you will receive a brief overview of the EarthLabs project, learn more about IODP Expedition 341, and see some of the resources that the module makes available to students to help them analyze the data.",

            "abstract": "Enormous strides have recently been made in the creation of high-resolution, high-quality models of spatial variations in seismic velocity, due to increased computational capacity and to projects such as USArray Transportable Array network that provide high-density passive seismic data. Such tomography models are essential for our understanding of the local and regional geology, for determining tectonic and geologic histories, and for constraining other geophysical investigations.\nMany previous investigations have utilized USArray data, and the general seismic velocity structure of the mantle beneath the United States is complicated but now well-established (e.g. Roth et al., 2008; Burdick et al., 2013), making it an ideal region for testing new methods. The eastern and central parts are seismically quiet and generally exhibit uniformly fast seismic propagation speeds, while the western portion of the country is tectonically active with a more complicated and depth-varying seismic signature.\nWe determine seismic velocities in the mantle beneath the western United States using a new joint inversion algorithm (Zhang et al., 2014). Traditional tomography methods such as surface wave dispersion or body wave travel-time tomography are often regarded as very disparate approaches, each subject to limitations due to inherent properties of the data used. Rather than considering surface and body wave phases separately, we solve both problems simultaneously in a single inversion. The new algorithm implements a direct inversion of surface dispersion data (Fang et al., 2014), which can be incorporated into the body wave travel-time inversion. Furthermore, the velocity models are solved in the wavelet domain, which addresses the perpetual challenge of uneven raypath coverage by taking advantage of the multiscale properties of wavelet representations (Fang and Zhang, 2014). The preliminary results presented here use both body wave arrival times (from the EHB and ISC bulletins, as well as the USArray dataset) and surface wave dispersion measurements (from Ekstrom et al., 2013) to determine the S and P wave velocity structure of the mantle beneath the western US at various depths.",

Here we discuss new results on the amount and directions of biogeochemical exchanges at the tidal wetland-estuary interface. Detailed microbial and photochemical degradation experiments and high resolution bio-optical observations in tidal freshwater and salt marsh systems of the Eastern US coast provide insights on the quality and fate of the organic compounds exported from tidal marshes and their influence on near-shore biological processes, biogeochemical cycles and optical variability. Impacts of anthropogenic activities and resulting air-pollution are also discussed. High resolution model runs were performed using the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, to examine atmospheric composition along the shoreline where processes such as sea and bay breeze circulations often favor the accumulation and air-deposition of atmospheric pollutants, impacting biogeochemical processes in sensitive tidal wetland ecosystems.",

First, we use existing theory and data to explain how SIF was incorporated into CLM4.. We then demonstrate that our simulated fluorescence values are reasonable when compared with satellite (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite; GOSAT) and in situ flux-tower measurements.

The Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) was established in 2009 to bring together the global scientific community to work towards a set of best practices and recommendations for using earth observation data to map, monitor and report on agricultural productivity globally across an array of diverse agricultural systems. These methods form the research and development component of the Group on Earth Observation Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) initiative to harmonize global monitoring efforts and increase market transparency. The JECAM initiative brings together researchers from a large number of globally distributed, well monitored agricultural test sites that cover a range of crop types, cropping systems and climate regimes. Each test site works independently as well as together across multiple sites to test methods, sensors and field data collection techniques to derive key agricultural parameters, including crop type, crop condition, crop yield and soil moisture. The outcome of this project will be a set of best practices that cover the range of remote sensing monitoring and reporting needs, including satellite data acquisition, pre-processing techniques, information retrieval and ground data validation. These outcomes provide the research and development foundation for GEOGLAM and will help to inform the development of the GEOGLAM “system of systems” for global agricultural monitoring. The outcomes of the 2014 JECAM science meeting will be discussed as well as examples of methods being developed by JECAM scientists.",

            "abstract": "This work attempts to answer the question “how much, if any, climate change, exists in middle and high school curricula in the United States?” A necessary first step towards this answer involves an examination of Global Climate Change (GCC) coverage in the requisite standards documents. Until recently, each state had its own science framework, with four states (at the time of writing) having already adopted the new Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) (Achieve, Inc, 2013). This work reports on an analysis of the extent to which GCC exists within the content frameworks of each state, including the NGSS. The analysis began with a word search for such content as “climate change”, “greenhouse effect”, and “global warming”. We then searched through the remainder of the documents in question to understand the nuance of each framework. Each framework was then scored on a scale form zero (no mention of climate change) to four (climate change is explicit, an anthropogenic potential cause is emphasized, and GCC appears within at least one standard of its own). Eighteen states scored a zero, while only five states scored a four. This is particularly troubling, in light of recent statements of scientific consensus (AAAS, 2006; 2009; AGU, 2013; IPCC, 2007). While the NGSS scored well, it is unclear what this means in terms of actual students encountering the subject of climate change in actual classroom. Attention is given to some still-problematic aspects of GCC content are addressed, including its focus largely within courses not required for graduation, as well as the murky details of the yet-to-be determined processes by which individual states will choose to test, or not to test, the subject matter. The authors conclude that as of 2013, there is little evidence that students in most states are required to take courses which include significant aspects of GCC in their curricula.",

            "abstract": "Human alteration of the global nitrogen cycle by agricultural activities has provided nutritious food to society, but also poses increasing threats to human and ecosystem health through unintended pollution. Managing nitrogen more efficiently in crop production is critical for addressing both food security and environmental challenges.\nTechnologies and management practices have been developed to increase the uptake of applied nitrogen by crops. However, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE, yield per unit nitrogen input) is also affected by social and economic factors. For example, to maximize profit, farmers may change crop choice or their nitrogen application rate, both of which lead to a change in NUE. To evaluate such impacts, we use both theoretical and empirical approaches on micro (farm) and macro (national) scales:\n1) We developed a bio-economic model (NUE3) on a farm scale to investigate how market signals (e.g. fertilizer and crop prices), government policies, and nitrogen-efficient technologies affect NUE. We demonstrate that if factors that influence nitrogen inputs (e.g. fertilizer-to-crop price ratios) are not considered, NUE projections will be poorly constrained. The impact of nitrogen-efficient technologies on NUE not only depends on how technology changes the production function, but also relies on the prices of the technologies, fertilizers, and crops.\n2) We constructed a database of the nitrogen budget in crop production for major crops and major crop producing countries from 1961 to 2010. Using this database, we investigate historical trends of NUE and its relationship to agronomic, economic, social, and policy factors. We find that NUE in most developed countries follows a “U-shape” relationship with income level, consistent with the Environmental Kuznets Curve theory. According to the dynamics revealed in the NUE3 model, we propose three major pathways by which economic development affects NUE, namely consumption, technology, and public policy.\nOverall, our research suggests that it is critical to include social and economic processes when studying perturbations of the global nitrogen cycle and crafting environmental and food security policy. Better collaboration across disciplines is essential to improve nitrogen management in the anthropocene.",

            "abstract": "The GEOstationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) mission aims to put atmospheric chemistry sensors into geostationary orbit in the 2020 time frame. Multiple observations per day over North America would provide unprecedented constraints for top-down estimates of trace gase emissions. As there are multiple instruments being considered for such a mission, there is a crucial need for characterizing the degree to which spectral design impacts the mission’s capability to address key scientific questions. In this study, we assess constraints on methane (CH4) emissions over the United States for three different instrument configurations. Results are presented for an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) based on a 4D-Var inversion which uses a GEOS-Chem nested simulation at 0.5°x0.66° over North America. Two XCH4 column retrievals based on existing infrared measurements are considered, one from the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES), and one from the Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT)). A newly proposed CH4 profile retrieval from a multi-spectral instrument is also tested. Full resolution posterior errors for these three inversion configurations are estimated using a computationally efficient stochastic algorithm. Large error reductions (>60%) over broad areas were obtained when using the multi-spectral CH4 retrievals. The GOSAT CH4 retrievals provided smaller constraints on the CH4 emissions (error reductions <40%), while the TES configuration was associated with the smallest information content (error reductions <20%). We quantify the spatial scales at which different instruments could separate CH4 emissions from different sources and the value of the emissions constraints as a function of the emissions magnitudes. These results also demonstrate that using observations from a multi-spectral instrument significantly mitigate the influence of biases in the boundary conditions on the inversion compared to other instruments.",

The idea is to work with local teachers to identify highly motivated and engaged students who want to learn more about science research and the people who do it. An intensive one day program was put together at multiple sites with an opportunity for the students and teachers who attended to connect virtually to discuss their research results, and get a report from the winterovers at the South Pole. In the spring of 2014, the IceCube Collaboration held its first masterclass with approximately 100 students in total at 5 sites---Universität Mainz (Germany), University of Delaware in Newark (US), Université Libre de Bruxelles and Vrije Universiteit Brussels (Belgium), and the Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (US). The students looked through IceCube data and performed analyses that led to the first evidence for high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. A description of the resources developed for the class, tactics used to recruit students and teachers, and the evaluation of the first course will be presented.

To accomplish this goal, NAFD project demands included Landsat image assessment and selection, pre-processing, algorithm improvement, change analysis, map quality assessment and post-processing.

            "abstract": "The properties of solar energetic particles (SEPs) have long been modeled to constrain the proposed scenarios for particle acceleration. The challenge, however, is that the signatures of acceleration gleaned from SEP observations are modified as a consequence of transport within interplanetary space. During transport, an interesting subject in its own right, solar energetic particles are subject to pitch angle scattering by the turbulent magnetic field, adiabatic focusing, and/or reflections at large-scale magnetic structures. The highest energy anisotropic SEPs, so- called Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs), provide an ideal way to study acceleration with minimal complications from transport. The different morphologies of anisotropic GLEs and SEPs measured in space at lower energies has led many to believe that two distinct acceleration processes are at work. The unique observations from the Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) instrument, provide an essential link between the highest energy GLEs and the low-energy in-situ observations. PAMELA observations bridge a critical gap in energy while also providing unique pitch angle measurements above several GeV making it possible for the first time to constrain the effects of transport over a broad range in energy. In this work, we present unique high-energy SEP observations from PAMELA of the 2012 May 17 GLE and interpret the observed pitch angle distributions as a function of energy as a result of local (1 AU) scattering.

            "abstract": "Meteorological station data from NW Greenland indicate a 3oC temperature rise since 1990, with most of the warming occurring in fall and winter. According to remote sensing data, the NW Greenland ice sheet (GIS) and coastal ice caps are responding with ice mass loss and margin retreat, but the cryosphere’s response to previous climate variability is poorly constrained in this region. We are developing multi-proxy records (lake sediment cores, ice cores, glacial geologic data, glaciological models) of Holocene climate change and cryospheric response in NW Greenland to improve projections of future ice loss and sea level rise in a warming climate. As part of our efforts to develop a millennial-length ice core paleoclimate record from the Thule region, we collected and analyzed snow pit samples and short firn cores (up to 21 m) from the coastal region of the GIS (2Barrel site; 76.9317o N, 63.1467o W, 1685 m el.) and the summit of North Ice Cap (76.938o N, 67.671o W, 1273 m el.) in 2011, 2012 and 2014. The 2Barrel ice core record has statistically significant relationships with regional spring and fall Baffin Bay sea ice extent, summertime temperature, and annual precipitation. Here we evaluate relationships between the 2014 North Ice Cap firn core glaciochemical record and climate variability from regional instrumental stations and reanalysis datasets. We compare the coastal North Ice Cap record to more inland records from 2Barrel, Camp Century and NEEM to evaluate spatial and elevational gradients in recent NW Greenland climate change.",

            "abstract": "The metabolic activities of soil microbes are the primary drivers of biogeochemical processes controlling the terrestrial carbon cycle, nutrient availability to plants, contaminant remediation, water quality, and other ecosystem services. However, we have a limited understanding of microbial metabolic processes such as nutrient uptake rates, substrate preferences, or how microbes and microbial metabolism are distributed throughout their habitat. Here we use a novel imaging technique with quantum dots (QDs, engineered semiconductor nanoparticles that produce size or composition-dependent fluorescence) to measure bacterial uptake of substrates of varying complexity. Cultures of two organisms differing in cell wall structure — Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens — were grown in one of four ecologically relevant experimental conditions: nitrogen (N) limitation, phosphorus (P) limitation, N and P limitation, or no nutrient limitation. The cultures were then exposed to QDs with and without organic nutrients attached. X-ray fluorescence imaging was performed at 2ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) to determine the elemental distributions within both planktonic and surface-adhered (i.e, biofilms) cells.\nUptake of unconjugated QDs was neglibible, and QDs conjugated to organic substrates varied depending on growth conditions and substrate, suggesting that they are a useful indicator of bacterial ecology. Cellular uptake was similar for the two bacterial species (2212 ± 273 nanoparticles per cm3 of cell volume for B. subtilis and 1682 ± 264 for P. fluorescens). On average, QD assimilation was six times greater when N or P was limiting, and cells took up about twice as much phosphoserine compared to other substrates, likely because it was the only compound providing both N and P. These results showed that regardless of their cell wall structure, bacteria can selectively take up quantifiable levels of QDs based on substrate and environmental conditions. APS images are consistent with those produced with confocal and optical microscopes, indicating that the XRF approach can detect bacterial uptake of CdSe-core QDs. These findings offer a new way to experimentally investigate basic bacterial ecology such as metabolic activity and biofilm development and function.",

Recently LBMs have been used to study both the dynamics and equilibrium states in two-fluid-phase systems.

We further show that the approach to an equilibrium state involves a relatively slow process in which fluid interfaces relax to their equilibrium state and that the time scale of this process makes accurate and complete resolution of equilibrium states computationally expensive. Motivated by this bifurcated physical process, we illustrate a temporally adaptive domain decomposition algorithm based upon level-set methods that enables the accurate simulation of equilibrium states with a considerable savings in computational costs compared to standard approaches.",

The associated increased freshwater flux directly contributes to sea level rise, but also has dynamical implications for the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and global climate. The freshwater buoyancy forcing from marine terminating outlet glaciers is distributed throughout the depth of coastal fjords. When coupled with strong fjord stratification, this buoyancy forcing can drive significant water mass transformation (WMT) of subsurface waters in the fjord. The WMT differs substantially from a simple freshwater input to the surface ocean. This often overlooked small-scale overturning has potentially important consequences for the influence of GrIS freshwater on large scale ocean circulation and needs to be accounted for in studies of GrIS impact on the ocean.\nFrom ship-based and moored hydrographic measurements in East Greenland (2008 to 2013) we describe the character and temporal variability of meltwater driven WMT. While melting always adds freshwater to the ocean, the corresponding WMT causes a seasonally variable vertical redistribution of heat and salt. Observations show that the seasonal cycle of the WMT lags surface air temperatures by several months. We discuss how the WMT and its timing might impact the boundary current system in East Greenland, and implications for its representation in numerical models and impact on North Atlantic deep convection.",

            "abstract": "The IcePod is a multi-sensor airborne science platform that supports a wide suite of instruments, including a Riegl VQ-580 infrared scanning laser, GPS-inertial positioning system, shallow and deep-ice radars, visible-wave and infrared cameras, and upward-looking pyrometer. These instruments allow us to image the ice from top to bottom, including the surface of melt-water plumes that originate at the ice-ocean boundary. In collaboration with the New York Air National Guard 109th Airlift Wing, the IcePod is flown on LC-130 aircraft, which presents the unique opportunity to routinely image the Greenland ice sheet several times within a season. This is particularly important for mass balance studies, as we can measure elevation changes during the melt season. During the 2014 summer, laser data was collected via IcePod over the Greenland ice sheet, including Russell Glacier, Jakobshavn Glacier, Eqip Glacier, and Summit Camp. The Icepod will also be routinely operated in Antarctica.\nWe present the initial testing, calibration, and error estimates from the first set of laser data that were collected on IcePod. At a survey altitude of 1000 m, the laser swath covers ~ 1000 m. A Northrop-Grumman LN-200 tactical grade IMU is rigidly attached to the laser scanner to provide attitude data at a rate of 200 Hz. Several methods were used to determine the lever arm between the IMU center of navigation and GPS antenna phase center, terrestrial scanning laser, total station survey, and optimal estimation. Additionally, initial bore sight calibration flights yielded misalignment angles within an accuracy of ±4 cm. We also performed routine passes over the airport ramp in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, comparing the airborne GPS and Lidar data to a reference GPS-based ground survey across the ramp, spot GPS points on the ramp and a nearby GPS base station. Positioning errors can severely impact the accuracy of a laser altimeter when flying over remote regions such as across the ice sheets. Setting up GPS base stations along the flight track can prove to be logistically challenging. We have processed the GPS-inertial data using both DGPS and PPP and present the comparison of those results here. Finally, we discuss our processing, calibration and error estimation methods and compare our results to previously flown IceBridge lines.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing interest in linking watershed processes with nearshore processes in order to predict the fate and transport of pollutants, including bacteria, for application to management of recreational waters. However, traditional nearshore bacterial water quality monitoring programs are not sufficiently informative for understanding the spatio-temporal variability of water quality at scales that are relevant to process modeling. During the summer and fall of 2012, 2013, and 2014, we conducted increasingly intensive monitoring specifically designed to aid in the development of a linked watershed-hydrodynamics modeling framework for simulating the impacts of Michigan’s Clinton River on the nearshore bacterial water quality of Lake St. Clair. Monitoring incorporated multiple sampling “events,” including routine weekly sampling at 19 points along 19 km of shoreline, periodic transects perpendicular to the shoreline, periodic offshore sampling corresponding to the shoreline sampling points, repeated shoreline sampling over several 3-day periods, weekly river grab samples, hourly sampling of the river at baseline conditions, and hourly sampling of the river during high flow events. These sampling events allow exploration of the spatiotemporal variability of nearshore water quality resulting from local physiographic factors as well as the temporal variability of water quality in the river outlets. We present results describing the spatiotemporal variability as it relates to the watershed and hydrodynamics processes represented in a linked modeling framework which is under development.",

            "abstract": "2D multichannel seismic (MCS), multibeam and CHIRP data were collected as part of the recent R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer (NBP1402) cruise to investigate the marine record of cryosphere-ocean dynamics on the continental shelf between the Dalton Ice Tongue and Totten Glacier systems. Outlet glaciers and ice shelves along this coastline drain a catchment area extending across the Aurora Subglacial Basin (ASB) whose topography lies below sea level and contains an ice volume of approximately 6.9m of sea level rise equivalent. Analysis of over 750km of high-resolution MCS data has revealed the preservation of extensive tilted fluvial-deltaic shelf sedimentation and the first evidence of polythermal glacial advance in this region with well-preserved subglacial meltwater channels and tunnel valley systems. This expansive fluvial to glacial sedimentary section is separated by a regional unconformity from a series of irregular, localized unconformities preserved in an otherwise seismically transparent facies. We interpret these transparent facies as subglacial diamictites deposited over several glacial cycles. Detailed seismic stratigraphic analysis of the glacial sequences above the regional unconformity identified at least 4 glacial cycles illustrated by grounding zone wedge moraine deposits recorded in both MCS and multibeam bathymetric data. Distinct differences were evident in the stratigraphic architecture of polar versus polythermal glaciations including greater preservation of till deposits above the regional unconformity proximal to the exposed bedrock boundary and the present-day ice front. Sedimentary sequence preservation here appears dictated by the geometry of local ice advance and allied basement structure controls. Integration of marine geology, high resolution CHIRP and multibeam bathymetry data with MCS sequence geometry and acoustic facies mapping has led to improved constraints on rates, styles and patterns of glacial retreat. Such improvements to deformable sediment distribution and lithologic character constraints are critical to numerical ice sheet model flow velocities and potential instability assessments, and continue to advance our understanding of ice sheet dynamics and basal conditions across both heavily fjorded and uniform basement architectures.",

We found that the multi-sensor satellite measurements well capture the evolution of dust and smoke mixture in space and time as revealed by ground and aircraft-based measurements during the SAMUM-2 campaign. We then carried out a multiyear (2006-2013) comparative analysis of wintertime dust AODs over the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean based on MODIS and CALIOP observations.

            "abstract": "North Iceland is located in a climatically sensitive region at the interface between the warm Irminger Current and the cold East Greenland Current. Torfadalsvatn (66° 3'41.73\"N, 20°23'14.26\"W) is a relatively small (0.4 km2) and shallow (z=5.8 m) lake that lies on the Skagi peninsula of northern Iceland approximately 0.5 km from the modern coastline and is ideally situated to compare with regional climate records of nearby marine cores from the North Iceland Shelf. We have employed a multi-proxy approach to reconstruct Holocene terrestrial climate from an 8.4 m sediment core at 15-30 year resolution using sedimentary pigments, organic carbon flux, C:N and their stable isotopes, and biogenic silica measured by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Several proxies show peak values shortly after 8 ka suggesting peak Holocene warmth may have occurred at this time. Elevated canthaxanthin, produced by cyanobacteria, and lutein (green algae and higher plants), along with less negative δ13C and high C:N suggest a productive aquatic environment with abundant aquatic macrophytes. The mid Holocene is characterized by elevated diatom pigment concentration, reduced C:N and lutein concentration suggesting a shift toward a diatom dominated system with continued high aquatic productivity. At ~1.5 ka influx of terrestrial organic matter increases associated with a decrease in aquatic productivity. Terrestrial organic matter continues to increase during the late Holocene, peaking at ~1750 AD potentially associated with minimum local Little Ice Age temperatures. Aquatic productivity, however, continues to decrease until ~1900 AD suggesting that the landscape destabilization signal may have become saturated before minimum temperatures occurred. A comparison of the data from this core with other high-resolution regional climate records will not only increase our understanding of differences in climate histories between north and south Iceland, but will also allow for a better understanding of the manifestation of variable Irminger Current strength on terrestrial climate.",

The recent occurrence of large earthquakes and discovery of deep fluid seepage calls for a revision of the postulated hydrogeological inactivity and low seismic activity of old oceanic transform-type plate boundaries, and indicates that earthquakes and fluid flow are intrinsically associated.\nThis Action merges the expertise of a large number of research groups and supports the development of multidisciplinary knowledge on how seep fluid (bio)chemistry relates to seismicity. It aims to identify (bio)geochemical proxies for the detection of precursory seismic signals and to develop innovative physico-chemical sensors for deep-ocean seismogenic faults. National efforts are coordinated through Working Groups (WGs) focused on 1) geophysical and (bio)geochemical data acquisition; 2) modelling of structure and seismicity of faults; 3) engineering of deep-ocean physico-chemical seismic sensors; and 4) integration and dissemination.\nThis poster will illustrate the overarching goals of the FLOWS Group, with special focus to research goals concerning the role of seismic activity in controlling the release of carbon from the old ocean crust into the deep ocean.",

            "abstract": "Recently, the authors have developed a novel Large Eddy Simulation (LES) infrastructure that has been designed from the outset to address problems of climate relevance. Addressing climate problems requires conducting LESs that reach realistic statistical quasi-equilibria when subject to realistic fixed and time varying large scale forcing. Reaching quasi-equilibria demands simulations of long duration.\nA consequence of conducting long duration LES is that the domain must be sufficiently large to contain mesoscale variability that emerges during the simulation itself. In a pioneering paper, de Roode and Duynkerke (JAS 2004) sought to address this question in fixed forcing LES, and found large domains are required to capture the largest scales of variability for all but the simplest boundary layer configurations. However, in that paper, which considered analysis of spectra in the spatial domain, the scales of analysis are limited by the spatial extent of the LES domain.\nIn this presentation, we report the results of an analysis of scale dependent statistics in the time domain. Unlike analysis in the spatial domain, which is limited by the extent of the LES domain, analysis in the time domain is bound by no constraint other than the temporal length of the simulation. Moreover, in the context of fixed and time varying large scale forcing, analysis in the time domain allows investigation of the impacts of time varying forcing across all temporal scales independent of domain size constraints.",

            "abstract": "The theory of coupled elastic waves and electromagnetic fields in porous media exists for two decades. Several modeling codes have been developed and some field work has been carried out with mixed success. Modeling the so-called electroseismic and seismo-electromagnetic wavefields is tricky because of the strong elastic fields generated by mechanical sources and strong electromagnetic fields generated by electromagnetic sources, while the coupled fields have relatively small amplitudes. A second difficulty is the fact that the elastic field is essentially a wavefield, while the electromagnetic field is a diffusive field. The slow P-wave is usually also a diffusive field depending on the frequency bandwidth of the data. On the other hand, for porous soils and rocks, laboratory measurements have been carried out to experimentally validate the current theoretical model and to some extent this has been successful. To be able to understand measured data it is crucially important that we have good control on the accuracy of modeled data. Today we don’t have this control, which makes it hard to judge the quality of the modeled data and trust the experimental validation of the theory. It is therefore important that exact solutions are found to validate modeling codes in simple configurations. These modeling codes can then numerically validate the theory by matching the results obtained in laboratory or field experiments. The simplest configuration is the homogeneous space and we show exact solutions for the governing equations for point sources and point receivers. These Green’s functions are obtained for any type of point source and any type of receiver. We reduce the coupled equations to two scalar equations for the electric field and the particle velocity vectors. Solutions for longitudinal and transverse waves are obtained separately and these are combined to obtain the Green’s functions for the electric field and the particle velocity, from which the solutions for all other fields are found. We show numerical examples of the fields that can be measured in the field.",

To further understand the genetic relation between the YTT and the domes, we conducted an extensive in-situ cathodoluminescence (CL) study on serial slices of their unusual ≤2 cm, euhedral quartz crystals. Several important magma processes are recorded by CL zoning of Toba quartz, including (1) episodes of undercooling and irregular crystal growth (skeletal and dendritic zones, melt entrapment, growth embayments), (2) crystal dissolution (rounded cores and truncated zones), (3) quartz clustering (synneusis, parallel growth or twinning), and (4) fluctuating magma conditions and dynamics (contrasts in CL intensity). The associated features (1–3) are defined by growth zone configurations, whereas distinct cores, mantles, rims, and oscillatory zones mainly represent differences in trace element concentrations (4). Nearly all magma compositions are dominated by quartz with continuous subtle core to rim oscillatory zoning, while mid- to lower-SiO2 samples contain the largest proportion of crystals with bright interior and rim zones consistent with crystal settling into a high-T environment or injection of hotter magma. The diversity of near-rim zoning patterns and CL boundary sharpness in single samples indicates coalescence of quartz with dissimilar, late-stage histories; however, interior zoning patterns broadly correlate with low- and high-SiO2 bulk magma compositions similarly for the YTT and lava domes. Although a second generation of quartz crystallization is apparent in the groundmass of the lavas, its occurrence is not visually evident on the majority of dome (or recycled-YTT) phenocrysts. Processes promoting cluster formation appear important for quartz growth at Toba and may be related to those responsible in plutonic systems (Beane and Wiebe, 2012). The complex but comparable quartz growth histories and composite crystal forms between the YTT and domes suggest they experienced similar conditions during quartz crystallization and may share a common ancestry.",

The products have uniform chemical composition (~47 wt.% SiO2), with phenocrysts of plagioclase, olivine and pyroxene that represent about the 6 vol% of the samples. Despite the uniform chemical and crystal-phase characteristics of the products, the textures are very heterogeneous. Two textural endmembers, intimately intermingled at the mm-scale within a single clast, were identified: one endmember (sideromelane) is characterized by higher vesicularity (~66%), with large regular sub-spherical vesicles (modal diameter 0.6 mm), a glass-rich groundmass (> 95 vol%) and evidence of post-fragmentation vesicle expansion; the second endmember texture (tachylite) is characterized by lower vesicularity (~32%), with small highly irregular vesicles (modal diameter 0.3 mm) that result in a higher vesicle number density than the sideromelane, and a groundmass rich in microcrysts (> 95 vol%), mainly Fe-oxides. Textural characteristics suggest interaction between magmas stored at different depths. The tachylitic texture is present in different proportions in the products of the different eruptive phases, while some small-scale variability seems to suggest variation in the crystallization conditions. However, given the uniform phenocryst composition, these small-scale variations are probably due to differences in the residence time rather than to different storage depths. As a result, our observations suggest the temporary storage of portions of the erupted magma in a complex fracture network or conduit system located at very shallow levels (and possibly within the cone) where the magma could degas and crystallize, producing the observed tachylitic texture. These processes also caused an increase in magma viscosity, likely enhancing eruption explosivity.",

            "abstract": "Any irregularly shaped solid body rotating about some axis that is not aligned with its figure axis will freely wobble as it rotates. For the Earth, this free wobble is known as the Chandler wobble in honor of S. C. Chandler, Jr. who first observed it in 1891. Unlike the forced wobbles of the Earth, such as the annual wobble, whose periods are the same as the periods of the forcing mechanisms, the period of the free Chandler wobble is a function of the internal structure and rheology of the Earth, and its decay time constant, or quality factor Q, is a function of the dissipation mechanism(s), like mantle anelasticity, that are acting to dampen it. Improved estimates of the period and Q of the Chandler wobble can therefore be used to improve our understanding of these properties of the Earth. Here, estimates of the period and Q of the Chandler wobble are obtained by finding those values that minimize the power within the Chandler band of the difference between observed and modeled polar motion excitation spanning 1962-2010. Atmosphere, ocean, and hydrology models are used to model the excitation caused by both mass and motion variations within these global geophysical fluids. Direct observations of the excitation caused by mass variations as determined from GRACE time varying gravitational field measurements are also used. The resulting estimates of the period and Q of the Chandler wobble will be presented along with a discussion of the robustness of the estimates.",

            "abstract": "Land and water surfaces play a critical role in hydroclimate by supplying moisture to the atmosphere, yet the ability of climate models to capture their feedbacks with the atmosphere relative to large-scale transport is uncertain. To assess these land-lake-atmosphere feedbacks, we compare the controls on atmospheric moisture simulated by a Regional Climate Model (RegCM) with observations and reanalysis products for the Great Lakes region. Three 23-year simulations with different boundary conditions are performed to capture the hydroclimatic variability with synoptic conditions. RegCM simulates wetter winters and drier summers than observed by up to 31 and 21%, respectively. Moisture advection exhibits similar biases, suggesting the contribution of external sources, yet land surface fluxes account for nearly one third of summer precipitation. RegCM underestimates reanalysis evapotranspiration by nearly 50%; however, the reanalyses overestimate measurements at three flux towers by up to a factor of two. Neither RegCM nor the reanalyses capture the spatial variability in observed land evaporation, indicating a source of model uncertainty. In addition, RegCM underestimates the observed evaporation response to its atmospheric drivers such as vapor pressure deficit and temperature. Over the lakes, one model member overestimates convective precipitation caused by enhanced evaporation under warm lake surface temperatures, highlighting the need for accurate representation of lake temperature in the surface boundary condition. We conclude that climate models, including those driving reanalyses, underestimate the observed surface-atmosphere feedbacks and their influence on regional hydroclimate.",

A general picture that has emerged is that particles are energized and rapidly transported/organized behind an \"injection boundary\" that penetrates closer to Earth in some magnetic local time sector (e.g. the so-called double-spiral injection boundary model). While this picture provides a very good description of injections at geosynchronous orbit, with the recent launchof the Van Allen Probes mission, we are now able to explore the evolution of injection signatures well inside of geosynchronous orbit at multiple locations as well. Here we report initial results of injection boundary modeling based on simultaneous multi-point measurements at both geosynchronous orbit (from the LANL/GEO spacecraft) and inside (from Van Allen Probes spacecraft). It is shown that many of the complex dispersion features observed in Van Allen Probes particle data are reproduced by the injection boundary model.",

            "abstract": "A 6-month deployment of instrumentation from April to October 2012 in 90 m water depth near the outer edge of the mid-shelf mud belt in southern Monterey Bay, California, reveals the relative importance of internal tides on the resuspension and transport of seabed sediment. Observations consisted of time-series measurements of water-column currents, temperature and salinity, and near-bed currents and suspended matter. The internal tide accounted for 15-25% of the water-column current variance and the barotropic tide accounted for up to 35%. The subtidal flow showed remarkably little shear and was dominated by the 7-14 day band, which is associated with relaxations in the dominant equatorward winds typical of coastal California in the spring and summer. Upwelling and relaxation events resulted in strong near-bed flows and accounted for almost half of the current stress on the seafloor (not accounting for wave orbital velocities), and may have driven along-shelf geostrophic flow during steady state conditions. Several elevated suspended particulate matter (SPM) events occurred within 3 m of the bed and were generally associated with higher, long-period surface waves. However, these peaks in SPM did not coincide with the predicted resuspension events from the modeled combined wave-current shear stress, indicating that the observed SPM at our site was most likely resuspended elsewhere and advected along-isobath. Sediment flux is almost equal in magnitude in the alongshore and cross-shore directions. Instances of wave-current shear stress that exceeded the threshold of resuspension for the silty-clays common at these water depths only occurred when near-bed orbital velocities due to long-period surface waves coincided with vigorous near-bed currents associated with the internal tide or upwelling/relaxation events. Thus, the internal tide and upwelling/relaxation dynamics are important in the transport of sediment during the relatively quiescent summer months.",

Topographic mapping will be a key component of JUICE orbital and Clipper flyby mapping and an understanding of Ganymede topography can also help guide instrument development. Topographic data for Ganymede are based almost entirely on Voyager and Galileo image analysis and are sparse. No more than 20% of the surface (which exceeds that of Mercury in area in total) is presently mappable. Both stereo (3D) and shape-from-shading (PC) are both possible (and nearly all possible DEM combinations have now been constructed). Unlike Europa, only an handful of sites are mappable using both techniques: these being mostly over the South Polar region with Voyager 2. Without stereo control, PC topography, while very useful, must be interpreted with caution. Only a handful of targeted stereo mosaics were possible from Galileo, but serendipitous Voyager-Galileo stereo greatly expands this data set. Topographic data allow determinations of RMS slope values for each terrain type, but currently only at length scales >100 m. Topographic amplitude can also be determined. Geologic units for which we have limited DEM data include: furrows, grooves, smooth and subdued grooved terrains, calderas, pit and dome craters, penepalimpsests, and palimpsests. Key science questions that can be guided by even the limited available topography include: relative elevations of smooth, grooved and dark terrains and the role of volcanic vs. tectonic resurfacing; relief of ancient degraded impact craters and the role of density and heat variations; density anomalies within or beneath the ice shell; the severity and history of thermal relaxation globally and the associated heat pulse. Here we focus on the issue of relaxation, where topographic evidence indicates that thermal relaxation reached a peak associated with bright terrain formation, reducing topography of earlier craters, furrows and all other features equally, and then decayed quickly, leaving more recently formed features mostly intact. Regional variations in heat flux may be evident in the distribution of relaxed craters, especially at the South Pole.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude, spatial distribution, and variability of land net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) are important determinants of the trajectory of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Independent observational constraints provide important clues regarding NEE and its component fluxes, with information available at multiple spatial scales: from cells, to leaves, to entire organisms and collections of organisms, to complex landscapes and up to continental and global scales. Experimental manipulations, ecosystem observations, and process modeling all suggest that the components of NEE (photosynthetic gains, and respiration and other losses) are controlled in part by the availability of mineral nutrients, and that nutrient limitation is a common condition in many biomes. Experimental and observational constraints at different spatial scales provide a complex and sometimes puzzling picture of the nature and degree of influence of nutrient availability on carbon cycle processes. Photosynthetic rates assessed at the cellular and leaf scales are often higher than the observed accumulation of carbon in plant and soil pools would suggest. We infer that a down-regulation process intervenes between carbon uptake and plant growth under conditions of nutrient limitation, and several down-regulation mechanisms have been hypothesized and tested. A recent evaluation of two alternative hypotheses for down-regulation in the light of whole-plant level flux estimates indicates that some plants take up and store extra carbon, releasing it to the environment again on short time scales. The mechanism of release, either as additional autotrophic respiration or as exudation belowground is unclear, but has important consequences for long-term ecosystem state and response to climate change signals. Global-scale constraints from atmospheric concentration and isotopic composition data help to resolve this question, ultimately focusing attention on land use fluxes as the most uncertain aspect of the historical and present-day atmospheric carbon budget. The result of this multi-scale enquiry is to suggest a small number of critical research needs which have yet to be met, but which would significantly improve our ability to understand and predict the trajectory of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration.",

            "abstract": "Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) is the artificial recharge and temporary storage of water in an aquifer when water is abundant, and recovery of all or a portion of that water when it is needed. In recent years, interest in ASR has increased due to various concerns such as declining groundwater resources, vulnerability of surface water supplies to contamination and reservoir sedimentation, and unfavorable projections of future climate change. In this study, we evaluate a new recharge method for ASR in near-surface unconsolidated aquifers using small-diameter, low-cost wells installed with direct-push (DP) technology. The effectiveness of a DP well for ASR was compared with a surface infiltration basin at a field site in the Lower Republic River basin, north-central Kansas. Initial DP-based characterization of the shallow, unconsolidated subsurface indicates that both the vadose and saturated zones have many low permeability silt and clay layers constraining vertical flow. The performance of the surface basin as a recharge approach was poor at the test site due to the presence of a continuous clay layer at a depth of 1.5 to 3 m, which prevented the downward movement of infiltrated water and significantly reduced the recharge capacity of the basin. The DP well, on the other hand, penetrated through this clay layer and was able to recharge water at a much higher rate without use of a pump (water moved by gravity alone). Most importantly, the costs of the DP well, including both the construction and land costs, were only a small fraction of those for the infiltration basin. The low cost of DP wells can significantly expand the applicability of ASR as a water resources management tool to regions with limited resources, such as many small municipalities and rural communities. Our field results have clearly demonstrated the great potential of DP wells as a new recharge option for ASR projects in near-surface unconsolidated aquifers.",

However, developing curriculum modules using data and models to augment classroom teaching is hindered by a steep technology learning curve, rapid technology turnover, and lack of an organized community cyberinfrastructure (CI) for the dissemination, publication, and sharing of the latest tools and curriculum material for hydrology and geoscience education. The objective of this project is to overcome some of these limitations by developing a cyber enabled collaborative environment for publishing, sharing and adoption of data and modeling driven curriculum modules in hydrology and geosciences classroom. The CI is based on Carleton College’s Science Education Resource Center (SERC) Content Management System. Building on its existing community authoring capabilities the system is being extended to allow assembly of new teaching activities by drawing on a collection of interchangeable building blocks; each of which represents a step in the modeling process. Currently the system hosts more than 30 modules or steps, which can be combined to create multiple learning units. Two specific units: Unit Hydrograph and Rational Method, have been used in undergraduate hydrology class-rooms at Purdue University and Arizona State University. The structure of the CI and the lessons learned from its implementation, including preliminary results from student assessments of learning will be presented.",

We estimate t* by modeling the observed spectra and spectral ratio of regional and teleseismic P- and pP-phases of large, deep (> 500 km) earthquakes rupturing beneath the North Korea region. We use seismograms, acquired from the IRIS data archive, from operational stations at the time of each earthquake.

            "abstract": "The US Climate Variability and Predictability Program (CLIVAR) has brought meaningful contributions to the understanding of the role the ocean plays in the global climate system since its launch in 1998. By fostering community-based planning and implementation, US CLIVAR has made strides in increasing our understanding of the climate system and its predictability. Key accomplishments include a better understanding of intraseasonal-to-centennial timescales, expansion of a sustained ocean observing system for monitoring and assessing climate variability and change, improved understanding of critical physical processes and their representation in climate and Earth system models, and coordinated inter-comparisons of ocean and coupled simulations that have led to improved predictive capability.\nBuilding upon these advancements, the new US CLIVAR Science Plan presents revised goals, strategies, and research challenges that emphasize strengthened ties to the broader Earth science community and relevance to societal impacts. We will highlight the scope and priorities for each of the following four research challenges: (i) decadal variability and predictability; (ii) climate and extreme events; (iii) polar climate; and (iv) climate and ocean biogeochemistry. We will also provide information on how scientists can participate in future planning and implementation activities.",

            "abstract": "Detrital zircon U-Pb age dating has become a widely used tool for determining sediment provenance in basins and orogenic systems. While traditional LA-ICPMS zircon geochronology is powerful, it has limitations when source regions are characterized by monotonous or non-diagnostic crystallization ages or by major sediment recycling and homogenization, leading to minimal zircon age variability. In the central Alps of Switzerland and Italy, for example, similar Cadomian, Caledonian, and Variscan zircons dominate with only minor Alpine ages. Samples collected from Oligocene-Miocene strata deposited in both the northern (Swiss Molasse) and southern (Apenninic foredeep) Alpine foreland basins document shifts in the relative abundance of Cadomian, Caledonian, Variscan and Alpine aged detrital zircon, but the exact source region and genesis of the grains remains poorly constrained based on zircon U-Pb age data alone. Laser Ablation Split Stream (LASS)-ICPMS depth profiling of detrital zircon allows for the simultaneous recovery of multiple ages and of chemical/petrogenetic data from single zircons, and has the potential to shed additional light on provenance. This study applies this approach to Oligocene-Miocene strata of the Swiss Molasse Basin and Apenninic foredeep.\nRecent advances in LA-ICPMS sample cell technology allow for reliable recovery of age and trace element data during progressive ablation into zircons. Decreased washout (<.3 sec) reduces vertical signal smearing during ablation and penetration into unpolished, tape-mounted grains. In contrast to traditional polished mount zircon spot-analysis, depth-profiling of unpolished grains minimizes zonal mixing given that ablation pits are commonly oriented perpendicular to growth zones. Split-stream analysis of U-Pb isotopic data and REE/trace element abundances during ablation improves petrochronologic resolution to the further elucidated the growth history and genesis of individual zircon grains. Results from the Swiss Molasse Basin and the Apenninic foredeep indicate that shifts in relative abundance of U-Pb zircon ages are accompanied by variations in rim-core relationships and REE/trace element abundances from grains of the major orogenic cycles, further constraining the provenance of these strata.",

            "abstract": "Because melt inclusions (MIs) trap melt prior to eruptive degassing, they are useful probes of melt volatile concentrations. However, during post-entrapment cooling and crystallization, the melt in the inclusion contracts more than the mineral host, causing depressurization and nucleation of a vapor bubble. This causes pressure-soluble volatiles, particularly CO2, to exsolve from the melt into the bubble. To explore the extent of CO2 loss, CO2 densities in bubbles were estimated using data from Raman analysis of olivine-hosted melt inclusions from two cinder cones in the southern Cascade Arc (Basalt of Round Valley Butte [BRVB]; Basalt of Old Railroad Grade [BORG]). In BRVB, bubble vol. % (bubble vol./MI vol.) and measured CO2 densities ranged from 0.9 – 6.7 vol. % and 0.05– 0.24 g/cm3, respectively. In BORG, bubble vol. % and CO2 densities ranged from 1.4 - 9.2 vol. % and 0.07 – 0.29 g/cm3, respectively. To eliminate MI containing bubbles that were co-entrapped with the melt, we used a model from Riker (2005) to predict bubble vol. % as a function of the difference between eruption and formation temperatures. This suggested that bubbles larger than ~3.3 vol. % should be eliminated from CO2 reconstructions. Using average values of MI H2O and CO2 measured by FTIR, we added CO2 from the bubbles back into the MIs to obtain estimates of dissolved CO2 at the time of trapping. Analyzed concentrations were 933 ppm CO2 and 2.8 wt. % H2O for BORG (2.7 kbar, or ~9 km depth), with a reconstructed CO2 concentration of 1860 ± 612 (2s) ppm. Analyzed concentrations for BRVB were 426 ppm CO2 and 1.6 wt. % H2O (1.1 kbar, or ~3.7 km depth), with a reconstructed CO2 concentration of 2320 ± 1688 (2s) ppm. Using the reconstructed CO2 concentrations, VolatileCalc estimates place both BORG and BRVB MI entrapment at 4.3 kbar, or ~14 km depth. Thus, adding the CO2 in bubbles back to the CO2 in the glass of MIs is essential for determining accurate depths of magma crystallization.",

The Arabian Peninsula is a major source of windblown dust as well as anthropogenic aerosols. Future emissions – driven jointly and individually by climate change and anthropogenic emissions from this rapidly growing region – will play an important role in both climate forcing and human health impacts from particulate matter. We use two scenarios to compare their climate and air quality implications. First, we use the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for four radiative forcing cases. Second, we develop a consistent future greenhouse gas and conventional pollutant emission inventory using the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, which is a general equilibrium model of the global economy that calculates how economic growth and anthropogenic emissions change as a result of policies and other stressors. With EPPA, we examine three emissions cases, a business-as-usual case and two stabilization cases leading to anthropogenic radiative forcings of 3.7 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2. We use these scenarios to drive GEOS-Chem for present and future climate, assessing changes in chemical composition of aerosol and drivers, both natural and anthropogenic, out to 2050. We find that projected anthropogenic emissions are strong determinants of future particulate matter air quality in the Middle East region.",

            "abstract": "Assessing and monitoring land cover changes over time, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa characterized by both a high population growth and the highest rate of land degradation in the world is of high relevance for sustainable land management, water security and food production. In this study, land cover changes between 1972 and 2013 were investigated in the Binah river watershed (North of Togo and Benin) using advanced remote sensing and GIS technologies to support sustainable land and water resources management efforts. To this end, multi-temporal satellite images - Landsat MSS (1972), TM (1987) and ETM+ (2013) were processed using object-oriented classification based on image segmentation and post-classification comparison methods. Five main land cover classes namely agricultural land, forest land, savannah, settlements and water bodies have been identified with overall accuracies of 75.11% (1972), 81.82% (1987), and 86.1% (2013) and respective Kappa statistics of 0.67, 0.76 and 0.83. These classification results helped to explicitly assess the spatio-temporal pattern of land cover within the basin. The results indicate that savannah as the main vegetation type in the basin has decreased from 63.3% of the basin area in 1972 to 60.4% in 1987 and 35.6% in 2013. Also the forest land which covered 20.7% in 1972 has decreased to 12.7% in 1987 and 11.7% in 2013. This severe decrease in vegetation mainly resulted from the extension of agricultural areas and settlements, which is, thus, considered as the main driving force. In fact, agricultural land increased of 61.4% from 1972 to 1987, 81.4% from 1987 to 2013 and almost twice from 1972 to 2013 while human settlements increased from 0.8% of the basin area in 1972 to 2.5% in 1987 and 7.7% in 2013. The transition maps illustrate the conversion of savannah to agricultural land at each time step relating to slash and burn agriculture, but also demonstrate the threat of environmental degradation of the savannah biome. However, at the same time, some proportions of agricultural land were converted to savannah relating to fallow agriculture. As a first assessment for the Binah river watershed, this study provides useful guidelines for vegetation restoration and conservation, efforts in managing land degradation and implementing integrated land and water resources management plans.",

            "abstract": "Bridgemanite is believed to be the most abundant mineral in the Earth’s lower mantle. Knowing its elasticity is thus critical to our understanding of the lower-mantle seismology, geochemistry, and geophysics. Although single-crystal elasticity and elastic anisotropy of bridgemanite under high P-T have been reported theoretically, experimental results on the single-crystal elasticity of bridgemanite remain very limited[1, 2]. Published experimental results have been limited to ambient conditions due to technical challenges in high-pressure measurements to permit derivations of all nine elastic constants (C11, C22, C33, C44, C55, C66, C12, C23 and C13) of the crystal. A thorough understanding of the elastic properties of bridgemanite at relevant lower mantle conditions, as well as the effects of iron, is essentially needed to interpret seismic observations and to construct a reliable mineralogical and geochemical model. In order to solve all individual elastic constants of bridgemanite at high pressures via Christoffel’s equations, we employed both Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) which is sensitive to shear wave velocities (Vs) up to megabars, and Impulsive Stimulated Light Scattering (ISS) which is sensitive to compressional wave velocities (VP) at lower mantle pressures. The BLS and ISS allowed us to measure VP and VS sound velocities as a function of the azimuthal angle from two orientated single-crystal iron bearing bridgemanite platelets under lower mantle pressures. These experimental results permit the derivations of full elastic constants of single-crystal bridgemanite that are consistent with previous theoretical studies [3, 4]. We will discuss how pressure-temperature, as well as the iron spin/valence states and minor element aluminum, affect the single-crystal elasticity and seismic parameters (e.g. VP and VS anisotropy AVP, AVS) at lower mantle conditions. Within a pyrolite mineralogical model, these results are extrapolated using a thermoelastic model and compared with seismic profiles of the lower mantle to better understand the deep-mantle geophysics and geochemistry.\n",

            "abstract": "Over the last two centuries, the Human System went from having a small impact on the Earth System (including the Climate System) to becoming dominant, because both population and per capita consumption have grown extremely fast, especially since about 1950. We therefore argue that Human System Models must be included into Earth System Models through bidirectional couplings with feedbacks. In particular, population should be modeled endogenously, rather than exogenously as done currently in most Integrated Assessment Models. The growth of the Human System threatens to overwhelm the Carrying Capacity of the Earth System, and may be leading to catastrophic climate change and collapse.\nWe propose a set of Ecological and Economic “Sustainability Indicators” that can employ large data-sets for developing and assessing effective mitigation and adaptation policies. Using the Human and Nature Dynamical Model (HANDY) and Coupled Human-Climate-Water Model (COWA), we carry out experiments with this set of Sustainability Indicators and show that they are applicable to various coupled systems including Population, Climate, Water, Energy, Agriculture, and Economy. Impact of nonrenewable resources and fossil fuels could also be understood using these indicators. We demonstrate interconnections of Ecological and Economic Indicators. Coupled systems often include feedbacks and can thus display counterintuitive dynamics. This makes it difficult for even experts to see coming catastrophes from just the raw data for different variables. Sustainability Indicators boil down the raw data into a set of simple numbers that cross their sustainability thresholds with a large time-lag before variables enter their catastrophic regimes. Therefore, we argue that Sustainability Indicators constitute a powerful but simple set of tools that could be directly used for making policies for sustainability.",

            "abstract": "Sierra Negra is a basaltic shield volcano located at the southern end of Isabela Island, Galápagos Islands, Ecuador. The volcano, along with the rest of the Galápagos Islands, has formed by hotspot volcanism. The volcano has erupted twice over the last 35 years, producing VEI-3 eruptions in November 1979 and October 2005. Previous studies suggest that deformation is due to a flat-topped chamber or sill centered 1.9-2.2 km beneath the caldera (Amelung et al. 2000; Yun et al. 2006; Geist et al. 2007). Ten continuous Global Positioning System (cGPS) stations were installed within and on the rim of the caldera of Sierra Negra (i.e., sites GV01 - GV10) in 2002, 2006, and 2009 to track ongoing deformation. In addition, there is one cGPS site on the nearby (90 km) island of Santa Cruz (GLPS), where no recent volcanism has been observed. We analyzed the cGPS data for the period 2008 to 2014 using GIPSY-OASIS II and produced daily position time series for each site. We then estimated yearly velocities for each site assuming linear deformation. We subtract the velocity vector for site GLPS from all Sierra Negra cGPS sites to remove the motion of the Nazca plate. The resulting horizontal and vertical velocity fields indicate significant upward and outward displacement of the volcanic edifice, which we interpret as caused by the influx of new magma or magma chamber pressurization. There are significant yearly variations in both the direction and magnitude of station velocities. For the period covering 2008 to 2011 there is accelerating inflation. Maximum rates of deformation (mm/yr) are seen at GV07 in 2008 (87.02), GV09 in 2009 (161.18), and GV03 in 2010 (191.03). Inflation continues for the period 2011-2013, but at a slower rate. Maximum rates are seen at GV03 in 2011 (78.53) and GV06 in 2012 (22.44). The rate then increases again for the period covering mid-2013 through early 2014. Maximum rates are seen at GV06 in both 2013 (318.27) and early 2014 (308.53). The maximum vertical uplift rates (564.92) are seen at the sites closest to the center of the caldera, GV02 and GV04. A preliminary model for the influx of magma into the system during 2013 suggests 0.015 km3 and a source depth of 2.2 km.",

            "abstract": "Cave records from the Southwestern US reveal a rich history of hydroclimate variability. In southeastern Arizona, we have developed a set of isotopic reconstructions of paleoclimate that include high-resolution records from several key intervals spanning the last glacial cycle (129 kyr BP to present). From monitoring studies in several caves, we infer that a significant control on the oxygen isotope content of dripwater is the balance between summer and winter precipitation. This balance varies among caves, and the response time is different between drips within caves. Speleothem records from both the Holocene (4 overlapping datasets) and the last interglacial (2 non-overlapping) show relatively high oxygen isotope values that most likely reflect a stronger monsoon directly forced by high summer insolation. This inference is consistent with other paleoclimate datasets and with forced model simulations of past intervals. We also observe elevated oxygen isotope values that approach Holocene levels around 14 and 52 kyr BP, which can only partly be linked to insolation forcing but are consistent with some other datasets. All records show substantial decade-century scale variability exceeding that of the past century; this variability can partially be correlated among late Holocene records. We show that caves with seasonally different infiltration rates may yield very different isotopic histories, because of the lack of correlation between summer and winter rainfall amounts. Finally, we find that carbon isotope records are highly variable, but poorly correlated even among samples from the same cave, and that growth rates do not seem to vary with moisture. Taken together, these records show an interplay among seasonally specific forcings over interannual-millennial time scales on Southwestern hydroclimate.",

Seasonal and diurnal flux characteristics, including variance, are discussed, based on a cloud sample approaching 105 observations collected that year. Conceptual depictions of bulk annual cirrus effect are proposed as a function of cloud top height, layer depths and optical depth. We highlight those conditions for which cirrus forcing oscillates between positive and negative at the surface; a characteristic mostly unique to cirrus within the climate system. As this work represents an initial step toward implementing cirrus cloud radiative flux estimates as an operative MPLNET Level 2 product, we motivate the discussion through the continuing need for satellite and model verification datasets that improve cirrus physical characterization over varying climate regimes.",

            "abstract": "The Izu–Bonin islands lies along the convergent boundary between the subducting Pacific plate (PA) and the overriding Philippine Sea plate (PH) in the western Pacific. Nishimura (2011) found that the back-arc rifting goes on behind the Izu arc by studying the horizontal velocities of GNSS stations on the Izu islands. Here we show that this rifting has accelerated in 2004 using GNSS data at Aogashima, Hachijoujima, and Mikurajima stations.\nThe back-arc rifting behind the Izu islands can be seen as the increasing distance between stations in the Izu-Bonin islands and stations located in the stable part of PH. We found that their movement showed clear acceleration around the third quarter of 2004.\nObtaining the Euler vector of the PH is necessary to analyzed the movement of each stations relative to the other stations on the same plate. The analyzing of GPS timeseries leads us to one initial conclusion that some accelerated movement started to occur in the third quarter of 2004. This event was closely related to the earthquake on May 29, 2004 in Nankai Trough and September 5, 2004 earthquake near the triple junction of Sagami Trough. The analyzing process help us to understand that this accelerated movement was not the afterslip of any of these earthquakes, but it was triggering these area to move faster and further than it was.\nWe first rule out the best possible cause by constraining the onset time of the accelerated movement, and correlating it with the earthquakes. May 29, 2004 earthquake (M6.5) at the PA-PH boundary clearly lacked the jump which should mark the onset of the eastward slow movement. Moreover, additional velocity vectors do not converge to the epicenter, and onset time that minimizes the post-fit residual is significantly later than May. We therefore conclude that accelerated movement started in 2004 was not due to the afterslip of interplate earthquake in May 29.\nOn the next step we found that the onset time coincides with the occurrence of September 5, 2004 We found that the accelerated movement vectors of these islands are almost parallel with each other, and perpendicular to the rift axis. We hypothesize that the seismic wave radiated from the epicenter of this earthquake dynamically triggered the acceleration of the back arc opening in the Izu Arc.",

            "abstract": "Speleothem growth is a sensitive indicator of both temperature and rainfall, and independent changes in either one or both of these can cause periods of enhanced or reduced growth. Our attempt to relate growth rates to past change in regional climate is based on results from an aragonite stalagmite (CAM; 22.5 cm tall) collected near the far end of Coves de Campanet, from a well-decorated and poorly ventilated chamber. The mean annual cave temperature and relative humidity are 21ºC and >95%, respectively. Twenty-five U-Th ages constrain the stalagmite growth from 120,143 to 4,656 (±0.3) yr BP, with a large range in growth rates, from 0.76 to 7.6 µm/yr, but no apparent hiatuses. We note a significant difference between growth rates during glacial, stadial, and interglacial periods, with maximum rates occurring during MIS 5e and 5a (7.6 and 5.1 µm/yr, respectively), periods that are coincident with maximum summer insolation recorded at ~125 and 82 ka, Similar growth rates were reported from two other caves in Mallorca (Tancada and Cala Falcó). Significant drop in growth rate occurs at the beginning of stadial MIS 5d (1.5 µm/yr) and remained low during MIS 5c and b, likely in response to a decrease in the amount of precipitation. The growth rate dramatically decreased during the shift towards colder and drier conditions at the start of MIS 4, from 5.1 to 0.76 µm/yr. In contrast to most other stalagmites from NW Iberian Peninsula which show episodic growth during MIS 4 and 3, CAM maintained low but stable growth rate, of 0.76 to 0.88 µm/yr beginning at ~52 ka. Cala Falcó stalagmite ceased its growth ~45 ka, during Greenland Stadial 5. Our CAM growth rate data suggest dropping SSTs as a cause of reduced transport of moisture to the Mediterranean region. Combining these growth rates with high resolution stable isotope analyses (in progress) will allow deciphering in great detail the climate shifts in the western Mediterranean region since the Last Interglacial.",

            "abstract": "Boreal forest and arctic tundra fire regimes are highly sensitive to climate. Thus, predicting fire regime response to future climate change requires understanding modern fire-climate relationships across a range of spatial and temporal scales. We quantified fire-climate relationships across the entire boreal forest and arctic tundra biomes using MODIS MCD64 area burned data spanning 2002-2012, observed climate data, and ecoregion classifications. Stratifying analyses in space (biome and ecoregion) and time (annual and decadal) allowed us to infer how variability in fuel moisture and vegetation type influenced area burned and fire occurrence across multiple scales. At annual time scales and the biome level, area burned was significantly correlated with summer temperature (rboreal = 0.37, rtundra = 0.28, p < 0.01) and precipitation (rboreal = ˗0.39, rtundra = ˗0.16, p < 0.01), consistent with results of past studies. Within ecoregions, fire-climate relationships varied considerably, potentially due to variations in dominant vegetation (e.g. Picea vs. Larix forests) or the limited temporal coverage of the area burned data. At decadal time scales, fire was moderately biased toward warmer regions of the boreal forest, further highlighting the importance of summer fuel moisture influencing boreal forest flammability. Tundra areas characterized by high summer temperatures and rainfall were more prone to fire activity than cool, dry regions, likely due to more abundant vegetation cover that facilitates fire spread. While fire-climate relationships were best resolved at the biome scale, predicting the local impacts of climate change requires analyses that account for the combined effects of climate and vegetation on burning. Future work will use statistical models to quantify these relationships across the spatial and temporal scales considered here, facilitating projections of fire activity for the 21st-century.",

The importance of better understanding the effects and processes controlling the predictability and impacts of La Niña events rivals the importance of improving the understanding of these aspects of El Niño events. We show here that intraseasonal events of easterly wind stress in the western and central tropical Pacific play an important role in the onset and evolution of La Nina events. These easterly wind surge events are identified using reanalysis wind stress fields, validated against buoy measurements. Analysis of the observed changes in sea surface temperature following them in the 1986-2012 period, as well as experiments with easterly wind surge forcing of an ocean general circulation model, show that these easterly surges, whose frequency is a function of ENSO state, are able to affect La Nina events in a fashion analogous to their westerly wind event counterparts that have been shown to be important in the onset and evolution of El Nino events.",

            "abstract": "We have developed web-based data services to support the application of hydrologic models on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems. The purposes of these services are to provide hydrologic researchers, modelers, water managers, and users access to HPC resources without requiring them to become HPC experts and understanding the intrinsic complexities of the data services, so as to reduce the amount of time and effort spent in finding and organizing the data required to execute hydrologic models and data preprocessing tools on HPC systems. These services address some of the data challenges faced by hydrologic models that strive to take advantage of HPC. Needed data is often not in the form needed by such models, requiring researchers to spend time and effort on data preparation and preprocessing that inhibits or limits the application of these models. Another limitation is the difficult to use batch job control and queuing systems used by HPC systems. We have developed a REST-based gateway application programming interface (API) for authenticated access to HPC systems that abstracts away many of the details that are barriers to HPC use and enhances accessibility from desktop programming and scripting languages such as Python and R. We have used this gateway API to establish software services that support the delineation of watersheds to define a modeling domain, then extract terrain and land use information to automatically configure the inputs required for hydrologic models. These services support the Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Model (TauDEM) tools for watershed delineation and generation of hydrology-based terrain information such as wetness index and stream networks. These services also support the derivation of inputs for the Utah Energy Balance snowmelt model used to address questions such as how climate, land cover and land use change may affect snowmelt inputs to runoff generation. To enhance access to the time varying climate data used to drive hydrologic models, we have developed services to downscale and re-grid nationally available climate analysis data from systems such as NLDAS and MERRA. These cases serve as examples for how this approach can be extended to other models to enhance the use of HPC for hydrologic modeling.",

            "abstract": "Despite a growing appreciation for the ecological role of viruses in marine and gut systems, little is known about their role in the terrestrial deep (> 2000 m) subsurface. We used assembly-based metagenomics to examine the viral component in fluids from hydraulically fractured Marcellus shale gas wells. Here we reconstructed microbial and viral genomes from samples collected 7, 82, and 328 days post fracturing. Viruses accounted for 4.14%, 0.92% and 0.59% of the sample reads that mapped to the assembly. We identified 6 complete, circularized viral genomes and an additional 92 viral contigs > 5 kb with a maximum contig size of 73.6 kb. A BLAST comparison to NCBI viral genomes revealed that 85% of viral contigs had significant hits to the viral order Caudovirales, with 43% of sequences belonging to the family Siphoviridae, 38% to Myoviridae, and 12% to Podoviridae. Enrichment of Caudovirales viruses was supported by a large number of predicted proteins characteristic of tailed viruses including terminases (TerL), tape measure, tail formation, and baseplate related proteins. The viral contigs included evidence of lytic and temperate lifestyles, with the 7 day sample having the greatest number of detected lytic viruses. Notably in this sample, the most abundant virus was lytic and its inferred host, a member of the Vibrionaceae, was not detected at later time points. Analyses of CRISPR sequences (a viral and foreign DNA immune system in bacteria and archaea), linked 18 viral contigs to hosts. CRISPR linkages increased through time and all bacterial and archaeal genomes recovered in the final time point had genes for CRISPR-mediated viral defense. The majority of CRISPR sequences linked phage genomes to several Halanaerobium strains, which are the dominant and persisting members of the community inferred to be responsible for carbon and sulfur cycling in these shales. Network analysis revealed that several viruses were present in the 82 and 328 day samples; this viral persistence is consistent with concomitant temporal stability in geochemistry and microbial community composition. Our findings suggest that after a disturbance (hydraulic fracturing) viral predation and host immunity is an important controller of microbial community structure, metabolism, and thus biogeochemical cycling in the deep subsurface.",

The goal of this work was to evaluate the impact of different choices of processing strategies and models on GPS-based PPP. We studied the spectra of station positions, examined overall noise levels and identified the presence of spurious periodic signals. Testing various processing options allowed us to assess their effect on station position estimates. With the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s contribution to the second reprocessing campaign of the International GNSS Service (IGS) as our reference source for input orbits and clocks, we also considered the effects of using different orbit and clock products. This included products from the previous reprocessing campaign, which were fixed in the IGS05 reference frame, while recent products use the IGS08 frame. Of particular importance are our results from assessing the impact on the station position time series from the single-receiver ambiguity resolution capability offered by JPL’s reprocessing campaigns. Furthermore, our tests raise the possibility of distinguishing between PPP processing settings, input orbits and clocks, and station data and location-dependent effects as causes of these features.",

A geophone string spanning 800-1700 m in depth was cemented into a monitoring well at the Aneth oil field in Utah in 2007 for monitoring CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The monitoring continued till 2010. A total of 24 geophone levels recorded induced microseismic events, including 18 levels of three-component geophones and six vertical-component levels spaced 106.7 m (350 ft) apart to take full advantage of the entire array aperture. We apply a fat-ray double-difference tomography method to microseismic data acquired at the Aneth EOR field. We obtain high-precision locations of microseismic events and improve the velocity structure simultaneously. We demonstrate the improvements by comparing our results with those obtained using the conventional double-difference tomography.",

            "abstract": "The National Weather Service, in partnership with the State of Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (DHSEM) and the Alaska Broadcasters Association (ABA), has made tremendous improvements to Alaska's Emergency Alert System (EAS) with the use of an annual live code Tsunami System test.\nThe annual test has been implemented since 2007 during the 3rd week of March commemorating the Great Alaska Earthquake of 1964 and promoting Tsunami Preparedness Week. Due to the antiquity of hardware, this test had always been conducted state-wide. This resulted in over-warn testing large areas of the largest state with no tsunami risk. The philosophy being that through over-warning, the most rural high risk areas would be warned.\nIn 2012, the State of Alaska upgraded their dissemination hardware and the NWS was able to limit the test to a regional area eliminating most of the unthreatened areas from the test. While this occurred with several great successes, it also exposed a myriad of unknown problems and challenges.\nIn addition, the NWS and the State of Alaska, with support from the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Committee (NTHMP), has engaged in an aggressive education, outreach, and mitigation campaign with Alaska's coastal high-risk community Emergency Managers.\nThe resultant situation has produced a tight team between local Emergency Managers, State Emergency Managers and Emergency Operations Center, the NWS' National Tsunami Warning Center, NWS' Weather Forecast Offices and Regional Managers, and Alaska's Broadcasters coming together as a dynamic and creative problem solving force.\nThis poster will address the leaps of progress as well as the upcoming hurdles. Ultimately, live code testing is improving how we warn and save lives and property during the shortest fuse disaster his planet offers; the tsunami.",

Based on previous data generated from fracture water samples collected from mines in South Africa, including (i) stable isotope analyses of bulk N, N2, NO3- and NH3/NH4+, (ii) cloning and sequencing of NifH genes in DNA and RNA samples, and (iii) detection of Nar, Nif and NPD genes in several metagenomes, the nitrogen cycle occurred at the terrestrial deep subsurface sites has been proposed recently. We carried out an in-depth investigation of fracture water samples from a borehole located at 1.34 km depth in Beatrix Au mine where N and O isotope analyses of NO3- indicated enriched d15N and d18O values, consistent with fractionation during nitrate reduction. We identified the microorganisms responsible for the N-cycling and characterized the genes and proteins that were expressed. Metagenomic data provided a critical foundation for annotating the transcripts and proteomes. Preliminary results revealed the presence of transcripts and enzymes for denitrification (nitrate, nitrite and nitrous-oxide reduction) and N2 fixation. b-Proteobacteria is the predominant group of denitrifying bacteria, such as Cadidatus Accumulibacter, Dechlorosoma, Thiobacillus, Azoarcus and Sulfuricella, as shown in the transcriptomic and proteomic data.

            "abstract": "Climate proxy data has traditionally been interpreted through inverse models, which extract physical climate variables from proxy variables. This approach assumes stationarity of the proxy-climate relationship, typically reduces climate signal to a single variable, and requires extensive observational records. In contrast, forward models reverse the relationship, simulating proxy variables from physical climate variables for comparison to observed proxy variables. Since this approach accounts for multiple climate variables and avoids stationarity issues, forward models have been developed for several climate proxies, including tree ring width and oxygen stable isotopes (δ18O) of corals.\nHere we develop a basic forward model for the climate archive coralline alga Clathromorphum sp.This long-lived alga grows in mid-to-high latitude regions and forms a solid calcite skeleton with annual growth bands similar to those of trees and tropical corals. Sub-annually resolved δ18O in annual growth bands (δ18Ospec) provide a record of local environmental and climatic factors, notably sea surface temperature (SST) and sea water oxygen stable isotopes (δ18Osw).\nWe model Clathromorphum δ18Ospec in the Aleutian islands from gridded SST and δ18Osw of the growing season from 1960 to 2004. The strongest climate signal is observed in July, likely due to suppressed growth in other months. Initial results suggest no influence of growth rate on the fractionation of oxygen isotopes and indicate that δ18Ospec anomalies are significantly correlated with summer SST anomalies. We run this forward model with observed SST and δ18Osw and compare the resulting simulated δ18Ospec with that measured in live-collected specimens. This foundational model may be adapted to other regions and modified to include other variables influencing coralline isotope records, such as light availability and ice coverage.",

            "abstract": "Mass loss from Alaskan glaciers (-50 ± 17 Gt/a, 2003-2009) constitutes one of the largest contributions to global sea level rise outside of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The largest process-related uncertainties in this calculation arise from the difficulty in accurately measuring accumulation on glaciers and from the large variability of accumulation over a range of spatio-temporal scales. Further, the physical processes governing snow distribution in complex terrain elude model parameterization. Using ground-penetrating radar, constrained with probe and pit observations, we quantify the magnitude and variability of snow accumulation at six prominent glaciers throughout Alaska at the end of 2013 winter. We find that total SWE magnitude and variability are strongly controlled by the large-scale climate system (i.e. distance from the coastal moisture source along prevailing storm track). On average, total SWE decreases by 0.33 m per 100 km from the coast, while the SWE elevation gradient decreases by 0.06 m / 100 m per 100 km from the coast. SWE variability over small spatial scales (<200 m) is similar at most sites, although two glaciers exhibit notably low and high variability, likely related to their respective climatic provenance. On individual glaciers, strong elevation gradients, increasing from 0.07 m SWE / 100 m at the interior Gulkana Glacier to 0.30 m SWE / 100 m at the coastal Scott Glacier, exert the primary control on accumulation. Results from multi-variable linear regression models (based on topographic variables) find wind exposure/shelter is the most frequent secondary control on accumulation variability. Finally, we find strong agreement (<10% difference) between the radar derived and stake derived total SWE estimates at two glaciers in the USGS Benchmark Glacier Program.",

            "abstract": " Earthquake cycle simulations have been performed to successfully reproduce the historical earthquake occurrences. Most of them are quasi-dynamic, where inertial effects are approximated using the radiation damping proposed by Rice [1993]. Lapusta et al. [2000, 2009] developed a methodology capable of the detailed description of seismic and aseismic slip and gradual process of earthquake nucleation in the entire earthquake cycle. Their fully dynamic simulations have produced earthquake cycles considerably different from quasi-dynamic ones. Those simulations have, however, never been performed for interplate earthquakes at subduction zones.\n Many studies showed that on dipping faults such as interplate earthquakes at subduction zones, normal stress is changed during faulting due to the interaction with Earth’s free surface. This change in normal stress not only affects the earthquake rupture process, but also causes the residual stress variation that might affect the long-term histories of earthquake cycle.\n Accounting for such effects, we perform two-dimensional simulations of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake cycle. Our model is in-plane and a laboratory derived rate and state friction acts on a dipping fault embedded on an elastic half-space that reaches the free surface. We extended the spectral element method (SEM) code [Ampuero, 2002] to incorporate a conforming mesh of triangles and quadrangles introduced in Komatitsch et al. [2001], which enables us to analyze the complex geometry with ease. The problem is solved by the methodology almost the same as Kaneko et al. [2011], which is the combined scheme switching in turn a fully dynamic SEM and a quasi-static SEM. The difference is the dip-slip thrust fault in our study in contrast to the vertical strike slip fault. With this method, we can analyze how the dynamic rupture with surface breakout interacting with the free surface affects the long-term earthquake cycle.\n We discuss the fully dynamic earthquake cycle results focusing on the differences from previous quasi-dynamic studies such as Kato and Yoshida [2011]. They proposed a shallow strong patch model to explain the observed huge coseismic slip at the shallow portion close to the Japan Trench and the long recurrence time of several hundreds.",

            "abstract": "Gravel augmentation programs intended to improve riverine habitats are currently underway in a number of stream where the natural delivery of gravel from upstream is impeded by dams. Augmentations are sometimes intended to improve local habitat conditions at a specific stream location. However, gravel management objectives may also include establishing a more natural bedload regime in which gravel fluxes are sufficient to support the geomorphic processes that maintain channel complexity, substrate quality, and physical habitat integrity at the river segment scale. Determining the quantity of gravel to add to a stream and where to add it involves consideration of both spatial scales and requires a variety of analysis methods. Four general methods used to inform multi-scale gravel augmentation planning for the Trinity River of California are described. Recent analyses have produced recommendations for long-term average augmentation rates for the near-dam reaches based on measured bedload fluxes downstream from several unregulated sediment-producing tributaries. Monitoring of past augmentation projects is used to empirically evaluate the fate of added gravel at the augmentation locations, as well as the effects of those augmentations on reaches immediately downstream. Expectations for longer-term routing characteristics, including the identification of reaches likely to respond to upstream gravel additions, are assessed through morphodynamic modeling. A fourth approach to guiding augmentation activities involves integrating physical and biological information to identify specific locations where increasing the gravel supply are expected to produce specific habitat benefits. This is arguably most relevant way to approach habitat restoration, but it is also the most complex and least developed. It requires understanding the relative values of various habitat characteristics, linking ecological function to assemblages of channel features, and anticipating the geomorphic evolution of those features in response to gravel additions.",

The ridges (from west to east Delhi-Lahore-Sargodha, Delhi-Hardwar, Manghyr-Saharsa, Faizabad and Rajmahal-Garo) are oriented more or less perpendicular to the Main Boundary thrust, and their crests are several hundreds of kilometers apart. They separate deeper sub-basins of the foreland system. Goal of this study is to understand the origin of the basement highs.\nThe Himalayan Foreland Basin can well be explained by flexural deformation as a result of the load of the Himalayas and the infill of the foreland basin. One possible explanation for the basement highs and lows is differential loading of the subducted part of the plate. We used the geometry of the foreland basin and the load to estimate the effective elastic thickness of the northern Indian Plate with 3D flexural models, and included lateral variations in the load. The basement ridges could, however, not be reproduced. Buckling of the Indian Plate did, however, reproduce the observed highs and lows of the Indian Plate. There are several possible causes for buckling of the northern Indian Plate including compression and loading of the edges of the Indian Plate by the sediment load of the Ganges and Indus deltas.

            "abstract": "In the Southwestern U.S., warm anomalies in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are associated with increased probability of wetter than normal winter precipitation. For semiarid, snow-dominated mountainous watersheds, teleconnections, such as ENSO, may strongly affect the magnitude and timing of snowmelt pulses in streamflow. In examining stream-gage data, an implicit assumption is made that all the streamflow generation processes operative within the watershed are captured by the stream gage. However, zones of strong groundwater discharge to the stream alternating with zones of strong recharge from the stream may emerge in geologically complex watersheds. The spatial complexity of these groundwater/surface water interactions may not be captured in the stream-gage discharge data. This may not be a problem in watersheds where streamflow is generated primarily by shallow, fast runoff processes. In that case, changes associated with ENSO can be quickly apparent in streamflow (i.e., an increase in snowpack associated with warm ENSO anomalies will quickly translate to increases in daily and peak streamflow). However, the spatial complexity of groundwater/surface water interactions creates a problem in geologically complex watersheds where interactions with deep, regional groundwater are present. In this case, we test the hypothesis that the combined effect of complex geology and deep groundwater interactions creates phase shifts between peak snowpack, onset and peak of snowmelt pulses, and teleconnection indices. Using time-series analysis, the relationships between teleconnections, and metrics for snowpack and streamflow are evaluated for selected watersheds in New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado. A phase shift (lag) is observed between the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) and onset and peak of snowmelt pulses in streamflow in snow-dominated watersheds with complex geology across scales of 50 to 1600 km2. Additionally, strong relationships between teleconnections and streamflow are not observed at larger snow-dominated watersheds with known significant deep groundwater contributions. We conclude that the effects of complex geology and deep groundwater interactions must be considered when quantifying the effects of ENSO and other teleconnections on the timing of the onset of the snowmelt pulse.",

            "abstract": "Wave runup during storm conditions can drive extreme changes to coastal environments. Prediction of runup elevation during these events is important for identifying areas at risk to erosion and coastal flooding and for evaluating potential hazards to coastal communities. Parametric models are often used to calculate runup levels that are expected from specific storms or storm scenarios. However, most parameterizations were not developed or tested under highly energetic conditions, principally because observations of runup under these conditions are extremely difficult to collect. Therefore, we used a numerical model, XBeach, to simulate runup during storm conditions and then, using these model-generated data, determine where an existing parameterization (Stockdon et al, 2006) can be extended or modified.\nFirst, the accuracy of XBeach-simulated wave runup components (setup and swash) were evaluated using observations collected during the 1997 SandyDuck field experiment in North Carolina. The swash component was split into incident band and infragravity band. Incident-band swash is not modeled explicitly by XBeach and therefore simulated values are significantly lower than observations. Setup and infragravity swash are adequately modeled using XBeach, indicating that these simulated storm-induced water levels can be used as surrogates for actual observations. Generalized wave conditions for category 1-5 hurricanes were then used to model extreme setup and swash. For setup, simulated hurricane results are higher than what would be predicted using the parameterization. Here, interaction of high water levels with the dune face prevents a simple extrapolation of the existing parameterization. XBeach-modeled infragravity swash for hurricane conditions compares well with the parameterization suggesting that we can use simulated data to extend this parameterization to more extreme wave conditions.",

Lead by the Institute of Engineering (IE) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the engineering strong ground motion monitoring program at IE relies on a continuously growing network, that at present includes more than 100 free-field stations and provides coverage to the seismic zones in the country. Among the stations, approximately 25% send the observed acceleration to a processing center in Mexico City in real-time, and the rest require manual access, remote or in situ, for later processing and cataloguing.\nAs part of a collaboration agreement between UNAM and the National Center for Disaster Prevention, regarding the construction and operation of a unified seismic network, a web system was developed to allow access to UNAM's engineering strong motion archive and host data from other institutions. The system allows data searches under a relational database schema, following a general structure relying on four databases containing the: 1) free-field stations, 2) epicentral location associated with the strong motion records available, 3) strong motion catalogue, and 4) acceleration files -the core of the system. In order to locate and easily access one or several records of the data bank, the web system presents a variety of parameters that can be involved in a query (seismic event, region boundary, station name or ID, radial distance to source or peak acceleration). This homogeneous platform has been designed to facilitate dissemination and processing of the information worldwide. Each file, in a standard format, contains information regarding the recording instrument, the station, the corresponding earthquake, the record itself, and the numerical data. The standard format used was designed and preserved by many institutions in Mexico.\nAt this stage, only cataloged accelerograms (M>=5) from IE are integrated. Institutions expected to become part of the unified network of Mexico, will make available data through the platform described in this paper.",

            "abstract": "Liquid water flow in snowpacks is a complicated process to measure or to simulate in snowpack models, although it is important for assessing, for example, soil moisture variations, streamflow discharge or wet snow avalanche formation. The measurement site Weissfluhjoch (WFJ) is equipped with instruments recording meteorological conditions and snowpack properties, including a snow lysimeter and an upward looking ground penetrating radar (upGPR). The upGRP, among other capabilities, is able to track the progress of the melt water front through the seasonal snowpack at WFJ, whereas the snow lysimeter only records liquid water runoff from the snowpack. The 1 dimensional physics-based snowpack model SNOWPACK has recently been extended with a solver for Richards equation, which provides a demonstrable improvement in simulating snowpack runoff, especially on the hourly time scale, when compared to a simpler bucket-type approach. Here, we compare the two measurement methods and the two snowpack simulations for four snow seasons with respect to the progress of the melt water front through the snowpack and snowpack runoff. We show that in the studied period, snowpack runoff in the melt season starts before the arrival of the melt water front at the bottom of the snowpack as detected by the upGPR. This discrepancy is in the order of several days to 1-2 weeks. The agreement between measured and modeled snowpack runoff is higher, although modeled snowpack runoff is still lagging several days from observed runoff, depending on the used water transport scheme. This demonstrates that the early start of snowpack runoff is likely associated with the existence of preferential flow paths. The modeled progress of the melt water front is faster than observed in the upGPR data. This contributes to a better predicition of the onset of snowpack runoff, but may have consequences for the representation of the internal snowpack in the model. The study highlights the extreme difficulties in understanding and modeling liquid water flow in snow, but suggests that existing model approaches satisfactorily predict the onset of snowpack runoff in the melt season.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from small water-soluble molecules such as glyoxal and methyl glyoxal is a topic of emerging interest. Results from recent field campaigns, e.g. Waxman et al. (2013, GRL) and Knote et al. (2014, ACP), show that these molecules can form significant SOA mass as a result of ‘salting-in’. Salting-in happens when a molecule’s solubility increases with salt concentration and salting-out is the reverse. Salting effects modify the solubility exponentially with increasing salt concentration, and thus the effective Henry’s law constant can strongly modify partitioning, and multiphase chemical reaction rates in aerosol water. Moreover, the solubility in aerosol water cannot easily inferred based on the solubility in cloud water, as the salting effects could change the solubility by a factor of 104 or more. In this work, we have devised and applied a novel experimental setup to measure salting constants using an ion trap mass spectrometer. We focus on small, water soluble molecules like methyl glyoxal and similar compounds and measure salting constants for aerosol-relevant salts including ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and sodium chloride. The Setschenow salting-constant values are then used to parameterize the effects of salting in CMAQ. We present a series of sensitivity studies of the effects that inorganic aerosols have on the SOA formation from small soluble molecules in the southeastern United States.",

Within approximately 2.5 years time stage, we analyze and eliminate common mode errors of residual time series through considerations of correlation analysis with seasonal temperature and mass loading in localizable basins, including of southwestern part of Qaidam Basin, Xorkol basin and Ayakkum keli basin with identical elevation and climate conditions in the southern uninhabited region of Qimen Tagh Mountain. Thus, we estimate a approximate horizontal velocity of 6-8mm/yr. along central segment of Altyn Tagh fault and vertical relative velocity of 1~2mm/yr. near the peak of Altyn Tagh mountain using continuous GPS stations, crossing the central segment of Atlyn Tagh Fault with respect to the lowest velocity of GPS station which is noted as ATFD, while it might be on the Qimen Tagh thrust fault plane. Some analysis show that crustal uplift velocity profile is better curvilinear correlation with the topography of Akato Tagh Mountain, which is defined as major orogenic belt in Northern Tibetan Plateau. We analyze geological setting and deformation model among Akaoto Tagh bend, Kadzi Fault and Huatugou fold. The result indicates modern episode of Akato Tagh is uplifted with left lateral oblique slip affected by tectonic activity between Qimen Tagh and central segment of Altyn Tagh Fualt, accompanying with the collision between India and Eurasia. We estimate a sustained uplift and localized orogenic process is still occurred, according to explicitly constrains between our continuous GPS records in short-term geodetic observation and some terraces studies of Yaziquan spring within long-term geological temporal scale since at least Quaternary near the norhtern front of Qimen Tagh Mountain .",

            "abstract": "Forest succession theory maintains that trees drape existing landscapes as passive niche optimizers. Here, we explore the opposite view – that tree type can control the landscape morphology through canopy and soil structure differences between tree types. Using field observations combined with the analysis of a 1 m-resolution LiDAR DEM and cosmogenic nuclide geochemical techniques, we report links between topographic position, erosion rates, and tree distribution above 600 m in elevation in the pristine, tropical rainforest of the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory, Puerto Rico. Above 600 m, flat ridges connect a subdued topographic surface and cap a relict landscape composed of 10s-of-meters-thick saprolite derived from a quartz dioritic bedrock. Erosion in the form of concave coves dissects this landscape, exposing the underlying corestones and bedrock and progressively creating a new landscape of greater local relief and higher erosion. To understand the origin of the increase in local relief we measured the respective contributions of ridges and coves to the stream signal by analyzing 10Be in soils and stream sediments. We find that, in the coves, erosion is systematically higher than on the ridges, confirming the increase in landscape dissection. Because the overall forest structure has not been altered by anthropogenic disturbances, the tree type represents a long-term feature of the landscape. We analyzed the distribution of tree associations over the LiDAR topography by classifying high-resolution multispectral images of the forest. Vegetation in the study area is dominated by Palm and Palo Colorado forests. We found an almost systematic association of the Palm forest with the coves and of the Palo Colorado with the ridges. These forest types vary in their potential to prevent or enhance soil erosion. The Palo Colorado generates greater soil coverage and rain interception rates. Therefore, we propose that soils are more vulnerable to erosion under the Palm forest, providing a positive feedback whereby the presence of the Palm forest favors the incision of the coves while the Palo Colorado forest favors the protection of the ridges, thereby increasing local relief.",

            "abstract": "Although Yellowstone’s last magmatic eruption occurred about 70,000 years ago, hydrothermal explosions, earthquakes, and ground deformation still occur as testament to ongoing volcanic and tectonic processes. Since the late 1990s, a network of continuously recording Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers has recorded uplift and subsidence of the caldera and northwest caldera margin near Norris Geyser Basin. Previous deformation episodes have shown opposing vertical motion at the two sites, which has been attributed to temporal variations in magmatic fluid flux from the caldera laterally through the Norris-Mammoth fault corridor that intersects the caldera’s northwest margin (Dzurisin et al., 2012; Wicks et al., 2006). These episodes have exhibited gradual changes, transitioning from uplift to subsidence (and vice versa) over weeks to months. Large earthquake swarms accompanied transitions from caldera uplift to subsidence in 1985 and 2010.\nRecent deformation in Yellowstone differs from previously observed episodes. In the latter half of 2013, uplift began around Norris, and by January of 2014 it reached rates of over 15 cm/yr. Also at the start of 2014, caldera deformation shifted from approximately 4 years of slow subsidence to slow uplift. On March 30, 2014, a M4.8 earthquake, the largest in Yellowstone since 1980, occurred northwest of Norris Geyser Basin near the center of uplift. Shortly after the event, deformation near Norris abruptly reversed to rapid subsidence (over 20 cm/yr). Caldera uplift began to accelerate around the same time. Thus, uplift can occur simultaneously in both the caldera and the Norris area, and dramatic reversals from rapid uplift to rapid subsidence can occur within a matter of days. While the complexity of the deformation defies a simple explanation, we hypothesize that the rapid transition from uplift to subsidence at Norris may indicate that the M4.8 earthquake opened a pathway for fluid migration away from Norris and allowed an increase in fluid flux beneath the caldera.",

            "abstract": "Landscape disturbances are important shaping agents to ecosystem processes, services and structure. When multiple disturbances occur, they create novel ecosystem trajectories. It is unknown what happens to ecosystem resiliency and services, such as carbon storage, when multiple disturbances occur in a short time period. Routt National Forest, Colorado is a subalpine forest which experienced multiple disturbances including a blowdown (1997), logging (1999-2001), fire (2002) and insects (spruce and pine beetle, multiple years). The objective of this study is to determine recovery patterns post- disturbance as they pertain to resilience and carbon storage. Recovery from a single landscape disturbance for individual species typically have a predictable response. In order to study recovery from multiple disturbances, we measured plots in 2010-2013 across the multiple disturbances. Further, we simulated plots to the year 2113 using the Forest Vegetation Simulator to quantify carbon storage. Our sampling design captured disturbance interactions, where we considered 1. fire, 2. blowdown + fire, with a gradient across blowdown severity, 3. blowdown + logging + fire, 4. beetle-kill, 5. logged + beetle kill, 6. blowdown + beetle kill, 7. logged + blowdown, and 8. control. We counted species, diameter and height of each tree within the 162 (15x15m) square plots. Results between fire and other disturbances varied by individual species. Lodgepole pine regeneration was strongly driven by other disturbances along a severity gradient. Logging prior to fire seems to create varying abiotic conditions, increasing lodgepole seedling density post-fire. Engelmann spruce regeneration was linked to the presence of aspen post-fire + other disturbances, a function of shade provided by aspen. In turn, soil moisture drives aspen regeneration. Incoming aspen seedlings aid carbon storage, recovering to pre-fire between 60-80 years, post disturbance. Upon preliminary analysis, those plots absent of fire, beetle kill impacts not only lodgepole regeneration, but spruce and aspen as well. Once again, abiotic conditions appear to drive regeneration. Carbon does not appear to recover as quickly in the absence of fire. Multiple disturbances in the subalpine compound, impacting ecosystem services and processes well into the future.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol filter samples were collected daily during summer 2013, at the Pico Mountain Observatory (PMO, 38.47°N, 28.40°W, 2,225 m a.s.l.), Azores Islands. PMO monitors free troposphere air and aerosols transported from neighboring continents; North America has the most frequent influence due to predominantly westerly winds in mid-latitude regions, while aerosols from Europe and Africa are sampled occasionally. The residence time during long-range transport in the atmosphere has a critical impact on aerosol chemical and physical properties, and it can be estimated by measuring activities of radionuclides attached to aerosols. 210Pb (t1/2 = 22.1 years) and 210Po (t1/2 = 138 days) are daughter nuclides in the decay chain of 222Rn, an inert gas species produced throughout the Earth’s crust and emitted into the atmosphere. Due to different rates of decay, the activity ratio of 210Po to 210Pb can be used to estimate atmospheric residence times of the carrier aerosols. 210Po activity counting of 58 samples was conducted to investigate aerosol residence times in this study. 210Po activity was measured twice serially for each aerosol sample to predict the initial activity of 210Po on the sampling date and the activity of very slowly decaying 210Pb. Aerosol ages calculated by the activity ratio of 210Po to 210Pb were compared with air tracer ages simulated using the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART) and studied together with aerosol particle physical properties. The activity of terrestrial radionuclides per unit of aerosol mass can also reveal source information of the aerosols. FLEXPART backward trajectories will be used to verify correlations between source regions and activity of radionuclides in aerosols. In previous research related to long-range atmospheric transport to PMO, FLEXPART has proven to be reliable in identifying upwind source regions.",

The field of view is swept electrostatically over 2.8 pi steradians with energy resolution of 4% and angular resolution of 5 x 22.5 deg. for electrons and 5 x 45 deg. for ions except over the 45-deg. sector that typically views the solar wind, within which the resolution is 5 x 5 deg. IES is part of the 5 instrument Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC). IES has been measuring solar wind ions intermittently (because of S/C pointing issues) since exiting from hibernation in May 2014. On August 5, when Rosetta was ~160 km from comet 67P, IES began to see ions at its upper energy range, ~20 keV. We identify these energetic ions as ions created from neutral species emitted by the comet nucleus, photoionized by solar UV radiation and then \"picked up\" by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). These picked up ions were seen intermittently until abstract submission time on August 7, while also measuring solar wind protons at ~600 eV. The solar wind, as expected, was from the direction of the sun, whereas the energetic ions were away from the solar direction. This is also expected for pickup ions. IES continued to follow changes in the solar wind and the development of the pickup ion structure, which will be reported in this paper.",

Here we investigate the contribution of electron precipitation to radiation belt losses, looking at not only how much loss is due to precipitation events, but what wave modes are responsible for this loss. This enables a better understanding of the contribution of individual loss mechanisms to the net response of the outer radiation belt. Through a combination of low altitude precipitation measurements and equatorial plasma and wave data, we investigate the nature and extent of MeV electron loss to the atmosphere. The role of cold plasma in mediating both the generation of electromagnetic waves as well as the interaction of these waves with MeV electrons is also investigated. These studies form a more cohesive picture of the relationship between electromagnetic waves, their source populations, and the interactions of these waves with relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt.",

This latest development is anticipated to provide improvement in the range of two orders of magnitude as compared to the measurement accuracy of technology utilized to develop ISGN-71. In this presentation, we will explore how the IGSN-71 might best be “modernized” given today’s requirements and available instruments and resources.

            "abstract": "Here we report results of two experiments designed to evaluate the utility of anthropogenic noise as a source for generating body waves via interferometry. In particular we address the suggestion that traffic noise might prove effective at producing P and S waves at frequencies and amplitudes appropriate for crustal scale refraction and reflection imaging.\nThe first experiment recorded routine traffic for about 10 days along a straight stretch of a rural highway between the towns of Elmira and Ithaca in upstate New York. The array was deployed along the highway using two different spacings: an inner segment with Δx ~ 25 m, bracketed between flanking segments with Δx ~ 100 m. In addition to strong surface waves, direct and reflected P waves were clearly apparent on most of the virtual shot gathers. These P-waves match the velocities of P-waves recorded from a conventional, small scale refraction survey carried out at the same site with a shotgun source and an engineering seismograph.\nThe second experiment was located in the Rio Grande rift near Belen New Mexico, where relatively isolated train traffic was recorded for about 6 days parallel to a busy section of the BNRF railway that bisects New Mexico. Interferometric processing of the data produced virtual shot gathers with strong surface waves, as expected, but also linear arrivals that exhibit apparent velocities similar to those reported for the shallow Tertiary-Quaternary alluvium based on the original COCORP vibroseis surveys nearby. However the virtual shot gathers derived from the train sources are more complex that those obtained from the auto noise, which we suspect is due to the extended length of the train source relative to the spread length.\nBoth experiments confirm that cultural noise can be used for subsurface imaging, though the cost effectiveness of this approach depends, among other factors, upon the total length of recording time needed to probe to depths of interest. They are both sources that clearly lend themselves to exploitation by the new generation of large N array technologies.",

            "abstract": "Leakage of CO2 from geologic carbon sequestration sites could undermine the long-term goal of reducing emissions to the atmosphere. Despite this, leakage processes, especially the vertical transport of gases through geologic formations overlaying target repositories, are poorly characterized. The goal of this work was to experimentally assess how sub-basin scale heterogeneity in overlaying formations could reduce CO2 leakage. High-pressure columns packed with sand and glass beads of different sizes were used to create a capillary barrier, which is an analog of low-permeability inter-beds. Transport of the resulting plume was recorded in real time using electrical resistivity. The effect of pressure, temperature, permeability, surface wettability, and CO2 flow rate were all assessed.\nReal-time monitoring and quantification of CO2 saturation suggests that capillary heterogeneity trapping is primarily controlled by permeability contrast, pressure, temperature and water/CO2 wettability on mineral surfaces. The amount of trapping was considerably enhanced when permeability contrasted increased, showing a good agreement with equilibrium capillary pressure - saturation analysis in the literature. Temperature and pressure controlled experiments demonstrated the sensitivity of capillary trapping to geothermal and pressure gradient. Wettability alterations also increased initial trapping when more CO2-philic materials is presented and a much greater increase in residual trapping (defined as 10 pore volume water re-imbibition). Variation of leakage rate was not shown to result in significant difference in the overall saturation values, but the stability of the trapped plume was reduced at high CO2 injection rates.\nThese results suggest that local capillary trapping could contribute to secondary trapping and slow the buoyancy-driven rise of CO2. These measurements could have important implications for minimizing risk associated with leakage from carbon sequestration sites.",

Solar wind observations indicate that the statistical properties of the turbulence agree well with the MHD turbulence simulation. In addition, recent observations show the presence of different size inertial-scale magnetic islands in the slow solar wind near the heliospheric current sheet, evidence of island merging, and of heating of ions and electrons in their vicinity. At the same time, observations in the supersonic solar wind suggest the existence of suprathermal ion spectra in the solar wind frame where the distribution function is a power law in momentum with a -5 exponent. We present a new statistical transport theory to model the acceleration of superthermal ions traversing multiple contracting and reconnecting inertial-scale quasi-2D flux ropes in the supersonic solar wind. Steady-state analytical solutions for the accelerated suprathermal particle spectrum in a radially expanding solar wind will be explored to show under what conditions one can reproduce the observed superthermal power-law slope.",

The laser instrument is based on tunable laser direct absorption in the mid-infrared. The instrument recorded a continuous 10-day carbon stable isotope data set with 30 minutes resolution directly on-site in a field-based laboratory container during a tracer experiment. To test the instruments performance and accuracy the monitoring campaign was accompanied by daily CO2 sampling for laboratory analyses with isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). The carbon stable isotope ratios measured by conventional IRMS technique and by the new mid-infrared laser spectrometer agree remarkably well within 2σ analytical precision (<0.3 ‰). This proves the capability of the new mid-infrared direct absorption technique to measure high precision and accurate real-time table isotope data directly in the field. The injected CO2 tracer had a distinct δ13C value that was largely different from the reservoir background value. The laser spectroscopy data revealed a prior to this study unknown, intensive dynamic with fast changing δ13C values. The arrival pattern of the tracer suggest that the observed fluctuations were probably caused by migration along separate and distinct preferential flow paths between injection well and observation well. The new technique might contribute to a better tracing of the migration of the underground CO2 plume and help to ensure the long-term integrity of the reservoir.",

            "abstract": "Rivers are the largest suppliers of particulate material to the world ocean, and we must understand the dynamics of tidal river and shallow coastal environments in order to contrast and constrain the sediment budgets of major rivers and their adjacent marine sinks. Studies in large tropical tidal rivers elucidate the processes in these regions that modify the source signal of sediment particles to nearshore environments and vegetated shorelines. Here we focus on processes within the river mouth region of the Amazon and Mekong tidal rivers in order to understand the modulation of sediment-transport signals (magnitude, grain size, pathways) between the river mouth regions and coastal environments.\nThe immense Amazon River mouth experiences no salinity effects (e.g., buoyancy driven flows, physiochemical aggregation) as estuarine processes occur offshore. Mouth channel-bed morphology is variable, and although near surface suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) is relatively constant across the 15-km distributary width, near-bed SSC ranges widely over the tidal cycle depending on sub-channel sediment routing. Sediment pathways differ between ebb and flood conditions inducing a spatially and temporally heterogeneous supply of sediment to the nearshore. In the Mekong River, the mouth region changes from salt-wedge conditions to a partially mixed estuary with seasonal discharge, and there has been an anthropogenic reduction in connections between river and intertidal floodplains. SSC varies throughout the water column and is seasonally modified by estuarine processes. Differences between ebb and flood flows and sediment pathways within and between distributary channels are important to the overall sediment budget, and water-column processes seasonally modify the characteristics of the river bed. These two river-mouth systems differ in channel morphology and sediment-transport mechanisms. Both systems, however, deliver sediment to the nearshore in a spatially and temporally variable manner that is modulated by tidal-river processes. Climate change, sea-level rise, and increased anthropogenic modification of the shoreline necessitate increased understanding of the linkages between processes in the river and those on the adjacent coast.",

In this environment the breakdown of the rocks and the subsequent transportation are so slow that many of the chips can still be observed next to the boulder and in case of a locally rare lithology they form a distinct trail downslope of the source boulder. In McMurdo Dry Valleys we observed tens of in situ weathering boulders that had distinct chips on the downhill side forming a trail.\nWe found that the length of the dispersal patterns generally increase with the slope angle. We modeled the weathering rates of source boulders and resulting fragments, and the transport rates, constrained by observations of dispersal patterns and fragment characteristics. We determined that the source boulders spall a fragment over 250 times more often than the resulting fragment re-breaks.",

Standard metadata and data formats play a critical role in simplifying this process and freeing significant time for analysis and science.\nWhen combined with community specific conventions and application-specific semantics, the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) and software provide a robust and reliable foundation that many scientific communities currently rely on for interoperability and high-performance storage of metadata and data.\nHDF is currently being used in national science facilities all over the world to standardize data access and share data across observational communities with demanding data and computing requirements. In many of these situations HDF is the standard format underlying community standard formats with other names. In addition, HDF is supported or used transparently by many open-source and commercial data management and analysis tools and forms the basis for building sustainable archives in many communities.\nThe HDF foundation addresses many technical obstacles related to sustainable data and software, critical steps towards data reuse and sustainable science. The next step is identifying individuals and organizations that are already using HDF successfully and bringing them together to share experiences and best practices. This presentation is a call to action to take that next step.\n ",

            "abstract": "This presentation discusses results of a project to develop a near real time flood monitoring capability for the Lower Mekong Water Basin (LMB), the largest river basin in Southeast Asia and home to more than sixty million people. The region has seen rapid population growth and socio-economic development, fueling unsustainable deforestation, agricultural expansion, and stream-flow regulation. The basin supports substantial rice farming and other agrarian activities, which heavily depend upon seasonal flooding. But, floods due to typhoons and other severe weather events can result in disasters that cost millions of dollars and cause hardships to millions of people. This study uses near real time and historical Aqua and Terra MODIS 250-m resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products to map flood and drought impact within the LMB. In doing so, NDVI change products are derived by comparing from NDVI during the wet season to a baseline NDVI from the dry season. The method records flood events, which cause drastic decreases in NDVI compared to non-flooded conditions. NDVI change product computation was automated for updating a near real-time system, as part of the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites Disaster Risk Management Observation Strategy. The system is a web-based ‘Flood Dashboard that will showcase MODIS flood monitoring products, along with other flood mapping and weather data products. This flood dashboard enables end-users to view and assess a variety of geospatial data to monitor floods and flood impacts in near real-time, as well provides a platform for further data aggregation for flood prediction modeling and post-event assessment.",

            "abstract": "Microbial streamers are productive elements of surface-attached microbial communities that paradoxically seem to roughen mats under rapid, high shear flows, potentially exposing the mat to greater risk of erosion. They are common features found in modern hot-spring outflow channels, yet their formation mechanisms and effects on mat erosion are poorly understood. We test a hypothesis that streamers are produced by shear-induced viscoelastic deformation, and that streamers grow to heal detached turbulent boundary layers. Laboratory flume experiments were conducted using Particle Image/Tracking Velocimetry (PIV/PTV) to gain quantitative insights into the behavior of flows around small projections constructed from 3D-printed plastics or hydrated EPS gels, as well as artificial streamers. The combined use of fabricated hard and viscoelastic shapes, tracer particles, sheet lasers and high speed cameras allowed visualization of flows and quantitative measurements. Results show that primary and secondary flows (backflow behind projections) combine to produce deformations that drive the elongation of the top and ultimately initiate streamer formation. With insufficient secondary flows, streamers are not able to rise up from the basal mat. This implies that a combination of sufficient topographic relief and flow strength is required for streamers to form. In addition, flow measurements indicate that the presence of artificial streamers made the surface hydraulically smoother, and in effect reducing bed shear at the base. These results suggest a novel set of feedbacks that could reduce net mat erosion in energetic flows, and could help guide the evaluation of biosignatures in sedimentary rocks deposited in the presence of microbial mats.",

On a polar orbit, PACE will make climate-quality global measurements that are essential for understanding ocean biology, biogeochemistry and ecology, and determining how the ocean’s role in global biogeochemical cycling and ocean ecology both affects and is affected by climate change.\nWith advanced global remote sensing capabilities that include high spectral-resolution imaging, extended spectral coverage to the UV and SWIR, improved spatial resolution in inland, estuarine and coastal waters, enhanced atmospheric correction and higher signal-to-noise, PACE is expected to provide high quality observations that, over the long-term, will contribute to an extended time series of records on inland, coastal, and ocean ecosystems—all of which have substantial value beyond basic science and research. The combination of climate-quality, global atmospheric and oceanic observations provided by the PACE mission will provide a unique capability to help understand changes that affect our ecosystem services, implement science-based management strategies of coastal, marine and inland aquatic resources, and support assessments, policy analyses, and design approaches to plan adaptation and responses to impacts of climate change.

            "abstract": "By harvesting solar energy and converting it to chemical energy, photosynthetic life plays an important role in the energy budget of Earth [2]. This leads to alterations of chemical reservoirs eventually affecting the Earth’s interior [4]. It further has been speculated [3] that the formation of continents may be a consequence of the evolution life. A steady state model [1] suggests that the Earth without its biosphere would evolve to a steady state with a smaller continent coverage and a dryer mantle than is observed today.\nWe present a model including (i) parameterized thermal evolution, (ii) continental growth and destruction, and (iii) mantle water regassing and outgassing. The biosphere enhances the production rate of sediments which eventually are subducted. These sediments are assumed to (i) carry water to depth bound in stable mineral phases and (ii) have the potential to suppress shallow dewatering of the underlying sediments and crust due to their low permeability. We run a Monte Carlo simulation for various initial conditions and treat all those parameter combinations as success which result in the fraction of continental crust coverage observed for present day Earth. Finally, we simulate the evolution of an abiotic Earth using the same set of parameters but a reduced rate of continental weathering and erosion.\nOur results suggest that the origin and evolution of life could have stabilized the large continental surface area of the Earth and its wet mantle, leading to the relatively low mantle viscosity we observe at present. Without photosynthetic life on our planet, the Earth would be geodynamical less active due to a dryer mantle, and would have a smaller fraction of continental coverage than observed today.\n",

New capabilities now provide the first controlled laboratory-based experiments into this pressure range. Described here are new ramp compression experiments, revealing the mechanical and structural properties of solids to 50 million atmospheres, and shock compression experiments exploring the properties of dense fluids (equation of state and transport) from Mbar to near Gbar pressures.

            "abstract": "The goal is to illustrate the hydroclimatology of extreme droughts and floods, in the Northern High Plains (NHP). The state of Nebraska has the largest number of irrigated acres in the US by state; thus is exceedingly dependent on the availability of groundwater. Regions along the great Ogallala aquifer have already experienced a dramatic reduction of groundwater with most areas seeing water table drops of 10-50 feet in depth, with several recorded drops of over 100 feet. Finite groundwater resources availability challenges agroecosystems and ecosystem sustainability, leaving productive areas subject to the availability of surface water. However, our understanding on the predictability of extreme events is still limited. Thus our question is: What is the sensitivity of the NHP to extreme droughts and floods? Duration, frequency, and the area of influence of floods and droughts vary but can occur at the same time in different regions or at different times in the same region. Our objective is to (a) identify spatiotemporal patterns of variability of floods and droughts in NHP’s land surface hydrology (LSH); and (b) account for the spatiotemporal impacts of deficits and surpluses of water at the basin-scale. The hypothesis is that areas of influence and the associated duration of droughts and floods will be more sensitive to different LSH variables and state variables than to the statistical approaches used to analyze them. To test the present hypothesis we will use gridded observed (precipitation) and simulated LSH variables (runoff, baseflow, and soil moisture) on the Platte River Basin. Precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures, and wind speed force the Variable infiltration Capacity model at 1/16th degree resolution from 1950 to 2013. Drought indices based on percentiles estimated from Gamma, General Extreme Value, and Gumble distribution functions are estimated using daily observed and simulated variables for the domains and timespans mentioned above. Preliminary results using percentiles of soil moisture show that wetter sub-basins exhibit greater moisture changes than drier sub-basins during dry extremes. Results will contribute to improve predictability of extreme drought and flood events and their effects on water resources across scales.",

            "abstract": "Diamond crystals from three North American kimberlite occurrences were investigated with cathodoluminescence (CL) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to determine their growth history, carbon isotope composition and nitrogen content. Samples analyzed include sixteen from Lynx (Quebec), twelve from Kelsey Lake (Colorado) and eighteen from A154 South (Diavik mine, Northwest Territories).  Growth histories for the samples vary from simple to highly complex based on their CL images and depending on the individual stone. Deformation lamellae are evident in CL images of the Lynx crystals which typically are brownish in color. Two to five points per diamond were analyzed by SIMS for carbon isotope composition (δ13CPDB) and three to seven points for nitrogen content. The results for the A154 South (δ13CPDB = -6.76 to -1.68 ‰) and Kelsey Lake (δ13CPDB = -11.81 to -2.43 ‰) stones (mixed peridotitic and eclogitic suites) are similar to earlier reported values. The Lynx kimberlite stones have anomalously high carbon isotope ratios and range from -3.58 to +1.74 ‰. The Lynx diamond suite is almost entirely peridotitic. The unusually high (i.e. >-5‰) δ13C values of the Lynx diamonds, as well as those from Wawa, Ontario and Renard, Quebec, may indicate an anomalous carbon reservoir for the Superior cratonic mantle relative  to other cratons. In addition to the heavier carbon isotope values, the Lynx samples have very low nitrogen contents (<100 ppm). Nitrogen contents for Kelsey Lake and Diavik samples are more typical and range to ~1100 ppm. Comparison of observed core to rim variations in nitrogen content and carbon isotopes with modeled Rayleigh fractionation trends for published diamond growth mechanisms allows for evaluation of carbon speciation and other parent fluid conditions. Observed trends that closely follow modeled data are rare, but appear to suggest diamond growth from carbonate-bearing fluids at Lynx and Diavik, and growth from a methane-bearing fluid at Kelsey Lake. However the majority of crystals appear to have very complex growth histories that are clearly the result of multiple growth and resorption events. Trends observed in most of the samples from this study are chaotic and no consistent patterns are seen.",

The plasma parameters of the dusk-to-dawn drifting arc and surrounding ionosphere are extracted using the volumetric imaging capabilities of the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar – North (RISR–N). Multipoint, line-of-sight plasma drift measurements are used to construct an image of the field-aligned-current system of the arc. Overlaid with red-line and green-line optical data, the current system is shown to be consistent with what is expected of an arc; namely, an upward field-aligned-current lies within the optical body of the arc, and the corresponding downward current lies adjacent to the arc. In this event, the signature of the latter is identifiable by a zonally narrow and meridionally extended F-region plasma density trough of significant magnitude situated along the leading edge of the arc. The trough is sustained by a convolution of chemical recombination and current closure in the field-aligned-current system, and maintains its orientation and position on the leading edge of the arc for the duration of its transit through the RISR-N field-of-view.",

            "abstract": "The variability of daily runoff has direct consequences on water availability, flood hazard, ecosystem function, and erosional processes. One component to predicting runoff variability is solid understanding of soil moisture dynamics and the runoff response to rainfall events. By using a point-scale soil water balance model that accounts for vegetation and soil properties, we test how daily rainfall statistics and vegetation response to water availability affect mean hydrologic partitioning and the runoff response during rare storms. Simulations span a transect in mean annual precipitation (MAP) from 200 to 1200 mm/year and are motivated by analysis of a long-term observational network of rainfall in the contiguous U.S. Whether driven by higher storm depths or increased frequency of storm arrivals, increases in MAP always lead to more fractional runoff generation due to the synchronous increase in mean antecedent soil moisture and probability of large rainfall events. Simulations also show that at any given MAP, there are important tradeoffs between increasing the probability of large rainfall events and associated decreases in the mean soil moisture state.\nResults from this ecohydrologic analysis are then used to drive 1-D simulations of the longitudinal river profile that account for runoff variability and thresholds to incision. We show that in natural settings where long-term hydrologic observations are available and where millennial-scale erosion rates were measured, much of the observed variation between local relief and long-term erosion rates can be explained by combining these two relatively simple models. However, we also show that large differences in MAP often lead to comparatively small differences in the geomorphically effective climate. This partially explains why prior studies have struggled to isolate a climatic control on long-term erosion rates. Expectations for how vegetation influences landscape evolution are often based on the seminal work by Langbein and Schumm (1958) which argues that vegetation introduces negative feedbacks between climate and erosion by stabilizing and protecting the hillslopes. Alternatively, we hypothesize that the role of vegetation in altering hydrologic partitioning may be its most diagnostic imprint on fluvial landscape form and function.",

            "abstract": "Moist convection is characterized by complex interactions between dynamics and thermodynamics. As air parcels within the atmosphere, they experience multiple thermodynamic transformations, such as compression and expansion, diabatic heating and cooling, condensation and mixing. These transformations correspond to those of a heat engine that produces kinetic energy while transporting energy from a warm source to a colder sink. This atmospheric heat engine is however directly affected by moist processes. First, falling precipitation acts as a break on the circulation by dissipating a significant amount of kinetic energy. Second, evaporation of unsaturated water and diffusion of water vapor are irrevesible processes that also reduce the amount of work that can be produced. An important challenge is to quantify the impacts that these two effects have on the generation of kinetic energy.\nHere, I will introduce a new technique - the Mean Air Flow As Lagragian Dynamics Approximation (MAFALDA) - that can be used to systematically analyze the thermodynamic behavior of complex atmospheric flows. This approach relies on sorting the upward mass transport in terms of the equivalent potential temperature of the air parcels to obtain an isentropic streamfunction. This streamfunction is then used to determine the thermodynamic evolution of air parcels as they move through the atmosphere. This approach is applied to analyze how convective systems would behave in a warmer climate. It is shown that an increase in atmospheric temperature lead to a significant increase of the amount of kinetic energy that is produced per unit of mass of air transported. At the same time, the total generation of kinetic energy is only slightly affected. Taken together, these findings imply that, in a warming atmosphere, the number of intense convective events will be reduced, while their intensity should increase. I will also discuss the new possibility of systematically studying the thermodynamic transformation in atmospheric models.",

            "abstract": "The shallow mantle is, except in extremely thin and hot plates, the stronger part of the lithosphere and hence a key layer for understanding plate tectonics. We will present mechanical and microstructural data (EBSD and TEM) from deformation experiments on olivine single crystals and polycrystals performed at low temperature (850-1100°C) and moderate pressure (300 MPa) under dry conditions. These results indicate that the shallow lithospheric mantle may deform by dislocation-based processes at much lower stresses than those predicted from the extrapolation of high-temperature experimental data for olivine. Although the experiments show heterogeneous mechanical behaviors, with hardening, the microstructural observations highlight that, even at the high strain rate of the experimental conditions, recovery processes are at play, suggesting that in nature, at lower strain rates and higher pressure, hardening by dislocation entanglement might be counteracted. Consistently, mantle rocks deformed in natural shear zones active at temperatures 850-900°C show microstructures characterized by coarse recrystallized grain sizes (≥100µm) and strong crystal preferred orientations, which are consistent with deformation dominantly by dislocation creep at rather low stresses (<100MPa). Based on our experimental results and on a compilation of previously published data on olivine deformation between 500 and 1000 °C, we propose a new semi-empirical exponential flow law, which might represent an upper limit to the uppermost mantle strength. Such a low strength shallow mantle lithosphere suggests a higher equilibrium recrystallized grain sizes, and less shear heating; further geodynamic implications will then be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The liquid-equivalent snow rate (SR) quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) using radar (both ground-base and satellite) is very important component of GPM research. Winter storms can have with different type of precipitations such as, pristine ice crystal, sleet, graupel-like snow, rimed and aggregated snow, and each type of precipitations have very different micro-physical properties (e.g. size, density, fall speed, dielectric constant), to estimate SR accurately using radar becomes a challenge. The first step to get a proper estimator from radar observations is the precipitation classification. The form of different winter precipitation relates to the environment especially the temperature and humidity. In addition, the different precipitation type also correspond to different shape and density resulting in different fall speeds.\nRecent research shows that 2DVD is able to observe winter precipitation successfully. The 2DVD can measure the fall speed of each particle falling into its observing area, and provide the contours from two orthogonal views. It is straight forward to estimate the diameter of snowflake from two views of 2DVD and compute the particle size distribution (PSD). In order to classify the different type of precipitation, we must not only estimate the diameter but also define several geometric features. In this paper we explore a technique to estimate features from the contours of 2D-Video images.\nIn this paper, we analyze observations from two GPM winter campaigns namely, GCPEX and LPVEX. From these data sets , we derive the to get the statistics of fall speed and geometric features developed in this paper. Subsequently these are used to classify winter precipitation into four catalogs, namely rain, sleet, graupel-like snow and fluffy snow (may form by aggregation or aggregation with riming). We apply this procedure to two GCPEx cases which mixed with different type of precipitation in different time interval. Since we are using the contouring data and fall speed, this procedure may also apply to other image instruments which are capable to measure the fall speed such as the hydrometeor velocity and shape detector (HVSD) or Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC). Subsequently these classifications are used in the assumptions to simulate radar observations.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence to suggest that the pervasive incision seen in the American West is due, in part, to the removal of beaver (Castor canadensis) in the first half of the 19th century. New restoration strategies for these systems focus on the reintroduction of beaver and construction of beaver dam analogs. Such dams locally raise streams beds and water tables, reconnect incised channels to their former floodplains, trap sediment, increase hydraulic diversity, and promote riparian vegetation.\nHowever, the geomorphic and hydrologic impacts of both the original beaver dams and their analogs are poorly understood. Observations in the Silvies River basin in Oregon, USA - an upland, semi-arid catchment with extremely high historic beaver populations and a presently recovering population, inform a conceptual model for valley floor evolution with beaver dams. The evolution of the beaver dam complex is characterized by eight stages of morphologic adjustment: water impoundment, sediment deposition, pond filling, multi-thread meadow creation, dam breaching, channel incision, channel widening, and floodplain development. Well-constructed beaver dams, given sufficient time and sediment flux, will evolve from a series of ponds to a multi-threaded channel flowing through a wet meadow complex. If a dam in the system fails, due to overtopping, undercutting, lack of maintenance, or abandonment, the upstream channel will concentrate into a single channel and incise, followed over time by widening once critical bank heights are exceeded.\nFrom stratigraphic, dendrochronologic, and geomorphic measurements, we are constraining average timescales associated with each stage’s duration and transitional period. Measured sedimentation rates behind modern beaver dam analogs on five stream systems permit calculation of sediment flux over recent time periods, and aid in developing regional rates of sediment deposition over a range of drainage areas and gradients. Stratigraphic and dendrochronologic records provide insight into rates of incision, widening, and floodplain development. These measurements are leading to an understanding of the timescales associated with each morphologic stage and transition period, as well as the long-term implications of reintroducing beaver into a wide range of stream systems.",

The plant biomass and productivity sampling design is also critical to maximizing the utility of flux and soil measurements that are part of the Terrestrial Instrument System, as well as spectrometer and LiDAR measurements made by the Airborne Observation Platform, and the design explicitly states how these links are created. The plant biomass and productivity sampling falls into three main categories: 1) aboveground vegetation sampling; 2) belowground vegetation sampling; and 3) LAI sampling. Here, we describe the basic components of the sampling design associated with these three categories, and how sampling is standardized across very different suites of measurements. At the coarsest level, each terrestrial NEON site will support plant biomass and productivity measurements in three types of plots: Distributed plots located throughout the site, Gradient plots that capture site-level differences in important plant biophysical variables, and Tower plots that will enable a fine-grain partitioning of annual net primary productivity across different vegetation components. We also discuss how the timing of vegetation sampling will be standardized across the Observatory so that interannual variation in response variables can best be interpreted. Data from this sampling design will produce a long-term record of how plant biomass stocks and fluxes respond to change drivers at site, regional, and continental spatial scales.

However, physical/optical access to plume gases along pathways which include a suitable natural or active IR radiation source is often difficult or impossible to achieve, particularly for timeframes extending beyond short campaign periods.  In this study, we present results from preliminary tests conducted on three volcanic CO2 plume emissions using a tunable diode NIR laser system (TDL, Boreal Laser Inc.).  \nThe approach is proving itself as a good candidate for continuous monitoring of volcanic plume CO2, and by default all other IR-active constituents for which lasers of appropriate wavelength are available.  The CO2 system is configured with a TDL in a transceiver generating laser light which can be tuned to coincide with one of several absorption lines in the CO2 absorption band between 1575 nm and 1585 nm. This beam propagates through the atmosphere (and plume) to a retro-reflector, which returns the beam to a photodiode detector in the transceiver which processes the signal to report real time CO2 column densities.\n The CO2 absorption line at 1579.1 nm was used to good effect on Mt Ruapehu (NZ) where volcanic gases emanate through a 100 m deep crater lake, resulting in CO2 concentrations of > 78 ppm above background in the mixing zone varying from 4 to 30 m above the lake surface.  Subsequent tests on the main plume at White Island, however, generated only poor results with indicated CO2 amounts being less than atmospheric. We concluded that this was the result of interference from a neighboring but comparatively minor H2O absorption band which in the proximal, higher temperature plume (estimated 50-70 °C), had H2O concentrations some 4-5 times greater than ambient. A change to a less sensitive absorption line further removed from potential H2O band interference (1567.9 nm) appears to have solved this problem, and yielded maximum CO2 concentrations along the 730 m pathway in excess of 500 ppm.\nThis approach holds promise for continuous, real-time monitoring of volcanic plume chemistry, and we will now turn our focus to the detection of SO2, HCl and HF plume species.

            "abstract": "Engineering community is increasingly moving towards the use of data from seismic networks in the design and evaluation of structures. While such an approach could yield an increasingly realistic design process, there are also significant risks to the use of strong motion suites for the prediction of seismic response of structures. Inherent in any process are the common mistakes about the selection of assumptions, dependent on the user's constraints as well as knowledge and experience. However, the variability in the ground motion suite introduces an even more significant uncertainty to the process affecting the prediction. The effect of the variability in the ground motions on the predicted performance of urban infrastructure is significant and therefore requires a careful selection of ground motion suite from existing seismic networks as well as a statistically relevant methodology for the refinement of the results of such analyses. For gravity dams, the concern about the selection of the motions is even greater, as the expected variability in the performance of the structure is significantly higher due to the brittle response of the material.\nSpectral acceleration, the response of a single degree of freedom system to a ground motion recording, is the most commonly used ground motion index for determining the performance of a structure. However, this index is ineffective for the prediction of damage on gravity dams. In this context, the primary goal of this study is to determine the significant properties of ground motion recordings that are effective in determining the damage occurring on gravity dams during earthquakes. Common ground motion selection algorithms are compared in order to provide the practitioners with guidelines on the use of a ground motion suite for the prediction of the seismic response of gravity dams. A significant number of nonlinear finite element analyses were performed with 70 different ground motion recordings on three different dam geometries in order to identify the effect of the interaction of the frequency and the duration content of the motion and the system properties on the seismic response. A new approach for the selection of the ground motion suite for the evaluation of the performance of gravity dams is suggested based on the statistical analysis of the large pool of combined results.",

            "abstract": "With increasingly widespread use of weather radars, multiple radar-based QPEs are now routinely available in many places. In the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex (DFW), for example, the Multisensor Precipitation Estimator (MPE), Q2 (Next Generation QPE) and CASA (Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of Atmosphere) QPEs are available. Because these products are based on different radar systems, different sources of additional information, and/or processing algorithms, they have different error characteristics and spatiotemporal resolutions. In this work, we explore improving the accuracy of the highest-resolution radar QPE by fusing it with lower-resolution QPE(s). Two approaches are examined. The first is to pose fusion as a Fisher estimation problem in which the state vector is the true unknown precipitation at the highest resolution and the observation vector is made of all radar QPEs at their native resolutions. The second is to upscale the higher resolution QPE(s) to the lowest resolution, merge them via optimal estimation, and disaggregate the merged estimates based on the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation in the high resolution QPE. In both approaches, we compare Fisher estimation with conditional bias-penalized Fisher-like estimation which improves estimation of heavy-to-extreme precipitation. For evaluation, we compare the precipitation estimates from the two approaches with rain gauge observations in the DFW area.",

            "abstract": "Sustainability analyses of futuristic plausible land use and climate change scenarios are critical in making watershed-scale decisions for simultaneous improvement of food, energy and water management. Bioenergy production targets for the US are anticipated to impact farming practices through the introduction of fast growing and high yielding perennial grasses/trees, and use of crop residues as bioenergy feedstocks. These land use/land management changes raise concern over potential environmental impacts of bioenergy crop production scenarios, both in terms of water availability and water quality; impacts that may be exacerbated by climate variability and change. The objective of the study was to assess environmental, economic and biodiversity sustainability of plausible bioenergy scenarios for two watersheds in Midwest US under changing climate scenarios. The study considers fourteen sustainability indicators under nine climate change scenarios from World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP's) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3). The distributed hydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was used to simulate perennial bioenergy crops such as Miscanthus and switchgrass, and corn stover removal at various removal rates and their impacts on hydrology and water quality. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) developed to evaluate stream fish response to hydrology and water quality changes associated with land use change were used to quantify biodiversity sustainability of various bioenergy scenarios. The watershed-scale sustainability analysis was done in the St. Joseph River watershed located in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio; and the Wildcat Creek watershed, located in Indiana. The results indicate streamflow reduction at watershed outlet with increased evapotranspiration demands for high-yielding perennial grasses. Bioenergy crops in general improved in-stream water quality compared to conventional cropping systems (maize-soybean). Water quality benefits due to land use change were generally greater than the effects of climate change variability.",

            "abstract": "To maximize offshore wind energy generation it is critical to have a comprehensive understanding of all atmospheric and oceanic parameters that could affect any part of the wind turbine system; prime of which is ambient turbulence intensity (TI), a measure of the degree of fluctuations about the mean wind speed within the three dimensional wind field (σU, standard deviation of wind speed). A wealth of data from nine meteorological towers located between 7 and 111 kilometers offshore in the Irish and North Seas were used to investigate the dependencies of TI and σU on wind speed, height, wind direction (θ) and fetch. The average turbulence intensity at 50m ranged from 6.32% to 7.44%, with TI decreasing with distance from the coast until 40-50 kilometers after which TI interestingly began to increase. In fact, when examining TI as a function of wind direction, TI was largest in sectors with fetch greater than 100-200 km and smallest in land sectors. Additional factors that influenced the TI dependency on θ, especially in the sites with reduced fetch, were coastal orientation, inland topography and atmospheric stability.\nDissimilar to the relationships indicated in the IEC 61400-3 standards, σU is not linear, and TI not monotonically decreasing as a function of wind speed. Instead there is a height-dependent wind speed bin, between 8-14 m/s, where the transition from thermally- to mechanically-generated turbulence occurs. When comparing plots of σU and TI versus wind speed for all of the masts at various heights, it can be seen that there is near ubiquitous agreement between the masts. This implies that when averaging over all wind directions, these relationships are universal throughout Northern Europe.\nThe vertical profiles of σU and TI are highly susceptible to different wind regimes. At low wind speeds σU and TI are nearly uniform with height, likely a result of the well-mixed nature of thermally-driven turbulence. At high wind speeds a strong, nearly linear decrease with height is realized resulting from the air-sea interface that generates the mechanically-driven turbulence. Strong similarities exist in these vertical profiles and the TI versus θ plots between masts within similar geographic regions, indicating that throughout these regions similar turbulence characteristics can be expected.",

            "abstract": "High-precision Ar/Ar ages were generated for late Quaternary volcanic fields in the Rio Grande rift and along the Jemez Lineament, New Mexico, to assess the time-space patterns of volcanism and begin quantifying volcanic hazards for the region. The published chronology of most late Quaternary volcanic centers in the region is not sufficiently precise, accurate, or complete for a comprehensive volcanic hazard assessment. Ar/Ar ages generated as part of this study were determined using the high-sensitivity, multi-collector ARGUS VI mass spectrometer, which provides about an order of magnitude more precise isotopic measurements compared to older generation, single-detector mass spectrometers. Ar/Ar ages suggest an apparent increase in eruption frequency during the late Quaternary within the Raton-Clayton volcanic field, northeastern NM. Only four volcanoes erupted between 426±8 and 97±3 ka. Contrastingly, four volcanoes erupted between 55±2 and 32±5 ka. This last eruptive phase displays a west to east migration of volcanism, has repose periods of 0 to 17 ka, and an average recurrence rate of 1 eruption per 5750 ka. The Zuni-Bandera volcanic field, west-central NM, is composed of the ~100 late Quaternary basaltic vents. Preliminary results suggest that most of the Chain of Craters, the largest and oldest part of the Zuni-Bandera field, erupted between ~100 and 250 ka. Volcanism then migrated to the east, where published ages indicate at least seven eruptions between 50 and 3 ka. Both volcanic fields display a west to east migration of volcanism during the last ~500 ka, although the pattern is more pronounced in the Zuni-Bandera field. A reassessment of low-precision published ages for other late Quaternary volcanic fields in region indicates that most fields display a similar west to east migration of volcanism during the last ~500 ka. One possible mechanism to explain the observed patterns of volcanism is the westward migration of the North American plate relative to the upwelling asthenosphere, the ultimate source of late Quaternary magmas. New Ar/Ar ages demonstrate the unprecedented capabilities of the ARGUS VI mass spectrometer. Ongoing research is determining ages at all late Quaternary centers in the region, further quantifying the west to east migration of volcanism observed at most fields and volcanic hazards.",

Most tool designs utilize strong permanent magnets in order to achieve sufficient S/N, this has the side effect that the measured NMR phenomenon occur in the presence of a constant static-field gradient\n(∇\nB\n0\n)\n. The gradient can be exploited, using enhanced diffusion methods (EDM), in order to measure the temperature-dependent effective diffusion (\nD\neff\n(T)\n) constant of the investigated fluids. EDM have proven to be powerful and reliable techniques for fluid-type discrimination.In water-only samples deviation of the apparent diffusion from the intrinsic molecular diffusion coefficient of water\n(\nD\nw\n(T))\nis primarily controlled by restricted diffusion--the physical obstruction of spins which impedes free diffusion within the gradient.\nThe ability to relate hydraulic conductivity to NMR measurements is of fundamental interest in hydrogeophysics.

            "abstract": "The presence and valuation of risk are commonalities that link the diverse fields of climate change science and policy, environmental conservation, and the financial/investment sector. However, the definition and perception of risks vary widely across these critically linked fields. The “Stranded Asset” concept developed by organizations like the Carbon Tracker Initiative begins to elucidate the links between climate change risk and financial risk. Stranded assets are those that may lose some or all value from climate disruption, changes in demand-side dynamics and/or a more stringent regulatory environment. In order to shift financial flows toward climate change mitigation, emissions-heavy activities that present finance and investment opportunities must also be assessed for their GHG-asset risk attributes in terms of their contribution and vulnerability to climate disruption, as well as other environmental externalities. Until the concept of GHG-asset risk in investment is reconciled with the risks of climate change and environmental conservation, it will not be possible to shift business and financial practices, and unlock private sector resources to address the climate change and conservation challenge.\n UNEP-FI is researching the application of the concept of Value-atRisk (VaR) to explore links between the financial sector and deforestation/REDD+. The research will test the hypothesis that climate risk is a financial risk, and propose tools to identify and quantify risks associated with unsustainable land-use investments. The tools developed in this research will help investors, managers and governments assess their exposures to the material REDD-related risks in their portfolios. This will inform the development of ‘zero net deforestation’ investment indices to allow investors to lower the ‘deforestation’ exposure of ‘benchmark’ financial indices used by many of the largest money managers. A VaR analysis will be performed, combining the notion of externality with the traditional approach of external (exogenous) risk analysis. The VaR component introduces probabilities for different scenarios and may ultimately lead to a full distribution for the holistic losses. These distributions are non-parametric and non-linear since climate change is an “event-risk”.",

            "abstract": "How fast magnetic energy release is triggered and occurs in high Lundquist (S) and high Reynolds number ( R ) plasmas such as that of the solar corona is a fundamental problem for understanding phenomena ranging from coronal heating to flares and CMEs. Diffusion or collisional reconnection driven by macroscopic flows in quasi-steady Sweet-Parker (SP) current sheets are processes far too slow to fit observational data. Spontaneous reconnection, driven by the onset of the tearing instability inside current sheets, provides an alternative paradigm to SP reconnection. Nevertheless, as long as macroscopic current layers are considered, the growth of such an instability is also a slow process. Recently it has been shown that SP current sheets are rapidly unstable in high S plasmas, indeed have a growth rate diverging with increasing S. It has been suggested that such instabilities are triggered during the nonlinear stage of the primary tearing instability of a macroscopic layer. The formation of plasmoids in this presumed SP sheet speeds up the reconnection rate to ideal values. Recently, we have suggested that SP sheets can not be realized in quasi-ideal plasmas, and that the plasmoid instability is triggered on a much larger scale (i.e. with current sheets having a much larger ration of thickness to length than SP). Here we present a linear parametric study of the tearing instability for a Harris current sheet, while taking into account both viscosity and current sheets of variable aspect ratios. The present study shows that an explosive growth of the reconnection rate may be reached during the linear stage, once a critical width of the current layer is reached. In the absence of a strong guide field this depends on viscosity and a range of critical aspect ratios can be found for different values of S, R, or S and Prandtl number.",

Here we test predictions in central Texas in a six-year experiment that compares mixtures of all exotic or all native species under two summer irrigation treatments (128 or 0 mm) that varies the amount of summer drought stress. A major drought (precipitation of 41% of normal) occurred in year 4 (2011), allowing a “natural experiment” test of how treatments affect drought resistance and recovery. Peak biomass was only 8% of pre-drought values in the drought year of 2011. Biomass resistance (drought/pre-drought biomass) and resilience (post-drought/pre-drought biomass) were similar among treatments. Native communities lost fewer species during the drought, and recovered more species after the drought than exotic communities. Over time, the responses in peak biomass to summer irrigation changed between native and exotic communities, with initially large responses in exotic communities in year 1 diminishing to non-significant responses by years 5 and 6. Native communities on the other hand, showed a small response to summer irrigation in year 1, but this response grew to become a large increase with irrigation by years 4-6. Reduced response to summer irrigation in exotic communities were associated with reduced species diversity and shifts in species composition towards C4 grasses. The differential effects of the drought indicate that non-native species will alter grassland community responses to drought events.",

            "abstract": "The cranberry industry occupies a unique place in the history of southeastern Massachusetts, where commercial production of cranberries has existed for nearly two centuries. Currently, water quality represents one of the greatest challenges facing the industry, with federal regulations limiting the use of phosphorus (P) fertilizer via total maximum daily load (TMDL) implementation. In response to environmental concerns, cranberry growers have decreased their annual P fertilizer application rates by a factor of four, from ~40 kg P ha-1 in the early 1970s to ~10 kg P ha-1 in 2013. Despite these industry-wide reductions, legacy P derived from periods of high P fertilizer application likely make cranberry farms non-point sources of P to surface water. In this study, concentrations and export of P were determined to characterize the sources and transport pathways of P in harvest floodwaters for four cranberry farms. Among the sites, a general pattern emerged of sharp increases in concentrations of total dissolved P (TDP) and total particulate P (TPP) during the later part of the flood release. Differences in the exact timing of increases in TDP and TPP were interpreted to represent distinct transport pathways: (1) near-surface transport of TDP derived from soils, and (2) subsurface transport of TPP resulting from resuspension and erosion of ditch sediments. Values of total P (TP = TDP + TPP) export were relatively low for three sites (0.3-0.8 kg P ha-1) and high for one site (5.3 kg P ha-1). Export of TP from the high-P site accounted for roughly half of the annual value allocated to cranberry farms in a recent TMDL. Historical P fertilizer records from 2005-2013 showed similar present-day application rates among the sites (~10 kg P ha-1), but higher rates between 2005 and 2007 for the high-P site (30 vs. 10 kg P ha-1). Although other factors likely contribute, legacy P derived from past fertilizer applications imparts an important control on P export in cranberry floodwaters.",

            "abstract": "The conservation of biotic communities in urbanized ecosystems is critical in light of heightened vulnerability due to climate change. Conservation of large open spaces around cities and smaller ‘green’ spaces within cities - such as forest patches and wetlands - has the capacity to diminish the vulnerability of human communities to higher temperatures, water shortages, increased flooding and other impacts of climate change. In addition, native species need to migrate to track their climate niches and the chances of successful migration will be increased if species have access to habitat throughout the landscape. Thus there is a strong rationale to do more conservation and restoration for both ecosystem and urban adaptation to climate change. Despite this alignment, planning efforts in the urban and ecosystem sectors are rarely done synergistically. As a result it is not clear how well plans will achieve biodiversity along with other ecosystem services goals. In this talk, I will discuss how urban adaptation planning can better align with ecosystem adaptation planning by drawing on research exploring sustainability plans and urban ecology in US cities, including work conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area by the Terrestrial Biodiversity and Climate Change Collaborative (TBC3). This research shows that there are considerable opportunities for linking agendas across sectors in ways that could yield multiple benefits. There are however both social and ecological challenges.

            "abstract": "Routine groundwater monitoring conducted in 2005 revealed significant chromium (Cr) contamination in regional groundwater in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Previous use of potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) in cooling towers at Los Alamos National Laboratory’s main power plant is believed to be the source of the elevated chromium levels. From 1956 to 1972 between 31,000 and 72,000 Kg of toxic Cr(IV) was released into Sandia Canyon. Initial investigations of the vadose zone using chromium isotopes indicated that reduction of anthropogenic Cr(IV) had occurred. However, to justify the use of Monitoring Natural Attenuation (MNA) as a valid remediation strategy, the Cr attenuation mechanism and the reduction capacity of the regional aquifer needs to be determined. Conventional batch sorption and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies were performed. Two samples were selected from the Puye formation, a silicoclastic sedimentary rock sequence located within the contaminated aquifer. Additionally, two Los Alamos Puye outcrop samples with no chromium exposure were selected for comparison. Each sample was subsequently sorted based on grain size, magnetic, and clay fractions. Groundwater with a known concentration of Cr(IV) was used in the batch experiments. Spectroscopy measurements of Puye samples before and after exposure to the same contaminated groundwater were conducted at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). Batch sorption results indicated little to no attenuation, as indicated by the small measured sorption coefficient (Kd < 5 Kg/L). Spectroscopic measurements suggest that attenuation of hexavalent chromium in groundwater is due to reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in the Puye and may be attributed almost exclusively to the clay fraction. These results indicate that the tested Puye sediments occurring in the regional aquifer have minor ability to naturally attenuate anthropogenic Cr(IV), with the clay fraction dominating the reduction process. This study provides a field prediction model with reliable chromium reactive transport parameters in relevant geological settings.",

            "abstract": "Cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) is one of the most significant microphysical properties of liquid clouds and is essential for the understanding of aerosol-cloud interaction. It impacts radiative forcing, cloud evolution, precipitation, global climate and, through observation, can be used to monitor the cloud albedo effect, or the first indirect effect. The IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report continues to consider aerosol-cloud interactions as one of the largest uncertainties in radiative forcing of climate.\nThe SABOR experiment, which was a NASA-led ship and air campaign off the east coast of the United States during July and August of 2014, provided an opportunity for the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) to develop and cross-validate a new approach of sensing CDNC with the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL). The RSP is an airborne prototype of the Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor (APS) that was on-board the Glory satellite. It is a scanning sensor that provides high-precision measurements of polarized and full-intensity radiances at multiple angles over a wide spectral range.\nThe distinctive feature of the polarimetric technique is that it does not make any assumption of the liquid water profile within the cloud. The approach involves (1) estimating the droplet size distribution from polarized reflectance observations in the rainbow, (2) using polarized reflectance to estimate above cloud water vapor and total reflectance to find how much near infra-red light is being absorbed in clouds, (3) finding cloud physical thickness from the absorption and cloud top pressure retrievals assuming a saturated mixing ratio for water vapor and (4) determining the cloud droplet number concentration from the physical thickness and droplet size distribution retrievals.\nAn overview of the polarimetric technique will be presented along with the results of applying the new approach to SABOR campaign data. An analysis of the algorithm’s performance when compared with the HSRL system will be shown. The results will also be compared with other published methods of retrieving CDNC, which assume adiabatic liquid water profiles and droplet number concentrations derived from lidar profiles of extinction.",

In this presentation, we discuss a software architecture and data distribution model that was adopted to distribute the outputs of the regional climate model Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR). This involved summarizing a large static dataset for ad-hoc query and data download in a web-based application called \"MAR Explorer\", and making the application available using a cloud-based Amazon server.

            "abstract": "Since 2003, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite system has provided the means of investigating month-to-month to inter-annual variability of, among many other things, Arctic Ocean circulation over the entire Arctic Basin. Such a comprehensive picture could not have been achieved with the limited in situ pressure observations available. Results from the first 10 years of ocean bottom pressure measurements from GRACE in the Arctic Ocean reveal distinct patterns of ocean variability that are strongly associated with changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation (Peralta-Ferriz et al., 2014): the leading mode of variability being a wintertime basin-coherent mass change driven by winds in the Nordic Seas; the second mode of variability corresponding to a mass signal coherent along the Siberian shelves, and driven by the Arctic Oscillation; and the third mode being a see-saw between western and eastern Arctic shelves, also driven by the large-scale wind patterns.\nIn order to understand Arctic Ocean changes, it is fundamental to continue to track ocean bottom pressure. Our concern is what to do if the present GRACE system, which is already well beyond its design lifetime, should fail before its follow-on is launched, currently estimated to be in 2017. In this work, we regress time series of pressure from the existing and potential Arctic Ocean bottom pressure recorder locations against the fundamental modes of bottom pressure variation. Our aim is to determine the optimum combination of in situ measurements to represent the broader scale variability now observed by GRACE. With this understanding, we can be better prepared to use in situ observations to at least partially cover a possible gap in GRACE coverage.\n",

            "abstract": "Our research objective is to identify sediment transport systems that exhibit non local signals, such as those seen in the long-profile of fluvial surfaces. In previous work we have shown that appropriate nonlocal models of sediment transport under various tectonic forcing, can lead to fluvial surface shapes that are distinct from those obtained with local models. For example, in the study of a sediment bypass system, a nonlocal model for the sediment flux predicts a concave down fluvial surface in contrast to the linear surface predicted with a local flux model.\nIt is well known that hold ups and fast paths in transport systems lead to non-local behaviors. And we think that the mechanism that creates the unexpected curvatures in fluvial profiles is one of \"storage and release\". Perhaps the classic storage and release system is that seen in rice pile experiments. One set up for this experiment involves the formation of a rice pile in the gap (~25mm) between two vertical glass plates resting on a solid surface. In this system rice is added at a constant rate at the left and allowed to freely exit a distance (~0.5m) downstream; the system is run until a steady state is approached. Of course, an exact steady state is not reached because the rice does not move steadily down the pile surface but rather advances in a series of avalanches, with multiple length scales, separated by waiting times; in other words is transported via storage and release. The naive expectancy is that at the steady state the surface of the rice pile will exhibit a constant angle of repose. Our experiments with the system, however, indicate that while the storage and release mechanism invokes large temporal fluctuations in the pile its surface exhibits a persistent concave down shape. In this paper, we present the main findings of our rice pile experiment, explore models that might explain the persistence of the curved surface, and uncover the behavioral links between the rice pile model and non-local signals in fluvial sediment transport.\nThe authors acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation through Grant EAR-1318593, Generalized Transport Models in Earth Surface Dynamics.",

The Ocean Studies Board of the National Research Council is discussing these changes in the ocean science funding landscape. In 2014 the Board convened experts to better understand the long term public and private funding trends for the ocean sciences and the implications of such trends for the ocean science enterprise and the nation. Specific topics of discussion included: (1) the current scope of philanthropic and industry funding for the ocean sciences; (2) the long-term trends in the funding balance between federal and other sources of funding; (3) the priorities and goals for private funders; and (4) the characteristics of various modes of engagement for private funders.\nAlthough public funding remains the dominant source of research funding, it is unclear how far or fast that balance might shift in the future nor what a shifting balance may mean. There has been no comprehensive assessment of the magnitude and impact of privately-funded science, particularly the ocean sciences, as public funding sources decline. Nevertheless, the existing data can shed some light on these questions. We will present available data on long-term trends in federal and other sources of funding for science (focusing on ocean science) and report on preliminary findings from a panel discussion with key private foundations and industry funders.",

In this study, several on-board incubation experiments were performed in the Yellow Sea of China during 2011 - 2014, to explore the responses of micro-, nano- and pico-phytoplankton to various combinations of Asian dust, nutrients and haze particles by measuring the size-fractionated chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration. In the experiments of Asian dust addition, the concentration of Chl a and the conversion efficiency index of N into Chl a increased by up to ~40 % and ~30 %, respectively, compared to the control, showing enhancement effects on the growth of phytoplankton. The addition of haze particles exhibited more obvious promotions of pico-phytoplankton growth, but more severe inhibitions of micro-phytoplankton growth than other treatments. The incubation experiments conducted in the Yellow Sea also indicated P limitation variations in spring and summer.

Despite the considerable advances made in the last thirty years of ENSO study, serious challenges still remain in predicting the trajectory of ENSO state (particularly from neutral conditions) and in forecasting the year-to-year weather anomalies seen among the commonly identified El Niño years. The variability of the tropical Pacific in recent years, such as 2012 and 2014, whose early to mid-year anomaly conditions prompted many to forecast the development of El Niño events, highlights the ability of sub-seasonal winds to affect that development. We offer some recent research results on the role that sub-seasonal wind events play in the initiation and growth of different types of ENSO events, with focus on their prolonged effects on the development of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Pacific oceanic waveguide and impacts on seasonal weather anomalies elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "We have performed the first climate change experiments with a very high resolution (1.5 km grid spacing) regional climate model over a region of the UK and compared these to results for a coarser resolution climate model (12 km). This model is typically used for weather forecasting in the UK. Although observations show increases in heavy rainfall at daily timescales in many regions, how changes will manifest themselves on sub-daily timescales remains highly uncertain. A reanalysis-driven simulation shows realistic hourly rainfall characteristics, including extremes, unlike results for coarser resolution climate models. This gives us confidence in the very high resolution model's ability to project future changes at sub-daily scales.\nThe 1.5 km model shows increases in hourly rainfall intensities in winter, consistent with projections from the coarser 12 km resolution model and from previous studies at the daily timescale. However, the 1.5 km model also shows future intensification of short-duration heavy rainfall in summer with significantly more events exceeding the high thresholds set by UK flood forecasters as indicative of serious flash flooding. We conclude that accurate representation of the local storm dynamics is an essential requirement for predicting changes to convective extremes; when included we find for the model here that summer downpours intensify with warming.\nWe further explore some of the mechanisms causing the changes, including the relationships to temperature and humidity through mechanisms such as the Clausius-cCapeyron relationship, and larger scale circulation changes.",

Robust measurements of natural GHG emissions are vital for evaluating regional to global carbon budgets and for assessing climate feedbacks on natural emissions to improve climate models. Diffusive and ebullitive (bubble) transport are two major pathways of gas release from surface waters. Capturing the high temporal variability of these fluxes has been labor intensive using manual based methods, or expensive using available high resolution equipment (e.g. eddy correlation methods). Here, we present an inexpensive device that includes an easily mobile diffusive flux chamber and a bubble counter (inverted funnel) all in one. It is equipped with wireless data readout and web-based remote monitoring and control functions. The device can be programmed to measure in situ mixing ratios of gas in the chamber, and accumulation of ebullitive gas in the funnel. The device can also collect gas samples into sample bottles for subsequent analyses (e.g concentration, stable isotopes) in the laboratory.",

            "abstract": "The increased melting of snow and ice in the arctic and the Himalaya is a growing concern for all of the earth’s population. Deposition of black carbon (BC) on the snow and ice surface accelerates melting by absorbing the radiative energy and directly transferring all that energy onto the underlying surface. During pre-monsoon season, satellite images show a thick layer of haze covering the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) and the Himalayan foothills. Sub-micron particles are transported to the Himalaya from the IGP predominantly driven by the thermal valley wind system. The Himalayas consist of some of the tallest mountain ranges in the world, over 8000m tall that reach the stratosphere. The Kali Gandaki Valley in Nepal is one of the deepest gorges in the world, and has some of the highest up-valley winds in the world. It is also one of the most open connecting points for air from IGP to reach the Tibetan Plateau.\nIn 2010 the University of Virginia, in collaboration with ICIMOD and Nepal Wireless, established an atmospheric research station in Jomsom, Nepal (28.78N, 83.42E, 2900 m.a.s.l.) half-way along the Kali Gandaki valley. The station is equipped to measure black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone concentrations. It also has an automated weather station, a filter sampler, and a NASA Aeronet Sunphotometer.\nHere we present our observations of black carbon, ozone, carbon monoxide at Jomsom to show the diurnal and seasonal variability of the pollutants. The results show diurnal patterns in the concentration of these pollutants and also episodes of high pollutant transport along the valley. These transport episodes are more common during the pre-monsoon season which indicates that deep mountain valleys like the Kali Gandaki valley facilitate the transport of pollutants and thus promote snow and glacial melting.",

However, the factors that control microbial diversity in subseafloor sediment have rarely been explored. Here we show that subseafloor bacterial richness varies directly with sediment age and net rate of organic-fueled respiration. We examined three open-ocean sites (in the Bering Sea and equatorial Pacific) and one continental margin site (Indian Ocean), with sediment depths to 404 meters below seafloor. At all locations, taxonomic richness decreases exponentially with increasing sediment age. Richness declines most rapidly for a few hundred thousand years after sediment deposition. This profile generally matches the canonical relationship between rates of organic oxidation and sediment age 4. To examine the potential link between organic oxidation and taxonomic richness we used pore-water chemical profiles to quantify net rates of organic respiration at the three open-ocean sites (the chemical profiles of the ocean-margin site are not in diffusive steady state). Taxonomic richness and total rate of organic-fueled respiration are highest at the high productivity Bering Sea site and lower at the moderate productivity equatorial Pacific sites. At each of these sites, organic-fueled respiration rate and taxonomic richness are highest at the surface and decline together as sediment depth and age increase. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that taxonomic richness is closely linked to organic-fueled respiration rate and sediment age in subseafloor sediment.\n",

Progress in integrated urban water management and low impact development in Western countries increased our understanding of how grey and green infrastructure interact to enhance these services. However, valuation methods that account for a diverse group of beneficiaries are typically not made explicit in urban water management models. In addition, the lack of spatial data on the stormwater network in developing countries makes it challenging to apply state-of-the-art models needed to understand both the magnitude and spatial distribution of the stormwater retention service. To fill this gap, we designed the Urban InVEST stormwater retention model, a tool that complements the suite of InVEST software models to quantify and map ecosystem services. We present the model structure emphasizing the data requirements from a user’s perspective and the representation of services and beneficiaries. We illustrate the model application with two case studies in a data-rich (New York City) and data-scarce environment. We discuss the difference in the level of information obtained when less resources (data, time, or expertise) are available, and how this affects multiple ecosystem service assessments that the tool is ultimately designed for.",

            "abstract": "Epidemics of meningococcal meningitis occur in sub-Saharan Africa during the dry season, a period when the region is affected by the Harmattan, a dry and dusty northeasterly trade wind blowing from the Sahara into the Gulf of Guinea. Although the mechanisms remain unclear, the location and seasonality of meningitis epidemics suggest that environmental factors, such as low absolute or relative humidity, high temperatures, and dusty atmospheric conditions play an important role. Using a 20-year time series of meningitis incidence in Niger we examined the potential of statistical models to predict seasonal incidence based on data that would be operationally available, such as climate and dust, population and previous incidence. We used surface dust concentration estimates from a model given the paucity of direct in situ measurements especially at district level. The soil dust aerosol component of the model was thoroughly evaluated with existing satellite and in situ data over the region of interest showing daily aerosol optical depth correlations around 0.6 (p < 0.05). Our results show that wind and dust information along with incidence in the early dry season predict a significant part of the year-to-year variability of the seasonal incidence at both national and district levels. Such a model could provide an early-season alert when wind, dust, and other conditions are conducive to an epidemic. We additionally discuss how this research has focused at “getting science into practice” by engaging with practitioner communities to inform operational decision-making for reactive vaccination.",

As the city of Toronto grew, the observatory was relocated to Agincourt in 1898, and finally to Ottawa in 1968. The record provides a rare opportunity for high resolution study of geomagnetic phenomena far into the past and over a long time scale. The magnetograms, originally recorded on photographic paper, were transferred to 35mm film in the 1980s. We are now converting these film copies to digital images and devising algorithms for unsupervised extraction of the time series data contained therein. Using the digital images, we are able to extract data with a time resolution of approximately 15 seconds, a magnetic resolution of approximately 0.1 nT, and 24-bit quantization. Spectra computed from the extracted time series are characteristic of spectra computed from current digital instruments, indicating that the extracted data are of high quality. Unsupervised extraction is important for reproducibility and because there are in excess of 32,000 images totalling about 500Gb of computer storage. However, given that perfect extraction performance is impossible due to varying image quality, artefacts such as hand-written notes, and quirks of the recording device, we are developing a semi-supervised approach to ensure data quality.",

Free-air gravity, reflection and refraction seismic, and bathymetry data were collected during R/V T. G. Thompson cruise TN272 over an 800-km-long transect of Mid Jurassic - Early Cretaceous Pacific ocean crust. The geophysical data are used to model the morphology of the sediment layer, upper and lower crust, and the Moho. Seafloor bathymetry reveals topographic highs, including seamounts and other relief shown by the seismic data, to be associated with volcanic intrusions of various sizes that have disturbed the basement and sediment layers along the transect. We were able to infer the shape of the Moho by constraining the thickness and density of the sediment layer and upper crust with seismic reflection and refraction data, and then adjusting the thickness of the lower crustal layer to satisfy the gravity observations. From our forward modeling, we identify three distinct segments along the survey transect characterized by differences in layer thickness of the sediment and crustal sequences and the depth to Moho. Segment-1 is characterized by volcanic intrusions that cause variations in the thickness and density of the layers of sediments and upper crust with the greatest variation in the thickness of layer 3. The Moho reaches ~20km depth. Segment-2, where no seamounts are present, shows the lack of bathymetric features at the seafloor and only small changes in sediment thickness, the upper crust, and layer 3. Segment-3 also lacks bathymetric features at the seafloor and shows the least change in thickness of the sediments, upper crust, and layer 3 in all the three segments. Our modeling suggests that the Cretaceous volcanic overprint on the Jurassic basement has a strong influence on the overall structure of the underlying sediment, upper and lower crust, and Moho depth at confined regions along our survey line.",

The use of those magnetic properties is a non-destructive, new technology that might allow for the identification and presence of specific species or types of magnetotactic bacteria in certain environments such as sediment. We will also show some preliminary results on the biogeochemical factors that control magnetotactic bacterial populations, documenting the environment and the preservation of bacterial magnetite, which dominates the palaeomagnetic signal throughout recent sediments from Brazilian Coast. We searched for magnetotactic bacteria in order to understand the ecosystems and environmental change related to their presence in sediments. We studied magnetotactic bacterial concentration and geophysical, geochemical and oceanographic results in marine settings measuring crucially nutrients availability in the water column and in sediments, on particulate delivery to the seafloor, to understand the environmental condition that allow the presence of magnetotactic bacteria and magnetosomes in sediments.",

            "abstract": "The tropics play a major role in the global hydrologic cycle and changes to tropical rainfall patterns have critical implications for water resources and ecosystem dynamics over large geographic scales. In tropical South America, late Pleistocene and Holocene precipitation variability has been documented in geologic records and associated with numerous external and internal variables, including changes in summer insolation, South American summer monsoon strength, Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures, continental moisture recycling, and other climate processes. However, there are few records from the northern hemisphere tropical Americas, a key region for understanding interhemispheric linkages and the drivers of tropical hydroclimate variability. Here, we present a ~13 ka record of coupled hydroclimate and environmental changes from Laguna Brava, a small (~0.07 km2), hydrologically closed lake basin situated at 2400 m asl in the Cordillera de Mérida, Venezuela. Sediment cores collected from varying water depths and proximity to shore are placed in a chronologic framework using radiocarbon ages from terrestrial macrofossils, and analyzed for a suite of physical, bulk geochemical, and stable isotopic parameters. Compound specific hydrogen isotope (D/H) measurements of terrestrial plant waxes (long-chain n-alkanes) show a sharp increase in the late Pleistocene, followed by a long-term trend toward more negative values that suggest a ~20‰ decrease in the D/H ratios of South American tropical precipitation during the Holocene. This pattern is consistent in sign and magnitude to other South American precipitation reconstructions from both hemispheres, indicating interhemispheric similarities in tropical hydroclimate variability. Superimposed on this continent-scale trend are changes in moisture balance and environmental conditions in the Venezuelan Andes. We reconstruct these parameters at Laguna Brava at multidecadal and centennial resolution and evaluate this record within the context of late Pleistocene and Holocene South American tropical hydroclimate variability and global climate changes.",

The American Geosciences Institute (AGI) organizes ESW, along with partners including NASA, using annual themes (e.g., the theme for 2014 is Earth’s Connected Systems). ESW provides a unique opportunity for NASA scientists and engineers across multiple missions and projects to share NASA STEM, their personal stories and enthusiasm to engage and inspire the next generation of Earth explorers. Over the past five years, NASA’s ESW campaign has been planned and implemented by a cross-mission/cross-project group, led by the NASA Earth Science Education and Pubic Outreach Forum, and utilizing a wide range of media and approaches (including both English- and Spanish-language events and content) to deliver NASA STEM to teachers and students. These included webcasts, social media (blogs, twitter chats, Google+ hangouts, Reddit Ask Me Anything), videos, printed and online resources, and local events and visits to classrooms. Dozens of NASA scientists, engineers, and communication and education specialists contribute and participate each year. This presentation will provide more information about this activity and offer suggestions and advice for others engaging scientists and engineers in education and outreach programs and events.",

            "abstract": "Reactions with hydroxyl radicals and photolysis are the main processes dictating a compound’s residence time in the atmosphere for a majority of trace gases. In case of very short-lived halocarbons their reaction with OH dictates both the atmospheric lifetime and active halogen release. Therefore, the accuracy of OH kinetic data is of primary importance for the comprehensive modeling of a compound’s impact on the atmosphere, such as in ozone depletion (i.e., the Ozone Depletion Potential, ODP) and climate change (i.e., the Global Warming Potential, GWP), each of which are dependent on the atmospheric lifetime of the compound.\nWe have demonstrated the ability to conduct very high accuracy determinations of OH reaction rate constants over the temperature range of atmospheric interest, thereby decreasing the uncertainty of kinetic data to 2-3%. The atmospheric lifetime of a tropospherically well-mixed compound due to its reaction with tropospheric hydroxyl radicals can be estimated by using a simple scaling procedure that is based on the results of field observations of methyl chloroform concentrations and detailed modeling of the OH distribution in the atmosphere.\nThe currently available modeling results of the atmospheric fate of various trace gases allow for an improved understanding of the ability and accuracy of simplified semi-empirical estimations of atmospheric lifetimes. These aspects will be illustrated in this presentation for a variety of atmospheric trace gases.",

            "abstract": "Surfaces of exposed solids change their integrity due to solar wind and micrometeorite impacts, resulting in significant modification of exposed mineral grains. Apart from the possibility of in-situ ice generation, initial iron rich composition allows for re-precipitation of iron. The importance of characterizing these SMFe (submicroscopic metallic iron) particles exists to better our interpretations in remote sensing of planetary surface minerals. For example, the presence of SMFe changes the spectral reflectance of silicate minerals in the visible (VIS) to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, and contributes to “space weathering”: (1) SMFe darkens the overall reflectance, (2) steepens (or reddens) the spectral slope, and (3) decreases the contrast in the 1 µm band. Irradiating olivine samples with energies simulating micrometeorite impact energies revealed single domain (SD) and superparamagnetic (SPM) iron grains varying in size. All samples exhibit general VIS-NIR space weathering effects, but also magnetic anomalies in the immediate surface proximity and frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility changes due to the production of SMFe. Planetary minerals such as olivine produce more SMFe when micrometeorite impacts and/or solar wind irradiation increases. Magnetic textures found during the scanning of the laser irradiated samples reveal anomalies that are dominantly caused by metallic iron and are in superparamagnetic state while at room temperature. We observed an increased dispersion of these metallic anomalies when irradiation energy increased. Frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements creates a data set that has potential to become a tool in remote detection of these surfaces by deep penetration radar incidence.",

            "abstract": "A prominent landslide deposit in the Slope Basin seaward of the Megasplay Fault in the Nankai Trough was emplaced by a high-mobility landslide based on analysis of physical properties and seismic geomorphology. Slide acceleration is a critical variable that determines amplitude of slide-generated tsunami but is many times a variable with large uncertainty. In controlled laboratory experiments, the ratio of the shear stress to yield strength, defined as the Flow Factor, controls a wide spectrum of mass movement styles from slow, retrogressive failure to rapid, liquefied flows. We apply the laboratory Flow Factor approach to a natural landslide in the Nankai Trough by constraining pre-failure particle size analysis and porosity. Several mass transport deposits (MTDs), were drilled and cored at Site C0021 in the Nankai Trough during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 338. The largest, MTD-6, occurs at 133-176 meters below seafloor and occurred approximately 0.87 Mya. Slide volume is 2 km3, transport distance is 5 km, and average deposit thickness is 50 m (maximum 180 m). Pre-failure water content was estimated from shallow sediments at Site C0018 (porosity = 72%). The average grain size distribution is 39% clay-sized, 58% silt-sized, and 3% sand-size particles as determined by hydrometer analyses of the MTD. Together, the porosity and clay fraction predict a Flow Factor of approximately 4, which corresponds to a relatively high mobility slide. We interpret this result to indicate the landslide that created MTD-6 was a single event that transported the slide mass relatively rapidly as opposed to a slow, episodic landslide event. This is supported by the observation of a completely evacuated source area with no remnant blocks or retrogressive headscarp and the internally chaotic seismic facies with large entrained blocks. Future works will focus on the tsunamigenic potential of this high mobility slide. This approach can be extended to other field settings characterized by fine-grained siliciclastics and where porosity and clay content are known.",

            "abstract": "A midnight brightness wave (MBW) is the phenomenon that the OI (630-nm) airglow enhancement propagates poleward once at local midnight. In this study, we first conducted geomagnetically conjugate observations of 630nm airglow for an MBW at conjugate stations. An airglow enhancement which is considered to be an MBW was observed in the 630-nm airglow images at Kototabang, Indonesia (geomagnetic latitude (MLAT): 10.0S) at around local midnight from 1540 to 1730 UT (from 2240 to 2430 LT) on 7 February 2011. This MBW was propagating south-southwestward, which is geomagnetically poleward, with a velocity of 290 m/s. However, similar wave was not observed in the 630-nm airglow images at Chiang Mai, Thailand (MLAT: 8.9N), which is close to being conjugate point of Kototabang. This result indicates that the MBW does not have geomagnetic conjugacy. We simultaneously observed thermospheric neutral winds observed by a co-located Fabry-Perot interferometer at Kototabang. The observed meridional winds turned from northward (geomagnetically equatorward) to southward (geomagnetically poleward) just before the MBW was observed. The bottomside ionospheric heights observed by ionosondes rapidly decreased at Kototabang and slightly increased at Chiang Mai simultaneously with the MBW passage. In the presentation, we discuss the MBW generation by the observed poleward neutral winds at Kototabang, and the cause of the coinciding small height increase at Chiang Mai by the polarization electric field inside the observed MBW at Kototabang.",

            "abstract": "Renewable and intermittent energy sources are likely to become more important in the future and consequently lead to a change in the production strategies of hydropower to account for expected production fluctuations. Optimization models are used as a tool to achieve the best overall result in a network of reservoirs and hydropower plants. The computational demand increases for large networks, making simplification of the physical description of the stream flows necessary. In management optimization models, the flows behavior is often described using a constant time-lag for water on flow stretches, i.e., the release of water mass from an upstream reservoir is time-shifted as inflow to the subsequent reservoir. We developed an optimization model that included the kinematic-diffusion wave equation for flow on stretches, which was used to evaluate the role of the model improvement for short term production planning in Dalälven River, a study case with 36 hydropower stations and 13 major reservoirs . The increased complexity of the time-lag distributions of the streams resulting from the kinematic-diffusion wave equation compared to the constant time-lag model was found to be highly important for many situation of hydropower production planning in a regulated water system. The deviation of optimized power production resulting from the two models (time-lag and kinematic-diffusive) increases with decreasing Peclet number for the flow stretches – the latter being evaluated for all included stretches. A procedure emulating the data-assimilation procedure present in modern systems, using the receding horizon approach, was used in order to describe the dynamic effect of the resulting flow prediction deviation. The procedure also demonstrated the importance of high frequency data assimilation for highly effected streams, which implies that the error in predicted power production decreases with decreasing time step of forecast updating.",

            "abstract": "Leakage through faults and fractures in caprocks is a major concern for geologic carbon sequestration in deep saline aquifers. Current leakage models assume constant permeabilities of pathways, but CO2-acidified brine may cause minerals to dissolve, leading to permeability alteration. Calcite could cause significant permeability alteration, because it is abundant, thermodynamically unstable at low pH, and kinetically fast-reacting. We developed two simplified geochemical models to describe Permeability Evolution due to Calcite dissolution (PEC) in 1D flow paths through caprocks. The first is a numerical reactive transport model that couples solute advection and diffusion with carbonate reactions. The PEC model was used to examine geochemical and mineralogical conditions that lead to extensive permeability alterations. It was found that formations with larger amounts of calcite ultimately have larger final permeabilities, but the change is slower because extensive calcite dissolution buffers the reaction and retards the advance of the dissolution front. The second model, PEC Reaction Progress (PECRP), is a semi-analytical model developed to replicate the predictions of the PEC model but with much shorter run times. The PECRP model is based on assumptions of spatial homogeneity, sharp reacting front, and no reactions above the front. We simulated a synthetic system, the Eau Claire formation, and a sandstone in the Paris Basin to assess PECRP model performance. We found 1) for most cases the PECRP model causes a slightly shorter breakthrough time than the PEC model without affecting the final permeability; 2) when initial porosity is low, we observe temporary permeability decrease in the PEC model, while permeability never decreases in the PECRP model; 3) the PECRP model tends to fail to reproduce results from the PEC model with low Péclet numbers; 4) the PECRP model is not suitable for for pathways with certain types and degrees of mineral spatial heterogeneity. In summary, there are many conditions for which the fast PECRP model could be used to predict reaction-induced permeability evolution in a leakage estimation simulator, but it should be used with caution in flow paths with low initial porosity, low Péclet number, and substantial mineral spatial heterogeneity.",

Consequently, the seasonal sea ice cycle appears important to both the solubility and biological carbon pumps. To estimate net CO2 transfer in the sea ice zone, we require accurate estimates of the air-sea gas transfer velocity. In the open ocean, the gas transfer velocity is driven by wind, waves and bubbles - all of which are strongly altered by the presence of sea ice, making it difficult to translate open ocean estimates of gas transfer to the ice zone. In this study, we present profiles of 222Rn and 226Ra throughout the mixed-layer and euphotic zone. Profiles were collected spanning a range of sea ice cover conditions from 40 to 100%. The profiles of Rn/Ra can be used to estimate the gas transfer velocity, but the 3.8 day half-life of 222Rn implies that mixed layer radon will have a memory of the past ~20 days of gas exchange forcing, which may include a range of sea ice cover conditions. Here, we compare individual estimates of the gas transfer velocity to the turbulent forcing conditions constrained from shipboard and regional reanalysis data to more appropriately capture the time history upper ocean Rn/Ra.",

            "abstract": "Floods are the most damaging of all natural disasters, adversely affecting millions of lives and causing financial losses worth billions of dollars every year across the globe. Flood inundation maps play a key role in the assessment and mitigation of potential flood hazards. However, there are several communities in the United States where flood risk maps are not available due to the lack of the resources needed to create such maps through the conventional modeling approach. The objective of this study is to develop and examine an economical alternative approach to floodplain mapping using widely available SSURGO soil data in the United States. By using the state of Indiana as a test case, floodplain maps are developed for the entire state by identifying the flood-prone soil map units based on their attributes recorded in the SSURGO database. For validation, the flood extents obtained from the soil data are compared with the extents predicted by other floodplain maps, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) issued Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), flood extents observed during past floods, and other flood maps derived using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). In general, SSURGO based floodplain maps are found to be largely in agreement with flood inundation maps created by FEMA. Comparison between the FEMA maps and the SSURGO derived floodplain maps show an overlap ranging from 65 to 90 percent. Similar results are also found when the SSURGO derived floodplain maps are compared with FEMA maps for recent flood events in other states including Minnesota, Washington and Wisconsin. Although not in perfect conformance with reference flood maps, the SSURGO soil data approach offers an economical and faster alternative to floodplain mapping in areas where detailed flood modeling and mapping has not been conducted.",

However, little is known about the geographic distribution of this potential, and no coarse scale investigation has addressed this ecosystem service at the continental scale. Our objective was to determine blue carbon stocks and flux in coastal wetland soils in the United States and categorize the potential for projects by estuarine basin, state, and wetland type. We linked National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) data with the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) through spatial analysis within a Geographic Information System (GIS). We then calculated and mapped soil organic carbon across the continental US. Results were filtered by state, estuarine basin, wetland type, and accumulation rate, and ranking lists for each categorization were produced. The results showed that belowground carbon accumulation is concentrated in specific regions, with the richest and largest reservoirs in the Gulf and Atlantic southeastern estuaries, for example mangrove zones in Florida. Salt marshes on the southern Pacific Coast were relatively low in carbon due to small areas of coverage and the presence of sandy and inorganic soil. The geomorphic position of a wetland within a given estuary, for example on an exposed barrier island versus recessed towards inflowing headwaters, accounted for a greater degree of soil carbon variation than the wetland type, for example woody mangroves versus herbaceous marshes. The potential of a blue carbon sequestration project in relation to its location could be influential in determining wetland policy, conservation, and restoration in the coming decades.",

            "abstract": "As part of the Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast Service, the US National Weather Service River Forecasting Centers have implemented short to medium range ensemble streamflow forecasts. Hydrologic models are forced with meteorological forecast ensembles derived using a downscaling and calibration technique, MEFP, that leverages correlations at multiple temporal scales between large scale GEFS forecast ensemble mean and local scale observed precipitation and temperature. Strengths of MEFP include its use of multi-decade hindcast for calibration of local scale forecasts and production of verification information, but possible weaknesses include the use of precipitation and temperature ensemble mean information only, which requires the statistical synthesis of ensemble members. We explore whether using a larger set of atmospheric predictors and full ensemble members from the GEFS can lead to greater meteorological and hydrological predictability. Using 30+ year streamflow hindcasts, we evaluate 1-15 day streamflow predictions using the Snow-17/Sacramento hydrologic modeling approach in small to medium-sized watersheds across CONUS. We compare the MEFP approach and performance with regressive and analog-based statistical downscaling and calibration methods that rely on a range of atmospheric predictors to produce watershed-scale ensemble forecasts. This presentation describes the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches.",

Depths of embrittlement are typical (~9.5-18 km), so heat was advected with the footwalls. Strain rates are poorly known but may have been high. High fluid pressure (Pf) during mylonitic flow apparently aided embrittlement: fractures formed and drained fluids, Pf dropped rapidly, and plastic deformation shut off. Evidence of return to plastic processes is absent or sparse; if embrittlement was related to the seismic cycle, plasticity was not renewed in interseismic periods. Specifics differ: in the Whipple footwall, reaction strengthening preceded embrittlement, sealed and locked up mylonites, and Pf increased, aiding embrittlement. In the Brenner footwall, a thin (~50 m) hydrously altered mylonite zone persisted above deeper brittle mylonites, suggesting that deeper cracks delivered hydrous fluids upward to a weakened, overlying plastic shear zone, locally inverting the BPT. In the Simplon footwall, along-strike structural changes correspond to a change from hydrous to hydrous + carbonic fluids: non-wetting carbonic fluids blocked fluid migration and Pf rose until brittle failure occurred.\nIncluding transtensile (e.g., Griffith) failure, fluid pressure and/or fluid-rock reactions will improve BPT models. Thrust upper plates may behave similarly but the stress field should favor subhorizontal cracks and opening may be subdued so the BPT may evolve differently. Cracking in the upper part of a subhorizontally shearing BPT may deepen it.",

Here are presented the results of investigations showing that ancient biomolecules and their decay products contain significantly more pMC’s (% modern 14C) than diamond and coal presented during a poster session held at the AGU 2003 SF convention.\nThe title was: The Enigma of the Ubiquity of 14C in organic samples older than 100,000 K. The given range for five diamonds from Botswana and South Africa ranged from 0.096 to 0.146 pMC. Ten coal specimens from the United States from the Eocene to Pennsylvanian geologic interval yielded 0.1 to 0.46 pMC’s. In our extensive field and lab study ten dinosaurs from Texas to Alaska, and China yielded much higher pMC’s of 0.76 to 5.59 after pretreatment to remove modern contaminants.\nWhen 2g of a Belgium Mosasaur from Europe was pretreated to remove contaminants the pMC was 4.68 or 24,600 RC years on Lund Un AMS in Sweden (Lindgren et al. 2011, PloS ONE, page 9).\nThe endogenous sources of dinosaur pMC’s were further enhanced by the δ13C range of -20.1 to -23.8 for collagen, 16.6-28.4 for bulk organic and -3.1 to -9.1 for CO3 fractions. The δ13C values compare favorably to δ13C values of -23 to -27 in a similar study of dinosaur δ13C values from the Judith River formation in Alberta, Canada that (Ostrom et al. 1993, Geology, v. 21). .\nDiamonds from South America (Taylor-Southon, Nuclear Instruments 2007 ) yielded ages of 66,000 to 80,000 years leaving little doubt that at least the dinosaur ages of 22,020 ± 50 to 39,230 ± 140 were not machine error or a result of contamination anymore than the coal samples. This data explains more clearly why such biomolecules have persisted and therefore should not be ignored as the implications are of utmost importance to science and humanity. Thus the experimental results presented here demonstrate the need for systematic 14C-dating of samples from different parts of the entire geologic column to discover patterns of 14C retention and to arrive at a coherent explanation of the results.

            "abstract": "The initiation of Cenozoic continental ice sheets and the history of their growth/decay is difficult to reconstruct because of the mixed effects of polar ice volume and temperature on benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope values. Coupled measurements of foraminiferal δ18O and Mg/Ca are a promising tool to unlock the history of past continental glaciation by calculating the oxygen isotopic composition of paleo-seawater. This method has been applied on Quaternary timescales with success, but uncertainty about secular changes in seawater Mg/Ca and potential changes in carbonate saturation have produced varying results with deeper time data. Currently, no experimentally-calibrated model explains how the Mg/Ca of low-Mg calcite, such as secreted by benthic foraminifera, responds to variations in seawater temperature and Mg/Ca. Our “Foram Farm” is a culture system for low-Mg calcite benthic foraminifera, composed of a colony and an experimental line. Currently, the colony hosts several species of rotaliids, miliolids, and buliminids obtained from Qatar, the Dominican Republic, Scotland, and Long Island Sound, USA. In addition, two tanks contain “live sand,” a mixture of sandy material and seawater obtained from tropical reefs, and commonly used to condition hobbyist saltwater aquaria. This sand contains foraminifera and numerous other microorganisms. “Live sand” could be a source for cheap and easy to obtain test subjects. The foram farm gives access to a constant supply and variety of test subjects for the experimental line, which consists of several analytical refrigerators with varying temperatures. Each refrigerator houses petri dishes where forams are grown in water with varying Mg/Ca compositions. Elphidium excavatum, a well-researched, eurytopic taxon, will be the first to be cultured in the experimental line. After growing under experimental conditions, specimens will be analyzed using LA-ICP-MS, in order to model effects of seawater T and Mg/Ca on foram Mg/Ca. These calibration data may reduce uncertainties surrounding deep-time estimates of continental ice volume as well as seawater temperature and chemistry.",

The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama Canal Watershed Experiment, Agua Salud Project, seeks to understand these processes and quantify the long-term effects of different land cover and uses across the Panama Canal Watershed. One question posed by this project concerns the hydrologic role of fire in tropical environments. Within the Panama Canal Watershed, fire has seen widespread use among agriculturalists. This study focused on a monoculture invasive grass (Saccharum spontaneum) catchment. Specifically, the effects of significant wildfire events on hydrological processes in the catchment were analyzed. The catchment is within Panama’s protected Soberania National Park, which is part of the greater Panama Canal Watershed. Installed instrumentation includes a rain gauge cluster, a two-stage v-notch weir, atmometer and an assortment of meteorological and automated geochemical sampling systems. Spatial, rainfall, runoff and ET data across the catchment is available from 2009-2013. Various hydrologic characteristics, such as runoff ratio, peak flow per unit area, time to peak, runoff duration, and leaf area index, from before and after the events were compared. These characteristics are related to rates of ground water recharge and the occurrence of flash floods. This study provides a baseline from which the potential impacts of fire on hydrological processes in tropical environments can be analyzed.",

The mantle viscosity profile, VM5a is a simple multi-layer fit to prior model VM2 of Peltier (1996, Science). However, the revised deglaciation history, ICE-6G (VM5a), differs significantly from previous models in the Toronto series.\n(1) In North America, GPS observations of vertical uplift of Earth's surface from the Canadian Base Network require the thickness of the Laurentide ice sheet at Last Glacial Maximum to be significantly revised. At Last Glacial Maximum the new model ICE-6G_C in this region, relative to ICE-5G, roughly 50 percent thicker east of Hudson Bay (in and northern Quebec and Labrador region) and roughly 30 percent thinner west of Hudson Bay (in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and the Northwest Territories).the net change in mass, however, is small. We find that rates of gravity change determined by GRACE when corrected for the predictions of ICE-6G_C (VM5a) are significantly smaller than residuals determined on the basis of earlier models.\n(2) In Antarctica, we fit GPS uplift rates, geologic estimates of changes in ice thickness, and geologic constraints on the timing of ice loss. The resulting deglaciation history also differs significantly from prior models. The contribution of Antarctic ice loss to global sea level rise since Last Glacial Maximum in ICE-6G_C is 13.6 meters, less than in ICE-5G (17.5 m), but significantly larger than in both the W12A model of Whitehouse et al. [2012] (8 m) and the IJ05 R02 model of Ivins et al. [2013] (7.5 m). In ICE-6G_C rapid ice loss occurs in Antarctica from 11.5 to 8 thousands years ago, with a rapid onset at 11.5 ka thereby contributing significantly to Meltwater Pulse 1B. In ICE-6G_C (VM5a), viscous uplift of Antarctica is increasing gravity as observed by GRACE by an equivalent 105 Gt/yr in surface mass which is equivalent to an increase in global sea level of 0.30 mm/yr, about twice as large as the most recent estimates based on the W12A and IJ05 R02 models of Antarctic postglacial rebound but very close to the previous estimate of Peltier (2009, QSR).\n(3)In Eurasia ICE-6G_C (VM5a) remains similar to ICE-5G (VM2).",

This orbit enabled high-resolution measurements around the South Pole. LRO’s seven instruments are operating nominally, and have experienced no significant degradation since beginning the ESM. The spacecraft has performed exceptionally well, with 98.4% uptime during the mission. LRO retains sufficient fuel so that its current orbit can be maintained for at least 8 years.\nLRO’s science teams have been extremely productive, focusing on the distribution of volatiles, evidence for early differentiation, measuring the lunar impact record, and the Moon’s interactions with its external environment. Three of the most exciting findings by LRO have been the identification of LRO-era impacts, global tectonic features, and the transient nature of some volatiles at the surface. These findings are areas of study for future LRO measurements.\nLRO’s data is released to the PDS every 3 months, as of Aug. 2014 528.75 TB of data have been delivered by LRO. Many of the teams have delivered higher-level data products as part of their routine PDS deliveries (e.g., mosaics, maps, derived products). These products are intended to act as useful resources for the science community. Some higher-level LRO data products are of interest for future lunar landers. These products include illumination maps, meter-scale digital elevation models, roughness maps, and 50cm per pixel images of a range of possible landing sites. All of these products are available either from the PDS [1] or individual teams websites [2-5]. If members of the community require assistance finding and/or using data from LRO, they are invited to contact the authors of this abstract.\n[1] http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/lro/default.htm\n[2] http://imbrium.mit.edu/\n[3] http://diviner.ucla.edu/\n[4] http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/\n[5] http://lro.gsfc.nasa.gov/",

            "abstract": "A traditional view of the origins of the solar wind states that slow wind streams arise from coronal hole boundaries due to the larger expansion factor. It is hard in this explanation to understand why the slow wind occupies so much space in the heliosphere. Pseudostreamers are multipolar features which develop into fields that are unipolar at greater heights. There is debate as to the speed and nature of the wind from pseudostreamers: it could be fast, slow, or in between. And, in general, they might form a network of slow wind which may or may not connect in the heliosphere to slow wind coming from around the heliospheric current sheet. Here we discuss the relationship between the expansion factor along PFSS extrapolated magnetic field lines of pseudostreamers and wind speed and plasma properties calculated with numeral modeling. We demonstrate how the resulting wind type depends on the stage of pseudostreamer development in the context of the global coronal environment: factors in determining wind speed include the height of the pseudostreamer null point, the presence or absence of filament channels, and the expansion of coronal magnetic field lines in the neighborhood of the pseudostreamer spine. This study helps to better understand the sources of slow and fast solar wind for the Solar Probe Plus mission.",

            "abstract": "Modeling studies that simulate snowpack sensitivity to climate warming often represent the rate of temperature change with elevation as a parameter in the model. If not represented as a parameter, this rate is implicit in the gridded forcing data. Theory and observational evidence conclude that the relationship between temperature and elevation varies in space and time, yet models often represent this rate as a constant value. In this study, we test how seasonal variability in temperature lapse rates affects modeled sensitivity of the mountain snowpack to climate warming in the 870 km2 upper Deschutes River Basin, Oregon Cascades (USA). We calculate mean monthly temperature lapse rates using linear regression with all available measurements in the study region during the period 1989 – 2011. We then calculate lapse rates from the 1/16o gridded forcing dataset provided by Livneh et al. (2014) for the domain during the study period. These lapse rates show muted seasonal variability and are steeper than the observed lapse rates (r2 = 0.01). Using a simple bias correction algorithm, we scale the temperature and precipitation in the gridded data to the monthly average temperature and monthly total precipitation from PRISM. Lapse rates calculated from the bias corrected data match the seasonal variability and mean values of the observed lapse rates (r2 = 0.93). We then run a spatially distributed, snowpack energy balance model (SnowModel) with both datasets, prescribing the calculated lapse rates. We use a multi-response algorithm to identify optimal model parameters independently for each dataset and simulate snow accumulation and melt for the period 1989 – 2011. We then run simulations using perturbed forcing data (+2°C, +4°C and ±10% precipitation) to evaluate the potential impacts of a warmer, wetter/drier winter climate on snowpack accumulation and melt with both datasets. We quantify changes in the partitioning of solid and liquid precipitation, total snow-water-equivalent (SWE), SWE-melt, and water available for runoff for each dataset and each climate perturbation on monthly timescales. Our results indicate that the choice of lapse rates changes the conclusions about the elevational dependence of snowpack sensitivity, as well as seasonal shifts in the quantified metrics.",

            "abstract": "The island of Crete in the forearc of the Hellenic subduction zone has a rugged topography with a local relief exceeding 2 km. Based on the elevation of marine shorelines, rates of rock uplift during the Late Holocene were previously estimated to range between 1 and 4 mm/a in different parts of the island (e.g. Lambeck, 1995). These rates may, however, not be representative for longer timescales, because subduction earthquakes with up to 9 m of vertical coseismic displacement have recently affected Crete (Stiros, 2001). Here we use a well preserved sequence of marine terraces near Kato Zakros in eastern Crete to determine the rate of rock uplift over the last ∼600 ka. Field investigations and topographic profiles document a flight of more than 13 marine bedrock terraces that were carved into limestones of the Tripolitza unit. Preliminary age constraints for the terraces were obtained by 10Be exposure dating of rare quartz-bearing sandstone clasts, which are present on some terraces. The 10Be ages of these samples, which have been corrected for an inherited nuclide component, yielded exposure ages between ∼100 ka and zero. Combined with geomorphologic evidence the two oldest 10Be ages suggest that the terraces T4 and T5, with shoreline angles at an elevation of ca. 68 and ca. 76 m above sea level, respectively, formed during the marine isotope stage 5e about 120 ka ago. The correlation of the higher terraces (T6 to T13) with regional sea-level high-stands (Siddall et al., 2003) indicates sustained rock uplift at a rate of ∼0.5 m/ka since at least ∼600 ka. As normal faulting has dominated the tectonics of Crete during the last several million years, upper crustal shortening can be ruled out as a cause for rock uplift. We argue that the sustained uplift of the island results from the continuous underplating of sediments, which are transferred from the subducting African plate to the base of the crust beneath Crete.\nLambeck, 1995, Geophys. J. Int. 122, 1022-1044.\nSiddall et al., 2003, Nature, 423, 853-858.\nStiros, 2001, J. Struct. Geol., 23, 545-562.",

            "abstract": "The science data archive of the Cluster mission is a major contribution of the European Space Agency (ESA) to the International Living With a Star program. Known as the Cluster Active Archive (CAA), its availability since 2006 has resulted in a significant increase of the scientific return of this on-going mission.\nThe Cluster science archive (CSA) has been developed in parallel to CAA over the last few years at the European Space Astronomy Center (ESAC) in Madrid, Spain. It is the long-term science archive of the Cluster mission, developed and managed along with all the other ESA science archives. Publicly opened in November 2013, CSA is available in parallel with CAA during a transition period until CAA public closing in early autumn 2014.\nOur goal here is to present what has been put in place to help geophysicists in their research. We will first talk about some aspects of the CSA user interface (data visualization including particle distribution; user data profiles) and how users can access data remotely (data streaming in Matlab, or via IDL or Python).\nThe second goal is to present unique value added datasets that are now available on the CSA/CAA. These data have been produced by the scientific community, thanks to two EU FP7 projects: ECLAT and MAARBLE.\nFor instance, the polarization and propagation parameters of ULF Pc waves measured by Cluster and Themis (since 2007) are available and cover more than a decade; along with magnetic spectra of Pc waves measured simultaneously by CHAMP and ground-based magnetometers. These data are clearly an outstanding data resource for low frequency waves researchers.\nOther datasets will be presented to show that CSA/CAA allow much more than downloading Cluster data from a graphical user interface. It's a single point entry that allows studies from micro-scale physics in the tail (e.g. catalogues of dipolarization fronts), to meso- and large-scale M-I coupling studies (e.g. Cluster magnetic footprints based on T96 and TS05; selected SuperDARN maps, MIRACLE network data and NASA IMAGE FUV auroral images). Plasma regions crossed on the nightside and very soon on the dayside are also there to ease the user in its data mining. Upcoming data and services will also be evoked.",

            "abstract": "The positive impacts that COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) radio occultation (RO) profiles are having on weather forecasting, climate and space weather applications has prompted U.S. agencies to execute a COSMIC follow-on mission (called COSMIC-2) with Taiwan that will put twelve low Earth orbit satellites with GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) RO payloads into orbit on two launches in the 2016-19 time frame. COSMIC-2 will make use of an advanced RO receiver with an innovative beam-steering antenna design, and will produce at least 10,000 high-quality atmospheric profiles per day from GPS and GLONASS signals to support operational and research applications. The raw RO measurements of interest are the tracked high-rate (i.e. 50-100 Hz) carrier phase and amplitude of the L1 and L2 signals transmitted from the GNSS satellites as the ray tangent points descend from ~100 km altitude to the Earth’s surface. The fundamental RO observable is the atmospheric excess phase due to the signal’s propagation through the atmosphere (in excess to vacuum). The computation of accurate atmospheric excess phase requires geodetic quality knowledge of the orbital motion and clock estimates for both the transmitting and receiving satellite systems. Allan deviations of the GPS and GLONASS clocks were investigated in previous studies from a single ground receiver, and showed the GLONASS clocks are less stable than GPS clocks on time scales critical for RO profiling, i.e., approximately 0.5 to 20 seconds. In this study we estimate GPS and GLONASS Allan deviations from a global network of GNSS receivers tracking at 1 Hz sampling rate and verify the results with the previous studies. We then estimate the expected impact that these clock instabilities will have on future COSMIC-2 RO retrievals. This presentation will give a short overview of the COSMIC-2 mission, and then discuss details of the GNSS clock processing and how transmitter clock instability impacts the RO retrievals.",

            "abstract": "Models of groundwater flow often work best when very little field data exist. In such cases, some knowledge of the depth to the water table, annual precipitation totals, and basic geological makeup is sufficient to produce a reasonable-looking and potentially useful model. However, in this case where a good deal of information is available regarding depth to bottom of a dune field aquifer, attempting to incorporate the data set into the model has variously resulted in convergence, failure to achieve target water level criteria, or complete failure to converge. The first model did not take the data set into consideration, but used general information that the aquifer was thinner in the north and thicker in the south. This model would run and produce apparently useful results. The first attempt at satisfying the data set; in this case 51 wells showing the bottom elevation of a Pacific coast sand dune aquifer, was to use the isopach interpretation of Robinson (OFR 73-241). Using inhomogeneities (areas of equal characteristics) delineated by Robinson’s isopach diagram did not enable an adequate fit to the water table lakes, and caused convergence problems when adding pumping wells. The second attempt was to use a Thiessen polygon approach, creating an aquifer thickness zone for each data point. The results for the non-pumping scenario were better, but run times were considerably greater. Also, there were frequent runs with non-convergence, especially when water supply wells were added. Non-convergence may be the result of the lake line-sinks crossing the polygon boundaries or proximity of pumping wells to inhomogeneity boundaries. The third approach was to merge adjacent polygons of similar depths; in this case within 5% of each other. The results and run times were better, but matching lake levels was not satisfactory. The fourth approach was to reduce the number of inhomogeneities to four, and to average the depth data over the inhomogeneity. The thicknesses were varied within 5% of the average until the lake levels were closely matched. This last methodology proved satisfactory and stable. The data were honored and the solver worked relatively quickly; thus preserving the simplicity and speed of the Analytic Element method; and various pumping scenarios were stable.",

In this study we analyzed the correlation between wind speed and the existence of dust in measurements pertaining to the region. Wind speed data was acquired from meteorological masts along with reanalysis output. Comparisons were made to the presence of polluted and desert dust as identified by CALIOP, a satellite-based lidar instrument, and to coarse-mode Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurements from the AERONET network of sun photometers. It was anticipated that results would evidence the existence of a critical wind speed that is required for the emission of noticeable desert dust. The proximity of this threshold to the ideal range of wind speeds for turbine efficiency can potentially influence the feasibility of harvesting wind energy in the region.",

            "abstract": "We have developed an algorithm for 3D simulation and inversion of magnetotelluric (MT) responses using deformable hexahedral finite elements that permits incorporation of topography. Direct solvers parallelized on symmetric multiprocessor (SMP), single-chassis workstations with large RAM are used for the forward solution, parameter jacobians, and model update. The forward simulator, jacobians calculations, as well as synthetic and real data inversion are presented. We use first-order edge elements to represent the secondary electric field (E), yielding accuracy O(h) for E and its curl (magnetic field). For very low frequency or small material admittivity, the E-field requires divergence correction. Using Hodge decomposition, correction may be applied after the forward solution is calculated. It allows accurate E-field solutions in dielectric air. The system matrix factorization is computed using the MUMPS library, which shows moderately good scalability through 12 processor cores but limited gains beyond that. The factored matrix is used to calculate the forward response as well as the jacobians of field and MT responses using the reciprocity theorem. Comparison with other codes demonstrates accuracy of our forward calculations. We consider a popular conductive/resistive double brick structure and several topographic models. In particular, the ability of finite elements to represent smooth topographic slopes permits accurate simulation of refraction of electromagnetic waves normal to the slopes at high frequencies. Run time tests indicate that for meshes as large as 150x150x60 elements, MT forward response and jacobians can be calculated in ~2.5 hours per frequency. For inversion, we implemented data space Gauss-Newton method, which offers reduction in memory requirement and a significant speedup of the parameter step versus model space approach. For dense matrix operations we use tiling approach of PLASMA library, which shows very good scalability. In synthetic inversions we examine the importance of including the topography in the inversion and we test different regularization schemes using weighted second norm of model gradient as well as inverting for a static distortion matrix following Miensopust/Avdeeva approach. We also apply our algorithm to invert MT data collected at Mt St Helens.",

These new regimes involve multiple X-lines as guided by a reconnection \"phase diagram\", in which different coupling mechanisms from the global system scale to the local dissipation scale are classified into different reconnection phases [H.

            "abstract": "Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans is a metabolically versatile Deltaproteobacterium and conserves energy from the reduction of various electron acceptors, including insoluble MnO2 and ferric oxides/oxyhydroxides (FeOOH). The goal of this study was to identify c-type cytochromes involved in electron transfer to MnO2. The characterization of deletion mutants has revealed a number of c-type cytochromes involved in electron transfer to solid metal oxides in Shewanella spp. and Geobacter spp; however, a genetic system for Anaeromyxobacter is not available. The A. dehalogenans str. 2CP-C genome encodes 68 putative c-type cytochromes, which all lack functional assignments. To identify c-type cytochromes involved in electron transfer to solid MnO2, protein expression profiles of A. dehalogenans str. 2CP-C cells grown with acetate as electron donor and MnO2, ferric citrate, FeOOH, nitrate or fumarate as electron acceptors were compared. Whole cell proteomes were analyzed after trypsin proteolysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Distinct c-type cytochrome expression patterns were observed with cells grown with different electron acceptors. A. dehalogenans str. 2CP-C grown with MnO2 expressed 25 out of the 68 c-type cytochromes encoded on the genome. The c-type cytochrome Adeh_1278 was only expressed in strain 2CP-C grown with MnO2. Reverse transcription PCR confirmed that the Adeh_1278 gene was transcribed in MnO2-grown cells but not in cells grown with other terminal electron acceptors. The expression of the Adeh_1278 gene correlated with Mn(IV) reduction activity. Adeh_1278 has three heme binding motifs and is predicted to be located in the periplasm. The identification of Adeh_1278 as a protein uniquely expressed when MnO2 serves as electron acceptor suggests its utility as a biomarker for MnO2 reduction. This example demonstrates the value of the LC-MS/MS approach for identifying specific proteins of interest and making functional assignments to proteins, including c-type cytochromes that have not been characterized. The distinctive expression of c-type cytochromes in response to growth with different terminal electron acceptors offers opportunities for functional (i.e., activity) in situ monitoring using metaproteomics or transcript-targeted approaches.",

            "abstract": "Ammonia (NH3) is a key precursor to atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5), with strong implications for regional air quality and global climate change. Existing atmospheric measurements suggest that urban traffic may provide significant amount of NH3. NH3 emissions in urban areas may cause greater impact on air quality and human health, because other aerosol tracers, like NO and NO2, are emitted by similar on-road sources. However, the on-road NH3 emission inventories are subject to significant uncertainties. A mobile platform is developed by mounting multiple portable (total power ~ 100 W, weight ~ 25 kg), high-resolution (10 Hz), open-path sensors on top of a passenger car. On-road NH3 emissions are quantified in the real-world driving conditions by synchronized NH3, CO, and CO2 measurements. The mobile platform has covered over 16,000 km in the US and China since 2013. The total on-road sampling time is over 300 hours. Major US metropolitan areas that have been sampled include LA, SF, Houston, Philadelphia, and Denver. Three Chinese megacities (Beijing, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang) were sampled in both 2013 and 2014. The average emission factors (grams of NH3 emitted per kilogram of fuel) range from 0.3 to 0.5 g/kg. Different methodologies were compared, including on-road emission ratios, tunnel measurements, and city-scale gradient measurements. These methodologies yielded the same emission factor for Houston (0.4±0.05 g/kg) within the sampling uncertainties and showed that multiple approaches are consistent with one another. The observed NH3 emission ratios indicate that National Emisison Inventory (NEI) underestimates on-road NH3 emissions by up to 50% in some major urban areas. On-road NH3 emission factors show higher values in both stop-and-go driving conditions and freeway speeds with a minimum near 70 km/h. This is consistent with another observation that the emission factors in urban traffic are generally larger than suburban traffic. Road gradient is found to influence emission factors substantially, with emission factors doubling at a 7% grade compared to a flat surface. An open-path NO sensor is now being incorporated to better quantify the contributions from on-road sources to secondary aerosol formation, and initial results will be presented.",

Three mobile lidars from the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar NETwork (TOLNET) provide high spatial and temporal ozone profiles from near surface to the top of the troposphere. The combination of multiple observations will provide detailed structure of the diurnal variation of ozone. This ozone information will help the satellite and modeling communities to study the character of lower tropospheric ozone for the improvements of satellite retrieval and air-quality models.

The FO cables were deployed at 3 depths: 5, 10, and 15 cm. In this system the FO sensing system provides measurements of soil moisture at >39,000 locations simultaneously for each heat pulse. Six soil monitoring stations along the fiber optic path were installed to provide additional validation and calibration of the AHFO data. Gravimetric soil moisture and soil thermal samplings were performed periodically to provide additional distributed validation and calibration of the DTS data. In this work we present the preliminary results of this experiment. We will also address the experience learned from this large scale deployment of the AHFO method. In particular, we will present the in-situ soil moisture calibration method developed to tackle the calibration challenges associated with the high spatial heterogeneity of the soil physical and thermal properties.\nThe material is based upon work supported by NASA under award NNX12AP58G, with equipment and assistance also provided by CTEMPs.org with support from the National Science Foundation under Grant Number 1129003.

            "abstract": "Modeling the variation of the MeV electron phase space density in the inner magnetosphere during active times is sensitive to many parameters, including the initial and time-varying boundary conditions, VLF wave spectral properties, plasma density, and magnetic field. Historically, diffusion codes like LANL’s DREAM3D have relied on the statistically-derived dependence of these parameters on geomagnetic indices, e.g. the wave intensity as a function of the AE index. However, the large number of satellites currently sampling the inner magnetosphere presents modelers with an unparalleled opportunity to create ‘event-specific’ models for many of these parameters. Toward this goal, we recently showed that using an event-specific model of the chorus wave intensity, built from proxy observations of low-energy electron precipitation observed by POES, along with a low-energy time-varying boundary condition informed by the Van Allen Probes, allows DREAM3D to reproduce the large enhancement of PSD for MeV electrons observed during the October 8-9, 2012, storm. One major limitation of this work is the fact that we used the static Sheeley plasma density model and a dipole magnetic field. Here we will discuss new results that use measurements of the plasma density inferred from the Van Allen Probes’ EMFISIS instrument to build an event-specific, global, time-dependent model of the plasma density that we use in DREAM3D in combination with the Tsyganenko 2004 storm-time model of the magnetic field. We show that this combination of plasma density and magnetic field model reproduce the ratio of cyclotron frequency to plasma frequency reported by EMFISIS during the entirety of the October 8-9, 2012, storm at all L-shells of interest, whereas our earlier results did not use the correct ratio at most locations and times. Because this ratio is a key parameter governing the effectiveness of chorus waves in accelerating electrons to higher energy, our new DREAM3D results resolve several discrepancies with the data that our previous calculation suffered from. Our ability to use an event-specific, time-dependent, model of the plasma density to calculate diffusion coefficients, previously beyond our computational capability, is enabled by a novel fast algorithm that we will also describe for the first time.",

We applied these techniques to a 1-year time-lapse monitoring of the geotechnical properties of a heritage earthwork at risk of failure, a stretch of the embankment of the Gloucestershire-Warwickshire railway in Laverton, UK. Like a significant part of UK railway network, this line was built in the early 20th century without modern construction standards. Poor maintenance and the increase in extreme weather events due to recent climate change have further compromised its stability.\nThe aim of this monitoring campaign is to assess the capability of non-invasive and repeatable geophysical methods to measure temporal changes of mechanical parameters of earthworks.\nMASW (multichannel analysis of SW) and P-wave refraction data were repeatedly acquired along a 100 m line on the crest of the embankment, every other month from July 2013 to July 2014. Smaller scale seismic data were also recorded on the flanks of the embankment. Sensors measuring climate –temperature, precipitation, solar radiation - and geotechnical parameters – water content, suction – were installed at various locations and depths within the embankment. Moreover, penetrometric data were acquired, soil samples were analysed.\nSW data were analysed in terms of phase velocity and attenuation. Hodocrones, dispersion and attenuation curves show a limited but continuous seasonal change. SW dispersion curves and P-wave travel times were separately inverted for VS and VP models with a laterally constrained and a tomographic approach, respectively. The VS and VP sections describe the temporal variation of seismic properties of the embankment, consistent with the climate trend. Such results were jointly interpreted with data from field sensors and cone penetration testing. This calibration stage provides a geotechnical model that explains the temporal variations of seismic velocities.\nMASW and P-wave refraction have proven to be adequate in depicting the seasonal change of seismic velocities of a heritage earthwork. The joint interpretation of geophysical data with sensors, sample and penetrometric data provides a geotechnical model explaining the variation of mechanical parameters of the soil with time. ",

            "abstract": "Climate extremes are a major challenge for corn producers in the central United States. Among those extremes are wet springs that lead to planting delays, late spring and early fall frosts that can damage crops, and extreme summer temperatures either too warm or too cool. A newly-operational corn growing degree-day (CGDD) tool helps producers manage and adapt to these extremes. For example, a challenge in recent years has been exceptionally wet springs that have led to significant planting delays. Producers have been forced to re-assess their planting strategies on short notice, such as switching to a faster-growing but lower-yielding hybrids. With this pattern of wetter springs projected to continue or worsen in the central United States, the problem will remain and likely get worse. Another example is helping producers identify the risk of early or late frost/freezes. The CGDD tool puts current conditions into a 30-year historical perspective and offers trend projections (based on climatology or forecasts) through the end of the calendar year. Corn, or sometimes called modified, growing degree-days use a temperature base of 10 C (50 F) and a ceiling of 30 C (86 F) and is strongly correlated with the development of the corn crop. This tool was developed as part of USDA-supported U2U Useful to Usable Project for transforming climate variability and change information for cereal crop producers.",

We timed the propagation of the shock through interplanetary space and into the inner magnetosphere. It took about 1 min for the shock to propagate from the dayside to the nightside magnetosphere where the compressions were accompanied by three cycles of toroidal Pc5 oscillations in the azimuthal component of the magnetic field observed by Van Allen Probes A and B. The ground response to the shock was very pronounced, global, and depended on the location of the observing station. Some stations observed location-dependent periodic oscillations.",

            "abstract": "Quasi-thermal noise spectroscopy is very accurate technique for in situ measurements of electron density and temperature in space plasmas. This technique uses the voltage fluctuation spectrum, which is ubiquitous in interplanetary space, obtained by an electric antenna. It is independent of antenna orientation if velocity distribution function of plasma particles is considered to be isotropic. On STEREO/WAVES antennas electron shot noise spectrum dominates because of large antenna surface area, especially at lower frequencies. This feature of antennas disables simultaneous measurements of electron density and temperature. However, technique may work accurately in high-density filamentary structures, where Debye length is small. In this paper, it has been illustrated on magnetic clouds. Obtained results have been used to recalibrate the data of PLASTIC instrument. Further on, in unperturbed solar wind, electron shot noise has been used to infer electron temperature. Electron density data, necessary in data processing, has been estimated from recalibrated PLASTIC data. For this purpose, data of both STEREO A and STEREO B spacecraft have been processed by selecting only spectra from free solar wind.",

            "abstract": "Nitrate contamination in water is a worldwide environmental problem and source apportionment is critical to managing nitrate pollution. Fractionation caused by physical, chemical and biological processes alters the isotope ratios of nitrates (15N/14N, 18O/16O and 17O/16O) and biochemical nitrification and denitrification impart different intramolecular site preference (15N14NO vs. 14N15NO). Additionally, atmospheric nitrate is anomalously enriched in 17O compared to other nitrate sources. The anomaly (Δ17O) is conserved during fractionation processes, providing a tracer of atmospheric nitrate. All of these effects can be used to apportion nitrate in soil.\nCurrent technology for measuring nitrate isotopes is complicated and costly – it involves conversion of nitrate to nitrous oxide (N2O), purification, preconcentration and measurement by isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). Site specific measurements require a custom IRMS. There is a pressing need to make this measurement simpler and more accessible.\nLos Gatos Research has developed a next generation mid-infrared Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (OA-ICOS) analyzer to quantify all stable isotope ratios of N2O (δ15N, δ15Nα, δ15Nβ, δ18O, δ17O). We present the latest performance data demonstrating the precision and accuracy of the OA-ICOS based measurement. At an N2O concentration of 322 ppb, the analyzer quantifies [N2O], δ15N, δ15Na, δ15Nb, and δ18O with a precision of ±0.05 ppb, ±0.4 ‰, ±0.45 ‰, and ±0.6 ‰, and ±0.8 ‰ respectively (1σ, 100s; 1σ, 1000s for δ18O). Measurements of gas standards demonstrate accuracy better than ±1 ‰ for isotope ratios over a wide dynamic range (200 – 100,000 ppb). The measurement of δ17O requires a higher concentration (1 - 50 ppm), easily obtainable through conversion of nitrates in water. For 10 ppm of N2O, the instrument achieves a δ17O precision of ±0.05 ‰ (1σ, 1000s). This performance is sufficient to quantify atmospheric nitrate in soil and groundwater and may be used to differentiate other sources of nitrate for which the range of Δ17O values is much smaller.\nBy measuring δ15N, δ15Nα, δ15Nβ, δ18O and δ17O, our instrument will help researchers unravel the complicated nitrate mixing problem to determine the sources and sinks of nitrate pollution.",

            "abstract": "Submesoscale oceanic fronts have been implicated in the turbulent energy cascade, and in nutrient supply into and carbon export out of the euphotic zone. However, their large-scale extent is unknown due to their characteristic small spatial (1-10km) and short time (~1 day) scales that complicate observations. Current large-scale understanding of fronts from satellite SST and ocean color is limited to a climatological view of occurrence frequency in cloud-free events. We show that useful estimates of frontal spatial coverage and structure can be derived from the recently available, merged satellite Level-4 SST product (G1SST at 1km resolution) using a gradient-based detection method in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre (28o-38oN, -75o- -45oW ). G1SST fronts are validated with in-situ fronts in continuous ship measurements from the Oleander Project. At a matching distance of Δx=5km, 79% of the G1SST fronts are in-situ fronts, and 64% of the in-situ fronts are detected by G1SST; these matches up increase with larger Δx. Comparing with in-situ velocities, ~56% of the fronts are coincident with across-track velocity jets with low-pass filter at scales > 5km，and 70% at scales > 50km, indicating that fronts are in large-scale geostrophic balance. Near-surface vertical shear predicted from thermal-wind relationship is in-phase but much smaller than (<50%) observed shear, indicating large ageostrophic shear is inclined to be co-located with surface baroclinic zones, likely due to interaction between fronts and gravity waves.\nFor the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, we find that submesoscale fronts comprise 57±4.6% of the total surface area. Fronts are found not only in the energetic Gulf Steam region, but also are surprisingly numerous in the quiescent subtropical gyre. This finding is consistent with previous modeling studies that indicate that submesoscale fronts could help to resolve the ‘nutrient--primary production’ balance in oligotrophic regions.",

            "abstract": "The vertical structure of shallow water flows are influenced by the presence of a bottom boundary layer, which spans the water column for long period waves or mean flows. The nature of the boundary is determined in part by the roughness elements that make up the seafloor, and includes sometimes complex undulations associated with regular and irregular shaped bedforms whose scales range several orders of magnitude from orbital wave ripples (10-1 m) to mega-ripples (100 m) and even larger features (101-103) such as sand waves, bars, and dunes. Modeling efforts often parameterize the effects of roughness elements on flow fields, depending on the complexity of the boundary layer formulations. The problem is exacerbated by the transient nature of bedforms and their large spatial extent and variability. This is particularly important in high flow areas with large sediment transport, such as tidally dominated sandy inlets like New River Inlet, NC. Quantification of small scale seafloor variability over large spatial areas requires the use of mobile platforms that can measure with fine scale (order cm) accuracy in wide swaths. The problem is difficult in shallow water where waves and currents are large, and water clarity is often limited. In this work, we present results from bathymetric surveys obtained with the Coastal Bathymetry Survey System, a personal watercraft equipped with a Imagenex multibeam acoustic echosounder and Applanix POS-MV 320 GPS-aided inertial measurement unit. This system is able to measure shallow water seafloor bathymetry and backscatter intensity with very fine scale (10-1 m) resolution and over relatively large scales (103 m) in the presence of high waves and currents. Wavenumber spectra show that the noise floor of the resolved multibeam bathymetry is on the order of 2.5 – 5 cm in amplitude, depending on water depths ranging 2 – 6 m, and about 30 cm in wavelength. Seafloor roughness elements are estimated from wavenumber spectra across the inlet from bathymetric maps of the seafloor obtained with 10-25 cm horizontal resolution. Implications of the effects of the bottom variability on the vertical structure of the currents will be discussed. This work was supported by ONR and NOAA.",

The data catalog is a multi-petabyte archive of georeferenced datasets that include images from Earth observing satellite and airborne sensors (examples: USGS Landsat, NASA MODIS, USDA NAIP), weather and climate datasets, and digital elevation models. Earth Engine supports both a just-in-time computation model that enables real-time preview and debugging during algorithm development for open-ended data exploration, and a batch computation mode for applying algorithms over large spatial and temporal extents. The platform automatically handles many traditionally-onerous data management tasks, such as data format conversion, reprojection, and resampling, which facilitates writing algorithms that combine data from multiple sensors and/or models. Although the primary use of Earth Engine, to date, has been the analysis of large Earth observing satellite datasets, the computational platform is generally applicable to a wide variety of use cases that require large-scale geospatial data analyses.\nThis presentation will focus on how Earth Engine facilitates the analysis of geospatial data streams that originate from multiple separate sources (and often communities) and how it enables collaboration during algorithm development and data exploration.

            "abstract": "Observation and detection of aseismic transient signals in geodetic data is an important part of improving understanding of the earthquake cycle. Recent work, conducted as part of the Southern California Earthquake Center's transient detection exercise, showed that transient detection results were improved by using multiple detection methods and by localizing results to specified geographical regions. While geographical regions can be defined on the basis of a priori science domain knowledge, regions defined in such a way are vulnerable to edge effects (i.e., observations collected near the region boundary are less reliable) and are not easily extendable to new regions or measurement modalities where a priori understanding is limited.\nWe present an approach to overcoming these challenges that utilizes a k-nearest neighbor approach to defining geographical regions for GPS stations. In this approach, each station has its own individual region, defined by a chosen number k closest neighboring stations rather than any predefined geographical boundary. In this general framework, a weighting function controls the contributions of neighboring stations to the transient detection, while a distance function (e.g., Vincenty's method) controls which k stations are considered neighbors. The \"proper\" k depends both on the transient detection method and the weighting function; it can be defined by the user directly or optimized using hyperparameter optimization. For transient detection using multiple detection methods, this framework nests readily within an ensemble classifier.",

            "abstract": "Accurately predicting bed load transport rates remains challenging, with many influential factors still poorly understood, including unsteady flows and stream bed armoring. Nearly all natural channels experience unsteady flows, and hydrograph form varies significantly from gradually (i.e. snowmelt) to rapidly changing flows (i.e. rain driven or many regulated flows). However, most predictive methods neglect hydrograph impacts, and nearly all bedload transport experiments use steady flows. Stream bed armoring likely influences bedload transport rates as well, with the coarser surface limiting the availability of the finer, more mobile grain sizes in the subsurface. It remains uncertain whether armor persists, breaks up, or exchanges particles with bedload during high flow events. Coupled effects of hydrograph form and armor may also be significant, and previous work indicates that more gradual changes in flow promote more significant armoring compared to rapid changes in flow.\nTo better understand the impacts of hydrograph form and armoring on bedload transport processes in gravel-bed rivers, flume experiments were conducted at the University of Idaho’s Stream Lab. An armored, equilibrium bed was established as the initial condition for all experiments, which included steady-state discharges and a variety of hydrograph forms from gradually to rapidly changing. Steady-state runs allowed for comparison of bedload transport for a given discharge run singularly and in the context of various hydrographs. Though hydrograph form varied, minimum and peak flow rates and the total estimated transport capacity were held constant between runs. Armor ratios were estimated before and after runs by sampling the surface and subsurface separately. Armor behavior during runs was tracked by spray-painting the bed surface in three cross-sections that were repeatedly photographed then excavated after runs. Additional data collection during runs included photos for bed grain size analysis, bedload transport rates and total bedload flux. This set of experiments will provide improved understanding and quantification of armor and hydrograph impacts on bedload transport processes which could be applied to significantly improve predictions of bedload transport.",

These methods, combined with improvements in fluorescence spectroscopy analysis, allow for high temporal resolution investigation of DOC flux into aquatic systems, as well as DOC flowpaths within coupled terrestrial-aquatic systems. This study utilizes a combination of in-situ UV-Vis absorbance spectrophotometry, as well as laboratory-based analysis by fluorescence spectrophotometry of corresponding water samples, to investigate how forest harvest affects organic matter flux in a small headwater stream located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The majority of DOC flux occurring during the wet winter months during both pre- and post-harvest periods, while clear-cut harvesting significantly increased the concentration and flux of DOC export. The concentration-discharge relationship for both periods showed transport-limited behavior. This was not significantly altered upon harvest; however the examination of specific events showed that DOC response greatly increased in the post-harvest period for specific storm events. Concentration-discharge relationships evaluated using segmented regression analysis demonstrated a large amount of inter-annual variability in streamwater DOC concentrations. However, when DOC concentration is modeled with a least-squares linear regression model, the pre- vs. post harvest period remains the best predictor of DOC concentration, followed by year (reflecting the large degree of inter-annual variability). Precipitation is a greater predictor of DOC concentration rather than discharge, groundwater height, baseflow or quickflow. The fluorescence characteristics of streamwater DOC show that the DOC fraction is dominated by humic-like structures within both periods. Examining DOC quality parameters obtained through in situ absorbance spectrophotometry supports this shift towards DOC originating from shallower soil horizons. This was confirmed by investigating DOC quality metrics of mobile DOC from various soil profile depths (through analysis of lysimeter and soil extract samples).",

Zircon saturation temperatures (TZrc,sat) are similar and low (ca. 700°C) for most of the individual units, but Ti-in-zircon temperatures (TZrn,Ti) and trace element ratios contrast strongly between outer marginal units and inner megacrystic units (low TZrn,Ti ≈ TZrc,sat, high Yb/Gd, low Th/U, high and similar Hf, and high Eu/Eu*). Zircon O and Hf isotopes vary markedly across the suite (ΔεHf = 15; Δδ18O = 2.5‰). Individual intrusive suites (gabbro to high-silica granite) record variable O-Hf variations; no correlation (John Muir), subtle binary or ternary arrays (e.g., Whitney, Sonora), or bimodal distribution of values (Tuolumne). In some cases single hand samples (small-volume mafic or felsic units), may record the entire variability within a suite. Inner megacrystic units generally have lower εHf than outer marginal units. Whole rock geochemical data for the intrusive suites also show an increase in the \"garnet signature\" with time (higher Sr/Y and Dy/Yb).\nThe isotopic data are consistent with variable mantle sources and progressively cooler, more water-rich magmatism with a simultaneous shift to greater crustal involvement, and deepening of the magma sources. Magmatic underplating and intraplating of mafic arc magmas produced increasing crustal assimilation but under PT conditions that allowed production of more felsic, zircon-saturated, magmas. The isotopic variability requires that plutons are amalgams of many magmas mixed at varying scales before final solidification.",

            "abstract": "Water engineers do not like people; we are better with numbers, equations and models where people behavior is only a variable, usually constant, or in the best case a probabilistic approximation. On the other side, most economic studies relate to people’s behavior, and when economists develop engineering-based models, engineers usually think that econometric approaches are too simple to represent complex systems that engineers like to work with.\nBesides this simple-minded cliche, there is a lot of field to explore in the intersections of both disciplines. Even though the development of infrastructure cost-benefit analyses after Dupuit’s work, or the more recent growth of hydroeconomic modeling, we are still missing a lot of potential synergic benefits from integrating behavioral economics and water infrastructure design and management.\nTo present a simple example: urban water infrastructure design is based on water peaks, so reservoirs, pump stations and pipe dimensions have to be built to serve these peaks; water-related energy assessment studies have shown that there is a lot of energy used for every drop of water used in our houses, farms, and industries, and energy peaks are even larger that water peaks, creating expensive troubles for energy supply; and all this energy consumption means greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore we agree that reducing water peaks might create a lot of benefits, but could water customers change their behavior? Which incentives do they need? It is only about money, or it may be managed with better information?\nBeyond this example there are many other promising economic topics that could help in our daily water problems, such as: game theoretic approaches to understand decisions; science-based agent models that help us to understand the performance of a system as the sum of agents’ actions and interactions; or the analysis of institutional-driven management to avoid the tragedy of the commons that depletes groundwater resources globally.\nAnd no need to remind that all resource scarcity problems will increase with population growth, so it would be better to begin work sooner on these problems.",

            "abstract": "Plant defenses against herbivores shape tropical rainforest biodiversity, yet community- and landscape-scale patterns of plant defense and the phylogenetic and environmental factors that may shape them are poorly known. We measured foliar defense, growth, and longevity traits for 345 canopy trees across 84 species in a tropical rainforest and examined whether patterns of trait co-variation indicated the existence of plant defense syndromes. Using a DNA-barcode phylogeny and remote sensing and land-use data, we investigated how phylogeny and topo-edaphic properties influenced the distribution of syndromes. We found evidence for three distinct defense syndromes, characterized by rapid growth, growth compensated by defense, or limited palatability/low nutrition. Phylogenetic signal was generally lower for defense traits than traits related to growth or longevity. Individual defense syndromes were organized at different taxonomic levels and responded to different spatial-environmental gradients. The results suggest that a diverse set of tropical canopy trees converge on a limited number of strategies to secure resources and mitigate fitness losses due to herbivory, with patterns of distribution mediated by evolutionary histories and local habitat associations. Plant defense syndromes are multidimensional plant strategies, and thus are a useful means of discerning ecologically-relevant variation in highly diverse tropical rainforest communities. Scaling this approach to the landscape level, if plant defense syndromes can be distinguished in remotely-sensed data, they may yield new insights into the role of plant defense in structuring diverse tropical rainforest communities.",

            "abstract": "The planetary boundary layer (PBL) height is a fundamental parameter characterizing the vertical extent of atmospheric mixing near the surface. It is critical for understanding the PBL process and low cloud evolution and its feedback on the climate system, which remains a key uncertainty in climate modeling. The PBL height is generally defined as the altitude of a transition layer where air temperature or humidity gradient are significant within the lowest 1-5 kilometers above the surface. Numerous thermodynamic parameters, including temperature, humidity (specific/relative humidity) and their derivatives (e.g., potential/virtual potential temperature etc.) have been widely used to define the PBL height. Advances in satellite remote sensing technique allow novel ways to detect the PBL heights from space. Many new parameters are proposed for PBL height detection including GPS radio occultation (RO) measurements (e.g., refractivity, bending angle and dry-temperature) and CALIPSO lidar backscattering measurements (e.g., cloud-top-height).\nLarge discrepancy among various PBL height definitions was revealed from radiosonde analyses, which however are restricted over lands and represent limited horizontal scales of atmospheric conditions. In this talk, we investigate the definition difference in a global perspective by using multi-year high-resolution ERA-interim (1 degree grid with 60 vertical layers) global analysis. Automatic algorithms are applied to compute the PBL heights with various physical parameters (both conventional and GPS RO) at each model grid. The global PBL height seasonal climatology and the difference among the climatologies are derived. Large discrepancy between the thermal-based and humidity-based PBL height definitions is most prominent over tropical and polar regions. Humidity-based PBL heights become problematic over dry regions, especially over high-latitude in winter season. The cloud-top height from CALIPSO is consistent with most physical parameter based PBL heights over subtropical eastern oceans. But much larger differences are seen elsewhere. The physical meaning of various PBL heights and their implication for evaluating weather and climate models with satellite observations will be discussed.",

Current models approximate meteoritic and cometary materials using Earth-analogue EOS's, e.g., quartz, dunite, hydrated tuff, water ice, and numerical convolutions of analog EOS's. Earth-analogues are used because the formulation of a comprehensive equation of state requires a large amount of experimental data that is often expensive to obtain and destructive to the available samples. Analogue EOS's can, however, perform very differently from the original material under shock loading.

            "abstract": "U-Pb geochronology of detrital zircon is an effective method for evaluating exhumation history, provenance, and depositional age constraints of sedimentary deposits. Over 1400 grains evaluated from thirteen samples collected from distal and proximal Oligo-Miocene strata of Adriatic turbidites are consistent with modern characterization of the proposed source region. Studies indicate that the principal source area of Oligo-Miocene strata from Adriatic deposits is the Lepontine Dome of the Central Alps. Our data reveals a significant shift in detrital zircon U-Pb age populations during the Oligocene-Miocene boundary which, when compared with data from modern sands, closely correlates to the westward shift of the erosional foci within the Lepontine Dome, from the Ticino to the Toce subdome, due to progressive indentation of Adria. This is coeval with progressive unroofing of Periadriatic magmatic rocks of Tertiary age along the Insubric Fault.\nThe lowermost Upper Oligocene proximal samples collected from the Como and Villa Olmo Conglomerates are dominated by Caledonian and Cadomian detrital zircon U-Pb age populations. The uppermost Oligocene and lower Miocene proximal samples collected from the Como Conglomerate are dominated instead by Periadriatic detrital zircon.\nDistal samples collected from the Lower Oligocene Aveto Formation have a dominant Periadriatic age peak with lesser amounts of late Cretaceous, Variscan, Caledonian and Cadomian detrital zircon. The lowermost Upper Oligocene distal samples collected from the Macigno Formation contain populations of Periadriatic, Variscan, Caledonian, and Cadomian detrital zircon, with major shifts in relative abundance from the lower to upper strata. The most dramatic shift in provenance in the distal units is between two samples located relatively proximally to one another in the Modino unit: Upper Oligocene marls contains primarily Variscan and Caledonian zircon grains with no individuals yielding Periadriatic ages, whereas the Upper Oligocene – Lower Miocene sandstones of the same unit include dominant Periadriatic and Variscan age populations. The youngest distal sample, from the Lower Miocene Bobbio Formation, primarily contains Variscan detrital zircon ages.",

            "abstract": "Among CCUS technologies (Carbon Capture Utilization and Sequestration), geological storage of CO2 has a large potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, but confidence in its deployment is often clouded by the possibility and cost of leakage. In this study, we took the Michigan sedimentary basin as an example to investigate the monetized risks associated with leakage, using the Risk Interference of Subsurface CO2 Storage (RISCS) model. The model accounts for spatial heterogeneity and variability of hydraulic properties of the subsurface system and permeability of potential leaking wells. In terms of costs, the model quantifies the financial consequences of CO2 escaping back to the atmosphere as well as the costs incurred if CO2 or brine leaks into overlying formations and interferes with other subsurface activities or resources. The monetized leakage risks derived from the RISCS model were then used to modify existing cost curves by shifting them upwards and changing their curvatures. The modified cost curves were used in the integrated assessment model - GCAM (Global Change Assessment Model), which provides policy-relevant results to help inform the potential role of CCUS in future energy systems when carbon mitigation targets and incentives are in place. The results showed that the extent of leakage risks has a significant effect on the extent of CCUS deployment. Under more stringent carbon mitigation policies such as a high carbon tax, higher leakage risks can be afforded and incorporating leakage risks will have a smaller impact on CCUS deployment. Alternatively, if the leakage risks were accounted for by charging a fixed premium, similar to how the risk of nuclear waste disposal is treated, the contribution of CCUS in mitigating climate change varies, depending on the value of the premium.",

            "abstract": "Frequent and spatially continuous water quality monitoring is either unattainable or challenging for developing nations if only standard methods are used. Such standard methods rely on in situ water sampling, which is expensive, time-consuming and point specific. Through the Regional Visualization and Monitoring System (SERVIR), Lake Atitlan’s water quality was first monitored in 2009 using Earth observation satellites. Lake Atitlan is a source of drinking water for the towns located nearby and a major touristic attraction for the country. Several multispectral sensors were used to monitor the largest algal bloom known to date for the lake, which covered 40% of the lake’s 137 square kilometer surface. Red and Near-Infrared bands were used to isolate superficial algae from clean water. Local authorities, media, universities and local communities, broadly used the information provided by SERVIR for this event. It allowed estimating the real extent of the algal bloom and prompted immediate response for the government to address the event. However, algal blooms have been very rare in this lake. The lake is considered oligotrophic given its relatively high transparency levels that can reach 15 m in the dry season. To continue the support provided by SERVIR in the algal bloom event, an algorithm to monitor chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration under normal conditions was developed with the support of local institutions. Hyperspectral data from Hyperion on board EO-1 and in situ water quality observations were used to develop a semi-empirical algorithm for the lake. A blue to green band ratio successfully modeled Chl a concentration in Lake Atitlan with a relative error of 33%. This presentation will explain the process involved from providing an emergency response to developing a tailored tool for monitoring water quality in Lake Atitlan, Guatemala.",

The high-resolution data sets, from XRF, TOC, magnetic susceptibility and hysteresis measurements, were used to track climatic changes in the tropical climate system at sub-centennial time scales over the past 7.3 cal kyr BP. The paleoprecipitation record shows variation trends, with a shift during the mid- to late Holocene, characterized by changes from high to low humidity. Pluvial, biogenic and eolian input, marked by variations in Ti, Si, Fe, K, Ca, Zr/Ti, Ca/Ti and magnetic susceptibility, shows trend changes between 7-5 cal kyr, 5-4.5 cal kyr, 4.5-3.5 cal kyr and 2.15-1.4 kyr. Drought events are recognized from 3.7 to 3.4, 2.8 to 1.8 cal kyr BP, and between 1.4 and 1.2 cal kyr BP.\nThe southern Gulf is well suited for documenting the climatic and precipitation changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean associated with ITCZ latitudinal migration, PDO, ENSO events and the North American monsoon. Analysis of sourcing, transport and deposition of sediments is used for reconstructing the changing ocean-atmosphere circulation patterns, particularly sensitive to paleoprecipitation. The Bay receives sediments mainly from the surrounding volcanic ranges of the peninsular Baja California. There are no rivers in the peninsula and sediments are related to pluvial input trough ephemeral creeks along the steep cliff ranges and narrow shelf. Biogenic sediments are associated with productivity and oceanographic conditions through upwellings and mesoscale gyres. Eolian sediments are transported into the basin from the peninsula and continent, including transport of fine dust from the northern desert of Sonora-Mojave and arid terrains in the peninsula. It is important to highlight that a common 1800 yr solar variation spectral periodicity has been captured. Correlation of the Bay of La Paz paleoprecipitation with records from Cariaco Basin, Gulf of Mexico and Santa Barbara documents regional variability, with spatial-temporal variation for the transitional interval from high to low humidity.",

In the alluvial aquifer near Rifle, CO, prior acetate injection resulted in reductive immobilization of U and a reduced zone simulating a NRZ, with elevated ferrous iron and sulfide (53.2–62.5 µM and 0.2–3.1 µM, respectively). To study the effects of redox fluctuations in a RZ, oxygenated groundwater was injected. Prior to injection, groundwater was suboxic (0.05–0.11 mg/L). Amended O2 was immediately consumed in the RZ. While cell numbers didn’t significantly increase, viruses increased from 1.1x106–2.1x106 mL-1 to 2.3x106–4.6x106 mL-1. VCR increased 1.8–3.4 fold from 3.9–10.1 to 11.0–17.9, demonstrating microbial activity. These changes were associated with large fluctuations of groundwater dissolved OC, suggesting viral release of OC from cellular biomass. Groundwater ORP decreased from an initial -146 mV – -132 mV to -317 mV – -304 mV, indicating an increase in the supply of available electron donors. Thus, rather than expected oxidative solubilization of U following amendment of O2, soluble U decreased, suggesting likely U reduction in the RZ. Fe and S fluctuated, but changes were not associated with aqueous U. Across the whole floodplain, viral abundance is correlated to groundwater dissolved OC, suggesting that viruses may be contributing to the liberalization of dissolved OC from biomass in NRZs, allowing turnover of carbon and reduction of contaminants of interest, independent of external acetate amendment. This is especially important considering the role of OC in controlling the fate and transport of contaminants in aquifers. These results suggest that viruses are an important factor to consider in the turnover and retention of carbon in the subsurface.",

Discontinuities in the material density and/or composition at the surface and deep interior reflect a small amount of incoming electro-magnetic waves back to the orbiting radar system that records amplitudes and travel times (or phases). By coherently processing the phase information collected from different viewing angles at different times, we would like to show that we could build 3D internal structural and compositional images, and thereby provide crucial information about the origin and evolution of the cometary nucleus.\nHere, we will report our efforts on the high-fidelity electromagnetic (E&M) forward modeling, comet modeling related to Rosetta experiments, and validation of a radar reflection tomographic imaging technique. We have developed innovative techniques to reduce numerical errors in the E&M modeling, allowing us to simulate data collection in a realistic environment while significantly reducing spurious effects caused by numerical errors or imperfect matching layers surrounding the simulation scene. For comet modeling, we have used models developed for radar sounding experiments on Rosetta comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. These models are driven from various scientific hypothesis and lab measurements of cometary materials. For an imaging algorithm, we have used a proven SAR technique after taking into account the slowness of light inside the comet and refraction (ray-bending) at the comet surface. We have successfully imaged 2D cross-sectional images of various comet models and will pursuit 3D simulation and imaging reconstruction in the near future.",

This transience was triggered by baselevel lowering along the Salmon River sometime during the late Cenozoic. However, the timing of the incision is unknown as is the mechanism that drove it. To provide insight into the drivers of landscape evolution in this region, we integrate field data with numerical modeling to constrain the timing of incision and gorge formation. We present 10Be cosmogenic radionuclide concentrations from bedload sediment in ten different tributaries of the mainstem Salmon located between the South Fork and the Little Salmon. The samples record basin wide erosion rates ranging from ~0.05mm/yr in relict topography to ~0.15mm/yr in refreshed topography over the last 103-104 yrs. These erosion rates combined with topographic metrics using channel slope and drainage area are used to calibrate a river incision model for rivers draining the Idaho Batholith rocks. Using the calibrated model, we quantify the migration of knickpoints from the mouth of the tributary to their present location in order to constrain a date for the regional baselevel change. Preliminary model results suggest an increase in the incision rate of the Salmon River occurred roughly 8 million years ago continues at the same rate today. Finally, we discuss the implications of this date in relation to the cessation of the Columbia River Basalts and the integration of the Snake River basin.",

Hydrogen isotopes of precipitation are important tool for measuring this climate gradient, as it summarizes variability in precipitation, temperature, and other parameters of the ocean-atmosphere system–all important for understanding the rapidly changing climate of the Arctic. We reconstructed D/H ratios of precipitation along with other hydrological and ecological parameters in a series of peatlands throughout the Alaskan Arctic. We reconstruct climate parameters using the hydrogen isotope ratios of leaf wax n-alkanes and paleoecology using distributions of lipid biomarkers and macrofossil identification. By reconstructing D/H ratios at all sites, we are able to compare disparate environments to robustly establish changing precipitation isotope gradients over the Holocene and in the Late Glacial. We investigated four sites in a southeast–northwest transect of the Alaskan arctic, each with stratigraphies covering the Holocene, and two extending into the Late Glacial. We used data from this transect to identify temporal changes in the gradient of precipitation D/H ratios. We also assessed the impact of these changes in the context of Arctic peatland and permafrost carbon accumulation, as these impacts are key to our understanding of the interactions and feedbacks of the terrestrial carbon cycle on recent and future Arctic warming.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires can become positive feedbacks in climate change scenarios, because wildfires release large amounts of carbon sequestered in plants and soil to the atmosphere, and because their frequency increases with increasing temperatures. Invasive plants represent an important biotic link between anthropogenic activity and wildfire, as many of these species benefit from human disturbance while increasing fire frequency and severity. A robust body of literature addresses the response of invasive species to nitrogen enrichment, and a separate body of research assesses the feedbacks between invasive plant species and wildfire. We have undertaken a systematic review of these fields in order to evaluate the hypothesis that anthropogenic nitrogen loading contributes to increasing wildfires by promoting the growth and spread of fire-adapted invasive plant species.\nWe identified invasive plant species using the Fire Effects Information System (FEIS), a Forest Service database that evaluates fire ecology of species identified as being of concern by land managers. We used information contained in the FEIS as well as more recent studies to characterize species on a continuum from fire-adapted to fire-intolerant based on traits related to interactions of fire with survival, reproduction, and spread. Of the 107 invasive plant species with fire ecology reports in the FEIS, we have initially classified 18 as fire-adapted, possessing traits that intensify fire regimes. Additionally, 33 species are fire-tolerant, benefiting from fire primarily because it creates a high-resource, low-competition environment. In continuing work, we are evaluating the responses of the invasive plant species to increased anthropogenic nitrogen with a focus on traits such as germination, productivity, and survival, as these traits contribute to wildfire frequency and severity.

            "abstract": "The response of the length and stratification of the North River estuary (MA) to variations in river discharge Qf and tidal amplitude UT is analyzed using time series from four along-channel locations in conjunction with cross- and along-channel boat board surveys collected from April 4 to June 22, 2006. The North River is a generally well-mixed estuary with a channel depth of 5 m and width of 70 m. Its length L5 is defined as distance between the mouth and the location where bottom salinity reaches a value of 5 psu, determined by approximating a linear along-channel salinity gradient. During the period of low discharge (Qf < 5 m3/s) spanning April, the average length of the estuary is relatively high and varies based on tidal amplitude. Lengths are typically 7-9 km for neap, 8-11 km for intermediate, and 10-14 km for spring tides. During two storm events marked by high discharge (Qf >15, reaching 85 m3/s) mean length remains shorter, at 6-9 km. Length of the estuary has a weak dependence on discharge and a positive relationship to tidal amplitude, L5 ~ Qf -0.135 UT 0.611. Stratification exhibits an increase with increasing discharge and a decrease with increasing tidal amplitude at mid-estuarine locations as ΔS ~ Qf 0.443 UT -1.22. Within tidal cycles, peak stratification is typically observed at the start of ebb. Using a one-dimensional salt balance, the along-channel diffusivity K is defined as K = Qf L/A, where A is cross-sectional area. K has a strong dependence on river discharge, and less so on tidal amplitude. It ranges from 100-200 m2/s during low discharge periods and peaks at 1200 m2/s during storm events. Although a simplified linear model of the salinity gradient was assumed, insight was gained as to how the estuary responds to river discharge and tidal variability.",

Since these functions are often governed by subsurface structure, understanding the complexities of fen stratigraphy is critical. We used a 200 MHz ground penetrating radar (GPR) and soil core analysis to study the stratigraphy of nine fens in the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains. We discovered that wetlands that appear as fens at the land surface had a stratigraphy that ranged from pure peat to heavily stratified with silt, sand or marl mineral layers. We then evaluated, in one of these peatlands, how the presence of buried mineral horizons regulated peat carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) distributions and mineralization rates. Revealed was that cumulative C mineralization rates (after a 63 d lab incubation) in peat soils with silt and marl horizons were significantly lower than in those without mineral horizons, owing to variations in water content and TOC concentrations. Differences in TOC concentrations among varying stratigraphic configurations were most apparent deeper in the peat column implying that transport via groundwater may be important. Peat underlain by marl had the lowest net ammonification rates, likely due to the high pH. Our results suggest the development history of mountain fens is complex and highly spatially variable, dependent on the effects of local and regional geomorphic and environmental factors, and has important implications for peatland biogeochemical functioning.",

            "abstract": "A 2-meter thick condensed section enriched in foraminifera is the final detachment horizon of a retrogressive submarine landslide, in the Ursa Basin, northern Gulf of Mexico. The high concentration of foraminifera (up to 900% relative to background values) in this layer produces a high porosity (up to 5 porosity units), low sonic velocity, low resistivity, and high gamma ray zone relative to the background clay properties. A high acoustic impedance contrast occurs at this interface and results in a high-amplitude reflection that is widespread and easily mappable in seismic. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 308 Site U1324 cored and logged this layer. We acquired 31 samples: 22 from the foraminifera-enriched layer and 9 to establish background values. Objectives were to (1) quantify foraminifera enrichment relative to background values, (2) describe the spatial arrangement of foraminifera within the clay, (3) identify the foraminifera assemblage, and (4) determine particle size. CT images show individual foraminifera dispersed within the clay and are predominantly in-tact. Foraminifera concentration is variable within the layer but average 0.75 grams of foraminifera per gram of sediment (maximum = 0.97 grams of foraminifera per gram of sediment). Foraminifera concentration correlates to particle size of the hosting sediment: highest foraminifera concentrations occur within the finest-grained samples and vice versa. This explains the high gamma ray response. The assemblage is expected for this time interval in the Late Pleistocene (~24 kya) with an abundance of Globorotalia ruber and Globorotalia sacculifer. This suggests the layer is in-situ and a result of a pause in terrigenous sedimentation. The landslide was a multi-detachment event that initiated in a deeper horizon but retrogressively cut upwards. The condensed section was a preferred detachment horizon but only minimal sliding occurred before further movement ceased. One potential mechanism to explain this is the presence of foraminifera causes a dilational shear strengthening behavior, which acts to arrest movement. On a broader scale, condensed sections with abundant microfossils, may play a key role in landslide mechanics by altering the shearing properties of the parent material.",

With more than 5 years of continuous data, complete spatial coverage of the lunar surface is achieved multiple times and coverage of local solar time enables the diurnal curve to be well-resolved for a given subsolar point.\nThe Diviner Foundation Dataset (FDS) represents a coordinated effort to recalibrate raw data to improve quality, and produce a definitive and comprehensive set of products for use by the lunar science community. We present the contents and organization of the FDS, background on the enhanced processing pipeline, show how it is retrieved from NASA’s Planetary Data System, and demonstrate its use with common mapping & analysis tools.\nThe FDS comprises level 1 Reduced Data Records (RDRs) and level 2/3 Gridded Data Records (GDRs). We produce new RDRs using improved calibration algorithms that remove instrument artifacts and improve accuracy of measured radiance, particularly for polar data in permanently shadowed regions. GDRs are built using a per-orbit gridding scheme, and data are sourced from a database constructed by modeling the effective field-of-view for each observation.\nNotable gridded products available for lunar science include: 1) Globally mapped brightness temperatures for all channels in tiled cylindrical and polar stereographic map projections, 2) Global hourly temperature snapshots – maps of bolometric temperature binned into 1 hour intervals of local time, 3) Topographic products (elevation, slope and azimuth) for each map tile, that represent the terrain model used to process the data, and 4) Accompanying gridded maps of auxiliary quantities such as emission angle, local solar time, error etc…, for filtering observations to those within desired constraints.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, carbon cycling, and climate. The global long-term history of biomass burning is not well established, making it difficult to study the relationship between burning, climate change, and atmospheric chemistry. Here we present the Antarctic ice core records of vanillic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic from the WAIS Divide ice core covering the past 2.4-30 kyrs BP. These molecules are derived from incomplete combustion of plant lignin and transported/deposited as aerosols onto the ice sheet. Vanillic and p-hydroxybenzoic acids are associated with combustion of conifers and grasses, respectively, but are not uniquely derived from these plant types. Analyses were done using ion chromatography with electrospray MS/MS detection in negative ion SRM mode.\nVanillic p-hydroxybenzoic acid exhibited a range from baseline levels near 0.01 ppb (detection limit) to >0.5 ppb. Vanillic acid exhibited striking millennial scale variability during late glacial period, with 6 major peaks between 25 and 13.5 kyrs BP, with a spacing of 1.5-3 kyrs and durations of up to 1 kyr. There are no comparable peaks during the early-mid Holocene. A late Holocene vanillic acid peak starts at 3 kyrs BP. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid shares the same major peaks as vanillic acid from 25-13.5 kyrs BP, but exhibits additional variability of comparable magnitude throughout the WAIS Divide 2.4-30 kyr record.\nThese paleo records should be viewed as qualitative burning proxies because 1) a wide range of aerosol composition and sizes can be generated from combustion of various plant materials under different conditions, and 2) the ice core levels of aromatic acids may reflect changes in source regions, transport and atmospheric removal efficiency, and postdepositional mobilization. The major peaks in the WAIS Divide aromatic acid records most likely do not represent changes in global biomass burning emissions, because they are not highly correlated with variations in atmospheric methane. Such caveats notwithstanding, these records provide a surprising new picture of the long-term variability in the deposition of burning-derived aerosols to the Antarctic ice sheet.",

            "abstract": "Climate change and tropical cyclone (TC) climatology has been the subject of a rapidly growing body of work, and both the observational record and general circulation models’ (GCM) prediction of the next century’s climate have been studied to learn how TC frequency, tracks, and intensity may change with the evolving large-scale environment. We have adpoted many of the techniques successfully used to study TC climatology in a future climate for analysis of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21,000 ka). By focusing on a climate state that is very different from either the present day or from projected future anthropogenic warming scenarios, this approach provides new insights into the links between TCs and the large-scale environmental factors that control them, and provides an improved foundation for studies of how tropical cyclones have impacted the geological record. We have used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in a 36-km tropical channel configuration to dynamically downscale output from the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum and 20th century, both from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We have downscaled 10 years of output for the LGM and for the 20th century and developed a climatology of the downscaled tropical cyclones for each. Here we show the changes in simulated TC tracks and intensity between LGM and the 20th century and link the changes in the downscaled tropical cyclones to large-scale climate indices and vortex tracking from the GCM output.",

            "abstract": "Only a limited amount of information derived from studies conducted at small catchment scales can be transferred to large scales because of the non-linear scale effects, thus necessitating studies (including nutrient concentrations and yields) across a range of scales. Here we present results from an investigation of spatial scale pattern and temporal variability of nutrient concentration in the River Eden in northwest England, a nested catchment stretching from Gais Gill (1.1 km2) to Great Corby (1373 km2). The monitoring involved seasonal campaigns and spot sampling of river water quality, using two United Kingdom national catchment study platforms. Nitrate concentration shows a clear increasing trend with the catchment area and there is highly significant difference (P<0.001) among the catchments. Compared with the headwater areas, phosphorus (P) and suspended sediment (SS) concentrations are significantly higher (P<0.05) downstream but do not show a very clear spatial pattern. An alternative explanation was therefore sought for their distribution along the river. Generally, intensity of agricultural activities appears to influence the concentrations of these water quality parameters. The field data show that the amount of nutrients and suspended sediment is higher in catchments with higher farming activities and this increase downstream. This underscores the importance of the distribution of agricultural land use as a driving force in nutrient transport in River Eden. Higher nitrate concentration is associated with the period of low flow (strongest negative relationship, R2 = 0.97, was recorded in autumn sampling campaign at a gauging station). In contrast, phosphorus and suspended sediment are positively associated with discharge (strongest relationship (R2= 0.97) for total P were recorded in spring campaign at a gauging station). Similarly the dryness or wetness of a season affects the nutrient concentrations.\nThus, it appears that hydrology and land use distribution, from the headwater to the lowland areas downstream, control the spatial behaviour of the nutrients and suspended sediment concentration in the River Eden. The findings are being generalized for wider applicability in the UK using the TOPCAT-NP model.\nKey words: scale, nitrate, phosphorus, River Eden, agricultural activity",

            "abstract": "Oscilla Power, Inc. (OPI) is developing a patented magnetostrictive wave energy converter aimed at reducing the cost of grid-scale electricity from ocean waves. Designed to operate cost-effectively across a wide range of wave conditions, this will be the first use of reverse magnetostriction for large-scale energy production.\nThe device architecture is a straightforward two-body, point absorbing system that has been studied at length by various researchers. A large surface float is anchored to a submerged heave (reaction) plate by multiple taut tethers that are largely made up of discrete, robust power takeoff modules that house the magnetostrictive generators.\nThe unique generators developed by OPI utilize the phenomenon of reverse magnetostriction, which through the application of load to a specific low cost alloy, can generate significant magnetic flux changes, and thus create power through electromagnetic induction. Unlike traditional generators, the mode of operation is low-displacement, high-force, high damping which in combination with the specific multi-tether configuration creates some unique effects and interesting optimization challenges.\nUsing an empirical approach with a combination of numerical tools, such as ORCAFLEX, and physical models, we investigated the properties and sensitivities of this system arrangement, including various heave plate geometries, with the overall goal of identifying the mass and hydrodynamic parameters required for optimum performance. Furthermore, through a detailed physical model test program at the University of New Hampshire, we were able to study in more detail how the heave plate geometry affects the drag and added mass coefficients. In presenting this work we will discuss how alternate geometries could be used to optimize the hydrodynamic parameters of the heave plate, allowing maximum inertial forces in operational conditions, while simultaneously minimizing the forces generated in extreme waves.\nThis presentation will cover the significant findings from this research, including physical model results and identified sensitivity parameters. In addition, we will discuss some preliminary results from our large-scale ocean trial conducted in August & September of this year.",

When the storm track is located so that cold outbreaks occur over places that are preconditioned for convection, deep water formation is more likely. To understand how cyclones influence the atmospheric forcing of deep water formation in the North Atlantic, we identify preferred North Atlantic cyclone locations (“cyclone states”) and associated temperature, humidity, freshwater, and radiative fluxes, and attribute the surface fluxes to physical processes using NASA MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications) surface fluxes, temperature and humidity tendencies and a MERRA-based cyclone climatology. We then quantify the time and space variability and trends of the cyclone states, and how these affect North Atlantic surface fluxes.",

            "abstract": "We have collected continuous vertical-component broadband data from 1109 seismic stations in regional networks across China, Korea, and Japan for the year 2011 to perform the largest surface wave tomography study in the region. Using this data set, we have measured over half a million Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves from 1-year stacks of station-pair ambient seismic noise cross-correlations. Quality control is performed by measuring the coherency of the positive and negative lag time sides of the cross-correlations. If the coherency is below an empirically determined threshold, the dispersion curve is measured on the side of the highest SNR. Otherwise, the positive and negative sides of the cross-correlation are averaged before dispersion curve measurement. Group velocity measurements for which the SNR was less than 10 are discarded. The Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves are regionalized on a tessellated spherical shell grid in the period range 10 to 50 s to produce maps of Rayleigh wave group velocity distributions. Preliminary maps at 10 seconds period match well with geologic features at the surface. In particular, we observe low group velocities in the Songliao, Bohai Bay, Sichuan, Ordos, Tarim, and Junggar Basins in China, and the Ulleung and Yamato Basins in the East Sea (Sea of Japan). Higher group velocities are observed in regions with less sediment cover. At periods around 30 s, we observe group velocity decreases going from east to west in China, representing an overall trend of crustal thickening due to the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates. The Ordos and Sichuan blocks show higher group velocities relative to the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, possibly reflecting low temperatures in these cratons.",

            "abstract": "The candidate phylum Aigarchaeota contains thermophilic archaea from terrestrial, subsurface, and marine geothermal ecosystems. The phylogeny and metabolic potential of Aigarchaeota has been deduced from several recent single-cell amplified genomes; however, an accurate description of their metabolism, potential ecological interactions, and role in biogeochemical cycling is lacking. Here we report possible ecological interactions and the in situ metabolism of an uncultivated lineage of Aigarchaeota from an oxic, terrestrial hot-spring filamentous ‘streamer’ community (Octopus Spring, pH = 8; T = 78 – 84 °C, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was combined with detailed genomic and transcriptomic reconstruction to elucidate the ecophysiological role of Aigarchaeota in these streamer communities. This novel population of Aigarchaeota are filamentous (~500 nm diameter by ~10-30 μm length), which is consistent with the morphology predicted by the presence and transcription of a single actin-encoding gene. Aigarchaeota filaments are intricately associated with other community members, which include both thermophilic bacteria and archaea. Metabolic reconstruction suggests that this aigarchaeon is an aerobic, chemoorganotroph. A single heme copper oxidase complex was identified in de novo genome assemblies, and was highly transcribed in environmental samples. Potential electron donors include acetate, fatty acids, sugars, peptides, and aromatic compounds. Transcripts related to genes specific to each of these potential electron donors were identified, indicating that this population of Aigarchaeota likely utilizes a broad range of reduced carbon substrates. Potential electron donors for this population may include extracellular polymeric substances produced by other microorganisms in close proximity. Flagellum genes were also highly transcribed, which suggests a potential mechanism for motility and/or cell-cell attachment. This study provides the first evidence for the in situ metabolism and possible ecological interactions of a novel lineage of Aigarchaeota that are globally distributed in oxic hot-spring ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Here we will present a new technique of satellite image compositing, supported by NOAA for producing and visualizing cloud products in the Alaska region. This technique, dubbed morphological compositing, is applied to a set of polar and geostationary satellite cloud products (CLAVR-x and GSIP) to create natural, real-time, high temporal resolution animations at the high latitudes.\nOther existing approaches for compositing satellite imagery from multiple sources produce imagery that, first and foremost, present the latest observations where available. The normal consequence of these approaches is a set of images with suboptimal temporal continuity (where continuity means natural motion, consistent resolution and correct location at the image time). Until recently this was understood to be inevitable at the high latitudes. However, the high sampling rate of cloud characteristics poleward of 70 degrees latitude (from four NOAA AVHRR sensors and two Metop AVHRR sensors) provides enough information for a more advanced compositing approach.\nThe technique presented here uses an “optical flow” algorithm to estimate the object motion of clouds in between polar satellite observations and produce accurate, full-resolution imagery at 30-minute resolution. The resulting product can be interpreted just like geostationary imagery, and is in fact seamlessly combined with GOES-West cloud products in the final compositing stage. In addition, we will discuss the operational plans for the product starting in early 2015, as well as the possibilities for other related applications.",

Delgada using closely spaced seismic-reflection profiles, high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and marine magnetics data. This new dataset documents NSAF location and continuity, associated tectonic geomorphology, shallow stratigraphy and deformation. Variable deformation patterns in the generally narrow (~1-km-wide) fault zone are largely associated with fault trend and fault bends.\nWe have described four regions (Pt. Arena, Basin, Shelter Cove, and Mendocino) along and adjacent to the NSAF based on fault trend, deformation styles, seismic stratigraphy, and seafloor bathymetry. The NSAF in the southern region (Pt. Arena) of the survey area is imaged as an arcuate fault trace that changes ~15° (327° to 342°) from south to north over a distance of about 50 km. The NSAF in the middle two regions (Basin and Shelter Cove) passes through two acute fault bends (~9° and ~8°), resulting in both an asymmetric “lazy z” sedimentary basin and an uplifted rocky shoal (\"Tolo Bank\"). The northwestern region of the survey area (Mendocino) lies west of the NSAF and Shelter Cove, and includes an east-trending fault zone related to the Mendocino transform fault that extends onshore near Punta Gorda.\nUsing the densely spaced seismic-reflection profiles we have created an isopach map of Holocene sediment throughout the survey area. This isopach map has revealed thick sediment piles adjacent to coastal watersheds with high uplift rates.\nWe infer from fault geometries, local bathymetry/topography and aero/marine magnetics that the NSAF zone transitions from a broadly distributed fault zone to a narrow fault zone over a short distance near Shelter Cove, Ca. At Shelter Cove the NSAF is characterized as a narrow, continuous fault. North of Shelter Cove the San Andreas likely terminates into a series of “horse tail” splay thrust faults known as the Kings Range Thrust. These observations allows for the NSAF near Shelter Cove, CA to accommodate significant slip, in agreement with paleoseismic studies and historical records. ",

An additional challenge for modeling is that global atlases of soil texture and composition are based on wet sieving, a technique that breaks the aggregates, particularly phyllosilicates, that are encountered in natural soils, drastically altering the original size distribution of the soil that is subject to wind erosion.\nWe propose both a semi-empirical and theoretical method to constrain the size-resolved mineral composition of emitted dust aerosols based on global atlases of soil texture and composition. Our semi-empirical method re-aggregates clay phyllosilicate minerals into larger soil particle sizes and constrains the size distribution of each emitted mineral based on observed mineral distributions at the source. Our theoretical method extends Kok’s brittle fragmentation theory to individual minerals. To this end we reconstruct the undisturbed size distribution for each mineral as a function of soil texture and soil type and calculate the emitted size distribution applying brittle fragmentation and assuming homogeneous fragmentation properties among the mineral aggregates. These approaches were tested within the NASA GISS Earth System ModelE. We discuss the improvements achieved and suggest future developments.",

            "abstract": "Global climate change over the last 100 ka is known to have resulted in glacial fluctuations in the eastern Sierra Nevada evidenced today by moraines. The effect of past climate on regolith erosion rates is quantified by modeling hillslope diffusion and evolution of a profile cross-section of Mono Basin moraine in the eastern Sierra Nevada. The degradation in the model is described by the linear transport law, q = -κ(dz/dx), where the diffusivity coefficient, κ, is a parameter to account for factors affecting regolith transport rate (q) unrelated to slope (dz/dx), such as climate and substrate. Three scenarios were modeled with respective κ values. In the first, κ is held constant through the age of the landform and optimized to reproduce the current moraine cross-section. In the second, κ varies with time based on the documented variation in the paleoclimate and related degradation rate. In the third, κ is held constant and defined by present-day degradation values measured in the region. In all the scenarios the moraine initial slopes are at the angle of repose. Comparisons of the first (constant κ) and second (variable κ) scenarios show that the former can generate erosion rates that overestimate crest elevation by 30% during the first quarter of the landform age and underestimate it by 20% during the latter three-quarters. However, the third (current κ) scenario underestimates the degradation up to 58% of the current profile. This indicates that the past erosion rates were higher than what is observed today. Increased regolith erosion rates in the past were driven by climates colder and wetter than the present.",

These three independent satellite datasets consistently show higher greenness level during the dry season relative to the wet season.

Today’s NASA Astrophysics Science Education and Public Outreach Forum (SEPOF), one of a new generation of forums coordinating the work of NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) EPO efforts—in collaboration with the ASP and NASA SMD missions and programs--has adapted the Discovery Guides into “evergreen” educational resources suitable for a variety of audiences. The Guides focus on “deep sky” objects and astrophysics themes (stars and stellar evolution, galaxies and the universe, and exoplanets), showcasing EPO resources from more than 30 NASA astrophysics missions and programs in a coordinated and cohesive “big picture” approach across the electromagnetic spectrum, grounded in best practices to best serve the needs of the target audiences.\nEach monthly guide features a theme and a representative object well-placed for viewing, with an accompanying interpretive story, finding charts, strategies for conveying the topics, and complementary supporting NASA-approved education activities and background information from a spectrum of NASA missions and programs. The Universe Discovery Guides are downloadable from the NASA Night Sky Network web site at nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov.\nWe will share the Forum-led Collaborative’s experience in developing the guides, how they place individual science discoveries and learning resources into context for audiences, and how the Guides can be readily used in scientist public outreach efforts, in college and university introductory astronomy classes, and in other engagements between scientists, students and the public.",

The lake is situated beneath 800 m of ice and ~ 70 km upstream of the grounding line where Whillans Ice Stream terminates into the Ross Sea. Subglacial Lake Whillans is a shallow lake and a component of a complex subglacial hydrological system that may resemble a large wetland along the Siple Coast of West Antarctica. Subglacial Lake Whillans drains and refills on a sub-decadal time scale discharging water towards the Ross Sea.\nWater and sediment samples were recovered from the lake, using clean access drilling technologies, in January, 2013. Isotopic analysis of the lake waters indicates basal meltwater from the ice sheet as the dominant water source. Geochemical analysis of the lake water reveals it is freshwater with mineral weathering as a significant solute source, with a minor contribution from sea water likely from relict marine sediments. Subglacial hydrothermal activity upstream may also contribute solutes. Nutrients N and P are present at micromolar concentrations. Sediment porewaters from shallow cores (~ 40 cm depth) of the subglacial lake sediments indicate increasing solute concentration with depth, with up to ~ five times greater solute concentrations than in the lake water. The waters and sediment contain metabolically active organisms which are likely involved in elemental cycling within the lake system.\nHere we will discuss solute sources to the lake, solute dynamics within the lake waters and sediment, and the fluxes of solute and nutrients to the Ross Sea and their implications for these marine ecosystems.",

The evolution of crystal fabric is driven by strain-induced grain rotation, as well as recrystallization. Most fabric-evolution models ignore or parameterize many of the physical processes involved, or are valid only for highly parameterized fabrics. Here, we describe a new fabric model that incorporates a more-realistic treatment of the physics involved. The model includes connectivity information between grains, with grains exchanging mass and interacting with their neighbors. The model treats dynamic recrystallization, polygonization, grain rotation, and other processes. We validate the model against thin-section data from the WAIS divide ice-core. By initializing the model with a number of fabrics generated by resampling shallow thin sections (with replacement) we show that a large proportion of fabric variability seen in deeper thin sections is stochastic, arising both from initial conditions and from the variability inherent in fabric development.",

            "abstract": "The feasibility of surface current measurements by airborne and spaceborne along-track interferometric synthetic aperture radar (along-track InSAR) has been demonstrated on a number of occasions. Since the Doppler shifts detected by the radar include contributions of surface wave motions, a correction for these contributions has to be applied, which is often estimated as a mean correction for the entire current field on the basis of a simple theoretical model. In coastal areas and river estuaries with complex current and wave patterns, this approach is not adequate because one has to account for spatial variations in the wave field and in the corresponding corrections for the current field, which can be on the same order of magnitude as the actual surface currents of interest. Here we test the ability of a numerical near-shore hindcast model (Delft3D) to produce a wave field to be used for more appropriate computations of corrections for the along-track InSAR data. Our study was conducted at the mouth of the Columbia River on the West Coast of the U.S. during the spring of 2013. Over the course of the experiment, seven TerraSAR-X along-track InSAR images were acquired as well as a variety of in-situ data sets, such as trajectories of GPS-equipped Lagrangian drifters and velocity profiles from acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP). We use the in-situ data to validate our Delft3D model results, and we try to relate spatially varying differences between the measured and simulated surface currents and the TerraSAR-X derived Doppler velocities to the wave spectra obtained from Delft3D and to wave patterns observed in the SAR images. The long-term objective of this work is to derive the wave information and the corresponding velocity corrections from signatures contained in the along-track InSAR data set itself, such that a completely self-consistent correction of along-track InSAR-derived surface current fields for the contributions of spatially varying wave motions becomes possible. The resulting high-resolution surface current fields will be very valuable for applications such as bathymetry and river runoff monitoring.",

Borehole reconstructions of these quantities over the Common Era have been used, inter alia, for the validation of general circulation models and to help quantify the overall energy budget of the global climate system. Recent analyses of geothermal data have been performed with data obtained from the borehole climatology data base of the International Heat Flow Commission that contains subsurface temperature profiles for over 600 sites spread across the Northern Hemisphere, with the majority of maximum borehole depths varying between 200 m to 600 m. Due to the nature of heat conduction, different depth ranges contain the record of past and persistent changes in the energy balance between the lower atmosphere and the ground for different time periods.\n Here we examine the dependency of estimated ground surface temperature histories and subsurface heat content changes on the maximum depth of the borehole temperature profile. We find that previous results remain unchanged for the period since industrialisation, but differ during earlier periods over the last millennium. We suggest that large-scale temperature reconstructions from terrestrial boreholes should be derived from datasets that comprise boreholes truncated at similar thermal depths. Analyses that do not control for the impacts of the depth of truncation are otherwise subject to difficult-to-estimate biases in temperature change estimates during the early and middle part of the last millennium.",

These earthquakes include the following: 2008 Mw=7.9 Wenchuan; 2010 Mw=6.9 Yushu; 2013 Mw=6.6 Lushan; and 2013 Mw=5.9 Minxian events. On August 4, 2014 the Mw=6.1 earthquake struck Ludian in Yunnan province. Althought it was a moderate size earthquake, the casualties have reached at least 589 people.\nIn fact, more than 50% of Chinese cities and more than 70% of large to medium size cities are located in the areas where the seismic intensity may reach Ⅶ or higher. Collapsing buildings are the main cause of Chinese earthquake casualties; the secondary causes are induced geological disasters such as landslide and barrier lakes.\nSeveral enormous challenges must be overcome to reduce hazards from earthquakes and secondary disasters.（1）Much of the infrastructure in China cannot meet the engineering standard for adequate seismic protection. In particular, some buildings are not strong enough to survive the potential strong ground shaking, and some of them did do not keep away from the active fault with a safe distance. It will be very costly to reinforce or rebuild such buildings. (2) There is lack of the rigorous legislation on earthquake disaster protection. (3) It appears that both government and citizen rely too much on earthquake prediction to avoid earthquake casualties. (4) Geologic conditions is very complicate and in need of additional studies, especially in southwest of China. There still lack of detail survey on potential geologic disasters, such as landslides.\nAlthough we still cannot predict earthquakes, it is possible to greatly reduce earthquake hazards. For example, some Chinese scientists have begun studies with the aim of identifying active faults under large cities and to propose higher building standards. It will be a very difficult work to improve the quality and scope of earthquake disaster protection dramatically in the coming years due to the factors mentioned above. Nevertheless, a broadly based program of earthquake hazard reduction in urban areas has begun.",

            "abstract": "Natural particles suspended in surface water are often non-spherical. We explore the ways in which particle shape effects particle motion, focusing specifically on how particle rotation is divided into spinning and tumbling components. This, in turn, will effect particle collision, clustering, and settling rates. We focus on idealized axisymmetric particles shaped as rods, discs, and spheroids. They are chosen so as to explain the physics of aspherical-particle motion that will be relevant for natural particles such as plankton, sediment, or aggregates (e.g. oil-mineral aggregates, clay flocs, or bio-sediment aggregates held together by TEP). Our work begins with laboratory measurements of particle motion in a turbulence tank built to mimic the flow found in rivers, estuaries, and the ocean surface mixed layer. We then proceed to direct numerical simulation of particle-flow interactions in sheared turbulence similar to that which is found in the surface water of creeks and rivers.\nWe find that shape has only a very weak effect on particle angular velocity, which is a quantity calculated with respect the global reference frame (i.e. east/north/up). If we analyze rotation in a particle's local frame (i.e. the particle's principle axes of rotation), then particle shape has a strong effect on rotation. In the local frame, rotation is described by two components: tumbling and spinning. We find that rod-shaped particles spin more than they tumble, and we find that disc-shaped particles tumble more than they spin. Such behavior is indicative of how particles respond the the directional influence of vortex tubes in turbulence, and such response has implications for particle motion other than rotation. Understanding particle alignment is relevant for predicting particle-particle collision rates, particle-wall collision rates, and the shear-driven breakup of aggregates. We discuss these briefly in the context of what can be concluded from the rotation data discussed above.",

            "abstract": "Cases of induced seismicity where the external forcing is controlled can contribute significantly to our understanding of the response of the crust to stress perturbations caused by fluid movement and the associated rupture events. In this work we analyze the 2013 September-October seismic sequence associated to the injection of natural gas into the Castor UGS, offshore Castellon, Spain, which has forced the stop of storage operations to date. The third period of gas injection was accompanied by small (M<3) and widely distributed seismic events. After injection was stopped seismic activity became more localized, eventually developing into mainshock (M~4)-aftershock sequences in early October, returning after to near-background levels. We use tools of statistical seismology to analyze the seismic sequence. Of particular interest is the application of the weighted average magnitude method, which shows escalations in average magnitude of the seismic events (or energy release of the system), which we interpret as rupture events, and which correlate with changes in injection rate. Furthermore, it shows that the system became unstable at some point during the injection, amplifying small fluctuations of the stress field, that possibly lead to the events of M~4 two weeks after the injection stopped. Using rank ordering statistics we have estimated the most probable size of the next largest earthquake, and interestingly it is just slightly larger than the largest registered to date, M=4.2. Perhaps more importantly, there might be log-periodic oscillations in the seismic moment release time series, which hopefully point to the presence of precursors prior to the M~4 events. This could be encouraging in terms of a hazard perspective as it could mean that, in some cases, there might be windows of detection prior to main events.",

This extraordinary celestial coincidence provides the opportunity for scientific scrutiny of an Oort cloud comet with a sophisticated collection of spacecraft instruments and for the study of the perturbations of the Mars atmosphere by a unusual exogenous source of mass and energy. The neutral coma of Siding Spring will impact the Mars atmosphere at a speed of 56 km/sec, corresponding to an energy of 300 eV for an H2O molecule. At these energies the molecules will deposit their energy in the Mars upper atmosphere, above the location of the ionospheric peak: this is the region of Mars that MAVEN is designed to study. Significant perturbations to the temperature, densities, and wind patterns are expected for a sufficiently active comet. We anticipate that MAVEN will measure energetic ions and electrons and magnetic perturbations produced by the interaction of the comet coma with the solar wind, as well as perturbations to the neutral and electron temperature, neutral, electron, and ion densities in the upper atmosphere of Mars. The suite of in situ measurements will be described as well as preliminary results, if possible.",

            "abstract": "Salt marshes play an important role in global and regional carbon and nitrogen cycling. We tested the hypothesis that anthropogenic nitrogen loading alters greenhouse gas (GHG, including CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions and carbon sequestration in salt marshes. We measured GHG emissions biweekly for two growing seasons across a nitrogen-loading gradient of four Spartina salt marshes in Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts. In addition, we conducted nitrogen addition experiments in a pristine marsh by adding low and high nitrate to triplicate plots bi-weekly during the summer. The GHG flux measurements were made in situ with a state-of-the-art mobile gas measurement system using the cavity ring down technology that consists of a CO2/CH4 analyzer (Picarro) and an N2O/CO analyzer (Los Gatos). We observed strong seasonal variations in greenhouse gas emissions. The differences in gas emissions across the nitrogen gradient were not significant, but strong pulse emissions of N2O were observed after nitrogen was artificially added to the marsh. Our results will facilitate model development to simulate GHG emissions in coastal wetlands and support methodology development to assess carbon credits in preserving and restoring coastal wetlands.

            "abstract": "The so-called \"blobs\" as defined in Sheeley et al., 1997, are small-scale structures embedded in the continuously expanding white-light solar corona and are considered to be tracers of the slow solar wind. As blobs are very faint structures, we considered long periods (around 2 to 5 days) where there were no coronal mass ejections (CME). The scarce presence of CMEs during the extended past solar minimum has permitted the identification of continuous blobs detachments, allowing us to estimate their un-projected trajectories between 2 and 15 solar radii (Mierla et al., 2008). In agreement with the idea that blobs are liberated from the cusps of helmet steamers (Wang et al., 1998), we constrained the observing region of interest in the coronagraphs field of view to ±30° from the Sun's equator. We studied cases where blobs were detected by the coronagraphs C2/LASCO and COR2/SECCHI, and inferred their source locations using two packages that implement the 3D potential field source surface (PFSS) model: (1) PFSS developed by De Rosa (2010) and (2) PFSS (De Rosa) in FORWARD (people.hao.ucar.edu/sgibson/FORWARD/). The locations of the origin of blobs that we find, support previous results that track down the origin of the slow solar wind to regions near the helmet streamers and pseudostreamers (Wang et al., 2012, Riley&Luhmann, 2012). Additionally, we found that in some cases blobs are coming from the boundaries of growing or decaying equatorial coronal holes, where the interchange reconnection is\nsupposed to be faster.",

            "abstract": "The West African Craton (WAC) consists of an Archaean–Proterozoic basement, is covered by sediments ranging in age from Neoproterozoic to present, and is bounded by multiple Pan-African or Hercynian belts. While some parts of the WAC have been studied extensively in recent years, seismic constraints of the central eastern region have hitherto been lacking.\nWe have analysed recordings from 2005–2013 from the International Monitoring System (IMS) seismic array TORD (Torodi, SW Niger) of the Preparatory Commission of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO). Our study provides a good example of how data acquired by the nuclear monitoring community may be used for basic research on the structure and dynamics of the Earth.\nHere, we present results of P-to-S receiver function and shear wave splitting analyses that give us insight into crustal, mantle, and mantle transition zone structure. H-Κ-stacking analysis yield bulk crustal properties, with an approx. 40 km thick crust and a low Vp/Vs-ratio of ~1.69. The latter suggests that the Paleoproterozoic crystalline basement is pervasive beneath the array.\nAt approx. 70 km depth, we detect what we interpret to be a mid-lithospheric discontinuity, which is in good agreement with a recent S receiver function study of the WAC. Both the 410 and 660 km discontinuities are visible in the receiver functions. The mantle transition appears to have a thickness of ~246 km, which is very close to the global average.\nSplitting fast orientations show a roughly E–W trend, and delay times are very low (~0.55s ± 0.01s). The results are consistent with recent global azimuthal seismic anisotropy studies. The lack of backazimuthal variation in fast direction indicates a single layer of anisotropy beneath the array. This suggests that the anisotropic fabrics stem from deformation in the Paleoproterozoic craton itself rather than the adjoining Neoproterozoic Trans-Saharan (Pharusian-Dahomeyan) mobile belt, as one would expect the latter to result in stronger anisotropic features.",

            "abstract": "In tropical mountain regions, the societal demands for ecosystem services has led to pressure over ecosystems that, in ocassions, may threaten the capacity of ecosystems to provide services. More specifically, global-change processes such as land use change and climate dynamics may lead to uncertainties about the stability of ecosystem functions on which services rely on. Of particular interest are the effects of land cover changes on the hydrological dynamics of the soil, that support multiple regulation and provision services, critical for a large portion of the population settled in mountain regions of the world. In this work, we present a protocol for the combined monitoring of ecohydrological, biogeochemical and sediment dynamics in a group of instrumented plots representing a typical gradient of human intervention in a tropical mountain ecosystem. Land cover categories include: a mature forest, secondary forest, early successional stage, recently abandoned agricultural field, a cattle pasture, permanent cropland, a high rotation cropland. On each plot, water fluxes from the top of the canopy to 1.5 m below soil surface are measured using a diverse array of instruments, along with measurements of sediment load in runoff waters and nutrient loads for all hydrologic compartments (measurements include Ca, Mg, K, P, NH4, NO3, Mn, Fe). Our preliminary results indicate that although rainfall does not vary significantly among plots, runoff generation does, with higher values ocurring in the pasture. Conversely, infiltration rates are highest in both types of forests, particularly for shallower layers of the soil. Chemical analysis indicate higher nutrient loads in runoff generating from croplands, highlighting the potential loss of soil fertility and potentially leading to eutrophication in water bodies downstream. After completion, our results will provide land managers tools to assess larger-scale effects of land use changes on the capacity of ecosystems to provide services to society.",

            "abstract": "In response to regional and municipal policies, transportation agencies are increasingly integrating greenhouse gas considerations into decision making. At the local level, fuel-based methods suffer leakage, mandating a bottom-up approach based on emissions models driven by local activity data. However, high spatial and temporal resolution traffic datasets are in general scarce and subject to error. Emissions models too are based on limited data and often require inputs that are not directly measured. Here, we show that routine, on-road CO2 surface measurements can be used to improve uncertainties on both of these fronts. Using forty hours of surface concentration data collected on CA Highway 24 together with a simple atmospheric dispersion model, we simultaneously derive traffic density as a function of vehicle speed, composite vehicle parameters needed to map vehicle operation to fuel consumption, and baseline meteorological parameters such as wind speed and mixing height. We compare our results directly with traffic loop detector measurements made by California’s Performance Measurement System (PeMS), with emissions predictions from EPA’s MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES), and with weather station data included in NOAA's Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System (MADIS). Using both top-down and bottom-up techniques, we measure the immediate rush-hour emissions reduction associated with congestion alleviation following the opening of the Caldecott Tunnel fourth bore. We use this example to argue that routine and distributed on-road measurements of this kind could serve as a much needed policy tool for testing the impact of traffic-related emissions reduction strategies.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the source and abundance of sediment transported within tidal creeks is essential for studying the connectivity between coastal watersheds and estuaries under conditions of changing land use, storminess and sea-level rise. Furthermore, analysis of the fine grained suspended sediment load (SSL) carried through the system is critical in our understanding of nutrient and contaminant transport, human-induced change, and the effects of climate. Unfortunately traditional methods of SSL collection, including instantaneous measurements and automatic samplers, can be labor intensive, expensive and are often inadequate for geochemical analysis. In estuaries this issue is even more pronounced, due to tidal bi-directional flow. This study tests the efficacy of a modification to an established uni-directional time-integrated sediment sampler (TIMs) design. Our new bi-directional TIMs design utilizes a ‘L’ shaped outflow tube to collect sediment uniquely in each direction of tidal flow. Laboratory flume experiments using dye and particle image velocimetry (PIV) are used to characterize the flow within the collector, specifically, to quantify the settling velocities and identify the stagnation points. Further laboratory tests of chemically dispersed sediment indicate that bi-directional TIMs capture nearly all incoming particles greater than 4 μm across a range of flow velocities. Field trials were employed in two distinct sampling locations within the tidal zone. Samples of single time point SSL were collected over a four day period and compared to sediment collected by the bi-directional TIMs over the same time frame. Particle size composition from the bi-directional TIMs were representative of the array of single time point samples, but yielded greater mass and proved to be more representative of the overall tidal flux. This work proves the efficacy of the modified bi-directional TIMs design, offering a novel tool for collection of SSL in the tidally dominated portion of the watershed.",

However, in order to calculate accurate DOC fluxes for comparison across sites, in situ FDOM data must be compensated for matrix effects. Key matrix effects, include temperature, turbidity and the inner filter effect due to color. These interferences must be compensated for to develop a reasonable relationship between FDOM and DOC. In this study, we applied laboratory-derived correction factors to real time data from the five USGS WEBB headwater streams in order to gauge their effectiveness across a range of matrix effects. The good news is that laboratory derived correction factors improved the predicative relationship (higher r2) between DOC and FDOM when compared to uncorrected data. The relative importance of each matrix effect (i.e. temperature) varied by site and by time, implying that each and every matrix effect should be compensated for when available. In general, temperature effects were more important on longer time scales, while corrections for turbidity and DOC inner filter effects were most prevalent during hydrologic events, when the highest instantaneous flux of DOC occurred. Unfortunately, even when corrected for matrix effects, in situ FDOM is a weaker predictor of DOC than A254, a common surrogate for DOC, implying that either DOC fluoresces at varying degrees (but should average out over time), that some matrix effects (e.g. pH) are either unaccounted for or laboratory-derived correction factors do not encompass the site variability of particles and organics. The least impressive finding is that the inherent dependence on three variables in the FDOM correction algorithm increases the likelihood of record data gaps which increases the uncertainty in calculated DOC flux values.",

            "abstract": "Substantial attention is being devoted to soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in Polar Regions, given the potential impacts of CO2 and methane (CH4) release into the atmosphere. In this study, which is part of a broader effort to quantify carbon loss pathways in patterned Arctic permafrost soils, CH4 and CO2 flux measurements were recorded from a site approximately 30 km south of Deadhorse, Alaska and 1 km west of the Dalton Highway. Samples were collected in late July, 2014 using six static flux chambers that were located within a single low-centered ice-wedge polygon. Three flux chambers were co-located (within a 1 m triangle of each other) near the center of the polygon and three were co-located (along a 1.5 m line) on the ridge adjacent to a trough. Soil in the center of the polygon was 100% water saturated, whereas water saturation measured on the ridge ranged between 25-50%. Depth to ice table was approximately 50 cm near the center of the polygon and 40 cm at the ridge. Temperature depth probes were installed within the center and ridge of the polygon. Nine gas measurements were collected from each chamber over a 24 h period, stored in helium-purged Exetainer vials, shipped to a laboratory, and analyzed using gas chromatography. Measured cumulative methane fluxes were linear over the 24 h period demonstrating constant methane production, but considerable spatial variability in flux was observed (0.1 to 4.7 mg hr-1 m-2 in polygon center, and 0.003 to 0.36 mg hr-1m-2 on polygon ridge). Shallow soil temperatures varied between 1.3 and 9.8oC in the center and 0.6 to 7.5oC in the rim of the polygon. Air temperatures varied between 1.3 and 4.6oC. CO2 fluxes were greater than methane fluxes and more consistent at each co-location; ranging from 21.7 to 36.6 mg hr-1 m-2 near the polygon centers and 3.5 to 29.1 mg hr-1 m-2 in the drier polygon ridge. Results are consistent with previous observations that methanogenesis is favored in a water saturated active layer. The independence of CH4 and CO2 fluxes suggests that different mechanisms may affect their formation and transport. Ongoing work on DOC and acetate concentrations may further elucidate the source of CH4 and CO2 flux. Results will be used to benchmark vertical SOC transport and active layer dynamics models, and then integrated into a Lidar-based geomorphic model for ice wedge polygon terrain.",

For each region we use the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) analysis to decompose SMB signal into locally periodic components (IMFs), and we determine the dominant oscillation characterizing each IMF time series using the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram analysis. To study the time variable amplitude of the identified oscillations we apply a wavelet analysis to each monthly IMF time series. In both regions we are able to identify the main climatic oscillation such as semi-annual oscillation (SAO), annual oscillation (AO), quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and a decadal cycle. In WAIS we find that the amplitude of the QBO is largest in 2004-2010. In EAIS QBO is statistically significant after 1994 with larger amplitude in 1994-2004. In WAIS we find a statistically significant ENSO during 1979-1999 with the largest signal during 1984-1994. In EAIS we detect a statistically significant ENSO signal during 2003-2011. In EAIS most of the SMB signal comes from the coastal regions, however we can also detect the signature of these oscillations in the interior.",

Because their epicenters are close to one another, we regard the March ML6.2 and June ML6.3 earthquakes as an event sequence. To investigate precursory seismicity change of the Nantou earthquake sequence, we applied the Epidemic-Type Aftershock-Sequences model (ETAS model) to the earthquake catalog data of the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) covering broader Taiwan region. Application of more than one model to an earthquake catalog would be informative in elucidating the relationships between seismicity precursors and the preparatory processes of large earthquakes. Based on this motivation, we further applied two different approaches: the pattern informatics (PI) method and the ZMAP method, which is a gridding technique based on the standard deviate (Z-value) test to the same earthquake catalog data of CWB. As a result, we found that the epicenter of the 2013 ML6.2 Nantou earthquake was surrounded by three main seismic quiescence regions prior to its occurrence. The assumption that this is due to precursory slip (stress drop) on fault plane or its deeper extent of the ML6.2 Nantou earthquake is supported by previous researches based on seismicity data, geodedic data, and numerical simulations using rate- and state-dependent friction laws.",

            "abstract": "Global models of the integrated lithospheric strength of oceanic plates and ridge-push force are presented. To assess the transmission of ridge-push related stress in oceanic plates, ridge-push force and lithospheric strength are compared. The integrated strength of oceanic plate has been estimated using plate cooling model and relevant rheology of the crust and upper mantle. The strength analysis includes Low-Temperature Plasticity (LTP) and assumes a range of possible tectonic conditions and rheology in the plates. The ridge-push force has been derived from thermal state of oceanic lithosphere, crustal age and seafloor depth data. The results of modelling show that both lithospheric strength and ridge-push force are age dependent. Old oceanic plates can be as strong as ~ 11 TN m-1. For plates of the same age, the magnitude of ridge-push force is in the order of ~ 3.5 TN m-1.The transmission of ridge-push is mainly controlled by the rheology and predominant tectonic condition in the plates. If the rheology of oceanic lithosphere is dry, the estimated lithospheric strength is larger than the ridge-push force at all ages for compressional tectonic regimes and at old ages for extension (> 75 Ma). Under such consideration, the ridge-push related stresses may not dissipate in a form of intraplate deformation. Instead, the stresses may be transmitted in the plate. If an oceanic lithosphere has wet rheology, the strength of young plates (< 75 Ma) is much less than the ridge-push force for extensional and compressional tectonic regimes. Consequently, the stress associated with ridge-push may result in intraplate deformation. This depends, however, on the balance of force resulting from far field forces, basal shear traction and Gravitational Potential Energy of elevated regions. In particular, strong basal shear traction can balance the ridge-push force, and as a result, the oceanic lithosphere may respond by deformation. The consideration of LTP in the upper mantle has negligible effect on the total strength of lithosphere, and hence, on the relation between lithospheric strength and ridge-push transmission.",

            "abstract": "In our contribution we present a new method for the evaluation of terrain corrections (TC) and/or topographical effects (TE) for the Gravity Database of the Slovak Republic - using a new software solution (program Toposk) and up to date high-quality digital terrain models. The program was successfully tested on several synthetic models. In our algorithm we have used the well established approach, developed by the gravimetrical school in former Czechoslovakia i.e. dividing the surrounding area into so called inner zone T1 (0 - 250 m), intermediate zone T2 (250 - 5240 m) and outer zone (5.24 - 166.7 km). When calculating the T1 zone contribution we have used interpolated station elevations instead the measured ones, which yield in our opinion better solution to the problem of small-scale inaccuracies of the detailed terrain model. Newly recalculated TC values for the Gravity Database of the Slovak Republic (total number of gravity stations equals 212478, with an average of 3-6 points/km2) are in the range from 0.20 to 79.84 mGal (for the correction density 2.67 gcm-3). Thanks to the new TC values, the final version of the obtained Bouguer anomaly field is more independent from non-geological influences and determines in a better way the information content on the lithospheric density distributions.\nIn the frame of the presented recalculation of regional gravity database we have worked with the concept of terrain corrections, but for other types of gravity method applications, the evaluation of topographical effects is much more straightforward - e.g. elimination of the effect of topography in the vertical gravity (tower) gradients approximation or during processing of absolute gravity measurements (with FG-5 and/or A-10 gravity meters). Another very important property of our proposed approach is that we can evaluate TC and TE in calculating points below the Earth’s surface (applicable also in borehole gravity method, BHGM).

MET Grid-Stat has been used to perform grid-to-grid neighborhood verification to account for the uncertainty inherent in high resolution forecasting, and MET Method for Object-based Diagnostic Evaluation (MODE) has been used to develop techniques for object-based spatial verification of high resolution forecast grids for continuous meteorological variables.\nHigh resolution modeling requires more focused spatial and temporal verification over parts of the domain. With a Geographical Information System (GIS), researchers can now consider terrain type/slope and land use effects and other spatial and temporal variables as explanatory metrics in model assessments. GIS techniques, when coupled with high resolution point and gridded observations sets, allow location-based approaches that permit discovery of spatial and temporal scales where models do not sufficiently resolve the desired phenomena.\nIn this paper we discuss our initial GIS approach to verify WRF-ARW with a one-kilometer horizontal resolution inner domain centered over Southern California.

Highly reactive compounds such as isoprene, monoterpenes and glyoxal have been observed in the marine atmosphere and/or ocean, yet their atmospheric impact is extremely uncertain. This is largely due to the limited observational dataset, and thus a high level of uncertainty in global sources and spatial distributions of these compounds. The Oceanic Reactive Carbon: chemistry-climate impacts (ORC3) project aims to improve our knowledge of the sources and impacts of these reactive species in the remote marine atmosphere, through two 1-month field campaigns in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, and dedicated modelling activities.\nWe will present preliminary results from the two campaigns which took place during summer 2014 at the NCAS Cape Verde atmospheric observatory (16° 51' 49 N, 24° 52' 02 W), off the West African Atlantic coast. New datasets on the abundances of monoterpenes, isoprene and glyoxal have been obtained, spanning several weeks. Speciated monoterpene and isoprene observations have been obtained using a bespoke thermal desorption system hyphenated with portable GC-MS instrumentation. Glyoxal has been measured using a sensitive laser-induced phosphorescence (LIP) in-situ technique, which complements the limited database of remote-sensed glyoxal concentration measurements made in the remote marine atmosphere to date. We will describe the preliminary datasets obtained, and discuss implications for the atmospheric oxidising capacity and aerosol budget in the remote marine regions.",

            "abstract": "The unique solar minimum period of 2008/2009 has led to interesting observations of the equatorial ionosphere and low-latitude ionosphere made by the C/NOFS satellite. It has been found, for instance, downward equatorial vertical drifts during afternoon hours and upward drifts around local midnight, which were associated with enhanced semi-diurnal tides (Stoneback et al., 2011). To better understand the behavior of equatorial drifts, we used ground-based measurements of daytime 150-km echo drifts made by the Jicamarca Unattended Long-term studies of the Ionosphere and Atmosphere (JULIA) radar. Our analysis did not show signatures of the enhanced semi-diurnal pattern in the 150-km drifts, as seen by C/NOFS during the 2008/2009 solar minimum. We attribute the differences in the C/NOFS drifts and 150-km echo drifts to the height variability of the drifts, the abnormal F-region contraction due to the extreme solar minimum conditions, and the coupling with low-latitude semi-diurnal tides. We investigated further the height variation of the vertical drifts by comparing the Scherliess and Fejer [1999] F-region drift model with the 150-km echo drifts. We found that the model overestimates the 150-km vertical drifts in the morning, and underestimates the 150-km drifts in the afternoon. The same height variation is observed in all seasons and solar flux conditions (2001 through 2011).",

            "abstract": "The Andean building has been traditionally considered as a consequence of successive orogenic phases mostly occurring during the Cenozoic. However evidence from Peru-northern Chile and southern Argentina have shown a first contractional pulse during the mid to late Cretaceous. Between these regions, however, there are no reports evidencing this event, hence which open the questions about the real impact of this orogeny along the western boundary of South America. Likewise, the occurrence of this event in central Chile-Argentina could be evidencing that this first contractional pulse in the Andes respond to a major synchronous orogeny along the entire former western margin of Gondwana after a long period of extension since the Triassic. In this context, our study, located approximately at the latitude of the Aconcagua mount (32º50'S), reveals the existence of contractional structures, developed east of the Early Cretaceous magmatic arc, deforming Aptian rocks deposited in an extensional setting. Particularly, the geometry exhibited by a regional east-vergent anticline evidences inversion tectonics in which a thick Albian molasse unit is developed in the frontal limb and beyond with growth strata. Later this synorogenic deposits were thrusted and then covered unconformably by Upper Cretaceous volcanic unit, sealing the deformation of the Aptian-Albian rocks. Finally all these deposits were gently deformed and unconformably covered by a Maastrichtian volcanic unit. Studies of provenance indicate a transitional arc origin for the sandstones contained in the synorogenic deposits, which is in agree with the reported exhumation of previous Andean magmatic arc. Our data evidence the beginning of the contractional deformation, marking the onset of the orogeny in central Chile, during the mid-Cretaceous. Therefore we can propose that the Peruvian orogenic phase extended along most of the Southamerican margin. The location farther west, close to the concurrent arc, and it slightly older age respect to that evidenced north and south of the study region would not indicate a diachronism in the orogenic onset, but that deformation progressed from the arc to the eastern foreland. Considering that this orogeny lasted since the Albian to the Upper Cretaceous.\nThis study has been supported by the FONDECYT project N° 1120272.",

            "abstract": "Explicit parameterization of the decomposition of plant inputs and soil organic matter by microbes is becoming more widely accepted in models of various complexity, ranging from detailed process models to global-scale earth system models. While there are multiple ways to measure microbial biomass, chloroform fumigation-extraction (CFE) is commonly used to parameterize models.. However CFE is labor- and time-intensive, requires toxic chemicals, and it provides no specific information about the composition or function of the microbial community. We investigated correlations between measures of: CFE; DNA extraction yield; QPCR base-gene copy numbers for Bacteria, Fungi and Archaea; phospholipid fatty acid analysis; and direct cell counts to determine the potential for use as proxies for microbial biomass. As our ultimate goal is to develop a reliable, more informative, and faster methods to predict microbial biomass for use in models, we also examined basic soil physiochemical characteristics including texture, organic matter content, pH, etc. to identify multi-factor predictive correlations with one or more measures of the microbial community. Our work will have application to both microbial ecology studies and the next generation of process and earth system models.",

            "abstract": "LISN is an array of small instruments that operates as a real-time distributed observatory to understand the complex day-to-day variability and the extreme state of disturbance that occurs in the South American low-latitude ionosphere nearly every day after sunset. The LISN observatory aims to forecast the initiation and transport of plasma bubbles across the South American continent. The occurrence of this type of plasma structures and their embedded irregularities poses a prominent natural hazard to communication, navigation and high precision pointing systems. As commercial and military aviation is increasingly reliant on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) any interruption due to ionospheric irregularities or errors due to large density gradients constitutes a serious threat to passengers and crew. Therefore, it is important to understand the conditions and sources that contribute to the formation of these irregularities. To achieve high quality regional nowcasts and forecasts, the LISN system was designed to include a dense coverage of the South American landmass with 47 GPS receivers, 5 flux-gate magnetometers distributed on 2 base lines and 3 Vertical Incidence Pulsed Ionospheric Radar (VIPIR) ionosondes deployed along the same magnetic meridian that intersects the magnetic equator at 68° W. This presentation will provide a summary of recent instrument installations and new processing techniques that have been developed under the LISN project. We will also present the results of recent efforts to detect TIDs and TEC plasma depletions on a near real-time basis. We will describe a method to estimate the zonal velocity and tilt of the plasma bubbles/depletions by combining observations of TEC depletions acquired with adjacent receivers, making it possible to predict precisely their future locations.",

            "abstract": "We developed free software that enables researchers to utilize Microsoft’s new Kinect for Windows v2 sensor for a range of coastal and ocean mapping applications, as well as monitoring and measuring experimental scenes. While the original Kinect device used structured light and had very poor resolution, many geophysical researchers found uses for it in their experiments. The new next generation of this sensor uses time-of-flight technology, and can produce higher resolution depth measurements with an order of magnitude more accuracy. It also is capable of measurement through and under water.\nAn analysis tool in our application lets users quickly select any arbitrary surface in the sensor’s view. The tools automatically scans the surface, then calibrates and aligns a measurement volume to it. Depth readings from the sensor are converted into 3D point clouds, and points falling within this volume are projected into surface coordinates. Raster images can be output which consist of height fields aligned to the surface, generated from these projected measurements and interpolations between them. Images have a simple 1 pixel = 1 mm resolution and intensity values representing mm in height from the base-plane, which enables easy measurement and calculations to be conducted on the images in other analysis packages. Single snapshots can be taken manually on demand, or the software can monitor the surface automatically, capturing frames at preset intervals. This produces time lapse animations of dynamically changing surfaces.\nWe apply this analysis tool to an experiment studying the behavior of underwater oil in response to flowing water of different speeds and temperatures. Blobs of viscous oils are placed in a flume apparatus, which circulates water past them. Over the course of a couple hours, the oil blobs spread out, waves slowly ripple across their surfaces, and erosions occur as smaller blobs break off from the main blob. All of this can be captured in 3D, with mm accuracy, through the water using the Kinect for Windows v2 sensor and our K2MapKit software.",

In this new class of model, biome boundaries are predicted as the emergent properties of plant physiology, and are therefore sensitive to the high-dimensional parameterizations of plant functional traits. These new approaches offer the facility to quantitatively test ecophysiological hypotheses of plant distribution at large scales, a field which remains surprisingly under-developed.\nHere we describe experiments conducted with the Community Land Model Ecosystem Demography component, CLM(ED), in which we reduce the complexity of the problem by testing how individual plant functional trait changes to control the location of biome boundaries between functional types. Specifically, we investigate which physiological trade-offs determine the boundary between frequently burned savanna and forest biomes, and attempt to distinguish how each strategic life-history trade-off (carbon storage, bark investment, re-sprouting strategy) contributes towards the maintenance of sharp geographical gradients between fire adapted and typically inflammable closed canopy ecosystems. This study forms part of the planning for a model-inspired fire manipulation experiment at the cerrado-forest boundary in South-Eastern Brazil, and the results will be used to guide future data-collection and analysis strategies.",

            "abstract": "Fluxnet is a real success story of data integration. The scientific outcome is overwhelming. Nevertheless: in a time of methodological consolidation and transfer of the networks to technically more integrated infrastructures, a critical view on its weak points may strengthen the future success and our position within biogeochemical science. Four points should be discussed:\nWe have to select our sites more thoroughly.\nWe need better data curation.\nWe should think about ‘forgetting’ some of the older datasets.\nWe have responsibility for the results of integration studies.\nad 1: We had to learn during the past years that the EC is not applicable in all terrains. Slope and footprint problems are widespread and sites have to be critically scrutinized before being sure that we submit valuable ecological information. This is time consuming and may be frustrating since we have to accept that we had sometimes invested lots of work and money for building a flux tower at a site that is not suitable for the method. Nevertheless, a clear site quality policy should be developed among infrastructures and integrating activities.\nad 2: In some cases it has turned out that the information about different steps leading from the raw data to a number in integrated scientific papers has been lost. This is a big challenge to research infrastructures that should develop common rules for data curation to increase trust in integration activities.\nad 3: In the first approach Fluxnet left the responsibility for site and data quality to the site PI and accepted more or less all data submitted. Further approaches and in particular long-term infrastructures have to develop strategies to reject (or at least flag) data from sites that are prone by terrain problems. This includes that in future integration studies we should stop using some of the datasets from the ‘wild old times’ when we did not know better.\nad4: We need a strategy to communicate with data users that are far away from practical problems at the field sites. The amount of users without experience about possible problems related to terrain or technical limitations of eddy covariance will be dramatically increasing with open data policy, high performance computation and automated processing routines. The question arises how we can avoid misuse or misinterpretation of the data.",

The time that precipitation requires to travel into a stream regulates contaminant transports, nutrient mobility and bedrock weathering, but has not yet been evaluated at a continental scale. Here we synthesize a pan-U.S.A. dataset of rain, snow and streamflow 18O/16O and 2H/1H ratios and analyze the data to show that the lion’s share of USA streamflow is generated by precipitation that takes ~2 months to ~2.5 years to flush through watersheds and into networks of streams (i.e., rivers replenished by “infant-to-toddler aged” precipitation). These streamflow ages are considerably shorter than the average amount of time that water spends within streams themselves (~1 month, globally), and much shorter than the global groundwater residence time of more than ~1000 years. We also estimate the depth of “dynamic” groundwater storage that actively generates the majority of streamflow and discover that less than ~1% of watershed flowpaths generate the bulk of continental runoff. Our finding showcases that the most hydrologically-active zone within Earth’s hydrosphere is located nearest to the surface where atmosphere-biosphere-lithosphere interactions are at a maximum. This research emphasizes the importance of critical zone research for developing accurate forecasts of how human modifications to the land and climate will impact downstream water, nutrient and contaminant fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Evaporitic deposits and precipitates represent significant sinks of mobile cations (Li, As, B) and halides (Cl, I) in salar-like basin environments along the Andean volcanic belt in northern Chile. Li and B are particularly interesting because of their high concentrations in evaporitic minerals and geothermal waters in the region. Although these compositional features have been previously recognized in high-altitude salt lakes in northern Chile, the nature and extent of mixing processes between true evaporitic and geothermal endmembers in such environments is poorly understood. In a context where geothermal targeting methods need to be increasingly precise, a clearer understanding of what controls the localization of concealed geothermal resources is a prerequisite for more efficient exploration. Therefore, it is necessary to constrain surface saline inputs that can mask the deep imprints of the geothermal reservoir. On this basis, northern Chile offers a unique opportunity to test these features due to the large number of evaporitic closed basins containing thermal springs. To date, only a very limited number of studies have reported trace element concentrations and B, Li and Sr isotopes in salar-like waters aimed at differentiating the relative contributions of both members. In this study, we sampled water from high-altitude lakes with and without surficial thermal activity. This was complemented with geothermal water analyses from northern Chile and previously published data. In addition, we report preliminary dissolution experiments of evaporite minerals (e.g. ulexite, halite, gypsum, aragonite) to pure distilled water. These minerals were taken from two selected hydrological domains, located in the southern and northern part of the Chilean Central Volcanic Zone. Geochemical analyses of water run products from the aforementioned experiments at different temperatures (25 and 87°C, 500 hours of interaction each), confirmed that selected common elements (Cl, Li, Mg, As, B) allow to differentiate between geothermal and evaporitic endmembers. We are using isotopic ratios of δ7Li, δ11B and 87Sr/86Sr to provide insights about fluid sources and water-rock interaction.",

This nomenclature does not necessarily imply functional isolation because these systems may exhibit a gradient of hydrologic, biological, or chemical connections to other surface waters. In this study, we examine the influence of GIWs on streamflow, a potential indicator of GIW hydrologic connectivity with surface waters. Our method involves the Spatial Stream Network (SSN) model, which considers spatial autocorrelation of model covariates explicitly, and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which predicts streamflow across a network of 579 subbasins in the lower Neuse River Basin, North Carolina, USA. Our study results suggest that GIWs influence streamflow, though the effect is limited. The farther GIWs are from a stream, the greater their capacity to increase streamflow due to the physiographic setting and hypothesized connectivity, transit times and sequencing of watershed hydrologic connectivity in the study area across seasonal and annual scales. However, as the combined extent of GIWs and non-GIWs increases in subbasins, seasonal and annual streamflow decreases. Results also suggest that other landscape indicators of watershed-scale hydrology, when coupled with wetland features on the landscape, explain variations in seasonal and annual simulated streamflow. Our study findings begin to elucidate the aggregate influence of GIWs on streamflow, providing insights for future decision-making on GIW protection and management.",

It produced intense lightning, created enormous cloud disturbances and wrapped around the planet in 6 months. Six such storms, called Great White Spots, have erupted since 1876. They have alternated between mid-latitudes and the equator at intervals ranging from 20 to 30 years. The reason for the intermittent explosion is hitherto unclear and there are no similar storms on brother Jupiter. Here we describe the water-loading-mechanism, which could suppress moist convection for decades due to the larger molecular weight of water in a hydrogen-helium atmosphere. We show that this mechanism requires the deep water vapor mixing ratio to be greater than 1.0%. Observations imply that Saturn’s atmosphere is more enriched in water than Jupiter, which could explain why Saturn has such storms and Jupiter does not. We further use a two-dimensional axisymmetric dynamic model and a top-cooling convective adjustment scheme to connect our theory to observation. We show that for a deep water mixing ratio of 1.1%, the ammonia vapor is depleted down to 6 bars, the tropospheric warming is about 6 K, and the interval between two consecutive storms at one place is about 70 years. These values are confirmed by both ground-based and spacecraft observations.",

            "abstract": "The importance of gravity waves for the dynamics of the thermosphere-ionosphere system is a well-known fact. Numerical models of the thermosphere-ionosphere must account for gravity wave effects by using various parameterization schemes with currently unknown levels of accuracy. There are several existing methods allowing for the detection of individual instances of gravity wave manifestations. However, little information exists regarding the background wave spectrum and its variability in the thermosphere. We employ Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (TID’s) as tracers for gravity wave propagation, using results of Dynasonde data analysis as the starting point in our calculations. Data from the Wallops Island (VA), San Juan (Puerto Rico), Boulder (CO), Tromso and Svalbard (Norway) instruments are used. The interval between the sounding sessions is 2 minutes and the NeXtYZ inversion procedure (a part of the Dynasonde software package) allows us to obtain a vertical resolution for the parameters of ionospheric plasma in real height better than 1 km. The full output of the inversion procedure consists of height profiles of electron density, X (East-West) and Y (North-South) tilts of the constant plasma density contours and Doppler velocities, all of which showing persistent signs of gravity wave induced TID’s. We demonstrate using a few examples that the characteristics of the observed TID’s are in good agreement with the dispersion relation describing gravity waves. The ionospheric tilt measurements allow for determination of the direction of propagation for every wave mode. For each calendar month of 2013, the tilt spectra is obtained as a function of altitude using a Lomb-Scargle Welch implementation. The analysis is applied to all 6 stations proving unprecedented geographical coverage. The result is a complete picture of the altitude, temporal and location variability of gravity wave activity in the accessible thermospheric altitude interval with included differentiation between North-South and East-West propagating waves.",

It was constructed in 2011 and initially spans the shore over a 2.4 km stretch and extends up to 1 km offshore creating a hook-shaped peninsula. Due to wind, waves and currents the Sand Motor will gradually change in shape and eventually be fully incorporated into the dunes and beach. This concept is expected to be more environmentally friendly compared to traditional beach and shoreface nourishments. The aim of this project is to understand how oxidation changed the geochemistry of the sediment applied and to address possible toxic element mobilization.\nThe sediment was taken 10 km out of shore from the sea floor, which was at a depth of 20 m. Grab samples of the upper 25 cm seabed analyzed for geochemical mapping of Southern North Sea sediments, show locally high contents of sulfur, iron and trace elements like arsenic indicating presence of pyrite with impurities. Sediment was removed to a maximum depth of 6 m below sea floor, reaching different geological layers including bog iron ore layers.\nDifferent degrees of pyrite oxidation are expected with depth at the Sand Motor. First, minimum oxidation when sediment was deposited from the ship directly by opening the bottom floor, which is now present under water at the deepest part of the nourishment. Second, limited oxidation when sediment was applied from the ship under high pressure through the air, and settled below sea level. Last, maximum oxidation when the same method was used but the sediment remains located in a surface layer having a maximum height of 4 m above sea level.\nAt the Sand Motor, samples were taken of surface water, pore water and sediment from the surface to a depth of 10 m, the bottom of the nourishment. Analyses show that pyrite oxidation has occurred above sea level and mobilization of arsenic is present up to a maximum concentration of 92 ug/L in shallow pore waters.\nFine grained material will be transported towards the dune area with the development of the Sand Motor. As a result, heavy particles including shells and bog iron ore fragments get enriched at the surface. The bog iron ore fragments contain high arsenic contents of 391 ppm. The risk of human exposure asks attention as the Sand Motor is also a recreational area.",

            "abstract": "Accurate determination of the surface radiation budget is a critical component of understanding the global energy and water cycles and climate change. The only way to provide surface radiation budget estimates that are consistent and global is via satellite-based products; such estimates are now available convering several decades. In order to make use of these products in climate studies, it is imperative that we understand and minimize their uncertainties. While general estimates of uncertainty can be made using surface observations at multiple locations around the globe, more focused investigation is required to identify the specific conditions under which errors in the satellite products occur.\nIn this study, we evaluate the NASA/GEWEX Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) radiative flux estimates as a function of meteorological state. We have constructed a classification of large-scale meteorological states at the ARM Climate Research Facility’s Southern Great Plains (SGP) and Darwin sites using ECMWF ERA-interim data. Typical SGP states include various stages of frontal passages during winter and summer convective conditions. Typical Darwin states include dry season, transition season and monsoon conditions. Time series of these states were assembled for the period 1979-2010 at the SGP and 1979-2012 at Darwin. We also obtained ground-based solar and longwave irradiance measurements at these locations. Simultaneous ground-based measurements and satellite estimates are composited based on the meteorological state classifications. We then carry out a statistical comparison of the satellite-derived and measured irradiances based on the meteorological state populations and draw conclusions regarding how well or poorly the satellite retrieval algorithms perform. For example, the smallest differences in downwelling solar irradiance at the SGP site occur when cold fronts are in the vicinity, while the largest differences in the longwave downward irradiance occur for cold conditions dominated by northerly winds. This analysis provides insights into conditions under which the largest errors occur and what might be reponsible for those errors. This will allow us to develop improved algorithms for the creation of surface-based estimates.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations of sharp voltage spikes by the WAVES electric field experiments onboard the twin STEREO spacecraft have been attributed to plasma clouds generated by the impact ionization of high velocity dust particles. The reported dust fluxes are much higher than those measured by dedicated dust detectors at 1 AU, which leads to the interpretation that the STEREO observations are due to nanometer-sized dust particles originating from the inner solar system and accelerated to high velocities by the solar wind magnetic field. However, this interpretation is based on a simplified model of coupling between the expanding plasma cloud from the dust impact and the WAVES electric field instrument. A series of laboratory measurements are performed to validate this model and to calibrate/investigate the effect of various impact parameters on the signals measured by the electric field instrument. The dust accelerator facility operating at the University of Colorado is used for the measurement with micron and submicron sized particles accelerated to 50 km/s. The first set of measurements was aimed at the understanding of the charge yield of impact-generated plasmas from common materials used on spacecraft, i.e. BeCu, germanium coated black Kapton, MLI, and solar cells. The measurements show that at 10 km/s these materials yield similar charge signals. At higher speeds (~50 km/s) the variation is with material increases. The impact charge is also found to depend on angle of incidence; the data suggest a maximum at 45 degrees. The second set of measurements investigates the variation of the induced dust signal with bias potential applied on the simulated spacecraft.",

            "abstract": "Column-integrated CO2 mixing ratio measurements from satellite should provide a new view of the global carbon cycle, thanks to their ability to measure with great coverage in places that are poorly sampled by the in situ network (e.g. the tropics) using a new approach (full-column averages rather than point measurements). For this new insight to be useful, however, systematic errors in these data must first be identified and removed.\nHere we use atmospheric transport modeling to perform a global comparison of satellite CO2 measurements to higher-quality reference data (in situ data from flasks and aircraft, column CO2 data from the upward-looking spectrometers of the TCCON network) to assess systematic errors in the satellite data. This broad comparison is meant to complement the more direct validation done at specific TCCON sites. A suite of 3-D CO2 mixing ratio histories are generated across 2009-2014 using combinations of several different a priori fossil fuel, land biospheric, and oceanic CO2 fluxes run through the PCTM off-line atmospheric transport model driven by MERRA 1°x1.25° winds and vertical mixing parameters. Each member of the suite is forced to agree with in situ CO2 measurements (flask, tall tower, and routine light aircraft profiles) through use of a variational carbon data assimilation (4Dvar) system. The optimized 3-D CO2 fields are then compared to ACOS column CO2 retrievals of GOSAT data, with the differences being fit to different independent variables (aerosol optical depth, atmospheric path length, surface albedo, etc.) to derive a GOSAT bias correction. ACOS-GOSAT CO2 retrievals, corrected by this scheme, as well as with the “official” ACOS bias correction, will then be assimilated using the same 4Dvar approach. The benefit of the GOSAT data with and without the bias corrections will then be assessed by comparing the optimized CO2 fields to independent data (TCCON column data, as well as aircraft data left out of the in situ inversions).\nFinally, we will compare these GOSAT-optimized CO2 fields to early-mission column CO2 data from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) across August-October 2014. We will attempt to characterize the relative GOSAT-to-OCO-2 CO2 retrieval biases and to identify their causes by plotting them against independent variables.",

            "abstract": "This project discusses a case study, where eight graduate students in a Boundary Layer Meteorology course at Plymouth State University collected observation data and ran the WRF model in order to explore the relationships between model output, observation data, and boundary layer theory. At the end of the course, the students drafted a paper highlighting their findings, which has been submitted for publication.\nAs a part of the course, the students were provided with a unique learning opportunity to collect meteorological data for a boundary layer phenomenon of their choice, analyze the data and compare it to theory learned in class, and run a numerical model to test the model forecast skill of the observations. Students had access to the Plymouth State University (PSU) radiosonde system and the Mount Washington Observatory Mesonet stations that measure wind, temperature, and relative humidity. Additionally, they had access to the NCAR Yellowstone supercomputer to run their WRF model simulations.\nThis course used a hybrid approach to learning about running the WRF model, which included the in-class material and an online WRF modelling course. For the purposes of this class, the hybrid approach included having the students take the online tutorial and have weekly videoconference meetings with the online course tutor, who lives in Norway. This, in conjunction with the traditional in-class portion, provided multiple modes of learning WRF, access to more expertise in running numerical models, and an opportunity to meet a foreign researcher.\nSurvey results indicate that the students found it helpful to run the model as a part of understanding the atmosphere. A few students recognized that having experience running a model could help them in their future research if they ever need to run WRF or any other atmospheric research model. Most students report that it was useful to compare model data to observed data in order to evaluate the model and compare their findings to what the “expected” outcome would be based on theory. Having students recognize the inconsistencies but not discount the usefulness of the model and the data is an extremely important learning outcome from this course. In sharing our classroom experience, we hope to inspire other instructors to try utilizing both observation and modeling techniques in the classroom.",

In this study, we present a superposed epoch analysis of GPS total electron content (TEC) variations driven by geomagnetic storms during the current solar cycle (2008 – present). The analysis is focused on the northern hemisphere where greater GPS receiver coverage is available in the North American, European, and Japanese sectors. Globally distributed measurements of vertically-integrated GPS TEC are first binned into 1° × 1° cells at 5 min cadence and then organized by storm phase to calculate the deviation from 27-day TEC averages for large-scale ionospheric structures such as storm enhanced density, tongue of ionization, and midlatitude trough. The resulting maps of TEC variations are then compared with similar distributions of ionospheric irregularities and airglow as seen by ground-based networks of HF radars and all-sky imagers. By improving our understanding of these multi-scale ionospheric storm phenomena we are able to produce better global models and forecasting techniques.",

Sea breeze circulation carries air at low altitudes from coastal to inland regions, where the air rises and expands before returning back towards the coast at higher altitudes. As a result, relatively clean air is expected at low altitudes over coastal regions, but following the path of sea breeze circulation should increase the amount of anthropogenic influence. During the 2014 NASA Student Airborne Research Program, a highly modified DC-8 aircraft completed flights from June 23 to 25 in and around the LA Basin, including missed approaches at four local airports—Los Alamitos and Long Beach (coastal), Ontario and Riverside (inland). Because carbon dioxide (CO2) is chemically inert and well-suited as a conserved atmospheric tracer, the NASA Langley Atmospheric Vertical Observations of CO2 in the Earth’s Troposphere (AVOCET) instrument was used to make airborne in situ carbon dioxide measurements. Combining measured wind speed and direction data from the aircraft with CO2 data shows that carbon dioxide can be used to trace the sea breeze circulation pattern of the Los Angeles basin.",

Multi-decadal time-series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, a spectral metric of vegetation productivity) shows an overall “greening” trend across the Arctic tundra biome. Regional trends in climate plausibly explain large-scale patterns of increasing plant productivity, as diminished summer sea-ice extent warms the adjacent land causing tundra vegetation to respond positively (increased photosynthetic aboveground biomass). However, at more local scales, there is a great deal of spatial variability in NDVI trends that likely reflects differences in hydrology and soil conditions, disturbance history, and use by wildlife and humans. Particularly, habitat use by large herbivores, such as reindeer and caribou, has large impacts on vegetation dynamics at local and regional scales, but the role of herbivores in modulating the response of vegetation to warming climate has received little attention. This study investigates regional tundra plant community dynamics within inhabits of different sizes of wild caribou/reindeer herds across the Arctic using GIMMS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) 3g data product. The Taimyr herd in Russia is one of the largest herds in the world with a population increase from 450,000 in 1975 to about 1 million animals in 2000. The population of the porcupine caribou herd has fluctuated in the past three decades between 100,000 and 180,000. Time-series of the maximum NDVI within the inhabit area of the Taimyr herd has increased about 2% per decade over the past three decades, while within the inhabit area of the Porcupine herd the maximum NDVI has increased about 5% per decade. Our results indicate that the impact of large herbivores can be detected from space and further analyses on seasonal dynamics of vegetation indices and herbivore behavior may provide more understanding of the plant-herbivore interactions within the context of a ‘greening’ Arctic.",

These climate change effects are even more pronounced in western Alaska where the loss of sea ice in early winter and spring are exposing the coast to powerful winter storms that are visibly altering the landscape, putting coastal communities at risk, and are likely impacting important coastal wildlife habitat in ways we don't yet understand. The Western Alaska Landscape Conservation Cooperative has funded a suite of projects to improve the information available to assist managers and communities to adapt changes in coastal storms and their impacts. Projects range from modeling tide, wave and storm surge patters, to ShoreZone and NHD mapping, to bathymetry mapping, community vulnerability assessments and risks to important wildlife habitat. This group of diverse projects has helped stimulate momentum among partners which will lead to better tools for communities to respond to dangerous storms. For example, the State of Alaska and NOAA are working together to compile a series of community-scale maps that utilize best-available datasets to streamline communication about forecasted storm surges, local elevations and potentially impacted infrastructure during storm events that may lead to coastal flooding.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation is a notoriously noisy variable at spatial scales from rain-gauges to GCM grid cells, partially due to the complexity of occurrence processes. To properly characterize variability of precipitation at so-called \"weather\" versus \"climate\" time scales, we demonstrate a probabilistic method for representing daily precipitation within a stationary-climate (\"weather only\") framework with applications for constraining unrealistic precipitation variability in climate models. This method accurately recreates the annual seasonal cycle and the daily variability of precipitation conditioned on the previous m days of data in a generalization of an autoregressive process optimal for zero-inflated empirical probability distributions.\nMonte Carlo simulations from these models create \"weather\" distributions for a given location at any spatial scale, which can then be compared to observations to determine the magnitude of \"climate\" variability (i.e., variability not well-represented by our stationary models). Weather distributions have applications in characterizing forecast confidence intervals, and climate/weather variance ratios allow us to calculate potential predictability for precipitation. Techniques for empirical model selection and calibration are highlighted, as are common assumptions about precipitation stationarity and variability. As an application, the variability of precipitation at weather/climate time scales is compared for observational data and a collection of historical runs from Global Climate Models.",

Saturn's magnetosphere is an ideal laboratory for studying these processes. Here we focus on the production of O2/O2+ from Saturn's diffuse E ring. Compared to H2 molecules, another major decomposition product from irradiated water ice, heavy O2 molecules diffuse more slowly from their source(s) and therefore can be used as an ice surface reaction tracer.\nOriginating from Enceladus, the E ring is composed of water ice grains populated between 3 to about 20 RS (Saturn radius, 1RS = 60,268km) under the influences of various forces. The plasma conditions that E ring grains experience vary from the cold plasma at the dense Enceladus torus to the hot, tenuous outer magnetospheric plasma. The sputtering and radiolysis processes determined by the plasma properties are thus coupled with the orbital evolution of E ring grains. Using modeled and measured E ring profile, we will calculate the O2/O2+ production rate from the E ring icy grains as well as from the embedded icy moons. We will also calculate the H2O molecule and water group ion (W+) production rate from these sources and compare with the O2+/W+ ratio measured by the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS).",

            "abstract": "Ecological theory asserts that regional wildfire size distributions are examples of self-organized critical (SOC) systems. Controls on SOC event-size distributions by virtue are purely endogenous to the system and include the (1) frequency and pattern of ignitions, (2) distribution and size of prior fires, and (3) lagged successional patterns after fires. However, recent work has shown that the largest wildfires often result from extreme climatic events, and that patterns of vegetation and topography may help constrain local fire spread, calling into question the SOC model’s simplicity. Using an atlas of >12,000 California wildfires (1950-2012) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we fit four different power-law models and broken-stick regressions to fire-size distributions across 16 Bailey’s ecoregions. Comparisons among empirical fire size distributions across ecoregions indicated that most ecoregion’s fire-size distributions were significantly different, suggesting that broad-scale top-down controls differed among ecoregions. One-parameter power-law models consistently fit a middle range of fire sizes (~100 to 10000 ha) across most ecoregions, but did not fit to larger and smaller fire sizes. We fit the same four power-law models to patch size distributions of aspect, slope, and curvature topographies and found that the power-law models fit to a similar middle range of topography patch sizes. These results suggested that empirical evidence may exist for topographic controls on fire sizes. To test this, we used neutral landscape modeling techniques to determine if observed fire edges corresponded with aspect breaks more often than expected by random. We found significant differences between the empirical and neutral models for some ecoregions, particularly within the middle range of fire sizes. Our results, combined with other recent work, suggest that controls on ecoregional fire size distributions are multi-scaled and likely are not purely SOC. California wildfire ecosystems appear to be adaptive, governed by stationary and non-stationary controls, which may be either exogenous or endogenous to the system.",

Not only does the Ocean Basemap evolve from the authoritative data contributions, but user needs influence the direction of the program as well. With the eyes of the scientific and maritime community shifting northerly to the Arctic, it became obvious that both the scientific and GIS communities needed a more appropriate basemap to best accommodate and share their work. The Esri Ocean Basemap team began designing a new Ocean Basemap product to support work conducted in the Arctic Ocean. The team first complied the best available data sources and applicable community contributions. By leveraging commercial-off-the-shelf capabilities in the ArcGIS platform, the team converted datasets from a range of governmental, non-governmental and private entities into compatible formats and ensured a uniform data projection for all of the datasets. In addition, the team developed and applied automatic sorting rules to create a surface model for cartographic purposes using the ArcGIS for Maritime: Bathymetry solution. After determining a tiling scheme, the Ocean Basemap team officially published the Arctic Ocean Basemap. The Arctic Ocean Basemap provides the scientific and GIS communities with a WMTS-enabled, appropriately projected basemap to support their maps and applications. ",

            "abstract": "Geologic CO2 sequestration has been proposed as a climate change mitigation strategy to limit emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere from large fossil-fuel burning CO2 point sources; however, there are concerns associated with the long-term stability of a mobile subsurface CO2 plume. The large-scale movement of subsurface supercritical CO2 (scCO2) can be prevented via capillary trapping, wherein scCO2 is immobilized in the subsurface by capillary interactions between the solid surface, resident brine, and scCO2. Capillary trapping occurs in two steps: first, the porous medium undergoes drainage as scCO2 is injected into the system; then, wetting fluid re-enters the medium in an imbibition process, isolating small bubbles of scCO2 in the pore bodies of the medium. There are many empirical models which predict capillary trapping for a single drainage-imbibition cycle; however, in an engineered CO2 sequestration project, it is possible to implement cyclic scCO2-water injections in a water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection scheme in which the system may undergo multiple CO2 injections to potentially increase the trapping efficiency of scCO2.\nWe present experimental results of multiple drainage-imbibition cycles of scCO2 and 1:6 by mass potassium iodide (KI) brine within Bentheimer sandstone. Capillary (differential) pressure and absolute pressures for each phase were continuously measured throughout each flow process, which is a unique feature of our experimental system. Experiments were conducted at a working pressure of 8.3 MPa (1200 PSI) and 40oC, and synchrotron x-ray computed microtomography (x-ray CMT) images were collected of the drainage and imbibition process endpoints at a resolution of 3.19 µm at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory.\nThe evolution of the connectivity, topology, morphology, and capillary trapping of scCO2 phase is analyzed as a function of capillary pressure, scCO2 saturation, and sample history. Preliminary results suggest that capillary trapping of scCO2 is hysteretic and that this pore-scale phenomenon and dependence should be considered when designing large scale CO2 injection processes. These results are discussed in terms of current empirical capillary trapping models as well as from alternative theoretical perspectives.",

Yet, global compilations highlight a critical lack of proxy SST data in this oceanic realm, and especiallly in its eastern part. Well-preserved, high-resolution laminated sediments from the Peruvian upwelling system allow for reconstructing past oceanic changes in the Eastern Tropical Pacific over the last 2000 years, and for assessing relevant changes in the biogeochemical functionning of the system. The alkenone-SST record in the study area does not show significant contrast between the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA) periods, unlike the records from the Western Pacific. Our proxy data clearly demonstrate different SST zonal gradients, while our model experiments show corresponding anomalies in the tropical Pacific thermocline depth. For the last 150 years, SSTs show an overall decreasing trend with short-term positive excursions that correspond to strong El Nino events. The signature of IPO is identified in our record indicating large-scale modulation of SSTs. Changes in the tropical Pacific ocean–atmosphere system are shown to have a fundamental impact on the biogeochemistry of the Peruvian upwelling system, as well as on the S. America hydroclimate on decadal time scales. Possible forcings for tropical SST changes and underlying causal mechanisms are investigated through comparing proxy data with climate modeling.",

            "abstract": "Drought influences the efficacy of numerous natural and artificial systems including species diversity, agriculture, and infrastructure. Global climate change raises concerns that extend well beyond atmospheric and hydrological disciplines – as climate changes with time, the need for system adaptation becomes apparent. Drought, as a natural phenomenon, is typically defined relative to the climate in which it occurs. Typically a 30-year reference time frame (RTF) is used to determine the severity of a drought event. This study investigates the projected future droughts over North America with different RTFs. Confidence in future hydroclimate projection is characterized by the agreement of long term (2005-2100) multi-model precipitation (P) and temperature (T) projections within the Coupled model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Drought severity and the propensity of extreme conditions are measured by the multi-scalar, probabilistic, RTF-based Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). SPI considers only P while SPEI incorporates Evapotranspiration (E) via T; comparing the two reveals the role of temperature change in future hydroclimate change. Future hydroclimate conditions, hydroclimate extremity, and CMIP5 model agreement are assessed for each Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) in regions throughout North America for the entire year and for the boreal seasons. In addition, multiple time scales of SPI and SPEI are calculated to characterize drought at time scales ranging from short to long term. The study explores a simple, standardized method for considering adaptation in future drought assessment, which provides a novel perspective to incorporate adaptation with climate change. The result of the analysis is a multi-dimension, probabilistic summary of the hydrological (P, E) environment a natural or artificial system must adapt to over time. Studies similar to this with specified criteria (SPI/SPEI value, time scale, RCP, etc.) can provide professionals in a variety of disciplines with necessary climatic insight to develop adaptation strategies.",

            "abstract": "Kinetic barriers generally inhibit intercrystalline equilibration of cations and isotopic compositions at temperatures below ~350˚C, greatly limiting the geothermometers available to study the upper 10-15 km of the crust. Calcite ‘clumped’ isotopes commonly appear to record homogeneous equilibrium during crystallization at surface temperatures, but kinetic models predict that reordering due to solid-state exchange among nearby carbonate groups modifies primary compositions at temperatures above ~115˚C on timescales of 10^6 - 10^8 years and fully re-equilibrates above 200˚C in most geological environments1. Slowly cooled dolomitic marbles commonly preserve apparent temperatures of ~300˚C, indicating that dolomite may have slower reordering kinetics and thus greater preservation of primary crystallization temperatures. If so, dolomite clumped isotope thermometry may be a useful geothermometer in much of the the shallow crust.\nWe measured the kinetics of clumped isotope reordering in dolomite with heating experiments at 400-800˚C in a TZM cold seal apparatus pressurized with CO2. Results predict that no detectable reordering occurs in dolomite held at temperatures less than ~250˚C over timescales of up to 10^8 years, demonstrating the viability of the system as a shallow crustal geothermometer. The non-first order behavior observed in calcite1,2,3is exhibited by dolomite as well, albeit at higher temperatures.\nTo test these predictions, we measured the clumped isotopic compositions of coexisting calcite and dolomite in marbles from the Notch Peak aureole, UT. Dolomite clumped isotope temperatures in the outer aureole match peak conditions predicted by thermal models up to ~275˚C, indicating that the system resisted reordering below this grade. Calcite clumped isotope temperatures are never greater than ~150˚C at all grades in the aureole; this is consistent with the ambient burial temperature in the section and indicates that all metamorphic calcite was fully reset in the >100 my subsequent to intrusion. Dolomite and calcite blocking temperatures in high-grade samples are consistent with those predicted by model sample T-t paths using experimentally-derived kinetic parameters.\n",

Key elements of each node encompasses a three-component seismic recorder, which includes an amplifier, filter, and 24- bit analog-to-digital converter that can sample up to 10 kHz. Each unit also includes a microphone channel to record the ground-coupled airwave. The timing for each node is available from GPS measurements and a local precision oscillator that is conditioned by the GPS timing pulses. In addition, we record the carrier-phase measurement of the L1 GPS signal in order to determine location at sub-decimeter accuracy (relative to other geoPebbles within a few kilometers radius). Each geoPebble includes 16 GB of solid-state storage, wireless communications capability to a central supervisory unit, and auxiliary measurements capability (including tilt from accelerometers, absolute orientation from magnetometers and temperature).\nA novel aspect of the geoPebble is a wireless charging system for the internal battery (using inductive coupling techniques). The geoPebbles include all the sensors (geophones, GPS, microphone), communications (WiFi), and power (battery and charging) internally, so the geoPebble system can operate without any cabling connections (though we do provide an external connector so that different geophones can be used). We report initial field-deployment results and current efforts to test this new instrument system and how we are addressing the challenges imposed by the extreme weather conditions on the Antarctic continent. After fully validating its operational conditions, the geoPebble system will be available for NSF-sponsored glaciology research projects.",

It provides the possibility to retrieve ionospheric total electron content (TEC) from these observations using the same approach as for dual frequency GPS/GLONASS observations.\nIn this work we study L1/L5 signals of Indian GAGAN geostationary satellites observed with geodetic GNSS receivers at several stations at mid-latitudes and estimate corresponding geostationary TEC and errors of such estimations. TEC RMS was found to reach up to 1.5 TECU with typical values of 0.25-0.5 TECU which is several times greater than for common GPS/GLONASS observations. TEC RMS also manifests UT-dynamics which is specific for the chosen geostationary satellite and not relevant to the receiver site and signal paths. SBAS TEC was found to be in good agreement with the data of nearest ionosondes taking into account low elevation angles of SBAS satellites already at mid-latitudes and spatial gradients of electron density along the ray paths.\nWe also present the wavelet analysis of geostationary TEC, providing typical periods of observed variations at different time scales (from tens of minutes to tens of days) and discuss the capabilities of SBAS TEC observations in connection with ionospheric effects of solar flares.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are commonly used to delineate the presence of Pleistocene recharge in groundwater systems. Groundwaters that have a component of subglacial recharge and glacial runoff have δ18O and δD values that are much lower than those found in modern precipitation and recharge. The actual value of the subglacial water that entered the groundwater system is not clear. Examining the lowest δ18O and δD values in various groundwater systems across North America and Europe, constraints can be placed on the isotopic composition of Pleistocene ice sheets.\nThe lowest δ18O and δD values are found in Quaternary aquitards and confined aquifers with narrow and reasonably shallow recharge areas. In shallow aquitards this water may be connate water or water that has travelled very short distances since the last glaciation. In confined aquifers, the lowest values are associated with near complete replacement of existing porewater by subglacial groundwater. This often occurs at significant distance from the recharge area.\nThe δ18O and δD values are variable in space, with lower values observed at higher latitudes. The observed values are consistent with some, but not all, outputs from isotope-enabled general circulation models of conditions at the last glacial maximum. Defining a unique ice sheet value for paleoclimate studies involving freshwater drainage may not be possible.",

            "abstract": "The laser-heated diamond anvil cell is a unique tool for subjecting materials to pressures over few hundreds of GPa and temperatures of thousands of Kelvins which enables us to experimentally simulate the inaccessible interiors of planets. However, small sample size, laser profile and thermally conductive diamonds cause temperature gradients of 1000s K over a few microns which also affects chemical and structural distribution of phases in the sample.\nWe have examined samples of San Carlos olivine (Mg,Fe)2SiO3 powder melted in the diamond anvil cell by double-sided and single-sided laser heating for 3-6 minutes to ~3000 K at 35-37 GPa. Moreover, MgO is used as an insulating media in one of the sample. Recovered samples were analyzed by a combination of focused ion beam (FIB) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) detector. Images and chemical maps were acquired for ~300 slices with ~70 nm depth from each sample, comprising about half of the heated zone. Detailed chemical and structural analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of lamellas prepared from the remaining section of the samples will also be presented.\nIn all samples the heated zone included (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite-structured bridgmanite (PV) phase and two (Mg, Fe)O phases, one of which, magnesiowüstite (MW), is richer in iron than the other one, ferropericlase (FP). In double-side heated samples we observe a Fe-rich quenched melt core surrounded by MW phase. Our results show that with increasing heating time, Fe migrates to the molten center of the sample. In the single-side heated sample, the Fe-rich MW phase is concentrated in the center of heated zone. In all samples a FP crust was observed around the heated zone. This crust, however, is broken in the upper part (colder part) of the single-side heated sample due the high asymmetrical temperature gradient within the sample. The results confirm the importance of double-side heating and insulating media for generating homogenous central temperature and chemical distribution.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the mechanistic controls on tropical forests photosynthetic metabolism is a central problem of ecology and global change biology. We hypothesize two different temporal scales for the mechanisms regulating tropical photosynthesis (Gross Ecosystem Productivity, GEP): (1) at seasonal scales, leaf phenology (changing age and amount of leaves) is the primary control on GEP seasonality; (2) at the hourly scale with a constant phenological stage, climatic variables are the first order controls on GEP.\n In order to test this hypothesis, we partitioned the sources of GEP variation measured on eddy flux towers in central Amazon forests into biological and climatic components. The biological component (photosynthetic capacity, or PC) was defined as the monthly mean value of GEP extracted under a fixed narrow range of climate conditions, representing phenological changes associated with the amount and age of leaves. The climatic component was extracted via a path analysis of the hourly flux data, conditioned on a given monthly PC, representing the effects of fluctuating climate operating on the given PC. The main climatic variables were PAR, air-temperature, VPD, and Cloudiness Index (CI), the fraction of reduction of incident solar radiance due to clouds and aerosols relative to that expected under clear sky conditions. \n We found that the variability in monthly GEP arises from both seasonality of PC and that of climate, but despite the strong seasonality of climate, GEP was dominated by PC seasonality (R2=0.92). We found that the variability in hourly GEP (relative to the potential represented by monthly PC) was controlled primarily by PAR and VPD (as modified by the influence of CI). The tradeoff between the positive GEP effects of increased PAR and the negative effects of higher VPD stress indicates that tropical forests are stable in the face of modest climatic variability. For example, a significant reduction in mean cloudiness (of 0.1 CI units, corresponding to a ~18% increase in PAR and ~19% increase in VPD) would cause only modest changes in GEP (~1.8% increase in the wet season and ~2.9% decline in the dry season). This work provides an improved framework for understanding the climate drivers of canopy scale photosynthesis by separately analyzing the influence of phenological and climatic components.",

Nitrate contamination of groundwater across the Central Valley of California has been related to its diverse and intensive agricultural practices. However, there has been no study comparing leaching of nitrate in each individual agricultural land within the complex and diversely managed studied area.\nA combined field monitoring and modeling approach was developed to quantify from simple measurements the leaching of water and nitrate below the root zone. The monitored state variables are soil water content at several depths within the root zone, soil matric potential at two depths below the root zone, and nitrate concentration in the soil solution. In the modeling part, unsaturated water flow and solute transport are simulated with the software HYDRUS in a soil profile fragmented in up to two soil hydraulic types, whose effective hydraulic properties are optimized with an inverse modeling method.\nThe applicability of the method will first be demonstrated “in-silico”, with synthetic soil water dynamics data generated with HYDRUS, and considering the soil column as the layering of several soil types characterized in-situ. The method will then be applied to actual soil water status data from various crops in California including tomato, citrus, almond, pistachio, and walnut. Eventually, improvements of irrigation and fertilization management practices (i.e. mainly questions of quantity and frequency of application minimizing leaching under constraint of water and nutrient availability) will be investigated using coupled modeling and optimization tools.",

            "abstract": "3D seismic reflection data (CRISP) collected across the southern Costa Rica margin reveals that a thick, deforming sedimentary wedge underlies the younger slope sediments (Silver et al., this meeting). The older wedge material and younger slope sediments are separated by a high-amplitude regional unconformity. Seismic stratigraphy of the sedimentary strata overlying this regional unconformity reflects a dynamic deformation history of the margin. The younger slope sediments contain series of more localized unconformities, separating sedimentary units as thick as 1 km that reveal a dynamically changing set of inverted, overlapping basins. The geometry of these overlapping, inverted basins indicate sequential uplift events. The direction of basin thickening varies upsection, and these basins are cut by both thrust and normal faults and are deformed by folding. Structural development appears to be controlled by relief on the subducting plate interface, which induces uplift and subsidence and thereby controls the pattern of erosion and deposition. We interpret the evolution of these inverted stratigraphic packages as forming from subducting topography. Correlating these seismic-stratigraphic packages to recent drilling based on preliminary magnetostratigraphy from IODP site U1413 (Expedition 344 Scientists, 2013), allows us to date the passage of the subducting plate topography beginning ~2 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Previous work suggested that large-scale nearside basin-localized extensional tectonism on the Moon ended ~3.6 billion years ago and mare basin-related contractional deformation ended ~1.2 billion years ago. Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) high resolution (50-200 cm/pixel) images enable the detailed study of lunar tectonic landforms and further insight into the evolution of stresses. Populations of landforms are now observed at scales much smaller than previously recognized, and their morphology and stratigraphic relationships imply a complex deformational history.\nThe most common tectonic landforms in mare basins are sinuous wrinkle ridges that have up to hundreds of meters of relief and are interpreted as folded basalt layers overlying thrust faults. They consist of a narrow, asymmetric ridge atop a broad arch and sometimes occur radial to or concentric with the centers of some mare basins. Wrinkle ridges with these patterns have previously been associated with mascons – dense concentrations of mass identified by positive gravity anomalies. Loading of the crust by lunar mascons causes flexure and subsidence to form wrinkle ridges. However, some basins including western Mare Frigoris are not associated with mascons, yet wrinkle ridges deform the mare. The origin of compressional stresses in non-mascon environments remains an outstanding question.\nA key step to better understanding the occurrence of wrinkle ridges in non-mascon basins is characterizing the behavior of the underlying faults. We expand upon methods used in Williams et al. [2013] and apply fault dislocation modeling to estimate geometries and displacements for selected wrinkle ridge faults in Mare Frigoris. Digital terrain models (DTMs) derived from LROC NAC stereo pairs are used to constrain fault models. Using the system of analytical equations for deformation of a half-space defined by Okada [1985, 1992], we apply inverse methods to model ridge relief for fault geometry. Preliminary results suggest maximum depths of faulting within the upper ~1-2 km and shallow (<40°) dip angles. These preliminary modeled values are comparable to estimates for other lunar and martian wrinkle ridges, and suggest this faulting is likely confined to within the mare fill and not rooted deeply in anorthositic crust.",

            "abstract": "NASA's venerable LCAS sounding rocket program has been the primary means to test new space instrumentation for space physics, for over 60 years. Recently, new LCAS pathways have been introduced for instruments and science that require longer exposure than a sounding rocket affords. The International Space Station (ISS) offers similar infrastructure to a sounding rocket, with ample mass and volume, controlled attitude, and predefined and generous power and telemetry interfaces. The DEmonstration LEO Polarizing Heliospheric Imager is an LCAS mission that pioneers replacing the SPARCS+black brant stack with the ISS itself, to exploit the environment afforded by the ISS and demonstrate new instrumentation on-orbit.\nDELPHI is a solar off-pointed heliospheric imager that demonstrates the use of pB/B and quantitative photometry to locate solar wind features in 3-D with high spatial resolution, in a few-month mission. It makes use of the stable environment and high telemetry volume (1Mbps) on ISS to improve image quality with ground postprocessing. It is built on the ISS-standard ExPA interface and robotically deployed from the Space-X Dragon trunk to an external mount location.\nWe will discuss some of the engineering and programmatic trades go with designing an orbital sounding-rocket-class instrument, and advocate using ISS as a future platform for instrument development.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the dynamical processes and forecast uncertainty associated with an intense atmospheric river (AR) that contributed to widespread drought-mitigating extreme rainfall (maxima >200 mm) across the southeastern U.S. during 22–27 October 2007. This AR is found to be dynamically linked to anticyclonic wave breaking (AWB) over central North America and the attendant formation of an elongated potential vorticity (PV) streamer. The AR formed in connection with a pronounced increase of water vapor flux into the southeastern U.S., forced in conjunction with the equatorward and eastward propagation of the PV streamer and an attendant lower-tropospheric cyclone toward the western flank of a subtropical anticyclone. Trajectory calculations demonstrate that the AR was associated with poleward transports of moist air parcels originating over the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the western North Atlantic Ocean.\nExamination of ECMWF ensemble forecasts from TIGGE reveals large uncertainty associated with the AWB and, correspondingly, large uncertainty and low skill in the water vapor flux and precipitation forecasts over the central and eastern U.S. It is found that the uncertainty associated with the AWB is closely related to ensemble variability in the representation of upstream cyclogenesis resulting from the interaction between a diabatic Rossby vortex and a tropopause-level polar disturbance over the eastern North Pacific. Specifically, ensemble members in which the upstream cyclogenesis is too strong exhibit overly intense ridge amplification over western North America and, accordingly, AWB occurs too far west. These members exhibit large water vapor flux and precipitation forecast errors over the central and eastern U.S., displacing the AR and the heavy precipitation area to the west and underforecasting the water vapor flux and precipitation amounts. Conversely, ensemble members more accurately representing the upstream cyclogenesis exhibit AWB farther east and produce relatively accurate water vapor flux and precipitation forecasts over the central and eastern U.S.",

            "abstract": "Investigations of land-atmosphere coupling have shown that surface conditions can influence local boundary layer development and precipitation likelihood across local to regional scales from subdaily to seasonal time scales. Observational techniques utilized for land-atmosphere coupling metrics vary greatly in spatial and temporal scale. When assessing metrics derived across a variety of resolutions, it is important to consider the influence of spatial and temporal resolution on the observations and model output. This study analyzes a recently-developed coupling metric across a variety of spatio-temporal resolutions. High frequency, small footprint eddy covariance tower data and lower frequency, lower resolution MODIS satellite products are both used to quantify a time series of the metric of coupling strength. The time series are decomposed using wavelet analysis, and spectra are investigated in order to determine the temporal scales associated with strong coupling and to consider how coupling strength varies with the scale of observation. In addition, the underlying atmospheric and surface properties are investigated to assess the relative contribution to the overall coupling between the land-atmosphere interface. As soil moisture memory can play a large role in coupling strength, extreme dry and wet conditions are categorized and investigated separately to see how the dynamics of coupling on a local and a regional scale may cause feedbacks promoting continued wet conditions or exacerbating drought.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric modelers continue to push towards higher resolution simulations of the planetary boundary layer. As resolution is refined, the resolved terrain slopes increase. Atmospheric models using terrain-following coordinates, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, suffer from numerical errors since steep terrain slopes lead to grid skewness, resulting in model failure. One solution to this problem is the use of an immersed boundary method, which uses a non-conforming grid, for simulations over complex terrain. Our implementation of an immersed boundary method in WRF, known as WRF-IBM, was developed for use at the micro-scale and has been shown to accurately simulate flow around complex topography, such as urban environments or mountainous terrain.\nThe research presented here describes our newly developed framework to enable concurrently run multi-scale simulations using the WRF model at the meso-scale and the WRF-IBM model at the micro-scale. WRF and WRF-IBM use different vertical coordinates therefore it is not possible to use the existing nesting framework to pass lateral boundary conditions from a WRF parent domain to a WRF-IBM nested domain.\nNesting between WRF and WRF-IBM requires “vertical grid nesting”, meaning the ability to pass information between domains with different vertical levels. Our newly implemented method for vertical grid nesting, available in the public release of WRFv3.6.1, allows nested domains to utilize different vertical levels. Using our vertical grid nesting code, we are currently developing the ability to nest a domain using IBM within a domain using terrain-following coordinates. Here we present results from idealized cases displaying the functionality of the multi-scale nesting framework and the advancement towards multi-scale meteorological simulations over complex terrain.",

            "abstract": "The coastal ocean accounts for about half of the global fish harvest, but is poorly resolved in global climate models (a one-degree grid barely sees the continental shelf). Moreover, coastal ocean circulation is strongly modified by river freshwater sources, often coming from estuarine systems that are completely unresolved in the coarse grid. River freshwater input in CESM is added in a practical but ad hoc way, by imposing a surface salinity sink over a region of the ocean approximating the plume area of a given river.\nHere we present results from a series of model experiments using a high-resolution (1.5 km) ROMS model of the NE Pacific, including the Columbia River and the inland waters of Puget Sound. The base model does multi-year hindcasts using the best available sources of atmospheric (MM5/WRF), ocean (NCOM), river (USGS), and tidal forcing. It has been heavily validated against observations of all sorts, and performs well, so it is an ideal test bed for downscaling experiments. The model framework also does biogeochemistry, including oxygen, and carbon chemistry is being added to make forecasts of Ocean Acidification.\nThis high-resolution ROMS model is systematically run in downscaling experiments for the year 2005 with combinations of CESM forcing (CAM, POP, and rivers) swapped in. Skill is calculated using observations. It is found that the runs with CESM forcing generally retain much of the skill of the base model. A compact metric of response to freshwater forcing is used, which is the mechanical energy required to destratify a shallow coastal volume. This, along with the average temperature and salinity of the volume, are used to characterize and compare runs, including the original CESM-POP fields. Finally the model is run with projected CESM simulation forcing at the end of 21st century based on a set of RCP scenarios, and the compact metrics are used to quantify differences from 2005.",

            "abstract": "The AmeriFlux network encompasses independently managed field sites measuring ecosystem carbon, water, and energy fluxes across the Americas. In close coordination with ICOS in Europe, a new set of fluxes data and metadata products is being produced and released at the FLUXNET level, including all AmeriFlux sites. This will enable continued releases of global standardized set of flux data products. In this release, new formats, structures, and ancillary information are being proposed and adopted. This presentation discusses these aspects, detailing current and future solutions. One of the major revisions was to the BADM (Biological, Ancillary, and Disturbance Metadata) protocols. The updates include structure and variable changes to address new developments in data collection related to flux towers and facilitate two-way data sharing. In particular, a new organization of templates is now in place, including changes in templates for biomass, disturbances, instrumentation, soils, and others. New variables and an extensive addition to the vocabularies used to describe BADM templates allow for a more flexible and comprehensible coverage of field sites and the data collection methods and results. Another extensive revision is in the data formats, levels, and versions for fluxes and micrometeorological data. A new selection and revision of data variables and an integrated new definition for data processing levels allow for a more intuitive and flexible notation for the variety of data products. For instance, all variables now include positional information that is tied to BADM instrumentation descriptions. This allows for a better characterization of spatial representativeness of data points, e.g., individual sensors or the tower footprint. Additionally, a new definition for data levels better characterizes the types of processing and transformations applied to the data across different dimensions (e.g., spatial representativeness of a data point, data quality checks applied, and differentiation between measured data and data from models that use process knowledge). We also present an expanded approach to versions of data and data processing software, with stable and immutable data releases, but also pre-release versions to allow evaluation and feedback prior to a stable release.",

The Winternships provided an enhanced alternative learning environment for students pursuing degrees in the STEM fields through faculty and peer mentoring in guided undergraduate research activities. All activities associated with undergraduate research were covered including literature searches, hands-on laboratory and field research, collection and analysis of data, culminating in oral and written presentations at College of the Desert and regional student conferences. In addition, students received assistance in searching for summer internships in their area of interest, completing applications, and guidance on follow-up communication with the programs to which they applied. During the funding period, 44 students participated in the Winternship activity in which all submitted a minimum of 3 applications for summer internship opportunities. Results presented will include student success at receiving summer internships, examples of projects completed during the summer and winter activities, and impact on student success. Adaption of this program to other community colleges and into a sophomore level research experience course will be described.

            "abstract": "Impact of climate change on the water resources of the United States exposes the vulnerability of feedstock-specific mandated fuel targets to extreme weather conditions that could become more frequent and intensify in the future. Consequently, a sustainable biofuel policy should consider a) how climate change would alter both water supply and demand and, b) in turn, how related changes in water availability will impact the production of biofuel crops and c) the environmental implications of large scale biofuel productions. Since, understanding the role of biofuels in the water cycle is key to understanding many of the environmental impacts of biofuels, the focus of this study is on modeling the rarely explored interactions between land use, climate change, water resources and the environment in future biofuel production systems to explore the impacts of the US biofuel policy and climate change on water and agricultural resources.\nMore specifically, this research will address changes in the water demand and availability, soil erosion and water quality driven by both climate change and biomass feedstock production in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. We used the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrologic model to analyze the water quantity and quality consequences of land use and land management related changes in cropping conditions (e.g. more use of marginal lands, greater residue harvest, increased yields), plus management practices due to biofuel crops to meet the RFS target on water quality and quantity. Results show that even if the Upper Mississippi River Basin is a region of low water stress, it contributes to high nutrient load in Gulf of Mexico through seasonal shifts in streamflow, changes in extreme high and low flow events, changes in loadings and transport of sediments and nutrients due to changes in precipitation patterns and intensity, changes in frequency of occurrence of floods and drought, early melting of snow and ice, increasing evaporation and changes in soil moisture.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between seismicity and subsurface well activity is crucial to evaluating the seismic hazard of transient, non-tectonic seismicity. Several studies have demonstrated correlations between increased frequency of earthquake occurrence and the injection/production of fluids (e.g. oil, water) in nearby subsurface wells in intracontinental settings (e.g. Arkansas, Colorado, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas). Here, we evaluate all earthquake magnitudes for the past 20-30 years across the diverse seismotectonic settings of Utah. We explore earthquakes within 5 km and subsequent to completion dates of oil and gas wells. We compare seismicity rates prior to well establishment with rates after well establishment in an attempt to discriminate between natural and anthropogenic earthquakes in areas of naturally high background seismicity. In a few central Utah locations, we find that the frequency of shallow (0-10 km) earthquakes increased subsequent to completion of gas wells within 5 km, and at depths broadly similar to bottom hole depths. However, these regions typically correspond to mining regions of the Wasatch Plateau, complicating our ability to distinguish between earthquakes related to either well activity or mining. We calculate earthquake density and well density and compare their ratio (earthquakes per area/wells per area) with several published metrics of seismotectonic setting. Areas with a higher earthquake-well ratio are located in relatively high strain regions (determined from GPS) associated with the Intermountain Seismic Belt, but cannot be attributed to any specific Quaternary-active fault. Additionally, higher ratio areas do not appear to coincide with anomalously high heat flow values, where rocks are typically thermally weakened. Incorporation of timing and volume data for well injection/production would allow for more robust temporal statistical analysis and hazard analysis.",

Although subsurface creep is currently monitored using Insar and GPS, continuous creep measurements on the surface fault have been intermittent. In 2014 we installed a carbon-fiber rod creepmeter at Ismetpasa and a second creepmeter across the surface rupture of the 1999 Izmit earthquake, which is also known to be creeping at depth. The creepmeters have a resolution of 5 µm and a range of 2.2 m. Each creepmeter uses two sensors- a subsurface LVDT (resolution 5 µm range 10 mm) and an above-ground rotary Hall effect sensor (resolution 25 µm and range 2.2 m) and their data are transmitted via the Iridium satellite as 30 minute samples every 2 hours. The hybrid sensors on the creepmeters are similar to others currently operating on the Hayward, Calaveras, and San Andreas faults. Their ability to capture slow slip, coseismic rupture or afterslip has been tested in deployments on the rapidly creeping Jackson, Wyoming landslide (1-3 mm/day). Installed creepmeters will be a powerful tool to search the possibilities of the transient or episodic creep and they will be used to validate the results of on-going monthly InSAR and campaign GPS studies, along the north Anatolian fault.",

The issue of how to obtain comparable uncertainty estimates for the gridded data using the different estimation approaches is addressed. Achieving comparable estimation is accomplished by applying the propagated uncertainty concept that has been previously proposed in the literature and a numerical realization of Tobler’s first law to the measurement data prior to the computation of the estimate, no matter which form of estimator is used.",

To speed up the process, high performance computing is widely adopted. By partitioning a large study area into small subdomains according to their geographic location and executing them on different computing nodes in a parallel fashion, the computing performance can be significantly improved. However, it is still a question worthy of consideration that how to allocate these subdomain processes into computing nodes without introducing imbalanced task loads and unnecessary communications among computing nodes. Here we propose a domain decomposition and allocation framework that can carefully leverage the computing cost and communication cost for each computing node to minimize total execution time and reduce overall communication cost for the entire system. The framework is tested in the NMM (Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model)-dust model, where a 72-hour processes of the dust load are simulated. Performance result using the proposed scheduling method is compared with the one using default scheduling methods of MPI. Results demonstrate that the system improves the performance of simulation by 20% up to 80%.",

            "abstract": "For CO2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers, contaminant transport in subsurface, and oil or gas recovery, we often need to forecast flow patterns. Subsurface characterization is a critical and challenging step in flow forecasting. To characterize subsurface properties we establish a statistical description of the subsurface properties that are conditioned to existing dynamic and static data. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used in a Bayesian statistical description to reconstruct the spatial distribution of rock permeability and porosity. The MCMC algorithm requires repeatedly solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations describing displacement of fluids in porous media for different values of permeability and porosity. The time needed for the generation of a reliable MCMC chain using the algorithm can be too long to be practical for flow forecasting. In this work we develop fast and effective computational methods for generating MCMC chains in the Bayesian framework for the subsurface characterization. Our strategy consists of constructing a family of computationally inexpensive preconditioners based on simpler physics as well as on surrogate models such that the number of fine-grid simulations is drastically reduced in the generated MCMC chains. In particular, we introduce a huff-puff technique as screening step in a three-stage multi-physics MCMC algorithm to reduce the number of expensive final stage simulations. The huff-puff technique in the algorithm enables a better characterization of subsurface near wells. We assess the quality of the proposed multi-physics MCMC methods by considering Monte Carlo simulations for forecasting oil production in an oil reservoir.",

            "abstract": "Observational data provide a powerful source of information for understanding the phenological response of tropical forests to a changing climate. Annual changes in mean temperature, precipitation, and solar irradiance, in part driven by ENSO cycles, provide a natural experiment. However, these time series are often relatively short (several years to several decades), the average climatic variability experienced in that timeframe is relatively small, and the corresponding response is therefore often very weak. As a result, standard statistical approaches may fail in detecting a biological response.\nWe present an alternative ecoinformatic analysis that demonstrates the power of weak models in the discovery and interpretation of statistically significant signals in short, noisy, ecological time series. We developed a simple response prediction model that uses cross-validation to explore a landscape of models that correlate the phenological behavior of individual taxa (pollen production, flowering, fruiting) to seasonal and annual mean temperature, precipitation, and solar irradiance using multivariate linear regression. We use a sign slope sensitivity analysis of each linear model that tallies positive and negative slope counts of a taxon’s phenological behavior to our environmental and null variables. We applied this analysis to pollen trap data collected from 1996 to 2006 from two lowland Panamanian forests, Barro Colorado Island and Parque National San Lorenzo. We also tested the performance of our predictive model using published data of annual flowering and fruiting from BCI to corroborate that our approach could reproduce previously published results on tropical phenology.\nOur results indicate that although the overall variation in temperature was 3.28 °C over the ten year period, pollen productivity at both sites was most consistently affected by changes in temperature. This result was replicated by the published BCI flower and fruit data, which also increased with increased temperatures, highlighting the significant influence of even subtle changes in temperature for tropical forest communities. We also observed that both pollen and fruit production were negatively correlated with precipitation, suggesting a mechanism for how climate may interfere with pollination success.",

            "abstract": "Long-range transport from Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitudes plays a key role in setting the distributions of trace species and aerosols in the Arctic. While comprehensive models project a strengthening and poleward shift in the midlatitude tropospheric jets in response to future warming, relatively little attention has been paid to assessing the large-scale transport response in the Arctic. A natural way to quantify transport and its future changes is in terms of rigorously defined air masses that partition air according to where it last contacted the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Here we present climatologies of Arctic air mass origin for NH winter and summer, computed from two integrations of the Goddard Earth Observing System chemistry-climate model (GEOSCCM) subject to present-day and future climate forcings. The modeled transport response to A1B greenhouse-gas induced warming reveals that in the future ~10% more air in the Arctic will originate over NH midlatitudes, with a slighter weaker albeit significant increase in winter compared to summer. Our results indicate that transport changes alone may lead to “cleaner” Arctic winters, as air will be 5-10% more likely to have last contacted the PBL over the East Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans and less likely to have originated over Europe and North America. Conversely, in future summers the air mass fractions originating over Asia and North America increase by ~10%, indicating that Arctic pollutant levels may be enhanced owing solely to changes in transport. In particular, our results suggest that more stringent emissions caps may be needed to combat enhanced transport into the Arctic from Asia, where increases in black carbon emissions have already posed concerns. Future changes in air mass fractions are interpreted in terms of large-scale circulation responses that are consistent with CMIP5 multi-model mean projections – namely, upward and poleward shifted meridional transient eddies in future winters and an overall weakening in large scale summertime convective transport throughout the NH midlatitude lower and middle troposphere.\n ",

So is global warming, and the two issues are closely related, but the natures of these two controversies have substantial and important differences. Building upon years of experience in teaching and developing resources and strategies for teaching about evolution and climate change, staff at the Paleontological Research Institution have engaged in public outreach and educator professional development to help nurture understanding of fracking and the broader energy system. How are these controversies similar to and different from one another, and how should understanding these similarities and differences inform educational programming (and about how you talk about these issues with your Uncle Fred at the family holiday dinner?).\nIt is nearly universally agreed amongst scientists who study climate that changes now underway are real and human caused, and are posing or likely to pose very serious problems for humanity. Scientists who study slickwater high-volume hydraulic fracturing agree that it causes environmental damage, but there is no consensus as to whether fracking causes more or less harm (e.g., among different kinds of environment harm, across different temporal and spatial scales, and among different social contexts) than other ways of producing energy on a large scale. In other words, the basic tenets of climate change are not a matter of scientific controversy, though the implications for policy making obviously remain politically controversial, while fracking is an issue of both scientific and political controversy. Without advocating for or against fracking, we help audiences disentangle scientific and political issues, better understand the energy resources used in their own communities, and consider issues of scale, systems, and complexity.\nWe will compare and contrast the overlapping controversies surrounding climate change and fracking and highlight effective and ineffective approaches for educational programming as well as for more personal discussions. We will draw attention to the important ways in which these topics differ and what that implies for the development of programming and resources for teaching.",

            "abstract": "At subduction zones, variations in fault zone seismic reflectivity provide key information about in situ physical properties. Commonly, negative polarity reflectors, which result from large impedance contrasts across the fault interface, are taken to indicate anomalously high porosity and pore fluid pressures. However, this idea has not been explored rigorously in the context of realistic sediment loading paths and consolidation behavior.\nWe use a forward model to quantify the effects of stress state and drainage conditions on fault zone reflection coefficient (R), focused on case studies from the Nankai and Costa Rican margins. We define constitutive relationships between: (1) stress state (mean and differential stress) and porosity (Φ); and (2) P-wave velocity (Vp) and Φ using data from triaxial laboratory consolidation experiments conducted on core samples. One key aspect of our approach is the consideration of differing stress states in the overriding wedge, which is likely to have experienced conditions at or near thrust failure, vs. the subducting sediment section, which likely undergoes uniaxial consolidation, at least in the near trench region.\nFor Costa Rica, the full range of pore pressure from hydrostatic to lithostatic yields negative values of R. Both the observation of decreased reflection amplitude beyond ~45 km from the trench and reported P-wave interval velocities in the subducting section are most consistent with modest overpressures (λ<~0.7). Decreased reflection amplitude landward of this point does not require the onset of drainage. Similarly, for Nankai, a wide range of pore fluid pressure conditions lead to negative values of R, because increased mean effective stress in the wedge leads to decreased Φ and higher Vp relative to the footwall. Positive polarity arises only if the underthrusting sediment transitions from a state of uniaxial compression to thrust failure, in combination with the onset of drainage - as might accompany décollement downstepping and duplexing. Our results show that fault reflectivity and its variation along-strike and downdip are unlikely to arise simply from variations in pore pressure. Future analyses should consider the role of stress state and sediment deformation properties in order to extract quantitative information from these signals.",

Four lithofacies in the injection horizon are chosen for strength testing, including: chlorite-cemented conglomeratic sandstone (CSS); mixed chlorite- and quartz-cemented cross-bedded fine sandstone (XSS); quartz-cemented tabular very fine sandstone (TSS); and quartz-cemented siltstone (SiS). Each lithofacies had 25-mm diameter by at least 50-mm length samples plugged. We performed a suite of compression tests for the sandstone at 100°C and pore pressure of 30 MPa, including near-zero effective confining pressure triaxial test, axisymmetric compression tests, and hydrostatic compression test. Sandstones were saturated with supercritical CO2-equilibrated brine with 30 MPa pore pressure. SiS samples were equilibrated at a constant relative humidity of 77% at 100°C. TSS had the largest yield and failure envelopes. XSS had slightly smaller yield and failure envelopes. CSS was by far the weakest. The sandy facies' effective unconfined tests showed rounded peaks, indicating viscous deformation during damage. SiS had strengths intermediate to TSS and XSS, and CSS. The chemical environment mechanically changed CSS, with cement type exerting control on strength. Constitutive behavior is modeled with elasto-plastic and viscous models. Essential features describing mechanical behavior include non-associative plasticity, stress-invariant dependent failure, elliptical cap surface, kinematic and isotropic hardening, non linear elasticity and elastic-plastic coupling.

            "abstract": "At volcanoes, seismic signals are often characterized by emergent onsets, a lack of phase arrivals, and long durations. Volcanic tremor, in particular, is a ubiquitous type of eruption seismicity that remains poorly understood. Large-N deployments of seismometers at actively erupting volcanoes offer a chance to make headway into understanding the processes of tremor generation. To illustrate these challenges, here I discuss imaging, waveform inversion, and tracking of volcanic tremor.\nDuring the 2008 Okmok eruption, low frequency tremor radiated continuously at frequencies as low as 0.2 Hz from beneath the active intracaldera cone. At these low frequencies and over the aperture of the Okmok seismic network, surface waves dominated the wave field and propagated in an effective laterally homogeneous medium with little scattering besides that due to topography. Since unknown path effects were negligible, I invert the waveforms of the low frequency tremor between 0.2-0.3 Hz for a point moment source. The inversion resolves a shallow subhorizontal sill beneath the active cone, with a mostly diagonal moment tensor dominated by the Mzz component.\nBackprojection has become a powerful tool for imaging the rupture process of global earthquakes. At the volcano scale, it can monitor changes in tremor location as well. I apply the method to the Okmok seismic network in the 0.2-0.3 Hz band at the time of an escalation in tremor during the 2008 eruption. Although backprojection focuses the wavefield close to the location of the active cone, the network array response lacks sufficient resolution to reveal kilometer-scale changes in tremor location. By deconvolving the response in successive backprojection images, I enhance resolution and find that the tremor source moved 1-2 km toward an intracaldera lake prior to its escalation. The increased tremor therefore may have resulted from magma-water interaction, in agreement with the overall phreatomagmatic character of the eruption. Imaging and tracking of eruption tremor shows that time reversal methods, such as backprojection, can provide new insights into the temporal evolution of volcanic sources.",

Iron-bearing carbonates especially ferromagnesite [(Mg,Fe)CO3] has been commonly proposed to be a major carbon career in the Earth’s mantle. Previous studies have reported very different scenarios for the (Mg,Fe)CO3 system in the deep-mantle conditions including the chemical dissociation and various structural transitions. Using synchrotron X-ray diffraction in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, we have studied the spin transition diagram as well as the phase stability and compressional behavior of (Mg,Fe)CO3 carbonates up to lower-mantle conditions of approximately 120 GPa and 2400 K. These studies focus on understanding the effects of the spin transition on the physical and chemical properties of the deep-mantle carbonates. Our high-pressure results show that an electronic spin crossover occurs in ferromagnesite at mid-lower mantle P-T conditions and that it then transforms into an orthorhombic high-pressure phase following the spin transition at deeper parts of the lower mantle pressure-temperature conditions. The high-pressure orthorhombic phase is likely in the low-spin state that can become a stable deep-carbon carrier at deeper parts of the lower mantle below 2000 km in depth. These findings suggest that deep-mantle carbonates can exhibit unique physical and chemical properties than that at shallower mantle conditions. Here we will address how the spin transition as well as the structural phase transition affects our understanding of the deep-mantle carbonate storage in the Earth’s interior.\n",

            "abstract": "The \"missing carbon\" problem has plagued the carbon cycle field for over 30 years. A newly proposed constellation of satellites promises to finally close the gap and find the missing carbon. This constellation would measure vegetation from multiple angles at solar wavelengths, essentially measuring the bidirectional reflectance (BRDF), and from this retrieve the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), something that has eluded space remote sensing community up until now, showing up to 40% uncertainty.\nThe science value of such a BRDF retrieval approach has been demonstrated using multi-angle, multi-spectral measurements from various deployments of the Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR) as the “gold standard” data for BRDF estimation. CAR is an airborne instrument operated by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Initial observing system simulations (OSSE) with four satellites launched as secondary payloads and operating in different imaging modes show BRDF error estimates of less than 12% when compared to CAR measurements, a 50% improvement to the worst case BRDF error produced by corresponding monoliths.\nHowever, GPP products require estimating the BRDF of photochemical reflectance index (PRI), which needs angular measurements at the xanthophyll sensitive band (533nm) – unavailable in CAR. The satellite OSSEs will be repeated using AMPSEC tower measurements. AMPSEC is a Unispec-DC (PP Systems, Amesbury,MA, USA) spectroradiometer with 256 contiguous bands with a nominal band spacing of 3 nm and a nominal range of operation between 350 and 1200 nm. The data will be used to estimate parameters of the widely-used Rahman–Pinty–Verstraete (RPV) and RossThin-LiSparseReciprocal (RTnLS) BRDF models. Since AMPSEC reflectance data is obtained at 360 view-azimuth directions and 90 view-zenith directions, satellite clusters will be able to sample only a part of this angular space. To make best use of the satellite-cluster BRDF data, a heuristic optimization method is used to find the best angular sub-sampling. Also, different closed loop formation-flying geometries are considered. We will show the effect of these formation-flying architectures on BRDF, PRI and GPP estimation errors and identify an optimal baseline architecture that will reduce errors when compared to existing spaceborne instruments such as MODIS and MISR.",

            "abstract": "Sediment dynamics in estuaries and near shore regions control the growth or erosion of the bed and fringing wetlands, determine the spread of sediment-associated contaminants, and limit the light availability for primary productivity through turbidity. In estuaries such as San Francisco Bay, this sediment is often cohesive, and can flocculate. Changes to the composition of the sediment and waters, the suspended sediment concentration, and the turbulence can all affect the flocculation of suspended sediment. In turn, flocculation controls the particle diameter, settling velocity, density, and particle inertia. These sediment properties drive the turbulent diffusivity, which balances with the settling velocity to impact the vertical distribution of sediment in the water column. The vertical profile strongly affects how sediment is transported through the estuary by lateral flow.\nTurbulence may also impact settling velocity in non-cohesive particles. In turbulence, dense particles may get trapped in convergent flow regions, thus particles are more likely to get swept along the downward side of a turbulent eddy than the upward side, resulting in enhanced settling velocities.\nWe isolated the impacts of turbulence level, particle size and type, and suspended sediment concentration on particle settling velocities using uniform grain size particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Controlling the turbulence in a well-defined turbulence tank, we used Two Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters, separated vertically, to measure turbulent velocities (w') and suspended sediment concentrations (C), which yield condition dependent settling velocities (ws), via equation 1.\nLab characterization of particle settling velocities help to validate the method for measuring settling velocities in the field, and will serve as a foundation for an extensive field experiment in San Francisco Bay. Characterizing the velocity enhancement relative to the Stokes number, the Rouse number, and the turbulent Reynolds number will enable more mechanistic predictions of sediment transport in low energy environments like protected estuary margins.",

            "abstract": "Impact craters are among the few geologic features we have some confidence will be present in the Pluto/Charon system. Crater morphologies are important as tracers of thermal history (through the mechanism of viscous relaxation), and can be used to probe through icy crusts (in terms of excavating deeper layers as on Ganymede or penetrating through floating ice shells as on Europa). New Horizons will have the opportunity to examine crater morphologies on Pluto to resolutions <100 meters and on Charon to ~250 meters over significant areas. Stereo-derived topography maps are anticipated over 20-35% of each body. The first task will be to place the observed craters (assuming they are not deeply eroded) into Solar System context. Crater morphology on icy satellites is controlled primarily by surface gravity. Charon has similar surface gravity to the icy Saturnian satellites and we expect craters on Charon to resemble those seen by Cassini, where the dominant landform will be prominent central peaks. Pluto surface gravity is midway between Ganymede and Rhea. Triton, with similar surface gravity and internal composition to Pluto, is of no help due to the paucity of resolved craters there. This opens the possibility of observing landforms seen on Ganymede, such as central dome craters, palimpsests and perhaps even a multiring basin or two, albeit at larger diameters than we would see on Ganymede. Several issues complicate our rosy picture. A key unresolved concern is that impact velocities in the Pluto system are only a few km/s, in the low end of the hypervelocity range. Numerical models imply possible differences during excavation, producing deeper simple craters than on the icy satellites. Impacts occurring at velocities well below the mean (<< 2km/s) might produce shallower craters, complicating the issue further. Whether such differences are real and are significant enough to be detected in our anticipated topographic data sets is unclear. Any viscous relaxation (driven by internal or modest tidal heating) or mass wasting erosion (by volatile redistribution) will also work to reduce crater depths on Pluto in different ways, but cratering onto the likely cold interior of Charon may provide a reference standard by which to evaluate modified craters on Pluto.",

U.S. DOT recently released a set of climate change and extreme weather tools for state DOTs and MPOs that address key challenges they have faced in increasing their climate change resilience. The tools were developed under the U.S. DOT Gulf Coast Study, Phase 2. The CMIP Climate Data Processing Tool provides an easy way for users to gather and process downscaled climate model data at the local level, and “translates” that data into information relevant to transportation engineers and planners. The Vulnerability Assessment Scoring Tool (VAST), provides a step-by-step approach for users to assess their vulnerability to climate change in a transparent, cost-effective way. The Transportation Climate Change Sensitivity Matrix provides detailed information on how 11 different climate stressors may affect transportation infrastructure and operations. These tools significantly advance the state of the practice for transportation agencies to respond to climate change impacts, and beta-versions have been used successfully by several state DOTs and MPOs. This presentation will focus on these tools, examples of how they can be applied within transportation agencies, and opportunities to apply the lessons learned from the tools—or even the tools themselves—beyond the transportation sector, including as part of the national Climate Resilience Toolkit.",

Other essential atmospheric forcing variables have been interpolated from default CLM offline forcing data. CLM4 physically describes variable snowpacks with up to five snow layers, taking into consideration snow compaction and the conservation of mass and heat transfer of water and ice content. This decoupled CLM4 model is evaluated between the water years of 1982-2011 over the Western United States (WUS) mountain region where snowmelt is critical for agricultural and urban activities. The results from this study show a significant improvement in SWE model output, which is underestimated with offline CLM4 runs using default coarse grids. An important cause for underestimation of SWE is coarse variable information that does not account for geospatial variability within the mountainous WUS. CLM4 grid point outputs are then quantitatively compared to associated locations of SNOTEL station observations. In addition, single-point analysis is provided at select geographical locations, that directly use SNOTEL precipitation data to force CLM4. This investigation will lead to future work providing realistic parameterizations into future CLM model runs for future snowpack predictions over the WUS.",

            "abstract": "The removal of the Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams from the Elwha River, near Port Angeles, Washington, has released a large pulse of sediment into the middle and lower reaches of the Elwha River. This sediment has important geomorphic, hydraulic, and ecological implications. Our project focuses on the deposition of fine sediment on vegetated parts of the Elwha floodplain using field observations of sediment accumulation in combination with a simplified physics numerical model, CAESAR-Lisflood. The floodplain of the Elwha is densely vegetated and in places is characterized by large amounts of local topographic variation. This makes measuring centimeter-scale overbank sedimentation difficult using traditional approaches such as lidar and total-station based cross-section surveys. To address this problem and to provide ground truth for more traditional surveying methods, we set up over 50 short (10-20 m long) cross-sections between sets of flagged trees and surveyed, at 1-meter intervals, ground elevation with respect to a spike set in each section. Nails in the trees ensure that the horizontal position of our measurements do not shift by more than a few centimeters from year to year. This approach allows sediment accumulation to be measured repeatedly with a precision we estimate to be on the order of a few centimeters, allowing us to estimate annual rates of local sedimentation. At a given point on the floodplain, sedimentation should depend significantly on the frequency of inundation. We simulate this for the 2012-2014 period using a CAESAR-Lisflood 2-D numerical model calibrated using a set of continuously recording staff gages. CAESAR-Lisflood uses simplified-physics hydraulic routines to efficiently simulate flow depth and velocity and to drive size-specific sediment transport and morphodynamic change. This allows the model to simulate changes in flood inundation probability for the post- removal period. CAESAR-based hydraulic results are used to interpret our field-based sedimentation measurements and to develop a reach-wide estimate of overall fine sediment accumulation on the floodplain. Our CAESAR runs, which are performed for the entire post-dam removal period, produce rich 2-D representations of velocity and bed texture that should be useful to other researchers studying this system.",

The Trinity River Restoration Program is now analyzing a 40 mile segment of the Trinity River to determine priority and implementation sequencing for its Phase II rehabilitation projects. A comprehensive approach and quantitative tool has recently been developed to analyze this complex river system referred to as: 2D-Hydrodynamic Based Logic Modeling (2D-HBLM). This tool utilizes various hydraulic output parameters combined with biological, ecological, and physical metrics at user-defined spatial scales. These metrics and their associated algorithms are the underpinnings of the 2D-HBLM habitat module used to evaluate geomorphic characteristics, riverine processes, and habitat complexity. The habitat metrics are further integrated into a comprehensive Logic Model framework to perform statistical analyses to assess project prioritization. The Logic Model will analyze various potential project sites by evaluating connectivity using principal component methods. The 2D-HBLM tool will help inform management and decision makers by using a quantitative process to optimize desired response variables with balancing important limiting factors in determining the highest priority locations within the river corridor to implement restoration projects. Effective river restoration prioritization starts with well-crafted goals that identify the biological objectives, address underlying causes of habitat change, and recognizes that social, economic, and land use limiting factors may constrain restoration options (Bechie et. al. 2008). Applying natural resources management actions, like restoration prioritization, is essential for successful project implementation (Conroy and Peterson, 2013). Evaluating tradeoffs and examining alternatives to improve fish habitat through optimization modeling is not just a trend but rather the scientific strategy by which management needs embrace and apply in its decision framework.",

            "abstract": "We present new data of real-time measurements of concentration and isotope (δ13C) composition of CO2in fumarolic and plume gases emitted from Mt. Etna volcano, performed by using a Delta Ray tunable diode laser. The first two campaigns of measurements were carried out on 11 July and on 5-6 September 2013, while a third campaign was performed in mid-July 2014.\nData acquired along the route Catania–Etna, while car was moving, showed an excess of 13C-depleted CO2 when passing through inhabited centers due to atmospheric pollution produced by the cars exhaust. A similar behavior was observed when accidentally measuring car exhaust of our car. Differently, volcanic gases displayed a 13C-enrichment of CO2 if compared to air. With the assumption of a two components mixing, a simple linear regression was applied to the data in order to obtain the volcanogenic δ13C of CO2.\nFumaroles of Torre del Filosofo (2,900 m a.s.l.) displayed a δ13C between -3.2±0.03‰ and -3.7±0.05‰, comparable to IRMS measurements of discrete samples collected in the same date and in previous investigations. Diluted plume gases were collected at more than 1 km from the craters and showed δ13C=-2.2±0.2‰, accordingly with collected crater fumaroles. Data collected in 2014 campaign are under processing, but preliminary results confirm a less negative signature of δ13C of CO2emitted from Central Craters if compared to Torre del Filosofo fumaroles, with some interesting variations over time that need to be compared with other simultaneously acquired parameters.\nConsidering the huge amount of data that may be acquired in a very short time by Delta Ray, we demonstrate that the addition to the atmospheric CO2 content of ~100 ppm of CO2 from an unknown source is enough to allow a mathematical calculation of the end-member with an uncertainty generally < 0.15‰. This is feasible with the assumption of a binary mixing. We thus infer that these measurements performed at Mt. Etna, if performed continuously, may contribute to a better comprehension of the magmatic processes.",

            "abstract": "Reach-scale solute transport studies are often used to characterize transient storage of solutes or groundwater-stream exchanges, yet the results are limited by window of detection issues (the limit of temporal and spatial scales over which one can infer processes from observed breakthrough curves). To determine the influence of exchanges into and out of reaches of different spatial scales, we conducted two simultaneous tracer injection types in a headwater stream in the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest in central Montana, USA - one constant rate Rhodamine WT (RWT) injection (8 days) over 2.8 km of stream, and synoptic chloride releases in 28 100-m and 14 200-m subreaches when the RWT concentrations were at quasi-steady state. From the synoptic releases, we examined the spatial distribution of stream flow exchanges. Stream discharge increased from 0.8 L s-1 (at the head) to 27 L s-1 (at the base) along the 2.8-km study reach. Although the stream gains water at the scale of the 2.8-km study reach, stream water balances in the 100-m and 200-m subreaches demonstrate gross gains and losses. When comparing the summed gains and losses of the two 100-m subreach exchanges to that of the encompassing 200-m reach, the combined 100 m reaches always exhibit greater gain and loss. We interpret this as an indication that the 200-m reach includes return flows that appear to be losses from the 100-m subreaches. When we evaluate the change in RWT load at 100-m and 200-m subreach scales, we find typically less mass loss of RWT than is computed from the chloride slug releases, indicating the gain of RWT from long hyporheic flowpaths that originate upstream of the subreach of interest (even when RWT is likely to be a less conservative tracer than chloride). We can further parse gains of stream water at the 100-m and 200-m scales into estimates of hyporheic water (i.e., streamwater labelled with RWT returning to the channel) and lateral water (not labelled with RWT), and we find that a majority of water that enters the 100-m and 200-m subreaches is hyporhiec, rather than lateral inflow from sources unmarked by tracers.",

            "abstract": "Access to affordable potable water is critical in the development and maintenance of urban centres. Given that water is a public good in Canada, all funds related to operation and maintenance of the drinking water and wastewater networks must come from consumers. An asset management system can be put in place by municipalities to more efficiently manage their water and wastewater distribution system to ensure proper use of these funds. The system works at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels, thus ensuring optimal scheduling of operation and maintenance activities, as well as prediction of future water demand scenarios. At the operational level, a fully integrated model is used to simulate the groundwater-surface water interaction of the Laurel Creek Watershed, of which 80% is urbanized by the City of Waterloo.\nCanadian municipalities typically lose 13% of their potable water through leaks in watermains and sanitary sewers, and sanitary sewers often generate substantial inflows from fractures in pipe walls. The City of Waterloo sanitary sewers carry an additional 10,000 cubic meters of water to wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, watermain and sanitary sewers present a significant impact on the groundwater-surface water interaction, as well as the affordability of the drinking water and wastewater networks as a whole. To determine areas of concern within the network, the integrated groundwater-surface water model also simulates flow through the City of Waterloo’s watermain and sanitary sewer networks. The final model will be used to assess the interaction between measured losses of water from the City of Waterloo’s watermain system, infiltration into the sanitary sewer system adjacent to the watermains, and the response of the groundwater system to deteriorated sanitary sewers or to pipes that have been recently renovated. This will ultimately contribute to the City of Waterloo’s municipal asset management plan.",

            "abstract": "In this project, we focus on providing a computer-automated platform for a better assessment of the potential failures and retrofit measures of flood-protecting earth structures, e.g., dams and levees. Such structures play an important role during extreme flooding events as well as during normal operating conditions. Furthermore, they are part of other civil infrastructures such as water storage and hydropower generation. Hence, there is a clear need for accurate evaluation of stability and functionality levels during their service lifetime so that the rehabilitation and maintenance costs are effectively guided.\nAmong condition assessment approaches based on the factor of safety, the limit states (LS) approach utilizes numerical modeling to quantify the probability of potential failures. The parameters for LS numerical modeling include i) geometry and side slopes of the embankment, ii) loading conditions in terms of rate of rising and duration of high water levels in the reservoir, and iii) cycles of rising and falling water levels simulating the effect of consecutive storms throughout the service life of the structure. Sample data regarding the correlations of these parameters are available through previous research studies. We have unified these criteria and extended the risk assessment in term of loss of life through the implementation of a graphical user interface to automate input parameters that divides data into training and testing sets, and then feeds them into Artificial Neural Network (ANN) tool through MATLAB programming. The ANN modeling allows us to predict risk values of flood protective structures based on user feedback quickly and easily. In future, we expect to fine-tune the software by adding extensive data on variations of parameters.",

            "abstract": "Speleothems (cave mineral deposits) are used to reconstruct changes in rainfall, moisture sources, atmospheric temperatures, and vegetation. Soil respiration is generally considered to be one of the major sources of cave-air CO2, and by extension a major source of carbon in speleothem calcite. However, the δ13C values from speleothem calcite are difficult to interpret. The purpose of this study is to investigate the major source of carbon in cave-air CO2 using a novel tracer, and thereby increase the accuracy of δ13C from speleothem calcite as a paleoenvironmental proxy. Potential sources of CO2 in cave-air include (1) soil respiration (primarily from roots and microbes), (2) animal respiration, (3) in-cave decomposition of organic matter, (4) deep magmatic or metamorphic sources, and (5) atmospheric air. Of these potential sources, soil respiration and atmospheric air are currently considered to be most significant in most caves. We use the respiratory quotient (RQ, which is the number of moles of CO2 produced per mole of O2 consumed, defined here in relation to atmospheric air) to compare cave air and overlying soil gas at two localities in central Texas: Natural Bridge Caverns and Inner Space Cavern. Soil gas samples (RQ = 1.32) follow a trend expected for respiration followed by diffusion whereas cave air samples (RQ = 0.97) follow a trend expected for respiration without subsequent diffusion. We suggest that root and rhizomicrobial respiration below the soil in the epikarst fracture network, where gas transport is dominated by advection rather than diffusion, contributes significantly to cave-air CO2. This is important because 12CO2 preferentially diffuses out of soils, elevating the d13C values of residual soil CO2, whereas no carbon isotope fractionation occurs during advection. Our interpretation of RQ values suggests that the d13C value of cave-air CO2 is not influenced by diffusive loss of CO2. In order to further investigate soil and cave carbon sources and transport, we plan to collect gas samples from fractures in the epikarst by drilling wells into the epikarst. In addition, we plan to incubate roots and root-free soil in order to characterize the RQ and d13C values associated with these two types of respiration.",

Providing a platform for our scientists to work with data from different models both in-house and extending a similar approach to the application of climate analysis on data from different modeling centers is a key goal that will be addressed in this presentation.\nModel intercomparison projects, Earth System Grid Federation and knowledge exchange within the climate science community have all enabled successful establishment of “data standards and controlled vocabulary” . This opens key possibilities to facilitate techniques used to “explore” dataset(s) in the Big-Data archive and perform climate analyses following a simple, standardized templated approach.\nA typical pattern of use would be where the scientist works with a few datasets interactively to refine and extract a signal of a particular climate phenomenon. At this point data access patterns are random, as the analysis is exploratory. We call this the “inspiration-driven” phase of research. Subsequently, the scientist would need to apply her analysis to a much wider set of data: different models and scenarios from CMIP5 for example. This can be thought of as the “industrial” phase of research.\nWe provide a pathway for user-developed analyses to transition from inspiration to industry. We will illustrate techniques being adopted at GFDL to develop analysis through interactive computational exploration on selected data; Provide analysis capabilities in batch workflows (using: Flexible Runtime Environment) and also web-based with data exploration mechanisms tapped from GFDL’s Curator infrastructure. Comparing climate data both at the inter and intra-laboratory level, simplified by use of “unified analysis templates” and data standards.\nThis work was partly funded by the International ExArch project under the G8 initiative by NSF Award 1119308.

            "abstract": "Climate models predict increasing drought in Amazonian forests over the next century, and the synergy of drought and fire may lead to forest dieback. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) are two primary drivers of Amazonian drought, and each process has a spatially distinct manifestation in the Basin. Paleoecological reconstructions can contextualize the forest response to past drought periods. Stalagmite and lake sediment records have documented that the early- to mid-Holocene, i.e. 10,000 – 5000 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP), was among the driest periods of the last 100,000 years in western Amazonia. Climatic conditions became wetter and more similar to the modern climate over the last 4000 cal yr BP, and fires rarely occurred in the absence of human activity. Yet there are currently no drought and fire reconstructions that examine the spatially explicit patterns of drought during the Holocene. Here, we present regional drought histories from southwestern and northeastern sections Amazonia for the last 10,000 years that document the drought-fire dynamics resulting from both climatic processes.\nOur reconstructions were based on a compilation of dated soil charcoal fragments (N= 291) collected from within Amazonia sensu stricto, which were analyzed by region using summed probability analysis. The compiled soil charcoal dates contained limited evidence of fire over the last 10,000 years in some regions. Fire frequency rose markedly across the Basin, however, during the last 2000 years, indicating an increased human presence. Fire probabilities, and thus droughts, had similar increasing trajectories between southwestern and northeastern Amazonia from 1500-1100 cal yr BP, which decoupled from 1100-740 cal yr BP, and then regained synchronicity from 740-500 cal yr BP. Fire probability declined markedly after 500 yr cal BP, coincident with European arrival to the Americas. Native populations were decimated, and fire probabilities returned to similar levels before the rise 2000 years ago. These results suggested that the synergy of humans plus drought have played a large role in historical fire regimes in Amazonian forests for the last 2000 years.",

            "abstract": "An integrated approach incorporating multicomponent and classical solute geothermometry was used to evaluate its utility to estimate the temperature of the Bath geothermal reservoir, a low-enthalpy system on the island of Jamaica. Reservoir temperatures were estimated from (1) empirical geothermometric equations; (2) simulations of solute geothermometers using SolGeo software; (3) computations of saturation indices [Log(Q/K)] of reservoir minerals from full chemically-analyzed thermal water samples over a temperature range of 25-220°C in PHREEQC; and (4) the Giggenbach Na-K-Mg geothermometer. A principal component analysis (PCA) shows strong, positive correlations between Na+, K+, and Mg2+ and is regarded as significant for these ions in their reliance as useful reservoir geoindicators. However, a negative correlation exists between Na+, K+, Mg2+ and silica (SiO2). The more realistic estimates of the geothermal reservoir temperature were provided by the Na-K and Na-K-Mg geothermometers, whereas the Na-K-Ca geothermometer overestimated reservoir temperatures. Estimated geotemperatures from silica-quartz geothermometers were the lowest. The discrepancy in estimated geotemperatures may be due to processes such as boiling, degassing, dilution, rock dissolution, and mixing during the ascent of geothermal fluids. Log (Q/K) curves cluster over a range of equilibrium temperatures closest to Na-K and Na-K-Mg geothermometers at 80-102°C. Reservoir temperatures estimated for the Bath geothermal system range between 79-118°C. Comparisons of the estimated geotemperatures using the integrated approach to geothermometry show a favorable agreement. Based on the results of this investigation, the integrated geothermometric approach provided a more reliable approach to reconstruct the fluid composition at depth and estimate the geothermal reservoir temperature.",

            "abstract": "A multi-channel seismic reflection and wide-angle refraction seismic experiment was conducted on the Juan de Fuca (JdF) plate to investigate the evolution of the plate from accretion to its subduction at the Cascadia margin. Hydration of the upper crust (UC) of the JdF Plate is well documented, but the state of hydration of the lower crust (LC) and upper mantle (UM] remains to be investigated. A 2D P-wave velocity model of the plate is derived from a joint reflection-refraction travel-time inversion of wide-angle seismic data. Stacked MCS reflection images together with modeled sedimentary velocities define an increasing thickness of sedimentary cover of up to 2.7km. Evidence for bending-related faulting is identified in coincident MCS images both indirectly as faulting in the sedimentary layer [Gibson, et al., this meeting] and directly as dipping crustal reflectors [Han et al., this meeting]. Three first order features are evident in the patterns of crustal velocity variations along the profile. 1: Crustal velocities at 150-250 km landward of the spreading ridge (~5 Ma age) show reduced velocities up to -0.20 km/s in comparison to velocities in younger crust (~3 Ma) 100-150 km from the ridge. This decrease in velocities is coincident with a propagator wake. 2: Upper crustal velocities begin to increase at 170km from the deformation front (DF), which coincides with the first evidence of faulting from sedimentary offsets. Crustal velocities start a decreasing trend at 80km from the DF where fault throws are seen to begin increasing trend landward. 3: UC velocities in the region of directly imaged crustal faulting (40km from trench) increase ~0.5km/s at the DF, while LC velocities decrease ~0.3km/s. The contrasting behavior in the upper and lower crust may indicate that bending promotes hydrothermal circulation in the outer rise. Circulation may be vigorous enough within the sediments/UC so that any residual shallow porosity is clogged with alteration products faster than new porosity created by faulting, while in the LC new faults and cracks are the dominant process increasing porosity. We present estimates of porosity from ridge to trench at crustal and upper mantle levels by taking into account thermal effects on seismic velocity in order to place bounds on total and spatial distribution of water stored in the plate.",

            "abstract": "Capture, curate, and analysis are the typical activities performed at any given Earth Science data center. Modern data management systems must be adaptable to heterogeneous science data formats, scalable to meet the mission’s quality of service requirements, and able to manage the life-cycle of any given science data product. Designing a scalable data management doesn’t happen overnight. It takes countless hours of refining, refactoring, retesting, and re-architecting. The Horizon data management and workflow framework, developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, is a portable, scalable, and reusable framework for developing high-performance data management and product generation workflow systems to automate data capturing, data curation, and data analysis activities. The NASA’s Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC)’s Data Management and Archive System (DMAS) is its core data infrastructure that handles capturing and distribution of hundreds of thousands of satellite observations each day around the clock. DMAS is an application of the Horizon framework. The NASA Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS)’s solution for making high-resolution global imageries available to the science communities. The Imagery Exchange (TIE), an application of the Horizon framework, is a core subsystem for GIBS responsible for data capturing and imagery generation automation to support the EOSDIS’ 12 distributed active archive centers and 17 Science Investigator-led Processing Systems (SIPS). This presentation discusses our ongoing effort in refining, refactoring, retesting, and re-architecting the Horizon framework to enable data-intensive science and its applications.",

We have begun to constrain the composition and timing of influx for fluids that caused retrograde metamorphism in southern Syros lithologies. Most of the southern part of the island has experienced greenschist facies metamorphism, and as a reconnaissance study, we have analyzed carbonate veins from metabasalt and serpentinite lithologies. Calcite veins from serpentinites and one carbonate vein from metabasite average low δ13C values: δ13C = -8.98‰ and δ13C = -8.33‰, respectively. Relative to the preceding samples, other carbonate veins from metabasites [avg. δ13C = -0.27‰] and a dolomite vein from serpentinite (δ13C = -2.90‰) are enriched in 13C. In contrast, δ18O values are homogenous and range from +24.2‰ to +28.1‰. Carbonates with low δ13C values are consistent with derivation of carbon from organic matter, and have δ18O values that reflect interaction and precipitation from meteoric water. Based on an estimated mean annual value of Syros meteoric water (δ18O = -5.4‰), calcite/dolomite-water equilibrium fractionation estimate reaction temperatures of ~25-44 °C. Samples with higher δ13C values likely reflect C contribution from dissolved limestone, wherein CO2-bearing fluids retain constant δ18O values because of the high abundance of water in the metamorphic fluid, but constantly change δ13C because of the abundant carbonate in the region that is readily dissolved. To help constrain fluid sources, we will determine oxygen isotope values of silicate minerals formed during various stages of retrogression. Petrography on thin sections will also assist in determining if various stages of retrogression exist. Ar-Ar dating of micas will be carried-out to determine the timing of fluid-assisted retrogression.",

            "abstract": "A fraction of terrestrial carbon (C) inputs are exported from river networks, however global budgets rarely incorporate in-channel processing of C to account for retention as materials are transported to the coast. To evaluate the metabolic response of microbial communities as a function of carbon quantity and quality, linking microbial activity to ecosystem metabolism, we collected measurements in a sixth order, large Coastal Plain river, the Cahaba River, AL. We characterized carbon pools using lipid biomarkers, modeled ecosystem metabolism, and determined water-column microbial community composition by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. This work was timed with a seasonal increase in water column phytoplankton biomass. As phytoplankton biomass increased, the percentage of long-chain lipid biomarkers declined and the ratio of unsaturated to saturated biomarkers increased, both indicating higher algal contribution to carbon pools and a possible increase in carbon bioavailability. There was a corresponding shift in the heterotrophic microbial community composition, and increased whole ecosystem primary production and respiration. These results highlight important linkages between riverine production, microbial community composition, and large-scale carbon dynamics, suggesting that the importance of the functioning of large rivers in retaining C has been underestimated. These data will contribute to our current modeling efforts linking in-channel spatial heterogenity to biogeochemical cycling, particularly within the context of increasing climate change.",

However, in order to interpret ice-core data accurately, scientists must understand the entire firnification process. In addition, satellite-based measurements of ice-sheet elevation changes must be accompanied by estimates of the air content, or depth-integrated porosity of the firn, in order to infer rates of mass gain or loss. The firn physics group at University of Washington is developing an open source Community Firn Model to simulate firn densification and gas-transport processes. We have calculated the spatial distribution of depth and age of the firn at pore close-off, as well as the depth-integrated porosity, using gridded mean-annual temperature over Greenland over a 173 year period together with gridded snow accumulation-rate data (Box). Our results can contribute to a better understanding of past climate changes, and knowing the close-off depth and age will provide guidelines for future core sites for investigation of pre-industrial levels of trace gases. Knowing the depth-integrated porosity will allow more accurate mass-loss estimates, and to future sea-level predictions.",

            "abstract": "The increase of the CO2 content in the atmosphere by the release of anthropogenic CO2 may be addressed by the enhancement of weathering at the surface of the earth. The average emission of mantle-derived CO2 through volcanism is ~0.3 Gt/year (109 ton/year). Considering the ~3.000 Gt of CO2 present in the atmosphere, the residence time of CO2 in the earth’s atmosphere is ~10,000 years. Because the vast proportion of carbon in biomass is recycled through the atmosphere, CO2 is continuously removed by a series of weathering reactions of silicate minerals and stored in calcium and magnesium carbonates. The addition of anthropogenic CO2 from fossil fuel and cement production, which currently exceeds 35 Gt/year and dwarfs the natural production 100-fold, cannot be compensated by current rates of weathering, and atmospheric CO2 levels are rising rapidly. To address this increase in CO2 levels, weathering rates would have to be accelerated on a commensurate scale. Olivine ((Mg,Fe)2SiO4) is the most reactive silicate mineral in the weathering process. This mineral is the major constituent in relatively common ultramafic rocks such as dunites (olivine content > 90%). To consume the current total annual anthropogenic release of CO2, using a simplified weathering reaction (Mg2SiO4 + 4CO2 + 4H2O --> 2 Mg2+ + 4HCO3- + H4SiO4) would require ~30 Gt/year or ~8-9 km3/year of dunite. This is a large volume; it is about double the total amount of ore and gravel currently mined (~ 17 Gt/year). To mine and crush these rocks to <100 μm costs ~ $8/ton. The transport and distribution over the earth’s surface involves additional costs, that may reach $2-5/ton. Thus, the cost of remediation for the release of anthropogenic CO2  is $300-400 billion/year. This compares to a 2014 global GDP of ~$80 trillion. Because weathering reactions require the presence of water and proceed more rapidly at higher temperatures, the preferred environments to enhance weathering are the wet tropics. From a socio-economic view, this would require a transfer of funds to some of the poorest and neediest countries. An additional benefit is that weathered ultramafic rocks produce some of the most fertile soils. It also would contribute directly to the remediation of ocean acidification.",

            "abstract": "A full-chain CCS demonstration project was started in 2010 by capturing and injecting around 100,000 tons of CO2 per annum into extremely low-permeability sandstone formations in the northeastern Ordos basin, Inner Mongonia, China. It is the first demonstration project in China for the purpose of public interests by sequestrating in the deep saline aquifers massive amount of CO2 captured from a coal liquefaction company. The injection takes place in overall five brine-bearing geological units that are composed of four sandstones and one carbonate, which are interbedded with various mudstone caprocks. A single vertical well was drilled to the depth of 2826m. Injection screens are opened to more than 20 thin aquifers distributed between the depth 1690m-2453m with a total of 88 m injecting thickness. The permeability for all the storage formations is less 10 md and porosity is in the range of 1-12%. Hydraulic fracturing and formation acidizing were conducted at 10 layers for reservoir improvement. Up to present, total injection of CO2 is about 280,000 tons. Injection pressure drops from around 8.5 MP at the beginning to less than 5MP at present and most CO2 goes to shallowest injection formation at the depth interval 1690-1699 m, which has not been conducted any reservoir improvement. We intend to understand the improving injectivity of such low permeability reservoirs with numerical simulations. The modeling results reasonably describe the spreading of the CO2 plume. After 3 years of injection of CO2, the maximum migrating distance of CO2 plume is about 500 m and the pore pressure build-up is slightly less than 15 MPa. The major storage reservoir at the depth interval 1690-1699 m contributes over 80% of the storage capacity of the entire reservoir system.",

            "abstract": "The dynamics of riverine erosion and sediment transport can be episodic, spatially and temporally non-uniform, and strongly scale dependent. Identifying the events and processes that control these sediment dynamics requires precise measurements, but overcoming spatial and temporal variability requires observations over large distances and long times. Addressing this challenge, therefore, requires integration of data collection efforts at point, cross-section, reach, and whole-river scales. From the mid-1800s to about the 1930s, extreme high flows caused incision along the Rio Puerco, an ephemeral tributary of the Rio Grande located in semi-arid north-central New Mexico. The incision created an arroyo within the 1 to 2 km wide alluvial valley that by 1927 was an average of 118 m wide and 8.5 m deep. In the early 1900s, sediment transported from the Rio Puerco into the Rio Grande contributed to widespread flooding along the Rio Grande and concerns about filling of Elephant Butte Reservoir, located 100 km downstream. We reconstructed the history of arroyo evolution in a 55 km long segment of the lower Rio Puerco by combining data from 3 trenches excavated across the arroyo bottom with arroyo-scale information from aerial imagery, aerial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, longitudinal profiles, and repeat surveys of cross sections. We then examined changes through time since 1927 in arroyo width, depth, volume, morphology, and vegetation. A transition to filling after the 1930s involved vegetation development, channel narrowing, increased sinuosity, and finally vertical aggradation. This strongly depositional sediment transport regime interacted with floodplain shrubs to produce a characteristic narrow, trapezoidal channel. Our study reach demonstrated upstream progression of arroyo widening and filling, but not of arroyo incision, channel narrowing, or floodplain vegetation development. Since the 1970s, arroyo wall retreat has been mostly limited to locations where meanders impinge on the arroyo wall. Average annual net sediment deposition within the Rio Puerco study reach between 1955 and 2005 was 4.8 × 105 t/yr, which is 16% of the average annual suspended sediment yield, and 24% of the long-term bedrock denudation rate. At this rate, the arroyo could fill in about 310 yr.",

            "abstract": "A thermal plume model was proposed for the Hot-spot type volcanism at Northwest Kyushu, southwest Japan in the post period of opening of the Sea of Japan. The model regards the Northwest Kyushu Basalts (NWKBs) were magmas fractionated from parental magmas with MgO = 12.8 – 18.8 wt. %, indicating that partial melting occurred at temperatures from 1330 to 1500 °C and at pressures from 1.5 to 3.0 GPa (Sakuyama et al., 2009; 2014).\n Previous petrological and observations, however, indicate that the NWKBs separated from the source mantle at pressures shallower than those inferred from the plume model. The Mg-Fe-Ni compositions of some NWKBs suggest that they could have been in equilibrium with mantle olivines with Fo = 81 – 87, meaning that they would have been not fractionated but primitive magmas. The NWKBs are associated with primitive high magnesium andesites, indicating that partial melting continued at low pressure such as 0.5 GPa (Mashima, 2009a, b). NWKBs include not garnet lherzolite xenoliths but spinel lherzolite, showing that primitive melt separation occurred at pressure lower than 2GPa (Arai et al., 2001). These lines of evidence indicate that the separation of primitive NWKBs occurred at temperature up to 1250　°C and pressures from 0.5 to 1.5 GPa, significantly lower than those assumed by the plume model.\nInstead of the plume model, geology of NW Kyushu infers that the volcanism was a consequence of the tectonic evolution of NW Kyushu. The volcanism was leaks of asthenosphere thickened extensional tectonics from the Paleogene to the early Miocene. Orientations of NWKB dikes indicate their eruption was induced by the reactivation of preexisting faults under horizontal compressive stress field oriented to a NW-SE direction. This　horizontally compressive stress field would have been caused by mechanical interactions between the subducting Philippine Sea pate and the Eurasian Plate. The NW Kyushu volcanism could be explained in the context of plate tectonics without the plume hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "Removing a forest to open new agricultural lands, which has been very intensive in countries like Brazil during the last decades, contributes to about 12% of the global anthropogenic emissions. Forest cover removal releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GEE) like methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as a result of burning trees, followed by gradual decomposition of the forest biomass left on the ground while pasture or crop plantations are being established. In Brazil, the 2nd Brazilian National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) presents the mean annual net CO2 emissions caused by changes in land use (LUC) in each Brazilian biome and the first place in the ranking is occupied by the Amazon Rainforest Biome (860,874 Gg), followed by Savannah (302,715 Gg), Atlantic Forest (79,109 Gg), Caatinga (37,628 Gg), Pantanal (16,172 Gg) and Pampa (-102 Gg) (MCT 2010). Despite these results, the estimates of CO2 emissions caused by LUC in the Brazilian semiarid region (Caatinga) are very limited and scarce, and associated to uncertainties directly related to the estimated biomass in different types of vegetation which are spatially distributed within the biome, as well as the correct representation of the dynamics of the deforestation process itself, and the more accurate mapping use and land cover. Based on such facts, this project is estimating the emissions of the main greenhouse gases (CO2, N2O and CH4) caused by land use changes in an area of Caatinga biome in Pernambuco State through the model INPE-EM. So far, it is known that from decades of 1940 up to 1995, Caatinga biome has contributed with about 3.2 % to total land use change emissions in the country, and recently (1990-2005), the contributions of Caatinga are even higher (over 30%), according to the 2nd Brazilian National Communication (2010). By means means of the model INPE-EM (data still being acquired), we are trying to diminish the uncertainties and identify specific and integrated emissions of GHG, as well as the stocks and flows of C and N, in order to contribute to the current information about GEE dynamic in the Brazilian. Besides, the model will incorporate the temporal dynamics related to the deforestation process, and accounts for the biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity of the region in study.",

Previously, we demonstrated that incorporating the physical effects of albedo into an ecological economic forest model of locations in the White Mountain National Forest, in New Hampshire, USA, leads to a substantially shorter optimal rotation period for forest harvest than under a carbon- and timber-only approach. In this study, we investigate similar tradeoffs at 565 sites across the entire state of New Hampshire in a variety of different forest types, latitudes, and elevations. Additionally, we use a regression tree approach to calculate the influence of biogeochemical and physical factors on the optimal rotation period. Our results suggest that in many instances, incorporating albedo may lead to optimal rotation times approaching zero, or, perpetual clear-cut. Overall, the difference between growing season and winter-time albedo for forested and harvested states was the most significant variable influencing the rotation period, followed by timber stumpage price, and biomass growth rate. These results provide an initial understanding of tradeoffs amongst these three ecosystem services and provide guidance for forest managers as to the relative important properties of their forests when these three services are incentivized economically.",

            "abstract": "We use continuous GPS measurements from 31 stations in southern Mexico to model coseismic slip and postseismic deformation from the 20 March 2012 Mw=7.5 Ometepec earthquake, the first large thrust earthquake to occur below central Mexico during the modern GPS era. Coseismic offsets ranging from ~280 mm near the epicenter to 5 mm or less at sites far from the epicenter are fit best by a rupture focused between ~15 km and 35 km depth, consistent with an independent seismological estimate. Transient postseismic motion recorded by GPS sites as far as 300 km from the rupture has a different horizontal deformation gradient and opposite sense of vertical motion than do the coseismic offsets. A forward model of viscoelastic relaxation as a result of our new coseismic slip solution incorrectly predicts uplift in areas where postseismic subsidence was recorded and indicates that viscoelastic deformation was no more than a few percent of the measured postseismic deformation. The deformation within six months of the earthquake was thus strongly dominated by fault afterslip. The postseismic GPS time series are well fit as logarithmically decaying fault afterslip on an area of the subduction interface up to 10 times larger than the earthquake rupture zone, extending as far as 220 km inland. Afterslip had a cumulative geodetic moment of 2.0×1020 N·m, ~40% larger than the Ometepec earthquake. Tests for the shallow and deep limits for the afterslip require that it included much of the earthquake rupture zone as well as regions of the subduction interface where slow slip events and non-volcanic tremor have been recorded and areas even farther downdip on the flat interface. We examine whether aftershocks accommodated a significant fraction of the shallow postseismic slip, but find that the energy released by aftershocks accounted for no more than 10% of the postseismic moment release at any depth. Widespread afterslip below much of central Mexico suggests that most of the nearly flat subduction interface in this region is conditionally stable and thus contributes measurable transient deformation to large areas of Mexico south of and in the volcanic belt.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have highlighted ENSO as a key driver of the interannual variability of atmospheric CO2 growth rate (AGR) through its influence on the biospheric carbon cycle. The biophysical mechanisms leading to this influence remain unclear, however. Understanding and correctly representing those mechanisms would provide crucial diagnostic tools to improve predictions of future changes to the global carbon cycle.\nHere we analyze the correlation between annual AGR and the Nino 3.4 index during 1959-2010 to elucidate the response of the biospheric carbon cycle to ENSO. We further compare these results with the responses implied by 11 process-based models participating the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison project (MsTMIP). We find that the annual AGR is strongly correlated with the ENSO index during the preceding September to February, with stronger land CO2 sources following stronger El Nino signals. This response results from teleconnections between tropical temperatures and ENSO, as well as from the influence of tropical temperatures on the biospheric carbon cycle. MsTMIP models capture this correlation, but overestimate it. This is due to an unrealistically high sensitivity of simulated NEE to tropical precipitation. In particular, the response of AGR to ENSO becomes asymmetric under positive and negative phases of ENSO, with their correlation with ENSO index peaking at different times for post-El Nino and post-La Nina years. This asymmetric response is not captured by models, and the simulated responses for post-El Nino years are highly inconsistent across models as well as between models and AGR. Models therefore appear to have problems in simulating the biophysical mechanisms after El Nino years, mechanisms that are likely associated with anomalously dry conditions. As stronger and more frequent El Nino events are projected under climate change, these results suggest that model response to ENSO variability needs to be improved in order to robustly predict future climate-carbon interaction.",

            "abstract": "Air quality problems persist in the Northern Front-Range Metropolitan Area (NFRMA) of Colorado despite efforts to reduce emissions, and summertime ozone concentrations frequently exceed the NAAQS. Atmospheric modeling in the NFRMA is challenging due to the complex topography of the area, as well as diversity of pollutant sources (urban NOx and VOCs, power plants, oil and gas, agricultural emissions, biogenic emissions, and wildfires). An improved understanding of the local atmospheric chemistry will enable researchers to advance atmospheric models, which will subsequently be used to develop and test more effective air quality management strategies. The Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE) investigates this problem through detailed examination of atmospheric chemistry in the NFRMA. Our project specifically explores the spatial variability in ozone (O3) concentration and dry deposition within the FRAPPE study area.\nOne source of uncertainty in atmospheric models is O3 flux, which varies spatially due to local meteorology and variation in ambient concentration and deposition velocity. Model grid cells typically range in size from 10-100 km and 100-500 km, for regional and global models, respectively, and accurate representations of an entire grid cell cannot always be achieved. Large spatial variability within a model grid cell can lead to poor estimates of trace-gas flux and concentration. Our research addresses this issue by measuring spatial variability in O3 flux using low-cost dry-deposition flux chambers.\nWe are measuring O3 and CO2 flux with 5 low-cost flux chambers and one eddy-covariance tower. The eddy-covariance tower is located at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory in Erie, CO. All 5 chambers are within a 8.3 x 6 km square, with one chamber collocated with the eddy-covariance tower, and the other 4 chambers at distances of 0.33, 1.14, 3.22, and 7.55 km from the tower. The largest distance between any two chambers is 8.5 km. All 5 chambers measure flux onto native grasslands across a range of natural variability in species and ecosystem productivity. Preliminary results show that ambient ozone concentrations and fluxes vary between sites. A detailed analysis of the variability in O3 fluxes and concentrations across measurement sites will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Fine-resolution descriptions of hydrologic variables are desirable for an improved investigation of regional-scale and watershed-scale phenomena. For example, fine-resolution soil moisture allows biogeochemical processes to be modeled at the desired mechanistic scales. However, direct deterministic simulations of fine-resolution land surface variables present many challenges, a prominent one of which is the high computational cost. To address this challenge, we propose the use of reduced-order modeling techniques, such as Gaussian process regression and polynomial chaos expansion, to directly emulate fine-resolution models. Dimension reduction techniques, such as proper orthogonal decomposition method, are further used to improve the efficiency of the resulting reduced order model (ROM). We also develop procedures to efficiently quantify the uncertainties in the ROM solutions.\nAlthough ROM, by definition, is computationally efficient, the construction of ROM can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive since we need to use many high-resolution solutions to train the ROM. In addition, high-dimensional regression models can have non-negligible computational demands. To address these computational challenges, we have developed a new parallel and scalable software framework for developing emulators for fine-resolution models. The framework allows ROM to be efficiently constructed from fine-resolution solutions and deployed on high-performance computing platforms. The framework utilizes some existing high-performance computing libraries such as PETSc (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation), SLEPc (Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computation) and Elemental.\nWe will demonstrate the accuracy of the ROMs we developed for two fine-resolution surface-subsurface models and the performance of our software framework.",

Freshwater demands of vegetative communities are variable depending on the composition of the community. Hence, changes to community structure from production crop introductions, non-native species invasions, and climate change, may have significant implications for freshwater availability. Understanding how vegetative community changes impact freshwater availability will allow for better management and forecasting of limited freshwater supplies. To better understand these dynamics, we investigated three small tropical atolls in the Phoenix Island Protected Area, Kiribati. Despite their close proximity, these islands receive varying amounts of rainfall, are host to different plant communities and two of the islands have abandoned coconut plantations. Using electromagnetic induction, ground penetrating radar, soil samples, climate and satellite data, we present preliminary estimates of vegetative water demand for different tropical plant communities.",

Using DFT+U calculations, we have investigated pressure induced state changes in Fe-bearing MgGeO3 perovskite and post-perovskite. Owing to the relatively larger atomic size of germanium compared to silicon, germanate phases have larger unit cell volume and interatomic distances than equivalent silicate phases at same pressures. As a result, all pressure induced state changes in iron occur at higher pressures in germanate phases than in the silicate ones, be it a spin state change or position change of (ferrous) iron in the perovskite cage.

We base model parameters primarily on the gravel-bedded middle Snake River near Marsing, Idaho. The heat budget is represented by an advection-dispersion-reaction equation with, in addition to radiative, evaporative, and sensible heat fluxes, a hyporheic flux term that models lateral flow from the main stream, through bars, and into alcoves and side channels. This term effectively introduces linear dispersion of water temperatures with respect to time, so that the magnitude of the hyporheic term in the heat budget is expected to scale with the ``hyporheic number,\" defined as , where is dimensionless hyporheic flow rate and is dimensionless mean residence time of water entering the hyporheic zone. Simulations varying the parameters for channel width and hyporheic flow indicate that, for a large river such as the middle Snake River, feasible changes in channel width would produce downstream changes in heat flux an order of magnitude larger than would relatively extreme changes in hyporheic number. Changes, such as reduced channel width and increased hyporheic number, that tend to reduce temperatures in the summer, when temperatures are increasing with time and downstream distance, actually tend to increase temperatures in the fall, when temperatures are decreasing with time and distance.",

            "abstract": "Software Defined Radio/Radar (SDR) platforms have become increasingly popular as researchers, hobbyists, and military seek more efficient and cost-effective means for radar construction and operation. SDR platforms, by definition, utilize a software-based interface for configuration in contrast to traditional, hard-wired platforms. In an effort to provide new and improved radar sensing capabilities, Penn State has been developing advanced instruments and technologies for future radars, with primary objectives of making such instruments more capable, portable, and more cost effective. This paper will describe the design and implementation of two low-cost radar systems and their deployment in ionospheric research at both low and mid-latitudes. One radar has been installed near Penn State campus, University Park, Pennsylvania (77.97°W, 40.70°N), to make continuous meteor observations and mid-latitude plasma irregularities. The second radar is being installed in Huancayo (12.05°S, -75.33°E), Peru, which is capable of detecting E and F region plasma irregularities as well as meteor reflections. In this paper, we examine and compare the diurnal and seasonal variability of specular, non- specular, and head-echoes collected with these two new radar systems and discuss sampling biases of each meteor observation technique. We report our current efforts to validate and calibrate these radar systems with other VHF radars such as Jicamarca and SOUSY. We also present the general characteristics of continuous measurements of E-region and F-region coherent echoes using these modern radar systems and compare them with coherent radar events observed at other geographic mid-latitude radar stations.",

            "abstract": "Among the biases in the tropical Pacific that are common in the climate models, two stand out. One is the excessive cold-tongue in the mean state---the pool of the cold water that is normally in the eastern tropical Pacific extends too far to the west. The other is the underestimate of the asymmetry of El Nino-Southern Oscillation—the fact that El Nino and La Nina are more or less a mirror image of each other in the models while they are not so in the observations. Results from an analysis from CMIP5 models, forced ocean GCM experiments, as well as an analytical model are presented to suggest that these two common biases in our state-of-the-art models are linked. Specifically, an excessive cold-tongue in the mean climatological state makes the ENSO system more stable and thus leads to a more symmetric ENSO, while a more symmetric ENSO in turn results in less nonlinear heating from the ENSO events to the cental equatorial Pacific which in turn contributes to the development of an excessive cold-tongue. The finding underscores that errors in the mean state and ENSO tend to reinforce each other and thus explains why it has been difficult to simulate the tropical Pacific climate. Further comparison with observations suggests that these two biases are the symptoms of a single structural inadequacy in the models: a weak dynamical coupling between the atmosphere and ocean which puts the ENSO system in the models to a different dynamic regime than the obsereved. Measures that may help push the models closer to the observations are suggested.",

            "abstract": "Approximately one hundred years of daily precipitation data have been analyzed at thirteen stations in California. Seasonal markovian stochastic models accounting for daily occurrence and depth are constructed using a generalized linear modeling framework. A probit link function is used to model the seasonally varying probability of daily precipitation, and a reciprocal link is used to model the (seasonally varying) mean of a gamma distribution for daily\nprecipitation depth. Short-term memory is accounted for with lagged indicator variables of precipitation occurrence. In this framework, the model is flexible enough to well capture the variability of daily precipitation, and its parameters are readily estimated using standard methods. Simulated realizations of centuries of daily data, however, do not capture the measured variance of precipitation at seasonal to annual time scales, indicating that low frequency variations in the underlying processes are present, which, by construct, are not accounted for. To account for this a clustering algorithm is developed that separates the years of data into distinct clusters (with associated parameters) in an optimal fashion with respect to the likelihood of the fitted generalized linear models. Typically three clusters are found to adequately be able to reproduce the aggregated (i.e. annual) rainfall statistics (e.g. the variance and also the probability distribution of annual rainfall). The final estimated models are again used to simulate hundreds of ensembles of the last century of rainfall, and are used to assess how unusual, or not, the calendar year 2013 drought was. At 10 of 13 stations, the annual 2013 rainfall was not statistically unusual, in the sense that a year as dry as 2013 would be expected to occur at least once in each century in ten percent of the ensembles. At 3 stations, however, the simulations reproduced 2013 levels of rainfall (in each simulated century) less than ten percent of the time. From these preliminary results, we conclude that the null hypothesis, i.e. that 2013 precipitation was produced by the same stochastic process as has occurred for the past 100 years, is rejected at the p=0.1 level at 3 stations.",

Because of competing effects between equilibrium and kinetic fractionation small variations in 17O-excess can be used, for example, to (i) infer changes in temperature and sea ice across glacial-interglacial cycles in Antarctica (Schoenemann et al., 2014), (ii) study the role of rain re-evaporation during convective events thereby improving the incorporation of isotopes into GCMs (Landais et al., 2010), and (iii) assess the role of stratospheric water vapor intrusions at high altitudes or in polar regions (Winkler et al., 2013).\nIn natural waters, variability in 17O-excess is very small (on the order of tens of per meg, where 1 per meg is 0.001‰). Until recently, only measurements made via Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) could achieve the required precision, following time-consuming front-end chemistry that converted H2O into O2 for analysis of m/z+ 32, 33 and 34. Recent improvements in laser-based spectroscopy, e.g., Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS), are enabling quicker and easier measurement of 17O-excess in water (Steig et al., 2013; 2014). The Picarro L2140-i is certified with a precision of ≤ 0.015‰; however implementation of best practices can result in an achievable precision of ≤ 0.008‰, thereby demonstrating comparable performance to IRMS. We will review our recommendations for achieving high-precision measurements of 17O-excess on the Picarro L2140-i, including how to calibrate the system, the frequency of standards analysis, the number of replicate injections and vials required, and approaches to dealing with sample-to-sample memory. We will also compare the external accuracy achieved by three distinct Picarro L2140-i analyzers for multiple waters with distinct isotopic composition.",

Ancient plant specimens preserved within packrat middens are invaluable in this context since they allow for comparisons between co-occurring plant lineages. Here we used modern and ancient plant specimens preserved within packrat middens from the Snake Range, NV to investigate the physiological responses of a mixed montane conifer community to global change since the last glacial maximum. We used a conceptual model to infer relative changes in stomatal conductance and maximum photosynthetic capacity from measures of leaf carbon isotopes, stomatal characteristics, and leaf nitrogen content. Our results indicate that most of the sampled taxa decreased stomatal conductance and/or photosynthetic capacity from glacial to modern times. However, plant families differed in the timing and magnitude of these physiological responses. Additionally, leaf-level responses were more similar within plant families than within co-occurring species assemblages. This suggests that adaptation at the level of leaf physiology may not be the main determinant of shifts in community composition, and that plant evolutionary history may drive physiological adaptation to global change over recent geologic time.",

            "abstract": "Surface albedo provides an important climate regulating ecosystem service, particularly in the mid-latitudes where seasonal snow cover influences surface radiation budgets. In the case of substantial seasonal snow cover, the influence of albedo can equal or surpass the climatic benefits of carbon sequestration from forest growth. Climate mitigation platforms should therefore consider albedo in their framework in order to integrate these two climatic services in an economic context for the effective design and implementation of forest management projects. Over the next century, the influence of surface albedo is projected to diminish under higher emissions scenarios due to an overall decrease in snow depth and duration of snow cover in the mid-latitudes. In this study, we focus on the change in economic value of winter albedo in the northeastern United States projected through 2100 using the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) a1 and b1 scenarios. Statistically downscaled temperature and precipitation are used as input to the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to provide future daily snow depth fields through 2100. Using VIC projections of future snow depth, projected winter albedo fields over deforested lands were generated using an empirical logarithmic relationship between snow depth and albedo derived from a volunteer network of snow observers in New Hampshire over the period Nov 2011 through 2014. Our results show that greater reductions in snow depth and the number of winter days with snow cover in the a1 compared to the b1 scenario reduce wintertime albedo when forested lands are harvested. This result has implications on future trade-offs among albedo, carbon storage, and timber value that should be investigated in greater detail. The impacts of forest harvest on radiative forcing associated with energy redistribution (e.g., latent heat and surface roughness length) should also be considered in future work.",

Terrain elevation profiles of cross-sections across the arcs show a distinct vertical rising and falling in elevations of hundreds of meters over a horizontal distance of tens of kilometers. It is hypothesized that these sizable arcs and associated rim-like topographic terrain features are remnants of huge meteorite impact craters with diameters ranging from 770 km to 1,310 km, thus forming potentially the largest known impact carter structures discovered on Earth today. The potential impact crater rim structures are located north of the eastern Amazon River, in the coastal region of Recife and Natal, and in the Brazilian, Bolivian and Paraguayan border region encompassing the Pantanal. Elevation profiles, hillshades and gray-shaded elevation maps were produced to support the geomorphologic analysis. It is also speculated whether in three of the four potential impact craters, central uplift domes or peaks, which are typical for complex impact crater structures can be identified. The worlds largest iron ore mining area of Carajás in Para, Brazil, falls exactly in the center of the largest hypothesized circular impact crater showing topographic elevations similar to the rim structure discovered 655 km to the north-north-west. Based on the topographic/geomorphologic driven hypothesis, geologic exploration of these topographic features is needed to test whether indeed meteorite impact craters could be verified, what the more exact ellipsoidal shapes of the potential impact craters might be, and to determine when during geologic times the impacts would have taken place. The propsoed talk based on the topographic evidence shall stimulate that discussion.",

Here we report combined SHRIMP chemical analyses and U-Pb geochronology on zircon from a suite of ten samples from depths of 26–148 mbsf in ODP Hole 894G, and one sample from IODP Hole U1415N.\nU-Pb zircon dating of gabbro, olivine gabbro, gabbronorite and olivine gabbronorite (1-10% oxide) collected from Hole 894G yield 230Th-corrected 206U/238Pb ages from 1.090 to 1.311 Ma with errors as low as 2.5%. In the uppermost 40 m of Hole 894G the one zircon-bearing sample yielded a date of 1.211±0.041Ma (MSWD =0.07). The next five sample dates from 50-100mbsf are older, with a weighted mean age of 1.281±0.019 Ma (MSWD=1.19). In the deepest section between 100-150 mbsf, two zircon-bearing samples have a weighted mean age of 1.234±0.050Ma (MSWD=3.5). These changes in zircon age (at ~40 and 100 mbsf) coincide with marked petrologic, textural and geochemical variations. Together with petrologic observations, these Pb/U dates define 3 macro-units, each tens of meters thick, showing no systematic pattern of age downhole. The range of zircon solidus dates implies this ~120m (true thickness) of fast spread crust was constructed over a protracted period of time (≥ 70ka), as thin pulses of magma emplaced randomly with depth, via a ‘piecemeal’ mode of crustal accretion.\nThe one sample of lower crust hosting zircon sampled from IODP Hole U1415N (olivine- and orthopyroxene-bearing gabbro w/ 0.5% oxide) yields a weighted mean solidus age of 1.321± 0.097Ma (MSWD 1.06).\nZircon chemistry is variable between samples downhole. Ti and Hf concentrations from spot analyses within individual samples range from tight clusters to linear trends of decreasing Ti with increasing Hf. Measured Ti concentrations in all zircon from 894G vary from 5 to 50 ppm (mean 23 ppm); calculated Ti-in-zircon temperatures vary by sample (Tmean= 783°; Tmax= 864°; Tmin =680°), with intrasample temperature ranges from 40-165°C (DTmean= 120°C). Zircons from U1415N have measured Ti concentrations of 19-50 ppm (calculated Tmean= 829°; Tmax= 966°; Tmin=777°; DT=189°C), consistent with the more primitive chemistry of this lower crustal sample.",

            "abstract": "Damming the natural flow regime is responsible to drive away native species from the aquatic ecosystem and it becomes potentially damaging when it concerns the drought-prone areas in particular. Drought cycles are common in the Great Plains, which have given native fish species adapted strategies for coping with extreme variation in flow regimes. However, native populations have crashed as these stream networks became heavily fragmented beginning in the post-depression water reclamation era and continued into the 1960’s boom in flood control dam construction.\nThis study is an attempt to understand and assess the cumulative impacts of river network fragmentation and climate change on the river ecosystem, geomorphology and hydrology of the Smoky-Hill River Basin of North-West Kansas. The vast majority of the basin does not overly significant groundwater resources and is thus reliant on water supplied from precipitation, runoff, and shallow alluvial storage zones strongly connected to surface water systems, which is now fragmented by the construction of both small farm-ponds as well as big flood reservoir structures. Thus, there is a high probability of stream network segments to be dissociated (from the main channel during dry periods) and/or completely depleted (in case of a series of drought cycles) in this area. This paper would identify such vulnerable network segments and assess the impact of extreme climatic conditions – as a single event or scenario of cyclic droughts that can drive the native fishes out of the Smoky-Hill River Basin – by comparing modeled future flow regime projections with historic flow regimes in the fragmented river structure. The study will further address structural and functional connectivity of the river and would contribute to the understanding of fragmentation and its effect to the stream ecology at a higher scale, where a larger aquatic population can get affected by a single drought event.",

Quality-controlled high-resolution climatologies that retain many critical mesoscale hydrographic features (such as persistent oceanic fronts, topographically controlled quasi-stationary meanders, etc.) become suitable for climate-scale interpretation through meaningful comparison between observations and high-resolution ocean model output. Leveraging the regularly sampled, synoptic depiction of the ocean contained in the model output we can assess the undersampled high-frequency variability contained in the quality controlled observational record that is inherently aliased into the climatology to discern longer period oscillations, differences, and trends. We couple the recently developed Arctic, Northwest Atlantic and Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Seas regional climatologies (with grid resolution of 1/10-degree–the highest regional resolution so far), with synergistic analyses of output from a data-assimilating ocean numerical model. By comparing the climatological fields with the model output, the authors explore the ability to quantify the relations between modeled and observed regional ocean variability, including the decadal-scale climatology differences that will focus on and may reflect AMOC long-term fluctuations.",

            "abstract": "While it is well-known from simulations and observations that cold pools play a key role in the triggering of deep convection, the question remains as to whether this forcing is primarily dynamical or thermodynamical in nature. We address this question by decomposing vertical forces into the dynamic pressure force and effective buoyancy of Davies-Jones (2003), and then apply this to cloud-resolving simulations of deep convection. We find that dynamical forces dominate the triggering, give physical explanations for why this should be, and compare to a shallow convection scenario where the force balance may be different. The thermodynamical properties of cold pools also turn out to play a key role, however, in that the lofted air often comes from mature `warm pools’ whose gust fronts are anomalously warm and moist, as emphasized by Tompkins (2001).",

            "abstract": "Boulders can be found on many coastlines around the globe. They are generally thought to be moved either during coastal storms or tsunamis because they are too heavy to be moved by more common marine or coastal processes. To understand storm and tsunami risk at given coastline, the event histories of both events need to be separated to produce a robust event statistics for quantitative risk analyses. Because boulders are most likely only moved by coastal storms or tsunamis, they are very suitable to produce the data basis for such event statistics.\nBoulder transport problem has been approached by comparing the driving with resisting forces acting on a boulder. However, we argue that this approach is not sufficient because the comparison of resisting and driving forces only constitutes boulder motion, but not for boulder dislodgment. Boulder motion means that the boulder starts to move out of its pocket. However, this motion does not guarantee that the boulder will reach the critical dislodgment position. Boulder dislodgment is a necessary condition to identify whether or not a boulder has moved. For boulder dislodgement, an equation of motion is needed, and that equation is Newtons Second Law of Motion (NSL). We perform fully coupled three-dimensional numerical simulation of boulders moved by waves where the boulders move according to NSL.\nOur numerical simulations are the first of their kind applied to tsunami and storm boulder motion. They show how storm and tsunami waves interact with boulders in a more realistic physical setting, and highlight the importance of submergence. Based on our simulations we perform a dimensional analysis that identifies the Froude number as important parameter, which can be considered large only in the front of tsunami waves, but small in the rest of tsunami wave and also generally small in storm waves. From a general point of view, our results indicate that the boulder transport problem is more complex than recently considered, and more variables need to be considered in inversions of the wave characteristics from moved boulders. However, numerical simulations are an incredible powerful and flexible tool with which more robust and more correct techniques to invert wave characteristics from moved boulders can be developed. Our analyses of the Froude number and submergence are positive indicators.",

This requires a better use of sophisticated visualization techniques to both forward the information and to follow the corresponding flow of information.\nA particular case of interest is the question of resilience to extreme weather events that also relies on increasing awareness of urban communities.\nThis research looks at the development of exploration techniques of unstructured Big Data. Indeed access to information on environmental and climate sciences has hugely increased in terms of variety and quantity, as a consequence of different factors, among others the development of public relations by research institutes and the pervasive role of digital media (Bucchi 2013; Trench 2008). We are left with unthinkable amounts of information from blogs, social networks postings, public speeches, press releases, articles, etc. It is possible now to explore and visualize patterns followed by digital information with the support of automated analysis tools. On the other hand these techniques can provide important insights on how different techniques of visual communication can impact on urban resilience to extreme weather.\nThe selected case studies correspond to several research projects under the umbrella of the Chair “Hydrology for resilient cities” aimed to develop and test new solutions in urban hydrology that will contribute to the resilience of our cities to extreme weather. These research projects – ranging from regional projects (e.g. RadX@IdF), European projects (e.g. Blue Green Dream and RainGain), to worldwide collaborations (e.g. TOMACS) – include awareness raising and capacity building activities aimed to foster cooperation between scientists, professionals, and beneficiaries.\nThis presentation will explore how visualization techniques can be used in the above mentioned projects in order to support outreach activities as well as to illustrate the impact of digital communication on urban resilience.",

            "abstract": "After a 10 years cruise the Rosetta probe has reached its final target, the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The main objectives of the mission are to gain more knowledge of the composition, the origin and formation of comets and the solar system.\nAfter extensive remote exploration of the comet the lander Philae will be separated to land on the comet surface, starting immediately examining its landing site with its scientific payload. Part of this payload is the APXS (Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer). It will measure in situ the chemical composition of the comet's surface and it's changes during the journey of the comet towards the sun. APXS is a combination of two spectrometers in one single instrument. It will irradiate the comet surface using Curium 244 sources, which are emitting alpha-particle and X-rays. In the alpha-mode the instrument uses alpha backscattering spectroscopy to detect lower Z elements like C, N and O and groups of elements with higher Z. In the X-ray mode alpha particle / X-ray induced X-ray spectroscopy (XRF) will allow the detection of most of the higher Z elements from Na up to Ni and above. Both modes will be always run in parallel allowing to determine lower and higher Z elements simultaneously.\nFor 3 years the solar powered Rosetta probe had to pass a hibernation phase because of a long passage far away to the sun. After wakeup in January 2014 an extensive test phase of all instruments and subsystems has been performed, including the APXS. After landing on the comet an intense initial measurement phase of all instruments is planned, the First Science Sequence (FSS). It will be followed by a long term science phase (LTS). As long as possible APXS and the other instruments will continue to measure and monitor the changes and increasing activity of the comet during its journey towards the inner region of the solar system.The project is funded by the German Space Agency DLR under contracts 50 QP 0404 and 50 QP 0902.\n",

            "abstract": "The hydrological and biogeochemical processes at the groundwater and river water interface are largely controlled by the exchange dynamics between the two water bodies. Accurate characterization of the heterogeneous permeability field at such interface is critical for modeling the bulk flow as well as the biogeochemical processes that are coupled with the flow. Taking advantage of the distinct conductivities in groundwater and rive water, time lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) can provide rich spatial and temporal data for characterizing the permeability field, by imaging the change in subsurface electric conductivity driven by river water intrusion and retreat. We installed a large-scale (300 m by 300 m) 3-dimensional ERT array to monitor river water intrusion and retreat through time at a major river corridor, and the 4-dimensional electrical geophysical data is assimilated to invert for the underlying permeability field using ensemble-based algorithms (e.g., ensemble Kalman filter and ensemble smoother). We developed a new high-performance hydrogeophysical code by coupling an ERT imaging code E4D (Johnson et al., 2010) with a site-scale flow and transport code, PFLOTRAN (Hammond et al., 2012). The coupled code provides the key modeling capability of multi-physics processes, parallel efficiency, and multi-realization simulation capability for hydrogeophysical inversion. We assimilated both well-based point measurements of water table and specific conductance and spatially continuous ERT images in a sequential Bayesian way. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of joint hydrogeophysical inversion for large-scale characterization of subsurface properties in the groundwater and river water interaction zone. Our investigation of spatial versus temporal data assimilation strategies have inspired systematic data worth analyses to identify the most valuable data sets for hydrogeophysical inversion. The high performance computing is performed on the Hopper supercomputer at NERSC. The main scientific achievements of this study are to integrate multiscale and multi-type data with increasingly complex multi-physics model through Bayesian data assimilation techniques, and to handle the intensive computational demands by using high performance computing resources.",

Much of the non-equilibrium problem is simplified by removal of the thermodynamic forces of temperature and charge gradients, although it is also complicated by stress and strain due to mantle-scale stresses and grain-scale density changes. Our goal is to approximate the chemical evolution of a non-equilibrium mineral assemblage undergoing continuous melting and solid-state phase transformations. It is then easy to model disequilibrium chemical evolution of trace elements which naturally include complicated geometry-dependent interactions between grains, grains and liquid, and phase transformations within grains. Grain-scale models may be coupled to mantle-scale geodynamic models by having grain-scale models represent the mantle at Lagrangian points within the mantle-scale model. All bulk geophysical properties, mineralogy, anisotropy, and geochemical budgets can be evaluated at the grain scale in a non-equilibrium framework for a given point in a mantle-scale model. Robustness of the coupled model depends primarily on the treatment of open-system melt advection, the number and distribution of grain-scale models, and interpolation schemes.",

These studies have concluded that global N2O inventories such as EDGAR may be underestimating the true U.S. anthropogenic N2O source by a factor of 3 or more. However, simple back-of-the-envelope calculations show that emissions of this magnitude are difficult to reconcile with the basic constraints of the global N2O budget. Here, we explore some possible reasons why regional atmospheric inversions might overestimate the U.S. agricultural N2O source. First, the seasonality of N2O agricultural sources is not well known, but can have an important influence on inversion results, particularly when the inversions are based on data that are concentrated in the spring/summer growing season. Second, boundary conditions can strongly influence regional inversions but the boundary conditions used may not adequately account for remote influences on surface data such as the seasonal stratospheric influx of N2O-depleted air. We will present a set of forward model simulations, using the Community Land Model (CLM) and two atmospheric chemistry tracer transport models, MOZART and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), that examine the influence of terrestrial emissions and atmospheric chemistry and dynamics on atmospheric variability in N2O at U.S. and global monitoring sites.\n ",

Although Devonian strata along the Atlantic Seaboard are thought to be deposited in marine environments, the depositional environments of the Chattanooga Shale remain controversial. In particular, it remains unknown why much fewer fossils have been found in outcrops located in northeastern Alabama relative to the outcrops elsewhere. We hypothesized that the fossil scarcity may be due to more depleted oxygen conditions during the shale deposition in Alabama than at other locations. We collected samples from two outcrops of the Chattanooga Shale which are respectively located near Fort Payne and Collinsville in northeastern Alabama, where nearly complete stratigraphic successions from the underlying Silurian Red Mountain Formation to the overlying Mississippian Maury Formation were found. These two outcrops share similar sedimentological features (e.g., thinly laminated fissile grayish and black shale layers in the lower part and nearly homogeneous black blocky shale in the upper part) which indicate a transition from shallow to deep water environments. Based on the TOC concentrations (2.8-12.0 wt%) and Rock-Eval pyrolysis data (HI: 19.5±13.5; OI: 6.5±2.5; S1: 0.24±0.06 mg HC/g; S2: 2.8±1.1 mg HC/g; S3: 2.1±0.4 mg CO2/g), kerogen in these outcrops is classified as type I-II, which may be found in lacustrine and marine settings.

            "abstract": "Independent measurements of volume and sound velocity of basaltic glass (BCR-2) were made up to 5 GPa at room temperature by X-ray microtomography (HPXMT) and GHz- ultrasonic interferometry, respectively. These results are used to constrain bulk and shear moduli, and demonstrate that basaltic glass violates Birch’s law as found for vitreous silica and other network glasses. Specifically for basalt, there is a 12% increase in density from 0 - 4.5 GPa, while P- and S-wave velocities decrease by 2.8 and 7.2%, respectively over the same pressure range. At higher pressures a positive correlation exists between density, and P- and S-wave velocities. There is no detectable frequency dependence for P- and S-wave velocities between 1-2 GHz, and velocities determined on compression and decompress are identical within uncertainties demonstrating fully elastic behavior up to at least 5 GPa. We find the pressure of P- and S-wave velocity minima for basaltic glass are ~2 GPa higher than for vitreous silica. We further find that overall velocity reductions approaching the minima are more modest than for vitreous silica and posit that this behavior reflects network flexibility approaching the effective locking limit during compression.  Expansion of the pressure range of anomalous behavior coupled with the more modest overall velocity reduction relative to silica is attributed to the more depolymerized (disordered) structure of basaltic glass. We postulate that the velocity decrease observed in basaltic glass extends into the liquid state consistent with the recent work of Sakamai et al. (2013) and Sanloup et al. (2013). If this is true, the effect of melt on decreasing seismic velocities will be greater than currently assumed, and thus estimates of melt fraction in the upper mantle from velocity anomalies may be overestimated.\nT.

NWS Alaska Region leadership has developed plans for a significant enhancement to our operational forecast and decision support capabilities in Alaska to address the emerging requirements of the Arctic: An Arctic Test Bed.\nHistorically, the complexity of forecast operations and the inherent challenges in Alaska have not been addressed well by the R&D programs and projects that support the CONUS regions of the NWS. In addition, there are unique science,technology, and support challenges (e.g., sea ice forecasts and arctic drilling prospects) and opportunities (Bilateral agreements with Canada, Russia, and Norway) that would best be worked through Alaska operations. A dedicated test bed will provide a mechanism to transfer technology, research results, and observations advances into operations in a timely and effective manner in support of Weather Ready Nation goals and to enhance decision support services in Alaska.\nA NOAA Arctic Test Bed will provide a crucial nexus for ensuring NOAA’s developers understand Alaska’s needs, which are often cross disciplinary (atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and hydrologic), to improve NOAA’s responsiveness to its Arctic-related science and service priorities among the NWS and OAR (CPO and ESRL), and enable better leveraging of other research initiatives and data sources external to NOAA, including academia, other government agencies, and the private sector, which are particular to the polar region (e.g., WWRP Polar Prediction Project).

            "abstract": "The environmental impact of coal mining and burning of coal is evident and generally easy to understand. However, students often struggle to understand the social impacts of coal mining. A jigsaw activity culminating in a mock town hall meeting helps students link social, economic and environmental impacts of coal mining. Students are divided into four groups and assigned the task of researching the environmental, social, economic or health impacts of coal mining in West Virginia. When students have completed the research, they are assigned a role for the town hall. Roles include local community members, direct employees of the coal industry, business owners from industries related to coal mining, and environmentalists. One student from each research area is assigned to each role, forcing students to consider environmental, social, health and economic aspects of coal mining in choosing an appropriate position for their role. Students have 30 minutes to prepare their positions and then present for 2-5 minutes in the simulated town hall. We then have open class discussion and review the positions. Finally, students are required to write a letter to the editor of the local paper. The specific topic for the town hall and letters can be varied based on current events and could include new regulations on power plants, mine safety, government funding of alternative energy supplies or a range of other topics. This approach forces students to consider all aspects of the issue. In addition, because students have to assume a role, they are more aware of the direct impact that coal mining has on individuals’ lives.",

            "abstract": "Particles in Saturn’s rings are engaged in a constant tug-of-war between interparticle gravitational and adhesive forces that lead to clumping, on the one hand, and Keplerian shear that inhibits accretion on the other. Depending on the surface mass density of the rings and the local orbital velocity, ephemeral clumps or self-gravity wakes can form, giving the rings granularity on the scale of the most-unstable length scale against gravitational collapse. The A ring and many regions of the B ring are dominated by self-gravity wakes with a typical radial wavelength of ~50-100 m. A characteristic of self-gravity wakes is that they can effectively shadow the relatively empty spaces in between them, depending on viewing geometry. This leads to geometry-dependent measurements of optical depth in occultations of the rings. The C ring and Cassini Division have significantly lower surface mass densities than the A and B ring such that in most of these regions the most-unstable wavelength is comparable to the size of the ring particles (~1 m) so that self-gravity wake formation is not expected nor have its characteristics in various measurements been observed. Here we present measurements of the optical depth of the C ring and Cassini Division with the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) showing variations with viewing geometry in the “ramp” regions and the Cassini Division “triple band”. These variations are characteristic of self-gravity wakes. We place limits on clumping in other regions of the C ring and Cassini Division.",

            "abstract": "With the growing number of available climate simulations, the capacity of end users to process and interpret all this information in vulnerability, impact and adaptation studies becomes limited. At the same time, for an organization providing climate scenarios and services, it is important to provide scenarios that will ensure comparable and coherent decision making across various projects, while still addressing their particularities. Here, the choices and challenges related to the production of a standard climate scenarios ensemble are presented. The resulting ensemble should be standard in terms of climate simulations used and post-processing methods applied. Furthermore, the uncertainty present in the full original ensemble should be appropriately represented for all time horizons, spatial locations and scales, and variables. Starting from the CMIP5 ensemble, an objective selection of simulations is done using cluster analysis. Biases in climate simulations are characterized and simple post-processing methods are used to correct those biases, with particular interest in preserving the effects of natural variability. With such a standard climate scenarios ensemble, it is possible to provide condensed, but still adequate, climate information accompanied by a well-documented methodology. These products, with related knowledge transfer associated to underlying uncertainties, as well as interactions with end users form the basis for successful adaptation decisions.",

These events, often related to coronal mass ejections, can be disruptive to ionospheric communications, destructive to satellites, and pose a health risk to astronauts. To develop a useful forecast for the onset time and peak flux of SEP events, we are examining the radio burst, proton, and electron properties associated with the SEPs of the current solar cycle. Using the Wind/WAVES radio observations from 2010–2013, we analyzed the 123 decametric-hectometric type II solar radio burst properties, the associated type III burst properties, and their correlation with SEP properties determined from analysis of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) observations. Through a principal component and logistic regression analyses, we find that the radio properties alone can be used to predict the occurrence of an SEP event with a false alarm rate of 17%, a probability of detection of 65%, and with 88% of the classifications correct. We also explore the use of the > 2 MeV electron flux to forecast proton peak flux and event onset time, with preliminary results suggesting a correlation between the peak electron and proton flux.",

            "abstract": "The detection of benzene at ppm levels in Titan’s atmosphere[1] by Cassini’s Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) has enforced the idea that aromatic and heteroaromatic reaction pathways may play an important role in Titan’s atmospheric chemistry, especially in the formation of aerosols. Indeed, Trainer et al.[2] showed that aromatic molecules are easily dissociated by ultraviolet radiation and can therefore contribute significantly to aerosol formation. Sebree et al. [3] used such a mixture of low concentration aromatic and/or heteroaromatic molecules (benzene, naphthalene, pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline) to produce aerosol analogs and then analyzed their far infrared absorption spectra. Their study shows that such aerosols can reproduce some spectral features observed by Cassini’s Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS) in the far infrared below 500cm-1 [4]. Aerosols absorption at such a low wavenumbers most likely results from lattice resonances within their structure[4,5], and this might be influenced by the temperature of the sample. In this work we investigated the influence of temperature on the absorption spectra of the aerosol samples studied in Sebree et al.[4]. We recorded spectra at 100K and 300K and this revealed variations in the total absorption with temperature, but no new absorption features were observed. Through this investigation we have also found an unexpected strong absorption band of cooled Silicon in the far infrared, which has never been reported in the literature.\n[1] Waite et al.

In the environmental sciences, CT is an efficient tool for the nondestructive inspection of sediment and soil cores. However, in order to extract parameters describing such properties as pore space and solid-phase distribution, the imaged volume must be segmented according to relevant categories. When done manually by image inspection, segmentation produces results that are often inconsistent, and applying the method over multiple images may be impractical. Modern machine learning techniques have been shown to be more accurate than humans at some vision tasks in fields of histology and remote sensing, and those techniques may be useful for environmental samples. We present a technique using deep learning to categorize a tomographic volume into solid and pore regions, while also identifying morphologically similar solid-phase regions within the imaged object. Finally, we show how the composition of these characteristic solid constituents may be estimated by propagating two dimensional XRF data through the segmented volume.

The Mekong Basin is subject to large hydrological fluctuations on a seasonal and inter-annual basis. The basin remains prone to severe annual floods that continue to cause widespread damage and endanger food security and the livelihood of the millions who dwell in the region. Also the placement of newly planned dams primarily for hydropower in the Lower Mekong Basin may cause damaging social, agriculture and fisheries impacts to the region where we may now likely be at a critical ‘tipping point’. The primary goal of this project is to apply NASA and USGS products, tools, and information for improved flood and water management in the Lower Mekong River Basin to help characterize, understand, and predict future changes on the basin. Specifically, we are providing and helping transfer to the Mekong River Commission (MRC) and the member countries of Thailand, Cambodia, Lao, Vietnam, and Burma the enhanced Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) using remotely sensed surface, ground water, and root zone soil moisture along with improved Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps. In order to estimate the flood potential and constrain the SWAT Available Water Capacity model parameter over the region, we are assimilated GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage observations into the Catchment Land Surface Model. In addition, a Graphic Visualization Tool (GVT) as been developed to work in concert with the output of the SWAT model parameterized for the Mekong Basin as an adjunct tool of the MRC Decision Support Framework. The project requires a close coordination of the development and assessment of the enhanced MRC SWAT with the guidance of MRC resource managers and technical advisors. This presentation will evaluate the skill of the enhanced SWAT model using qualitative (i.e., MODIS change detection) and quantitative (e.g., streamflow) metrics over one sub-basin of the Lower Mekong River Basin.",

            "abstract": "The apparent lack of entrenchment on Martian fan deltas has been hitherto uniquely interpreted as evidence for fast disappearance of water and used to support the hypothesis of an abrupt climate change on Mars around 3.7-3.4 Ga. However, hi-res imagery and topography of several martian fan deltas show evidence of erosion and entrenchment in response to decreasing water level settings. Moreover, the boundary conditions for entrenchment have never been investigated from a quantitative point of view. To gain a quantitative understanding on fan delta entrenchment processes, we are studying (using remote sensing, modeling, and fieldwork campaigns) a series of seven stacked fan deltas formed at Lake General Carrera/Buenos Aires (Chile/Argentina). The uppermost deposit is located more than 400 m above the lowest delta presently forming at the current lake water level. The six raised deltas formed during highstands punctuating the overall 15000 yrs long retreat of the lake and are entirely entrenched thus allowing potential sampling over the entire thickness of the sedimentary sequences. These windows to the internal outcrops enable the assessment of water and sediment paleo-discharges (based on the analysis of the grain sizes) and to implement numerical simulations to reproduce the sedimentary deposits using numeric code such as Sedflux 2.0 (Hutton and Syvitski, 2008). The studied sedimentary assemblage offers the unique opportunity to place constraints on the fan deltas entrenchment with strong implications for the modeling of martian entrenched fans and thus for the understanding of the paleoclimate and paleohydrology during their terminal activity. We present the results of remote sensing study from satellite hi-res imagery and topography, numerical modeling, and from a survey field campaign.\nE. W. H. Hutton and J. P. M.

In order to properly address the needs of NGSS, this conversation is being expanded to include engineers. Our initial efforts include a series of semi-structured interviews with a dozen engineers involved in different aspects of space science and mission development. We will present the responses from the survey and compare this information to our knowledge base about space scientists, their needs, attitudes, and understandings of E/PO. In addition to a new emphasis on engineering in the NGSS, we also consider engineering habits of mind such as systems thinking, creativity, optimism, collaboration, communication, and attention to ethical considerations as described by an NRC policy document for engineering education. Using the overall results, we will consider strategies, further ideas for investigation, and possible steps for going forward with this important aspect of including engineering in education and outreach programming.",

            "abstract": "Micro-scale modeling of multiphase flow in porous media is critical to characterize porous materials. Several modeling techniques have been implemented to date, but none can be used as a general strategy for all porous media applications due to challenges presented by non-smooth high-curvature and deformable solid surfaces, and by a wide range of pore sizes and porosities. Finite approaches like the finite volume method require a high quality, problem-dependent mesh, while particle-based approaches like the lattice Boltzmann require too many particles to achieve a stable meaningful solution. Both come at a large computational cost. Other methods such as pore network modeling (PNM) have been developed to accelerate the solution process by simplifying the solution domain, but so far a unique and straightforward methodology to implement PNM is lacking.\nPore topology method (PTM) is a new topologically consistent approach developed to simulate multiphase flow in porous media. The core of PTM is to reduce the complexity of the 3-D void space geometry by working with its medial surface as the solution domain. Medial surface is capable of capturing all the corners and surface curvatures in a porous structure, and therefore provides a topologically consistent representative geometry for porous structure. Despite the simplicity and low computational cost, PTM provides a fast and straightforward approach for micro-scale modeling of fluid flow in all types of porous media irrespective of their porosity and pore size distribution.\nIn our previous work, we developed a non-iterative fast medial surface finder algorithm to determine a voxel-wide medial surface of the void space of porous media as well as a set of simple rules to determine the capillary pressure-saturation curves for a porous system assuming quasi-static two-phase flow with a planar w-nw interface. Our simulation results for a highly porous fibrous material and polygonal capillary tubes were in excellent agreement with available experimental and analytical data.\nIn the current study, we expand the simulation rules to include phenomena such as interface merging at intersections, and converging/diverging flow paths. We also assess capabilities of PTM to compute the permeability of a porous system; and to simulate two-phase flow in swelling porous media.",

            "abstract": "Extreme precipitation events can cause significant impacts to drinking water and wastewater utilities, including facility damage, water quality impacts, service interruptions and potential risks to human health and the environment due to localized flooding and combined sewer overflows (CSOs). These impacts will become more pronounced with the projected increases in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events due to climate change.\nTo model the impacts of extreme precipitation events, wastewater utilities often develop Intensity, Duration, and Frequency (IDF) rainfall curves and “design storms” for use in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Wastewater utilities use SWMM for planning, analysis, and facility design related to stormwater runoff, combined and sanitary sewers, and other drainage systems in urban and non-urban areas. SWMM tracks (1) the quantity and quality of runoff made within each sub‐catchment; and (2) the flow rate, flow depth, and quality of water in each pipe and channel during a simulation period made up of multiple time steps.\nIn its current format, EPA SWMM does not consider climate change projection data. Climate change may affect the relationship between intensity, duration, and frequency described by past rainfall events. Therefore, EPA is integrating climate projection data available in the Climate Resilience Evaluation and Awareness Tool (CREAT) into SWMM. CREAT is a climate risk assessment tool for utilities that provides downscaled climate change projection data for changes in the amount of rainfall in a 24-hour period for various extreme precipitation events (e.g., from 5-year to 100-year storm events). Incorporating climate change projections into SWMM will provide wastewater utilities with more comprehensive data they can use in planning for future storm events, thereby reducing the impacts to the utility and customers served from flooding and stormwater issues.",

            "abstract": "Non-Fickian transport, in which the mean square displacement is not proportional to time, is ubiquitous in disordered environments including dispersion of contaminant plumes in aquifers, nutrients in surface water and sediments, proteins and morphogens in crowded cells, and electric signals in spiny dendrites of the cerebellar cortex. In highly heterogeneous sediments, reactive plume particles in groundwater experience a broad velocity distribution as the particles are transported preferentially through interconnected low and high permeability zones. The effect of this non-Fickian transport is exhibited by the power law tails in concentration versus time breakthrough curves. Recently, new continuous time random walk (CTRW) governing equations have been developed for non-Fickian multi-species plume transport that also include first-order sequential reactions. These new equations indicate that first-order reactions are coupled to plume transport, which requires additional investigation. Both 1-D analytical solutions and numerical particle tracking simulations indicate that the steady-state, non-Fickian plume flux-averaged concentration distribution in highly heterogeneous media resembles the Fickian plume distribution in moderately heterogeneous media because first-order reactions truncate the waiting times between particle displacements and thus remove the lower velocity spectrum of particles during transport. Although both models can approach the same steady-state distribution, results of 1-D semi-analytical transient calculations show differences between non-Fickian and Fickian reactive plume models during plume development.

Our version of SAM includes SHOC (Simplified Higher-Order Closure, Bogenschutz and Krueger 2013) which combines several existing components: A prognostic SGS turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) equation, an assumed double-Gaussian PDF following Golaz et al. (2002), the diagnostic second-moment closure of Redelsperger and Sommeria (1986), the diagnostic closure for the third moment of vertical velocity by Canuto et al. (2001), and a turbulence length scale related to the SGS TKE (Teixeira and Cheinet 2004) and to eddy length scales.\nCold-air outbreaks typically produce an evolving cloud-topped boundary layer whose structure is influenced by strong surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat, mixed-phase microphysics, cloud-top radiative cooling, and cloud-top entrainment. By systematically varying the horizontal resolution from 1 to 100 km and comparing the results to a benchmark large-eddy simulation of the case, we will assess the ability of SHOC to represent this type of boundary layer.\nThe image shows the cloud water path from a large-eddy simulation of the CONSTRAIN case. The domain size is 64 km by 64 km. Such simulations are used as benchmarks for coarse-grid simulations that use SHOC.",

The JPSS Common Ground System (CGS), consisting of Command, Control & Communications (C3) and Interface Data Processing (IDP) segments, is developed by Raytheon. CGS now flies the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite, transferring data between ground facilities, processing them into Environmental Data Records for NOAA & DoD weather centers, and expanding to support JPSS-1 in 2017.\nCGS Block 2.0 (B2.0) is the recent CDR-approved design to support both the current S-NPP and upcoming JPSS-1 missions. In B2.0, many important improvements were made to evolve CGS C3. One of those improvements is the addition of SLE services. The CCSDS SLE Protocol standard facilitates and significantly improves GS-to-Data Center communications. The CGS SLE architecture provides data reliability and resource scheduling and is scalable to support added missions.\nThe JPSS CGS is a mature, tested solution for supporting operational weather forecasting for civil, military, and international partners as well as climate research. It features a flexible design that handles order-of-magnitude increases in data over legacy satellite ground systems and meets demanding science accuracy needs. The JPSS CGS is expandable to support additional ground station service providers with or without the deployment of additional JPSS ground hardware by using standard SLE Transfer Service protocol and offers opportunities to reduce costs and improve information Integration across missions. The Raytheon-built JPSS CGS provides the full common ground capability, from design and development through operations & sustainment. These features lay the foundation for the CGS future evolution to support additional missions.",

            "abstract": "The interval spanning the latest Maastrichtian to the early Palaeocene has great potential in helping to elucidate the stabilising mechanisms on the Earth’s carbonate system on both long and very short geological timescales, from the geologically-instantaneous production of sulphate-rich aerosols and nitrogen oxides from the K-Pg bolide impact to the relatively more gradual degassing from Deccan volcanism in the latest Maastrichtian. The extent to which ocean pH (and atmospheric CO2 concentrations) changed in response to these contrasting acidification pressures, and the timescales of their recovery, may provide unique insight into the efficiency of the Earth’s oceans in buffering greenhouse gas increases (through carbonate dissolution, weathering-derived alkalinity flux, and biological carbon cycling). The boron isotope palaeo-pH proxy in planktic foraminifera is well suited to such investigations, but its application over this interval has been problematic, not least due to a scarcity of sample material and a near-complete turnover of planktonic foraminiferal species across the K-Pg boundary. To attempt to circumvent these issues, we investigate the biological influences on boron isotope signals in Maastrichtian and Danian planktonic foraminifera, with the goal of producing more accurate palaeo-pH reconstructions. With these findings in mind, we present preliminary constraints on ocean pH and carbonate system dynamics across this critical interval of geological time.",

            "abstract": "As an important agricultural snowmelt-dominant watershed in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, the Yakima River basin (YRB) is projected to experience increasing water scarcity problems during the summer irrigation season. The system is already experiencing over-allocation with unmet irrigation entitlements occurring more frequently, resulting in negative consequences to YRB agriculture and therefore the economy of the region. Water storage management is one climate change adaptation strategy particularly applicable to snowmelt-dominant watersheds experiencing a shift of its water availability away from the summer irrigation season. These changes in conjunction with climate change will significantly change the availability of water for agriculture, thus impacting farmers’ irrigation decisions. These decisions occur at multiple time scales, including capital investment to change irrigation technology (decadal), to distributing the seasonal allocation of water in a projected drought year (seasonal), to deficit irrigating crops (daily to weekly).\nThe Yakima Basin Integrated Water Resource Management Plan (YBIP) aims to improve the availability of water for agriculture, fish, and communities through a number of projects, including additional or modification of physical infrastructure. Our objective is to reduce the vulnerability of irrigated agriculture in the YRB to climate change through exploring changes in irrigation management strategies in response to implementation of each phase of YBIP. We apply VIC-CropSyst (a newly coupled hydrological/cropping model) and Yakima RiverWare (a water management model) to explore the relationships between climate, hydrology, crop growth and phenology, irrigation management, and YBIP implementation. Results suggest the importance of irrigation management strategies in YRB and indicate that if irrigation strategies are modified in response to changes in physical infrastructure, significant enhancements to instream flow and agricultural water availability will minimize the adverse impacts of climate change.",

These structures, found as short duration (~0.1 msec) quasi-periodic bursts of electric field in the high time resolution electric field waveform, have been called Time Domain Structures (TDS). They can quite effectively interact with radiation belt electrons. Due to the trapping of electrons into these non-linear structures, they are accelerated up to ~10 keV and their pitch angles are changed, especially for low energies (∼1 keV). Large amplitude electric field perturbations cause non-linear resonant trapping of electrons into the effective potential of the TDS and these electrons are then accelerated in the non-homogeneous magnetic field. These locally accelerated electrons create the “seed population” of several keV electrons that can be accelerated by coherent, large amplitude, upper band whistler waves to MeV energies in this two step acceleration process.

Where these high-pH waters come in contact with CO2 at the surface, rapid calcite precipitation forms extensive travertines. We study natural travertine samples from Oman and synthetic witherite (BaCO3) from high-pH experiments to identify disequilibrium signals in δ18O, δ13C and clumped isotopes (measured as Δ47) that characterize rapid uptake of atmospheric CO2 and carbonate precipitation from high pH fluids. Kinetic effects preclude the use of clumped or oxygen isotopes for carbonate thermometry in these environments, but trends in δ18O, δ13C and Δ47 could help identify extinct alkaline systems or distinguish CO2 sources.\nOman travertines formed at peridotite-hosted alkaline springs have long been known to exhibit a large range of kinetically depleted δ18O and δ13C values. We find fresh carbonate precipitated at these alkaline springs also exhibit large enrichments in Δ47 that covary with the depletions in δ18O and δ13C, thought to arise during hydroxylation of CO2 in high-pH fluids. Witherite precipitated during rapid CO2 uptake and carbonate precipitation in high pH experiments also exhibits disequilibrium values in δ18O, δ13C and Δ47, with the Δ47 of carbonate precipitates strongly affected by the Δ47 the reactant CO2.\nδ18O, δ13C and Δ47 trends could serve as a marker for carbonates formed in subaerial alkaline environments and track carbon sources in these systems. For example, the δ18O-δ13C slope in carbonates from Martian meteorites is similar to that observed in carbonates from terrestrial alkaline springs, so if corresponding enrichments in Δ47 could be identified in Martian carbonates, it could suggest that alkaline springs were present on the surface of Mars. Clumped isotope signals could also help distinguish carbon sources: kinetic enrichments in Δ47 would be absent or diminished in high-pH carbonates formed via mixing of alkaline fluids with fluids bearing dissolved CO2 (e.g., bedrock-derived CO2) versus direct uptake of atmospheric CO2. Incorporation of older sediment or later precipitation in pore space may be difficult to detect in 14C, δ18O or δ13C, but the very non-linear nature of clumped isotope mixing may allow identification of mixed carbonates.",

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectrometer (MISR) Retrieved aerosol optical depth and Meteosat Second Generation dust enhancement product were used to examine a dust outbreak that occurred between 13 and 15 August 2005 and revealed that an moist intrusion into the Sahara caused a MCS to form and resulted in dust emission due to cold pool outflow from the MCS. A dust model based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model was developed to include dust emissions, transport, dry and moist deposition, and radiation interactions and was used to simulate the case. Dust-radiation interactions were found to enhance convective strength through low-level heating, which increased convective available potential energy and low-level convergence. The increased intensity of the convection led to stronger and more widespread cold pool formation, which in turn emitted more dust into the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "As the footprint of our urban areas expands, so does our manipulation of the hydrology. For decades we have channeled runoff into storm sewers, wreaking havoc on downstream water bodies with pulses of polluted stormwater. Recently, there has been a push for 'green infrastructure' to replace this hard, grey infrastructure, where green infrastructure- from rain gardens to green roofs to restored riparian areas- would detain stormwater and promote pollutant removal, in addition to a plethora of other ecosystem services. Primarily, it has been landscape architects, engineers, and urban planners who have jumped on the green infrastructure bandwagon. I believe there is also a niche for hydrologists and biogeochemists in re-envisioning how we manage stormwater in urban areas. Developed areas may not be as enticing as a remote mountain field site and their hydrology may be a lot more complicated to model than that of a forest hillslope, but these areas are where the majority of people live and where we could have a great impact on informing better water management practices. In collaboration with more applied fields like landscape architecture and engineering, we can provide crucial insight on existing hydrology as well as how certain green infrastructure or other alternative considerations could support a more sustainable and resilient city, particularly in the face of climate change. Our knowledge on landscape hydrological processes and biogeochemical cycling- combined with the expertise of these other fields- can inform design of truly multi-functional green infrastructure that can effectively manage storm runoff in addition to providing wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, improved aesthetics, and even an opportunity to engage with citizens. While there are certainly some hydrologists that have recognized this opportunity, I hope to see many more pursuing research and seeking solutions for better management of water in urbanized areas.",

            "abstract": "Global ocean anoxia has been proposed to be the cause of the end-Permian (252 Ma) marine extinction event. Evidence for global-scale anoxia mainly comes from the study of organic geochemistry, framboidal pyrite, and redox-sensitive elements, although disagreement exists with respect to the interpretation of the observed patterns. Climate models with biogeochemical components often fail to generate global-scale anoxia induced by warming alone, unless increased phosphate level is invoked. Here, I use the carbon isotope inversion approach in an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (GENIE) with modern phosphate levels to investigate ocean deoxygenation due to global warming through continuous CO­2 emission. I evaluate the temporal and spatial extent of ocean deoxygenation for a best-fit scenario that represents contact metamorphism of organic-rich sediments (δ13C = -25‰) during Siberian Traps volcanism eruption. This scenario is characterized by total peak amount of ~30,000 Gt of carbon and global sea surface temperature increase of 5 oC (Cui et al., 2014). The global surface ocean oxygen concentration shows only a modest decrease (from 230 to 215 µmol kg-1) during peak C emission, whereas the global deep ocean oxygen concentration shows a 70% decrease (from 160 to 50 µmol kg-1). During peak C emission, the oxygen minimum zone (~800 m depth) expands vertically and horizontally, and vast regions in the deep northern Panthalassa becomes hypoxic (<50 µmol kg-1) while the deep southern Panthalassa remains oxygenated. The minimum oxygen concentration is coincident with the peak extinction and minimum surface saturation state, suggesting ocean deoxygenation and ocean acidification might go hand in hand causing the largest extinction of all time.\n",

            "abstract": "Tropical forests are fundamental components in the global carbon cycle and are threatened by deforestation and climate change. Because of their importance in carbon dynamics, understanding the structural architecture of these forests is vital. Airborne lidar data provides a unique opportunity to examine not only the height of these forests, which is often used to estimate biomass, but also the crown geometry and vertical profile of the canopy. These structural attributes inform temporal and spatial apsects of carbon dynamics providing insight into the past disturbances and growth of forests.\nWe examined airborne lidar point cloud data from five sites in the Brazilian Amazon collected during the years 2012 to 2014. We generated both digital elevation maps, canopy height models (CHM), and vertical vegetation profiles (VVP) in our analysis. We analyzed the CHM using crown delineation with an iterative maximum finding routine to find the tops of canopies, local maxima to determine edges of crowns, and two parameters that control termination of crown edges. We also ran textural analysis methods on the CHM and VVP. Using multiple linear regression models and boosted regression trees we estimated forest structural parameters including biomass, stem density, basal area, width and depth of crowns and stem size distribution. Structural attributes estimated from lidar point cloud data can improve our understanding of the carbon dynamics of tropical forests on a landscape level and regional level.",

            "abstract": "In general, the runoff phenomenon at the time of a flood is consisted of a series of runoff components. For example, Horton (1933) proposed that when the rainfall amount is over then the limit capacity of soil permeation, the other water would be output as the surface runoff. Kikkawa et. al (1979) considered that sub-system of the discharge decreasing progressively for the tank model. And Kure et. al (2005) recommended the smallest scale tank for unique slope including of the characteristics of soil, topography to calculate the rainfall- runoff volume. However, the physical meaning of these researches was not very clearly. Therefore, the authors would focus on it and develop the multi-layers flow as the main model to evaluate the flood runoff in a short term and long term period.\nFirst the historically rainfall-runoff model considering multi-layer flow in a slope is proposed. The purpose of this study is to propose the runoff model in consideration of multi-layer flow and to indicate possible application of long-and short-term runoff analysis. It shows outline of proposed rainfall-runoff model considering multi-layer flow in a slope. Additionally, it argues over the difference of reproducibility from existing model. And finally, this model is applied to long-and short-term runoff analysis at a small dam basin (254km2) in Japan. In conclusion, the model considering multi-layer flow was able to be proposed by incorporating no difficulty involved vertical infiltration mechanism to the existing model. As a result of runoff analysis at the dam basin, the availability of the proposed model is shown.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical data has been used for many years to aid exploration of platinum group elements (PGE) in layered mafic intrusions, such as the Stillwater Complex, Montana. Using modern processing schemes we glean new information from legacy data sets which include a Fugro DIGHEM V airborne electromagnetic (AEM) and aeromagnetic survey along with ground-based gravity data. We apply a modern stochastic inversion to image the AEM data. Stochastic modeling utilizes statistics to provide parameter distributions, such as number of layers, and resistivity and thickness of each layer. A variety of modern filters were applied to the magnetic and gravity data.\nThe complex’s gravity high continues >25 km north of its outcrop indicating that the complex is larger than its surficial expression. Xenoliths of the complex in Cretaceous intrusions have been found 25 km to the North, confirming the gravity. The layers of the complex have been grouped into five series: Upper Banded (highest), Middle Banded, Lower Banded, Ultramafic, and Basal series (lowest). The PGE zone of interest, the J-M Reef, occurs as cumulate layers in the Lower Banded series. The aeromagnetic data clearly discerns layering, including the J-M Reef, within the complex due to varying amounts of serpentinized olivine. The aeromagnetic highs can be traced under cover and correlate with subvertical conductors in the AEM models. The complex’s resistivities are generally high, while the Reef’s resistivity is expected to be slightly lower due to higher serpentinized olivine content. Our inversions show the overlying sediments, serpentinized ultramafic rocks, and the Basal series to be conductive. Forward modeling suggests that the AEM data should not be able to resolve the Reef; however, significant amounts of olivine exist above and below indicating a potential Reef zone. By using the lab resistivity measurements from specific stratigraphic units and the resistivity distributions from the AEM models we aim to tease out variations within the Lower Banded series. Through the use of legacy data and modern processing and imaging techniques we are able to better characterize the geometry and composition of the Stillwater Complex — approaches that can be applied to other layered mafic intrusions.",

            "abstract": "A series of true triaxial constant mean stress tests was performed on Castlegate Sandstone with the intent of determining the effect of the intermediate principal stress on localization. Tests were performed by first hydrostatically loading the specimens to the desired mean stress (30, 60, 90, 120, 150 MPa) then switching the test mode to maintain constant mean stress. This was done by releasing the minimum principal stress, increasing the maximum principal stress and varying the intermediate principal stress in proportion to achieve the desired stress state. The stress states were defined by maintaining a constant Lode angle throughout the test. Five Lode angles were tested ranging from axisymmetric compression to axisymmetric extension (30, 14.5, 0, -14.5, -30°). Results showed that as the Lode angle decreased the loads required to cause localization decreased and the band angle (defined as the angle between the band normal and the direction of maximum compression) decreased with increasing mean stress.\nComparing the experimental results with localization predictions required development of constitutive parameters from the experimental data. This resulted in development of a strain separation process to determine elastic and plastic constitutive parameters from the experimental data. The strain was separated into four components: A) strain due to change in stress at constant modulus, B) strain due to stress dependence of the modulus, C) strain due to plastic strain dependence of the modulus, and D) plastic strain. Information derived from the strain separation process was used to develop constitutive parameters; which were applied to the Rudnicki and Rice (1975) localization criterion and the results were compared to experimental deformation bands. Results indicated that away from the axisymmetric stress states, at low mean stress, the strain separation process provides results which correlate well with experimental results.

This represents the highest performance yet achieved by a silicon-based vibration sensor. The microseismometer builds on previous development of a short- period seismometer for NASA’s 2016 InSight mission to Mars. The 25-mm-square sensor element is unique in that it uses a spring-mass system with a proof mass that moves laterally. This minimizes the damping of the spring mass systems without the need for vacuum encapsulation. The proof-mass position is sensed by a periodic linear capacitive array transducer allowing highly sensitive position detection combined with feedback control at multiple null points. Operation at any of these points enables the sensor to function over a large tilt range without compromising the noise performance. As well as the capacitive sensing elements, the proof mass has planar coils on the surface to electromagnetic actuator when placed in a static magnetic field. The MEMS sensor element is connected to an electronics feedback circuit similar to those used in broad-band seismometers allowing the sensor to act as a velocity output force balance transducer.\nfile:///var/folders/x6/mzxsjdyn37xdlg6bfq63838w0000gn/T/com.apple.Preview/com.apple.Preview.PasteboardItems/Microseismometer.png",

            "abstract": "We introduce a method for imaging the earthquake source dynamics through the inversion of ground motion records based on a parallel genetic algorithm. The source model follows an elliptical patch approach and uses the staggered-grid split-node method to model the earthquake dynamics. A statistical analysis is used to estimate uncertainties in both inverted and derived source parameters. Synthetic inversion tests reveal that the rupture speed (Vr), the rupture area and the stress drop (Δτ) are determined within an error of ~30%, ~12% and ~10%, respectively. In contrast, derived parameters such as the radiated energy (Er), the radiation efficiency (η) and the fracture energy (G) have larger uncertainties, around ~70%, ~40% and ~25%, respectively. We applied the method to the Mw6.5 intermediate-depth (62 km) normal-faulting earthquake of December 11, 2011 in Guerrero, Mexico (Diaz-Mojica et al., JGR, 2014). Inferred values of Δτ = 29.2±6.2 MPa and η = 0.26±0.1 are significantly higher and lower, respectively, than those of typical subduction thrust events. Fracture energy is large, so that more than 73% of the available potential energy for the dynamic process of faulting was deposited in the focal region (i.e., G = (14.4±3.5)x1014J), producing a slow rupture process (Vr/Vs = 0.47±0.09) despite the relatively-high energy radiation (Er = (0.54±0.31)x1015 J) and energy-moment ratio (Er/M0 = 5.7x10-5). It is interesting to point out that such a slow and inefficient rupture along with the large stress drop in a small focal region are features also observed in the 1994 deep Bolivian earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The formation, maintenance, and severity of thunderstorms that produce large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes are often difficult to forecast due to their rapid evolution and complex interactions with environmental features that are challenging to directly observe. This paper describes an empirical, data driven, approach to forecasting severe convection through fusion of near real time data from several sources. More specifically, data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) network, and the Rapid Refresh (RAP) numerical weather prediction (NWP) model are used to drive a naïve Bayesian classifier. Each observation source provides unique information during different periods of storm development (i.e., the pre-storm environment, storm initiation and growth, and hydrometeor intensification). The model is designed to provide warning guidance to forecasters in the near-term (0-60 min), by quantifying several key temporal and spatial attributes of developing convection. The probabilistic model, known as ProbSevere, has been running in near real time at the University of Wisconsin Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (UW-CIMSS) since April of 2013 and was formally evaluated by National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters at the Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT) in the spring of 2014. Validation studies and forecaster feedback indicated that the ProbSevere model, which is driven by near real time data, could be used to improve severe weather warning operations. In this paper, we will give an overview of the ProbSevere model, including performance statistics, and describe how the model will benefit from the next generation of GOES satellites (GOES-R).",

            "abstract": "The strong variability of internal tidal phase with respect to tidal phase has been recently documented. The slowness of internal tidal propagation through evolving uncertain environmental conditions offers a simple descriptive explanation for this effect. Here, a method for analyzing the propagation of internal tides through the random medium is presented. The equations of motion for internal waves are recast into vertical and horizontal equations. The vertical equation is a generalization of the internal-wave modal equation and the Taylor-Goldstein equation. This equation takes into account the effects of two-dimensionally sheared currents into the normal mode wavelength and speed. The horizontal equation is the Helmholtz equation with an azimuthally variable (anisotropic) phase speed. Ray tracing methods for this anisotropic speed scenario are presented. Tehniques for solving the equations and some example results are shown. The method differs from other internal tide propagation analysis methods that use the long wave approximation normal modes and include current effects in the horizontal equations. The figure shows, at the right, phase speed as a function of azimuth for three M2-frequency internal-wave modes for the shear flow and stratification conditions shown at the left.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is expected to alter precipitation patterns around the world. The impacts of altered precipitation on ecosystem function will be partly controlled by soil microbes because of their primary role in soil carbon cycling. However, microbial responses to drought remain poorly understood, particularly local responses that might partly reflect specialization based on historical conditions. Here, we investigated the respiratory response of microbial communities originating from historically wetter and drier sites to both low and high soil moistures. We focused on the respiratory quotient (RQ= moles of CO2 produced per mole of O2 consumed), which varies with the oxidation state of organic carbon being respired and/or the compounds being synthesized by soil microbes. We hypothesized that there would be a shift in RQ across the gradient of soil moisture. Soils were collected from 13 sites across a steep precipitation gradient on the Edwards plateau in central Texas, air-dried, rewet at low or high soil moisture (6% or 24% gravimetric, respectively), and incubated in an atmosphere of 21% O2, 1% Ar, and balance He. After eight weeks, CO2, O2 and Ar in the headspace of incubation vials were measured by gas chromatography after separation of Ar and O2 at subambient temperature. Because of the high calcite content in soils on the Edwards plateau, we corrected the RQ values by assuming pH was buffered at 8 and then adding the calculated amount of CO2 dissolved in water in the incubations vials to the measured CO2 in the headspace.\nWe found that uncorrected RQ values were slightly less than one and increased significantly with increasing mean annual precipitation. In contrast, corrected RQ values were greater than one and decreased with increasing mean annual precipitation. In both cases, we see a shift in RQ across the gradient, suggesting that differences in substrate utilization may vary based on origin across the gradient and with current level of soil moisture. This could provide insight into how microbial communities respond physiologically to shifts in environmental conditions, such as precipitation.",

Here we present recent developments to the massively parallel reactive transport code ParCrunchFlow. This model, previously applicable only to steady-state, saturated subsurface flows, has been extended to transient, surface-subsurface systems. Proof-of-concept simulations detailing reactive transport processes in hillslope and floodplain settings will be presented. In order to reduce the numerical dispersion inherent in grid based advection schemes, which can lead to an over prediction of reaction rates, a weighted, essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) advection scheme has been implemented, providing formal fifth-order spatial and third-order temporal accuracy. We use a mass-conservative, positivity-preserving flux limiter while advecting solute concentrations to prevent non-physical solutions. The effects of advection schemes and their associated numerical dispersion on reaction rates are evaluated by comparing our scheme to a monotonic lower order scheme in a transverse mixing scenario. The work presented here allows a better understanding of nutrient cycling dynamics in watershed systems.",

In fact, helioseismology has become in one of the best and powerful tools we have to study the Sun's interior. Actually, we already know that there are three different kind of oscillation modes: acoustic (due to pressure), internal gravity and surface gravity waves named as p, g and f modes respectively. The purpose of this work is to simulate an acoustic signal (focusing on p modes) that is being propagated through a 2D region of plasma immersed in a homogeneous and constant magnetic field based on the previous research made by Schunker and Cally (2006). This simulation will show how magnetic fields can affect the trajectory of the acoustic signal and therefore reproducing previous results but based on a different computational algorithm.",

In order to compliment this experiment, the VPM spacecraft will fly in low-earth orbit (LEO) to measure the presence and intensity of VLF transmissions from DSX as well as their effects on the local electron population. The data received from VPM can be analyzed in coincidence with that obtained by the DSX WPIx equipment to obtain an unprecedented, simultaneous evaluation of two points in the inner magnetosphere.

            "abstract": "A procedure is presented that allows using information from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor to improve the quality of monthly burned area estimates over Brazil. The method integrates MODIS derived information from two sources; the NASA MCD64A1 Direct Broadcast Monthly Burned Area Product and INPE’s Monthly Burned Area MODIS product (AQM-MODIS). The latter product relies on an algorithm that was specifically designed for ecosystems in Brazil, taking advantage of the ability of MIR reflectances to discriminate burned areas. Information from both MODIS products is incorporated by means of a linear regression model where an optimal estimate of the burned area is obtained as a linear combination of burned area estimates from MCD64A1 and AQM-MODIS. The linear regression model is calibrated using as optimal estimates values of burned area derived from Landsat TM during 2005 and 2006 over Jalapão, a region of Cerrado covering an area of 187 x 187 km2. Obtained values of coefficients for MCD64A1 and AQM-MODIS were 0.51 and 0.35, respectively and the root mean square error was 7.6 km2. Robustness of the model was checked by calibrating the model separately for 2005 and 2006 and cross-validating with 2006 and 2005; coefficients for 2005 (2006) were 0.46 (0.54) for MCD64A1 and 0.35 (0.35) for AQM-MODIS and the corresponding root mean square errors for 2006 (2005) were 7.8 (7.4) km2.\nThe linear model was then applied to Brazil as well as to the six Brazilian main biomes, namely Cerrado, Amazônia, Caatinga, Pantanal, Mata Atlântica and Pampa. As to be expected the interannual variability based on the proposed synergistic use of MCD64A1, AQM-MODIS and Landsat Tm data for the period 2005-2010 presents marked differences with the corresponding amounts derived from MCD64A1 alone. For instance during the considered period, values (in 103 km2) from the proposed approach (from MCD64A1) are 399 (142), 232 (62), 559 (259), 274 (73), 219 (31) and 415 (251). Values obtained with the proposed approach may be viewed as an improved alternative to the currently available products over Brazil.",

            "abstract": "The Snake River Plain and neighboring regions are well known for their high heat flow and robust Neogene-Quaternary tectonic and magmatic activity. Interestingly, however, there are comparatively few surficial manifestations of geothermal activity. This study is part of a renewed examination of this region as a possible hidden or blind geothermal resource. We present a testable, integrated volcanological, petrogenetic, tectonic and hydrothermal conceptual model for 57 ka China Hat and cogenetic topaz rhyolite lava domes of the Blackfoot Volcanic Field. This field is well suited for analysis as a blind resource because of its distinctive combination of (1) young bimodal volcanism, petrogenetic evidence of shallow magma storage and evolution, presence of coeval extension, voluminous travertine deposits, and C- and He-isotopic evidence of active magma degassing; (2) a paucity of hot springs or other obvious indicators of a geothermal resource in the immediate vicinity of the lava domes; and (3) proximity to a region of high crustal heat flow, high-T geothermal fluids at 2.5-5 km depth and micro-seismicity characterized by its swarming nature. Eruptions of both basalt and rhyolite commonly evolve from minor phreatomagmatic to effusive. In our model, transport of both magmatic and possible deep crustal aqueous fluids may be controlled by preexisting crustal structures, including west-dipping thrust faults. Geochemical evolution of rhyolite magma is dominated by mid- to upper-crustal fractional crystallization (with pre-eruption storage and phenocryst formation at ~14 km). Approximately 1.2 km3 of topaz rhyolite have been erupted since 1.4 Ma, yielding an average eruption rate of 0.8 km3/m.y. Given reasonable assumptions of magma cumulate formation and eruption rates, and initial and final volatile concentrations, we infer average H2O and CO2 volatile fluxes from the rhyolite source region of ~2MT/year and 340 T/day, respectively. Lithium flux may be comparable to CO2.",

            "abstract": "We assess the feasibility of imaging the subsurface using upgoing muons. Traditional muon imaging focuses on more-prevalent downgoing muons. Muons are subatomic particles capable of penetrating the earth’s crust several kilometers. Downgoing muons have been used to image the Pyramid of Khafre of Giza, various volcanoes, and smaller targets like cargo. Unfortunately, utilizing downgoing muons requires below-target detectors. For aboveground objects like a volcano, the detector is placed at the volcano’s base and the top portion of the volcano is imaged. For underground targets like tunnels, the detector would have to be placed below the tunnel in a deeper tunnel or adjacent borehole, which can be costly and impractical for some locations. Additionally, detecting and characterizing subsurface features like voids from tunnels can be difficult. Typical characterization methods like sonar, seismic, and ground penetrating radar have shown mixed success. Voids have a marked density contrast with surrounding materials, so using methods sensitive to density variations would be ideal. High-energy cosmic ray muons are more sensitive to density variation than other phenomena, including gravity. Their absorption rate depends on the density of the materials through which they pass. Measurements of muon flux rate at differing directions provide density variations of the materials between the muon source (cosmic rays and neutrino interactions) and detector, much like a CAT scan. Currently, tomography using downgoing muons can resolve features to the sub-meter scale. We present results of exploratory work, which demonstrates that upgoing muon fluxes appear sufficient to achieve target detection within a few months.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the internally induced natural (unforced) variability of climate systems remains an outstanding scientific challenge especially for climate systems, which are far from equilibrium. Such systems are driven by internal non-linear processes, which make the evolution of this system transient. Transient behavior of the non-linear system is very sensitive to fluctuations and initial conditions. Therefore it is extremely difficult to predict future changes in such systems from observational data alone, since there is only one realization (of many possible transients) available. Our aim is to bring the methodology of non-equilibrium dynamics to bear on understanding the internally induced climate variability by modeling transient scenarios of climate change.\nIn this study, we consider the dynamics of the thermohaline circulation and the variations in the Earth’s temperature as examples of the transient scenarios. We study the evolution of the system whose parameters are near critical values - bifurcation points. The control parameter is a function of a time, and it evolves slowly through the critical value undergoing a dynamic bifurcation, that makes the system non-autonomous, its evolution is completely transient, and its dynamics is non-equilibrium. We assume the rate at which the control parameter crosses its critical value to be small compared to the response time of the system. We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the system at different control parameter profiles (monotonic or periodic function, rate of change, initial values).\nOur results show that depending on the control parameters and its vicinity to the bifurcation points, the system may be closer or further away from equilibrium, may exhibit multiple equilibria, different kind of instabilities and oscillations around equilibria. In contrast to the scenarios with the time-independent parameters, non-equilibrium dynamics framework allows us to explicitly examine the transients and provide us with a diagnostic tool to reproduce the dynamics of observational data.",

            "abstract": "Two magmatic belts in Maine host essentially undeformed, well-preserved Silurian to Devonian volcanic sequences that include thick ash flow tuffs and rhyolitic lava flows. The Coastal Maine volcanic belt consists of at least five bimodal volcanic complexes (419 to 424 +/- 2 Ma) hosting volcanic sequences 1-4 km thick, spanning approximately 160 km of the Maine coastline. Entire cross-sections of the volcanic-plutonic complexes are visible, providing excellent sites to study the volcano/pluton interface. The Central Maine belt also extends approximately 160 km, northeast to southwest, across central Maine, and also hosts several bimodal plutonic/volcanic complexes. Rocks in the Central Maine belt range from 400 to 410 Ma (Hubacher and Lux, 1987; Bradley et al., 1996). The largest complex in the Central Maine belt is the ~407 Ma (Rankin and Tucker, 1995) Katahdin granite and Moxie mafic intrusive complex and the coeval Traveler Rhyolite, a monotonous two-member, 3200-meter-thick pyroclastic succession. In Rankin and Hon (1987), Hon argued that the original volume of the Traveler rhyolite was at least 5000 km3, making it one of the largest silicic caldera eruptions in the rock record. Both the Coastal Maine volcanic belt and the Central Maine belt are on the Gander terrane, a peri-Gondwanan crustal block that accreted to Laurentia during the Salinic orogeny. Accretion of the block was complete by ~421 Ma (Pollock et al., 2012), but by then the Avalon terrane was accreting to Gander. Either back-arc extension associated with subduction of oceanic lithosphere on the leading edge of the Avalonian plate, or delamination of that plate beneath Gander resulted in back-arc extension, decompression melting of the mantle, and partial melting of thick crust. The Central Maine belt, farther inboard of the downgoing Avalonian slab, developed similar bimodal, extension-related magmatism by approximately 410 Ma. Large silicic caldera eruptions developed in these belts as a result of subduction of the Avalon plate beneath a thick Gander plate, production of dry, mantle-derived basalt in extensional settings, and sufficient crustal extension in the wide Gander terrane to permit transport of basaltic melt to shallow crustal levels, where it intruded large silicic magma chambers and initiated supervolcano-scale eruptions.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) are important for mountainous areas where snow accounts for the majority of the annual precipitation. Radar has been proven to be an effective tool for estimating SWE in dry snow but can be challenging in wet snow packs. Liquid water rapidly attenuates the radar signal and decreases the velocity, leading to large errors in SWE estimates if not accounted for. Pulsed radar in the 1-6 GHz range has been relatively unexplored for studying snow due to only recently being available commercially, and offers ~6 cm vertical resolution while using frequencies that are low enough to effectively penetrate wet snow. Field observations from a fixed post were performed continuously through a range of liquid water content values during melt in spring 2014. Since liquid water causes frequency-dependent attenuation in the 1-6 GHz range, the difference in frequency content of the source signal and ground surface reflection can be used to estimate the complex permittivity of the snow through empirical relationships. The snow depth is known from the snow surface reflection from the fixed post and is used to estimate radar velocity. Snow density is estimated from empirical relationships with permittivity, and SWE estimates are made that account for liquid water in the snow. The field data are compared to in-situ wetness measurements in a nearby snow pit. A 1D reflectivity model is used to characterize the theoretical ability of the 1-6 GHz pulsed system to estimate SWE in a mountain snow pack for ranges of snow depth and signal loss due to liquid water content and reflections from internal layers.",

Many questions need to be answered about the air pollution in China, such as how harmful is the air pollution, especially PM2.5? Why suddenly so many reports about sever air pollution, is the air in China getting more polluted? How to design a policy that can control the air pollution most efficiently?\nAfter updated the national Ambient Air Quality Standards in 2012 and included PM2.5 as one of the critical air pollutants, in 2013, Chinese central government released for the first time the “Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan”. The plan has set goals to reduce annual mean concentration of PM2.5 up to 25% in 2017 in different regions in China. If the ambitious goals were achieved, this could be the most significant air pollution reduction in such a short time that affects so many people in human history.\nTo achieve these goals, however, there are enormous scientific and public policy challenges to deal with. For example:\nIdentify the key components, size fraction of PM that have the largest health effects; and identify the sources of PM that has the most harmful effects on human health and ecosystem.\nReduce the uncertainty in health risk assessment.\nUnderstand complicate chemical transformation processes in air pollution formation with intensive emissions from industry, power plant, vehicles, agriculture.\nInteractions between air pollution, PBL, and atmospheric circulation at different scales.\nThe accountability, feasibility, effectiveness, and efficiency of air pollution control policies.\nIntegrate multi-pollutant control and achieve co-benefit with climate and energy policy.\nRegional coordinated air pollution control.\nThe largest challenge in China for air pollution control remains how to strength the link between science and policy.",

State-of-the-art hardware has given developers the tools needed to capture high-resolution spherical content, 360° panoramic video, giga-pixel imagery, and unique viewpoints via unmanned aerial vehicles as they explore remote and physically challenging regions of our planet. Advanced software enables integration of these data into seamless, dynamic, immersive, interactive, content-rich, and learner-driven virtual field explorations, experienced online via HTML5. These surpass conventional online exercises that use 2-D static imagery and enable the student to engage in these virtual environments that are more like games than like lectures.\nGrounded in the active learning of exploration, inquiry, and application of knowledge as it is acquired, users interact non-linearly in conjunction with an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). The integration of this system allows the educational experience to be adapted to each individual student as they interact within the program.\nSuch explorations, which we term “immersive virtual field trips” (iVFTs), are being integrated into cyber-learning allowing science teachers to take students to scientifically significant but inaccessible environments. Our team and collaborators are producing a diverse suite of freely accessible, iVFTs to teach key concepts in geology, astrobiology, ecology, and anthropology. Topics include Early Life, Biodiversity, Impact craters, Photosynthesis, Geologic Time, Stratigraphy, Tectonics, Volcanism, Surface Processes, The Rise of Oxygen, Origin of Water, Early Civilizations, Early Multicellular Organisms, and Bioarcheology. These diverse topics allow students to experience field sites all over the world, including, Grand Canyon (USA), Flinders Ranges (Australia), Shark Bay (Australia), Rainforests (Panama), Teotihuacan (Mexico), Upheaval Dome (USA), Pilbara (Australia), Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Iceland), and Mauna Kea (Hawaii).\niVFTs are being beta-tested and used at ASU in several large-enrollment courses to assess its usability and effectiveness in meeting specific learning objectives.

            "abstract": "The rapidly expanding use by the oil and gas industry of “nodal”, large channel capacity areal arrays that record continuously for extended periods of time is generating large volumes of data in excess of that needed for the conventional CMP reflection imaging that is the primary goal of such surveys. These excess data, once considered as simply “noise”, have recently been recognized to have utility not only for the exploration seismologist but also for addressing a diverse range of phenomena. The most widely recognized use for these “noise” records is surface wave tomographic imaging of near surface velocity structure via seismic interferometry of ambient natural noise. Such results are proving to be of great value in enhancing conventional 3D exploration imagery, but they should be appreciated in their own right for the information they provide on the shallow subsurface to the hydrologist, engineer and tectonicist. Another relatively dramatic application is the delineation of local structure by tracing the propagation of body and surface waves from local and teleseismic events across these dense arrays. Here I would like draw attention to three other promising uses for such data: a) detection and mapping of microseismicity below the detection thresholds of conventional earthquake monitoring networks, especially in areas of low conventional seismicity; b) reflection and refraction imaging of structure using cultural, as opposed to natural, energy sources, and c) systematic mapping of the basement in 3D using the existing exploration sources recorded at travel times longer than that typically harvested for resource purposes. We conclude by emphasizing that these potentially invaluable “extras” are now being recorded routinely around the world, but there is as yet no mechanism in place to ensure they are exploited rather than simply deleted.",

Of primary interest are the physical processes responsible for the fast electric field “characteristic” pulses that are often observed during this phase. The pulse widths of characteristic pulses are shown to occur as a superposed bimodal distribution, with the short and long modes having characteristic timescales on the order of 1 microsecond and 10 microseconds, respectively. Analysis of these pulses is based on comparison with laboratory observations of long spark discharge processes and with recently acquired high-speed video observations of a single –CG event. It will be argued that the fast electric field bimodal distribution is the result of conventional discharge processes operating in an extensive strong ambient electric field environment. An important related topic will also be discussed, where it will be argued that preliminary breakdown discharges are capable of generating energetic electrons and may therefore seed relativistic electron avalanches that go on to produce pulsed energetic photon emissions.",

Skarns from these regions may serve as proxies for intricacies in the fluid source, and have the potential to resolve magmatic flare-ups and relative depths of emplacement.\nBoth laser fluorination (LF) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) δ18O analyses of garnet from multiple Mojave (Lucerne valley) skarns indicate a strong, early influence of meteoric fluid despite the presence of relatively deep plutonism. LF data from individual whole garnets and garnet chips broken during sample preparation reveal variation from +4.2‰ to -8.8‰ (n = 24), with an average of approximately -4.0‰. The large spread in these LF data suggest that (A) δ18O reflects an average of varying δ18O (fluid) compositions spanning multiple garnet growth oscillations; or (B) multiple generations of garnets exist within individual skarns, the growth of each coinciding with changes in the hydrothermal source and composition.\nSIMS analysis of two individual Mojave skarn garnets with oscillatory zoning (seen in backscatter electron images) reveal crystal cores with δ18O values of -9.6‰, internal variations of -9.4‰ to -3.3‰, and crystal rims of -2.2‰ and -2.9‰ (precision ±0.3; 2σ). In general, δ18O values negatively correlate with andradite compositions, with high andradite zones having lower δ18O values ([AND + CaTi] compositions range from 100 to 73).\nSimilar analyses (both SIMS and LF) of garnets from Sierra Nevadan skarns (Tungsten Hills region) show variation in δ18O values with LF data ranging from 5.4‰ to 6.2‰ (n = 8), with an average of 5.7‰, and an additional 2.7‰ value obtained from a garnet interior. SIMS data show δ18O compositional variation from 4.0‰ to 5.9‰. Data across the two Tungsten Hills garnets analyzed via SIMS show the range of isotope compositions possible within a single crystal. All data from the Tungsten Hills skarns suggest meteoric water was less influential farther north in the arc, and that major skarn formation was likely the result of pluton-related magmatic fluids. Magmatic fluids would produce garnets with δ18O > +6‰.",

Determination of greenhouse gas fluxes and uncertainty bounds is essential for the evaluation of the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Indianapolis is intended to serve as a test bed for these methods; the results will inform efforts at measuring emissions from urban centers worldwide, including megacities. The generally accepted method for determining urban greenhouse gas emissions is inventories, which are compiled from records of land use and human activity. Atmospheric methods, in which towers are instrumented with sensors to measure greenhouse gas mole fractions and these data are used in an inversion model, have the potential to provide independent determination of emissions.\nThe current INFLUX observation network includes twelve in-situ tower-based, continuous measurements of CO2. A subset of five towers additionally measure CH4, and a different subset measure CO. The subset measuring CO also include weekly flask samples of a wide variety of trace gases including 14CO2. Here we discuss the observed urban spatial and temporal patterns in greenhouse gas mole fraction in Indianapolis, with the critical result being the detectability of city emissions with this high-density network. We also present the first atmospheric inversion results for both CO2 and CH4, compare these results to inventories, and discuss the effects of critical assumptions in the inversion framework. The construction of unbiased atmospheric modeling systems and well-defined prior errors remains an important step in atmospheric emissions monitoring over urban areas. In order to minimize transport model errors, we developed a WRF-Chem FDDA modeling system ingesting surface and profile measurements of horizontal mean wind, temperature, and moisture. We demonstrate the impact of the meteorological data assimilation system on the inverse flux estimates.",

            "abstract": "Satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is well known to be used as a volcano monitoring tool, providing the opportunity to conduct local and regional surveys to detect and measure volcanic deformation. The signals detected by InSAR on volcanoes can be related to various phenomena, such as volume changes in magmatic reservoirs, compaction of recent deposits, changes in hydrothermal activity, and flank instability. The InSAR time-series method has well documented examples of these phenomena, including precursory inflation of magma reservoirs months prior to volcanic eruptions, proving its potential for early warning systems.\nWe use the ALOS-1 satellite from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), which acquired a global L-band data set of nearly 20 acquisitions during 2007-2011, to make an InSAR time-series analysis using the Small Baseline method (SBAS). Our analysis covers all of the volcanoes in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru that are cataloged by the Global Volcanism Program. We present results showing time-dependent ground deformation on an near the volcanoes, and present kinematic models to constrain the characteristics of the magmatic sources for the cases in which the deformation is likely related to changes in magma reservoir pressurization.",

This framework includes the implementations of Spectral Elements, Discontinuous Galerkin, Flux Reconstruction, and Hybrid Finite Element methods with the goal of achieving optimal accuracy in the solution of atmospheric problems. Several advantages of this approach are discussed such as: improved pressure gradient calculation, numerical stability by vertical/horizontal splitting, arbitrary order of accuracy, etc. The local numerical discretization allows for high performance parallel computation and efficient inclusion of parameterizations. These techniques are used in conjunction with a non-conformal, locally refined, cubed-sphere grid for global simulations and standard Cartesian grids for simulations at the mesoscale. A complete implementation of the methods described is demonstrated in a non-hydrostatic setting.",

            "abstract": "On average, global temperatures have warmed at a greater rate in the past 50 years than in any preceding period. A warmer climate has been shown to yield less snowfall, a shallower snowpack and an earlier onset of snowmelt. Several studies have examined changes to the ratio of snow to rain throughout the United States, and found that there has not been a change in the amount of precipitation but at many locations there has been a decrease in the amount of snowfall.\n Across the Northern Great Plains of the central United States, snow accumulation is shallow but persistent for most of the winter. Here, 20 meteorological stations are used to examined climate change across this region over the past 60 years. In general, the amounts of precipitation (and snowfall) are not changing, but the number of days with snow has been decreasing, as the annual maximum and minimum temperatures have been warming. However, there is substantial spatial variability in the trends across this region. Since winter precipitation in solid phase will add fresh snow to the pack and increase its albedo, which alters the energy balance at the surface, albedo is modeled for all stations. Two adjacent stations are explored in further detail to highlight opposite trends.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing-based retrievals of aerosol composition require known or assumed relationships between aerosol optical properties and types. Most optically-based aerosol classification schemes apply some combination of the spectral dependence of aerosol light scattering and absorption-using the absorption and either scattering or extinction Angstrom exponents (AAE, SAE and EAE), along with single-scattering albedo (SSA). These schemes can differentiate between such aerosol types as dust, biomass burning, and urban/industrial but no such studies have been conducted in the SE U.S., where a large fraction of the background aerosol is a variable mixture of biogenic SOA, sulfates, and black carbon. In addition, AERONET retrievals of SSA are often highly uncertain due to low AOD in the region during most months.\nThe high-elevation, semi-rural AppalAIR facility at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC (1090m ASL, 36.210N, 81.690W) is home to the only co-located NOAA-ESRL and AERONET monitoring sites in the eastern U.S. Aerosol chemistry measured at AppalAIR is representative of the background SE U.S (Link et al. 2014) Dried aerosol light absorption and dried and humidified aerosol light scattering and hemispheric backscattering at 3 visible wavelengths and 2 particle size cuts (sub-1µm and sub-10µm) are measured continuously. Measurements of size-resolved, non-refractory sub-1µm aerosol composition were made by a co-located AMS during the 2012-2013 summers and 2013 winter. Systematic relationships among aerosol optical, microphysical, and chemical properties were developed to better understand aerosol sources and processes and for use in higher-dimension aerosol classification schemes. The hygroscopic dependence of visible light scattering is sensitive to the ratio of sulfate to organic aerosol(OA), as are SSA and AAE. SAE is a less sensitive indicator of fine-mode aerosol size than hemispheric backscatter fraction (b) and is more sensitive to fine-mode aerosol fraction. SSA, b, and AAE are also sensitive to changes in scattering coefficient (σsp)-a proxy for aerosol loading. AAE values well below 1 are consistent with enhanced absorption due to BC cores coated with sulfate and OA. Initial results from an aerosol classification scheme based on systematic relationships are also presented.",

            "abstract": "Balloon-borne instruments detecting radiation belt precipitation frequently observe oscillations in the mHZ frequency range. Several balloon missions measuring electron precipitation near the poles in the 100 keV to 2.5 MeV energy range, including the MAXIS, MINIS, and most recently the BARREL campaign, have observed this modulation at ULF wave frequencies (Clilverd et al., 2007; Millan et al., 2011). However, ULF waves in the magnetosphere, commonly associated with oscillations in solar wind dynamic pressure on the dayside and with Kelvin-Helmhotz instabilities in the flanks, are seldom directly linked to increases in electron precipitation since their oscillation periods are much larger than the gyroperiod and the bounce period of radiation belt electrons. It has been conjectured that ULF oscillations in the magnetosphere may modulate EMIC wave growth rates. EMIC waves, in turn, have long been associated with energetic electron precipitation, since they can cause pitch angle scattering of these particles, thus lowering their mirror points (Miyoshi et al., 2008; Carson et al., 2013). This would explain the ULF modulation of MeV electrons seen by the balloon instruments. However, test particle simulations show that another hypothesis is possible (Brito et al., 2012). 3D simulations of radiation belt electrons were performed to investigate the effect of ULF waves on precipitation. The simulations track the behavior of energetic electrons near the loss cone, using guiding center techniques, coupled with an MHD simulation of the magnetosphere, using the LFM code, during a CME-shock event on March 17, 2013. Results indicate that ULF modulation of precipitation occurs even without the presence of VLF-type waves, which are not resolved in the MHD simulation.",

We use a dataset of 4000 stable long-term waterlevel records from the United States in combination with new datasets of perennial streams and watershed delineations and existing estimates of groundwater recharge. Transmissivity was calculated using simple analytical solutions and numerical models of groundwater flow that include a more realistic exchange with surface water bodies and evapotranspiration. We perform an uncertainty analysis to account for uncertainty in recharge, waterlevels and elevation data. We discuss how well we can predict transmissivity using these large-scale datasets and how the calibrated values of transmissivity correlate with lithology and geological setting.",

            "abstract": "The National Assessment of Hurricane-Induced Coastal Erosion Hazards combines measurements of beach morphology with storm hydrodynamics to produce forecasts of coastal change during storms for the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coastlines of the United States. Wave-induced water levels are estimated using modeled offshore wave height and period and measured beach slope (from dune toe to shoreline) through the empirical parameterization of Stockdon et al. (2006). Spatial and temporal variability in beach slope leads to corresponding variability in predicted wave setup and swash. Seasonal and storm-induced changes in beach slope can lead to differences on the order of a meter in wave runup elevation, making accurate specification of this parameter essential to skillful forecasts of coastal change. Spatial variation in beach slope is accounted for through alongshore averaging, but temporal variability in beach slope is not included in the final computation of the likelihood of coastal change. Additionally, input morphology may be years old and potentially very different than the conditions present during forecast storm.\nIn order to improve our forecasts of hurricane-induced coastal erosion hazards, the temporal variability of beach slope must be included in the final uncertainty of modeled wave-induced water levels. Frequently collected field measurements of lidar-based beach morphology are examined for study sites in Duck, North Carolina, Treasure Island, Florida, Assateague Island, Virginia, and Dauphin Island, Alabama, with some records extending over a period of 15 years. Understanding the variability of slopes at these sites will help provide estimates of associated water level uncertainty which can then be applied to other areas where lidar observations are infrequent, and improve the overall skill of future forecasts of storm-induced coastal change.\nStockdon, H.

            "abstract": "The Brahmaputra River occupied the tectonically active Sylhet Basin in eastern Bangladesh three times during the Holocene. With samples from more than 200 closely-spaced (3-5 km) boreholes, we take advantage of these discrete channel occupations and the high trapping efficiency of the subsiding basin to investigate dispersal of fluvial sediments. Experiment and theory suggest that depositional units transition from channels to lobes as transported sediment mass declines below ~30% of the total measured at the basin head. We test these ideas by reconstructing the geometry and grain size distributions of a large (30 m thick x 80 km wide) sand lobe formed during the mid-Holocene occupation (~7000-4000 years BP) of Sylhet Basin. Based on estimates of modern sediment discharge in the system, the volume of this sediment lobe is insufficient to account for the entire sediment budget. The smaller sediment volume is likely a consequence of reduced sediment discharge during a weakened monsoon. Additional sediment is likely to have also been routed out of the basin via an outlet located approximately along the modern Meghna River channel. Facies within Sylhet Basin can be characterized as stacked braidbelt sands in the proximal portion of the system, with isolated sand lenses further downstream, indicating a transition from a highly mobile braidbelt to a less mobile distributary system. The majority of bed load is extracted within a distance of ~150 km from the avulsion node, approximately coincident with the regional backwater reach of the Bengal Basin, suggesting a link between the hydraulic and “morphodynamic” backwater reaches of the system. Downstream fining is more rapid in sediments associated with the long-term occupation of Sylhet Basin, for which sediment is trapped over a relatively short distance within the sand wedge of central Sylhet Basin, than those from the early- and late-Holocene occupations, for which sediment is distributed over a longer path that follows the course of the Old Brahmaputra River. Fine-grained sediments preserved in the system do not display measureable downstream fining. The increased rate of sediment extraction in the eastern part of the basin is likely coupled with a subsidence maximum (~7 mm/year) associated with the foredeep of the Dauki thrust fault.",

Our investigation has focussed on the weather and climate indicators that favoured the high incidence of coffee rust disease in Central America in 2012 by assessing daily temperature and precipitation data available from 81 weather stations in the INSIVUMEH and ANACAFE networks located in Guatemala. The temperature data were interpolated to determine the corresponding daily data at 1250 farms located across Guatemala, between 400 and 1800 m elevation. Additionally, CHIRPS five day (pentad) data has been used to assess the anomalies between the 2012 and the climatological average precipitation data at farm locations. The weather conditions in 2012 displayed considerable variations from the climatological data. In general the minimum daily temperatures were higher than the corresponding climatology while the maximum temperatures were lower. As a result, the daily diurnal temperature range was generally lower than the corresponding climatological range, leading to an increased number of days where the temperatures fell within the optimal range for either influencing the susceptibility of the coffee plants to coffee rust development during the dry season, or for the development of lesions on the coffee leaves during the wet season. The coffee rust latency period was probably shortened as a result, and farms at high altitudes were impacted due to these increases in minimum temperature. Factors taken into consideration in developing indicators for coffee rust development include: the diurnal temperature range, altitude, the environmental lapse rate and the phenology. We will present the results of our study and discuss the potential for each of the derived weather and climatological indicators to be used within risk assessments and to eventually be considered for use within an early warning system for coffee rust disease.",

Furthermore, these processes are qualitatively different in each heliospheric region (supersonic SW, heliosheath, and LISM), potentially yielding over a dozen categories of charged and neutral particles with distinct properties as shown by kinetic simulations. We present a 3D multi-fluid MHD model with one primary and two secondary neutral fluids, an ion fluid for the mixture of SW and PUIs, and additional source terms for PUI pressure and density. Some charge exchanges produce hot ions which are grouped together as PUIs, while others produce ions with similar properties to the SW. This approach is supposed to bring the accuracy of the fluid model closer to that of kinetic models, in addition to reproducing phenomena observed by spacecraft, e.g., Voyager and IBEX.",

We want to have a better understanding how of how the optical properties of biomass burning aerosols, coming from cooking and forest wildfires, interact with light and affect the Earths radiation budget and its impact on climate. Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometry and integrating Nephelometry was used to determine the extinction of scattering and absorbing polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres of 390 nm and 404nm respectfully and a soot sample of 400 nm. The extinction coefficients obtained for the scattering 404 nm PSL spheres, 390 nm absorbing PSL spheres and the soot sample were: 1.337E-05 m-1, 9.569E-05 m-1, and 2.200E-05 m-1 respectively. The Single Scattering Albedo was also obtained for the lab standards, which were 0.7077 for the scattering PSL spheres and 0.0643 for the absorbing PSL spheres. Samples for the flaming stage and smoldering stage were observed under a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to study how their morphology varies from one stage to the other. We determined the soot sample can attenuate light but less than what our PSL spheres are capable of after comparing extinction cross-sections. Error correlations need to be determined for the 400 nm soot particles and be applied to our data. Lastly, different morphologies were observed for the two burning stages analyzed under the SEM.",

            "abstract": "Estimating space-time variability in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is critical both to understanding the dynamical interaction between components of the climate system and to predicting climate change. Addressing these issues is challenged by the fact that the AMOC is poorly observed on decadal and centennial timescales, limiting our ability to document and understand the variability, and to assess the accuracy of forecasts over a wide range of historical conditions. The key to both the variability and the prediction problems lies in objective estimates of the AMOC over long periods of time from sparse and noisy measurements. Here we present a novel data assimilation technique that operates across multiple time scales to robustly estimate and predict the AMOC. We find that the AMOC is most skillfully reconstructed by incorporating observations of the climate system across multiple time scales compared to using observations at short (monthly to annual) or long (decadal) time scales alone. Moreover, we find that the AMOC may be estimated from atmospheric observations or proxies alone. Finally, the recovered states allow for estimates of the AMOC predictability timescale.",

            "abstract": "Extreme flow conditions such as droughts and floods are in general the direct consequences of short- to long-term weather/climate anomalies. For example, in southern Quebec, Canada, winter and summer 7-day low flows are due to summer and fall precipitations. Which prompts the question: is it possible to assess future extreme flow conditions from meteorological/climate indices or should we rely on the classical approach of using outputs of climate models as input to a hydrological model? The objective of this study is to assess six hydrological indices describing extreme flows at the watershed scale (Qmax, Qmin;7d, Qmin;30d for two seasons: winter and summer) using local climate indices without relying on the aforementioned classical approach.\nTo establish the relationship between climate and hydrological indices, daily precipitations, minimum and maximum temperatures from 89 climate projections are used as inputs to a distributed hydrological model. River flows are simulated at the outlet of the Yamaska and Bécancour watersheds in Québec for the 1961-2100 periods. To identify the best predictors, hydrological indices are extracted from the flow series, and climate indices are computed for different time intervals (from a day up to four years). The difference between four-month, cumulative, climatic demand (P-ETP) explains 69% of the 7-day summer low flow during the calibration process. For both watersheds, preliminary findings indicate that the selected indices explain, on average, 38 and 60% of the variability of high- and low-flow indices, respectively. Overall, the results clearly illustrate that the change in the hydrological indices can be detected through the concurrent trends in the climate indices. The use of many climate projections ensures the relationships are not simulation-dependent and shows summer events are particularly at risk with increasing high flows and decreasing low flows.\nThe development of a simple predictive tool to assess the impact of climate change on flows represents one of the major spin-off benefits of this study and may prooveto be useful to municipalities concerned with source water and flood management. Future work includes development of additional climate indices and application of the framework to more watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Multiple rotational, transitional, and lateral spread landslides have occurred in south central Idaho where basalt lava flows overly unconsolidated lake and fluvial sediments at the Sinking Canyon. The canyon is about 0.1 km deep and 0.25-1 km wide along a 4-km segment of the Salmon Falls Creek (SFC). Local topography and hydrological conditions are most likely the major triggering factors that have initiated landslides by increasing the gravitational stresses and weakening the canyon wall materials. Landslide activity has created natural dams of SFC, which in turn has resulted in forming large lakes with a potential flooding hazard to life and property downstream. In this study, we use campaign Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements of 2003-2004 and Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometric (InSAR) data acquired during 1992-2007 by the European radar satellites (ERS-1 and ERS-2) to identify, monitor, and analyze recent landslide activity at SFC. Results show that three main landslides have been active during the period of observation: the Salmon Falls landslide (SFL) that has been first reported in 1999, the historical 1937 landslide, and a third unnamed landslide to the north of the 1937 slide. InSAR measurements indicate that the SFL has been active during the period of our earliest interferogram (1992-1993) whereas the slide head has detached and has moved away from the eastern canyon wall about 3 cm. Over the years, the SFL body and toe have been pushed westward repetitively at rates of about 3-7 cm/yr. The toe is confined by the western canyon wall and thus is pushed upward in some years causing slight uplift (2-3 cm). Our field observations reveal many transverse and radial cracks associated with the deformation pattern caused by recurring motions. The historic 1937 slide is the largest mass wasting and is the least active landslide in the study area. The unnamed slide shows episodic activity with varying rates (0-4 cm/yr) of line-of-sight motions. This geodetic study allows identifying unstable slopes and improves understanding of how different landslide parts behave relative to each other to create advanced kinematic models. Understanding landslide dynamics is crucial for mitigating potential hazards and avoiding costly consequences.",

            "abstract": "Bathymetry has been a missing piece in understanding ice-ocean interactions of marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland. As bathymetry in fjords often controls the flow of warm water to the terminus of the glacier, and the grounding line depth of the glacier can modulate the effect of this warm water on the glacier. Study of Tracy and Heilprin Glaciers, a pair of neighboring glaciers in northwest Greenland, has indicated that when exposed to similar external forcings, the glacier with the deeper grounding line will retreat more rapidly. The new comprehensive mapping of grounding line depths with Operation IceBridge gravity inversions provides the basis for examining this question for all of Greenland’s glaciers. \nWe consider 54 distinct glaciers in our analysis. Grounding line depths for these 54 come from data collected by Operation IceBridge from 2010-2012. New grounding line depths for 36 glaciers are derived from gravity measurements in locations where radar is unable to retrieve grounding line depths. 18 grounding line depths come from CReSIS Multichannel Coherent Depth Sounder radar data. Offshore bathymetry in all 54 fjords is gravity-derived. The gravity-derived bathymetry is always constrained onshore by radar, and when possible pinned offshore to acoustic bathymetric measurements.\nHere we present the gravity-derived grounding line depths along with recent glacier behavior, including surface lowering and terminus retreat, of these 54 glaciers. In general, the glaciers with deeper grounding lines are experiencing greater mass loss. This relationship between grounding line depth and mass balance extends to much of Greenland. We systematically discuss this relationship in the different major regions of Greenland, and note that the relationship is strongest in the southeast, and weakest in the north.",

            "abstract": "Elevation dependent snowmelt magnitude and timing strongly influences net ecosystem productivity in forested mountain watersheds. However, previous work has provided little insight into how internal watershed topography and organization may modulate plant available water and forest growth across elevation gradients. We collected 800 tree cores from five coniferous tree species across a range of elevations, topographic positions and aspects in the Lubrecht Experimental Forest, Montana, USA. We compared the annual basal area increment growth rate to precipitation and temperature from a 60-year SNOTEL data record, groundwater and soil moisture data in sideslope and hollow positions, and topographic indices derived from a LiDAR digital elevation model. At the watershed scale, we evaluated the relationships between topographic indices, LiDAR derived estimates of basal area and seasonal patterns of the Landsat derived Enhanced Vegetation Index. Preliminary results indicate strong relationships between the rates of annual basal growth and the topographic wetness index (TWI) , with differing slopes dependent on tree species (P. menziesii R2 = 0.66-0.71, P. ponderosa R2 = 0.87, L. occidentalis R2 = 0.71) and elevation. Generally, trees located in wetter landscape positions (higher TWI) exhibited greater annual growth per unit of precipitation relative to trees located in drier landscape positions (lower TWI). Watershed scale analysis of LiDAR derived biomass and seasonal greenness indicates differential growth response due to elevation gradients, irradiance and local convergence and divergence. These preliminary observations suggest that topographically driven water redistribution patterns may modulate the effects of large scale gradients in precipitation and temperature, thereby creating hotspots for conifer productivity in semiarid watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Tropical glaciers are an important component of the water budget for high-altitude catchments in much of the central Andes. The majority of tropical Andean glaciers are small, but it has been suggested that because of their numbers the volume of water they contain is significant. Unfortunately, the ice volume measurements needed to inform decision makers have been made for only a handful of tropical glaciers. In August 2012, with the assistance of the Instituto Geográfico Militar in Bolivia, ground penetrating radar (GPR) and differential Global Positioning System (dGPS) measurements were collected along transects totaling 3,189 m in length on the Charquini SE cirque glacier. This small cirque glacier which is located in the southern portion of the Cordillera Real in Bolivia had an approximate surface area in 2012 of 02.42 square kilometers. Our initial observations indicate that the GPR survey was able to adequately capture the ice bedrock interface. Ordinary Kriging was used to develop maps of surface and subsurface topography from the dGPS and GPR observations. In 2012, the Charquini SE glacier contained a minimum of 3,900,000 cubic meters of ice. This information, along with other recent volume measurements for tropical and sub-tropical Andean glaciers, was used to update earlier volume-area scaling relationships established for these glaciers. This relationship will then be applied to determine the volume of water currently stored in tropical Andean glaciers based on previous research on glaciers areas using remote sensing.",

Specifically land use and land cover change due to urban expansion changes the surface albedo, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity of the surface. Consequently, the energy balance in urban region is different from that of natural surfaces. In this research, we apply the coupled WRF-NOAH-UCM, which includes a detailed urban radiation scheme, to evaluate the changes in regional climate that would arise due to projected urbanization in the Phoenix-Tucson corridor, in Arizona. We use the land cover data for 2005 and projections to 2050 (for areas north to Tucson from Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) using the Red Dot Algorithm (RDA), and for areas around Tucson and South is from SLEUTH model) with historical North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data as the lateral boundary condition. Result shows that temperature changes are well defined and reflect the urban heat island (UHI) effect within the areas experiencing LULCC. The heat index is also examined, the magnitude of change is similar to that of temperature change. The timing of the maximum and minimum temperature is delayed by approximately one hour. Precipitation was analyzed according to both the occurrence of rainfall and according to flow regime, however no clear evidence of changes in precipitation amount or occurrence was found due to urbanization.",

            "abstract": "River avulsions and earthquakes can be hazardous events, and many researchers work to better understand and predict their timescales. Improvements in the understanding of the intrinsic processes of deposition and strain accumulation that lead to these events have resulted in better constraints on the timescales of each process individually. There are however several mechanisms by which these two systems may plausibly become linked. River deposition and avulsion can affect the stress on underlying faults through differential loading by sediment or water. Conversely, earthquakes can affect river avulsion patterns through altering the topography. These interactions may alter the event recurrence timescales, but this dynamic has not yet been explored. We present results of a simple numerical model, in which two systems have intrinsic rates of approach to failure thresholds, but the state of one system contributes to the other’s approach to failure through coupling functions. The model is first explored for the simplest case of two linear approaches to failure, and linearly proportional coupling terms. Intriguing coupling dynamics emerge: the system settles into cycles of repeating earthquake and avulsion timescales, which are approached at an exponential decay rate that depends on the coupling terms. The ratio of the number of events of each type and the timescale values also depend on the coupling coefficients and the threshold values. We then adapt the model to a more complex and realistic scenario, in which a river avulses between either side of a fault, with parameters corresponding to the Brahmaputra River / Dauki fault system in Bangladesh. Here the tectonic activity alters the topography by gradually subsiding during the interseismic time, and abruptly increasing during an earthquake. The river strengthens the fault by sediment loading when in one path, and weakens it when in the other. We show this coupling can significantly affect earthquake and avulsion recurrence times. We also find a significant probability of event co-occurrence, where avulsions are induced by earthquakes. This model sets up a framework for the study of earthquakes and avulsions as a coupled dynamical system, and shows the importance of understanding this dynamic for prediction of hazard recurrence intervals.",

            "abstract": "Continental weathering links the atmosphere, hydrosphere and continents as it regulates the CO2 content of the atmosphere, shifts the composition of the continental crust from basaltic to andesitic, and ultimately controls the chemical composition of river waters and seawater. Magnesium is a water-soluble major element in the hydrosphere, continental crust and the mantle, and has three stable isotopes (24Mg, 25Mg and 26Mg). Studies of Mg isotopes during continental weathering may help to document the interactions between hydrosphere, crust and mantle. Previous studies have shown that the continental crust has a heterogeneous but on average heavier Mg isotopic composition than the mantle, whereas the hydrosphere is isotopically light. The complementary characteristics of Mg isotopic compositions between continental and hydrosphere have been attributed to continental weathering, with light Mg isotopes partitioned into water, leaving heavy Mg isotopes behind in the crustal residue. Here we summarize our studies of Mg isotope fractionation in four weathering profiles under various climate conditions. We show that large Mg isotope fractionation can occur during continental weathering. Although the weathered residue is usually enriched in heavier Mg isotopes than unaltered parent rocks, some heavily weathered products can be quite light in Mg isotopic composition. The complicated behaviors of Mg isotopes reflect different control factors during weathering such as parent rock lithology, primary mineral dissolution, secondary mineral formation, ion exchange, vegetation uptake etc. Though studies of natural samples can provide direct evidence on isotope fractionation, more well-controlled laboratory experiments on Mg isotope fractionation between fluids and minerals are needed in order to fully understand the behaviors of Mg isotopes during weathering, which ultimately lays the foundation for making Mg isotope geochemistry an important tool for studying different geological problems.

            "abstract": "Petrographic microscopy of smear slides is the standard method to initially investigate marine sediments in core sediment studies (e.g. IODP expeditions). The technique is not commonly used in more complex analysis due to concerns over the subjectivity of the method and variability in operator training and experience. Two initiatives sponsored by Ocean Leadership, a sedimentology training workshop and a digital reference of smear slide components (Marsaglia et al., 2013) have been implemented to address the need for advanced training. While the influence of subjectivity on the quality of data has yet to be rigorously tested, the lack of standardization in the current method of smear slide analysis (SSA) remains a concern.\nThe relative abundance of the three main components, (total diatoms, silt-to-sand sized siliciclastics, and clay minerals) of high and low density Bering Sea hemi-pelagic sediments from the ocean margin (Site U144; Site U1339) and pelagic sediments from the open-ocean (Site U1340) were analyzed. Our analyses show visual estimation is a reproducible method to quantify the relative abundance of the main sediment components. Furthermore, we present a modified method for SSA, with procedural changes objectively guided by statistical analyses, including constraints to increase randomness and precision in both the preparation and analysis of the smear slide. For example, repeated measure ANOVAs found a smear slide could be accurately quantified by counting three fields of view. Similarly, the use of replicate smear slides to quantify a sample was analyzed.\nFinally, the data produced from this modified SSA shows a strong correlation to continuously logged physical parameters of sediment such as gamma ray attenuation (Site U1339 r2= 0.41; Site U1340 r2= 0.36). Therefore, the modified SSA combined with other independent methods (e.g. laser particle size analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and physical properties) can be a very effective tool for the interpretation and the quantitative analysis of lithologic variability in marine sediments.",

            "abstract": "Following the launch of European Space Agency's (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission, it has been shown that brightness temperatures at a low microwave frequency of 1.4 GHz (about 21 cm wave length) are sensitive to sea ice properties. In contrast to the higher frequencies at which previous microwave sensors have been operated, the radiation over sea ice measured at L-band originates not only from the surface but also from the deeper parts of the ice, thus contains information of sea ice thickness. An iterative retrieval algorithm has been developed, based on a thermodynamic sea ice model and a three-layer radiative transfer model. The algorithm explicitly takes variations of ice temperature and ice salinity into account. Furthermore, ice thickness variations within a SMOS footprint are considered through a statistical thickness distribution function. This algorithm has been used for the continuous operational production of SMOS-based sea ice thickness data set from 2010 on at the University of Hamburg. In the current operational retrieval algorithm, the emissivity model does not correctly account for vertical gradients of ice temperature and salinity. The invalid assumption of a vertically homogeneous ice layer could introduce uncertainties because the relative brine volume and thus the permittivity depends on ice temperature and salinity. A first investigation of the influence of ice temperature gradient on the ice permittivity, and thus the retrieval of SMOS ice thickness will be shown.",

            "abstract": "In recent decades, bark beetle infestation in western North America has reached epidemic levels. The resulting widespread forest mortality may have profound effects on present and future water and carbon cycling with potential negative consequences to a region that relies on water from montane and subalpine watersheds. We simulated stand-level ecosystem fluxes of water and carbon at two bark beetle-attacked conifer forests in southeast Wyoming, USA. The lower elevation site dominated by lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) was attacked by mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) during 2008-2010. The high elevation Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) dominated site was attacked by the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) during roughly the same time period. Both beetle infestations resulted in >60% canopy mortality in the footprint of eddy covariance towers located at each site. However, carbon and water fluxes responses to mortality depended on the forest type. Using data collected at the sites, we scaled simulated plant hydraulic conductivity by either percent canopy mortality or loss of live tree basal area during infestation. We also simulated a case of no beetle attack. At the lodgepole site, the no-beetle model best fit the data and showed no significant change in growing season carbon flux and a 15% decrease in evapotranspiration (ET). However, at the spruce site, the simulation that tracked canopy loss agreed best with observations: carbon flux decreased by 72% and ET decreased by 31%. In the lodgepole stand, simulated soil water content agreed with spatially distributed measurements that were weighted to reflect overall mortality in the tower footprint. Although these two forest ecosystems are only 20 km apart, separated by less than 300m in elevation, and have been impacted by similar mortality agents, the associated changes in carbon and water cycling are significantly different. Beetle effects on hydrologic cycling were greatest at high elevation due to slow succession, which is the predominant regional water source from higher snowpack amounts. The surprising lack of bark beetle impacts at the lodgepole pine site may be due to faster than expected succession as suggested by vegetation measurements.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing is a powerful tool for measuring the current state of vegetation and monitoring changes over time with repeated data collections. Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data is especially well suited for mapping 3D vegetation structure.  In 2010, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) contracted LiDAR and hyperspectral airborne data collections over the Ordway-Swisher Biological Station (OSBS). Ground truth campaigns were also conducted in 2010, 2011, and 2014 including structural measurements and generation of species lists for a set of ground validation plots. The vegetation communities at OSBS can be characterized by the Florida Natural Areas Inventory (FNAI) classification system, with a large area of the property belonging to the Sandhill community. For this study, classification algorithm training locations are hand selected for each FNAI community type using photo-interpretation. A series of LiDAR metrics are calculated on the discrete return point clouds and derived digital elevation (DEM) and canopy height models (CHM). A decision tree classification algorithm is run using R package “rpart”. A main goal of the project is to relate the LiDAR metrics used by the decision tree to direct canopy structural quantities. For instance, the canopy 75th minus the 50th percentile height in the LiDAR point clouds are related to the uniformity and light penetration in the upper canopy. A prototype of the decision tree achieved a classification accuracy of 89% on the training data itself, suggesting that some locations in different FNAI vegetation communities have similar structure and could not be distinguished in the LiDAR metrics used. An improved decision tree is currently under development which will include more training locations and more LiDAR metrics as input features. Results from this improved model will be presenting using the NEON ground truth locations as an independent and quantitative validation measure of the decision tree classification accuracy. Finally, a classification map is generated for entire site. Future work with the flux tower measurements, field vegetation observations, and airborne hyperspectral data from NEON at OSBS will facilitate analysis of how ecosystem structure is connected to ecosystem function.",

            "abstract": "Implementation of quantitative metrics for inter-sample comparison of detrital geochronological data sets has lagged the increase in data set size, and ability to identify sub-populations and quantify their relative proportions. Visual comparison or application of some statistical approaches, particularly the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, that initially appeared to provide a simple way of comparing detrital data sets, may be inadequate to quantify their similarity. We evaluate several proposed metrics by applying them to four large synthetic datasets drawn randomly from a parent dataset, as well as a recently published large empirical dataset consisting of four separate (n = ~1000 each) analyses of the same rock sample. Visual inspection of the cumulative probability density functions (CDF) and relative probability density functions (PDF) confirms an increasingly close correlation between data sets as the number of analyses increases. However, as data set size increases the KS test yields lower mean p-values implying greater confidence that the samples were not drawn from the same parent population and high standard deviations despite minor decreases in the mean difference between sample CDFs. We attribute this to the increasing sensitivity of the KS test when applied to larger data sets, which in turn limits its use for quantitative inter-sample comparison in detrital geochronology.\nProposed alternative metrics, including Similarity, Likeness (complement to Mismatch), and the coefficient of determination (R2) of a cross-plot of PDF quantiles, point to an increasingly close correlation between data sets with increasing size, although they are the most sensitive at different ranges of data set sizes. The Similarity test is most sensitive to variation in data sets with n < 100 and is relatively insensitive to further convergence between larger data sets. The Likeness test reaches 90% of its asymptotic maximum at data set sizes of n = 200. The PDF cross-plot R2 value is sensitive across the maximum range of data set sizes, reaching 90% of its maximum at n = 400. These alternatives are easily implemented, provide quantitative comparisons regardless of the relative sample sizes, and, particularly in the case of the PDF cross-plot approach, are sensitive over a large range of data set sizes.",

Discharge records for stations above Tarbela (Indus), Mangla (Jhelum), Marala (Chenab) and Bhakra (Sutlej) dams have been examined for periods between 1920 and 2009, together with precipitation and air temperature data for stations with long records (within the period 1893 to 2013) at elevations between 234 and 3015 m a.s.l. Ice-cover age in the basins above the dams was between 1 and 12 %. Flows in the Sutlej, Chenab and Jhelum reached maxima in the 1950s before declining to the 1970s. Flow in the Chenab and Jhelum increased to 1950s levels in the 1990s, before falling steeply into the 2000s mimicking variations in winter and monsoon precipitation. Discharge in the Indus at Tarbela increased from the 1970s, reaching a maximum in the late 1980s/early 1990s, before declining back to 1970s levels in the 2000s, flow being influenced not only by precipitation fluctuations but also by changes in air temperature affecting glacier melt in headwater basins. Runoff at Bhakra was augmented by flow from the Beas-Sutlej link canal after 1977, but natural flow in the Sutlej above Luhri reduced considerably from the 1990s influenced by declining flows in the relatively dry but large Tibetan portion of the basin area. Large year-to-year fluctuations of reservoir inflows are nonetheless based on significant sustained underlying discharge levels at all four reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "The Hf and Nd isotope records of Earth's early history are sparse, difficult to interpret, and controversial, much like the few remnants of crust older than 4 Ga. New analytical techniques have been brought to bear on this problem but despite this recent work­–or, perhaps, because of it–the record is no clearer than it was 15 years ago. Several studies, based on highly variable calculated initial isotopic compositions, have argued for highly heterogeneous crust and mantle reservoirs in the early Earth1,2 and an ultra-depleted Eoarchean mantle3. These data come mostly from two sources: Hf-Nd isotope analyses of ultramafic rocks and Hf isotope analyses of zircons by solution or laser ablation. An important question for understanding the chemical evolution of the early Earth is: Do these data offer a unique window into the early Earth or are they artefacts not representative of crust/mantle evolution, giving an impaired view of the Earth's early history? In complex samples, measured isotopic compositions can result from open-system behavior in easily altered ultramafic compositions, in multicomponent, polymetamorphic gneisses, or in zircons with multiple generations of growth. Perhaps most importantly, accurate age assignment is often lacking, compromised, or impossible in these rocks, making calculation of initial epsilon Hf and Nd values ambiguous at best. In order to gain insight into crust mantle evolution in the early Earth we need, above all, a robust and unambiguous isotopic record to work with. This can be achieved by integrating zircon U-Pb and Hf and whole-rock Hf and Nd isotope compositions in relatively undisturbed igneous rocks with well-constrained ages. When this approach is used apparent isotopic heterogeneity decreases and a simpler model for crust-mantle evolution in the early Earth emerges. Careful screening of geological relationships, petrology, and geochemistry of samples from the early Earth should be done before interpreting isotopic data. Indiscriminate inclusion of isotope data from disturbed and multicomponent rocks and zircons will do more to obscure our understanding of the Hf-Nd isotope evolution of the Earth than to clarify it.\n [1] Harrison et al. 2005, Science 310, 1947-1950.\n[2] Blichert-Toft and Albarède, 2008, EPSL 265, 686-702.\n[3] Hoffmann et al., 2010, GCA, 74, 7236–7260.",

Based on the DRI Model 2001 carbon analyzer at 633 nm, major modifications were made on mechanical and electrical components, flow control, and the carbon detector to adopt modern technologies, increase instrument reliability, and reduce costs and maintenance. The correlation between wavelength-dependent light attenuation and organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC, respectively) content allows estimation of the amount of brown and black carbon (BrC and BC, respectively) on filters. Continuous monitoring of the light reflected from and transmitted through the filter along with carbon evolved from the filter when heated to different temperatures under either inert or oxidizing gas environments provides insights into the optical properties of the carbon released from the filter; it also allows examination of the charring process as pyrolyzed char has been one of the major uncertainties in quantifying OC and EC. The objectives of this study are: 1) establish performance equivalency between the Model 2015 and Model 2001 DRI carbon analyzers when comparing similar laser wavelength to maintain consistency for long-term network sample analysis; and 2) analyze the multi-wavelength signal to quantify BrC and BC, and to optimize char correction. A selection of samples, including standard chemicals, rural and urban ambient filters, and emission sources from biomass burning, diesel and gasoline engine exhaust, and resuspended dust were measured by both the Model 2015 and Model 2001 analyzers.

            "abstract": "The application of watershed simulation models is indispensable when pollution is generated by a nonpoint source. These models should be able to simulate large complex watersheds with varying soils, land use and management conditions over long periods of time. This study presents the application of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate, manage, and research the transport and fate of nutrients in (Subbasin HUC 16010204) Lower Bear Malad River (LBMR) watershed, Box elder County, Utah. Water quality problems arise primarily from high phosphorus and total suspended sediment concentrations that were caused by increasing agricultural and farming activities and complex network of canals and ducts of varying sizes and carrying capacities that transport water (for farming and agriculture uses). Using the available input data (Digital Elevation Model (DEM), land use/Land cover (LULC), soil map and weather and climate data for 20 years (1990-2010) to predict the water quantity and quality of the LBMR watershed using a spatially distributed model version of hydrological ArcSWAT model (ArcSWAT 2012.10_1.14). No previous studies have been found in the literature regarding an in-depth simulation study of the Lower Bear Malad River (LBMR) watershed to simulate stream flow and to quantify the associated movement of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment. It is expected that the model mainly will predict monthly mean total phosphorus (TP) concentration and loadings in a mountainous LBRM watershed (steep Wellsville mountain range with peak of (2,857 m)) having into consideration the snow and runoff variables affecting the prediction process. The simulated nutrient concentrations were properly consistent with observations based on the R2 and Nash- Sutcliffe fitness factors. Further, the model will be able to manage and assess the land application in that area with corresponding to proper BMPs regarding water quality management.\nKeywords: Water Quality Modeling; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); Lower Bear-Malad River (LBMR); Mountainous watershed",

            "abstract": "Assessing the regional natural variability of the climate is crucial to better describe, understand and estimate climate change. The capability of GCMs to estimate the natural variability of the meteorological observations is of upmost importance to assess the changes in extreme events such as floods or droughts. In this study, the inter-annual variability of the three variables precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature (tasmin and tasmax), was derived from gridded data sets over the meridional area of Québec, Eastern Canada, with a focus on the catchment of the Saguenay Fjord. Gridded observation data sets, derived from meteorological station measurements, furthermore strongly depend on the applied gridding algorithms. To address the uncertainty associated to this issue, an ensemble of three gridded data sets, based on different interpolation methods, was applied for the period 1970 - 1999. The inter-annual variability of a 40-member ensemble of the Community Climate System Model Version 3 (CCSM3), by the National Center for Atmospheric Research, was compared to the variability in these three observation grids. To compare the 40 members with the observations, the linear trend was removed in all data sets, hence the variability in the observations should be fully covered by the CCSM3 members, as only 30 years of observations are available, compared to 2400 years of modeled data (40 members x 60 years transient run from 2000 - 2059), which more likely include extremes with lower recurrence rates, than the 30 year data sets. Variability was assessed for different spatial scales, starting from the 10km grid of the observations to the ~ 320km grid of the GCM. Furthermore, various temporal scales were analyzed to determine the number of years required to properly capture inter-annual variability. The performed analyses show, that the CCSM3 ensemble estimates all variations in the observations for tasmax and precipitation, however there seems to be a slight underestimation of tasmin for the researched area. Furthermore, the regional patterns of inter-annual variability vary strongly in the three observation datasets.",

            "abstract": "A new method for glacier surface velocity (GSV) estimates is proposed here which combines ground- and space-based measurements with hidden state space modeling (HSSM). Examples of such a fusion of physical models with remote sensing (RS) observations were described in (Henke & Meier, Hidden State Space Models for Improved Remote Sensing Applications, ITISE 2014, p. 1242-1255) and are currently adapted for GSV estimation.\nGSV can be estimated using in situ measurements, RS methods or numerical simulations based on ice-flow models. In situ measurements ensure high accuracy but limited coverage and time consuming field work, while RS methods offer regular observations with high spatial coverage generally not possible with in situ methods. In particular, spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can obtain useful images independent of daytime and cloud cover. A ground portable radar interferometer (GPRI) is useful for investigating a particular area in more detail than is possible from space, but provides local coverage only. Several processing methods for deriving GSV from radar sensors have been established, including interferometry and offset tracking (Schubert et al, Glacier surface velocity estimation using repeat TerraSAR-X images. ISPRS Journal of P&RS, p. 49-62, 2013).\nOn the other hand, it is also possible to derive glacier parameters from numerical ice-flow modeling alone. Given a well-parameterized model, GSV can in theory be derived and propagated continuously in time. However, uncertainties in the glacier flow dynamics and model errors increase with excessive propagation. All of these methods have been studied independently, but attempts to combine them have only rarely been made.\nThe HSSM we propose recursively estimates the GSV based on 1) a process model making use of temporal and spatial interdependencies between adjacent states, and 2) observations (RS and optional in situ). The in situ and GPRI images currently being processed were acquired in the Swiss Alps (Jungfrau-Aletsch) and Greenland (Eqip Sermia). TerraSAR-X satellite images were acquired and processed over the Aletsch Glacier during the same period. For the Eqip Sermia glacier, data from the new Sentinel-1 satellite will be available soon, providing a high revisit time near the pole, increasing the expected accuracy of GSV estimates.",

            "abstract": "Forest disturbances have important impacts on regional and global carbon-climate feedbacks. Tree mortality resulting from disturbance can cause large areas to transition from carbon (C) sinks to C sources. Although severe acute disturbance, such as fire, has been quantified extensively in the literature, the impacts of disturbance that cause more spatially heterogeneous, gradual, mortality, such as beetle kill, are more difficult to quantify and have not been studied as extensively. Combining a 13 year time series of 250 meter, 16-day, MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data with field data on insect mortality collected by the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, we have produced large-scale maps of dead woody biomass resulting from insect epidemics.\nUsing a change detection algorithm, we were able to determine the timing and severity of changes in EVI due to insect epidemics across the western United States. A model was created to predict biomass based on EVI and a variety of environmental variables. Using the difference between post- and pre-outbreak EVI values, we were able to estimate the loss of biomass during insect outbreaks. These biomass data were then converted to carbon as a percentage of dry biomass using the Jenkins equations. This spatially explicit map of C currently stored in beetle kill wood will allow us to assess the vulnerability of this C to re-entering the atmosphere as CO2 via combustion or decomposition.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic modeling is an essential component to understanding the physical processes that govern water resources systems. The process representation, approach, and scale used in each model can vary greatly among scientific domains. In addition, many models use proprietary data input and output file formats making it difficult to share results among scientists. These factors limit the extent to which cross disciplinary models can grow, and as a result, restricts collaboration across academic disciplines. The heterogeneity of data formats among models also inhibits archival due to the lack of consistent metadata and the inability to quickly inspect file contents. This work investigates a method for archiving model simulation input and output time series data in an easily accessible manner. We present a relational data model for representing simulation-based data that extends the functionality of the Observations Data Model (version 2). We demonstrate its use by implementing a PostgreSQL database with geospatial support via PostGIS, and illustrate how it is used to store and retrieve data to facilitate sharing among models and scientists.",

The course draws students from all disciplines with varying levels of understanding of scientific approaches and often limited familiarity with climate issues. Its discussion sessions seek to foster scientific literacy via an alternating series of assignments focused on a combination of exercises that involve either examination and interpretation of on-line climate data or consideration and assessment of the scientific basis of new discoveries about climate change contained in recently published media articles. The final assignment linked to the discussion sessions requires students to review and summarize the topics discussed during the semester. Their answers provide direct evidence of newly acquired abilities to assimilate and evaluate scientific information on a range of topics related to climate change. In addition, student responses to an end-of-semester survey confirm that the vast majority considers that their knowledge and understanding of climate change was enhanced, and unsolicited comments note that the discussion sessions contributed greatly to this advancement. Many students remarked that the course’s emphasis on examination of paleoclimate records helped their comprehension of the unprecedented nature of present-day climate trends. Others reported that their views on the significance of climate change had been transformed, and some commented that they now felt well equipped to engage in discussions about climate change because they were better informed about its scientific basis and facts.",

            "abstract": "Super Typhoon (STY) Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines with sustained winds of 315 kph producing a 7+ meter storm surge that inundated parts of Leyte and Samar; >8000 died, > 106 homes were destroyed, and thousands of people are still missing. The surge reached 1 km inland and resulted in widespread seawater (SW) contamination of groundwater (GW) resources critical for coastal villages.\nWe conducted field-work in a village of ~2200 residents, inundated by a 5-6 m surge, 2 months and again 8 months after STY Haiyan. The 330+ shallow tube wells (STWs) had been drilled through beach sand into karstic reef carbonates to 5-20m below the water table (WT). Residents reported their STWs salinized immediately after the storm, even the deepest wells, and the only source of fresh water was a karst spring 1 km from the village. 2 months after the storm GW salinity was up to 18% SW. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) was used to image salt distribution in the surficial aquifer alongside the developed village. ERT detected an electrically conductive layer ~1m below the WT, and water sampling confirmed that this was due to infiltrated seawater. Variable-density flow and transport models corroborate the ER tomograms and show that the salt is infiltrating through the aquifer and slowly flushing to the ocean.\nWe hypothesize that SW rapidly infiltrated the ~2m sandy unsaturated zone and contaminated the shallow GW over a wide area. This salt layer is slowly sinking and flushing toward the ocean, and flow models show that it might be several years to flush the system. Results from a second ERT survey 6 months later show little change in the ER field, consistent with model predictions. But karst features and the STWs themselves served as preferential paths into the aquifer for SW injection to the deeper zone under the 6m surge potential, salinizing deep wells ahead of the advancing shallow SW layer. These wells have seen substantial decrease in salinity over 6 months, as much as 75%, with many approaching acceptable drinking water criteria (TDS<600ppm, WHO). We hypothesize that the deep-injected SW is being quickly flushed out by the coastward flow of fresh GW, enhanced by primary and secondary porosity in the carbonate aquifer. It is unclear however if the slowly sinking shallow layer of salt will contaminate STWs in the future.",

Chemicals within snow and ice are found in three different compartments: distributed in the bulk ice, concentrated in liquid-like regions (LLRs) within the ice matrix (such as at grain boundaries), or in quasi-liquid layers at the air-ice interface. While some experiments suggest reaction rates may vary in these different compartments, it is not clear if the reaction rates are different or if the changes are due to variations in the reaction environment (such as photon flux). A companion presentation discusses our work identifying solute location in laboratory ice samples; here, we describe experimental measurements of reaction rates in different ice compartments.\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are common pollutants in snow and ice. We first prepared aqueous solutions of a single PAH. We then froze these samples using various methods that segregate the solute into different locations in the ice matrix. With simulated sunlight, we illuminated these samples and measured photon flux (using 2-nitrobenzaldehyde) and the photodecay of the PAH. We will discuss differences in PAH photochemistry as a function of location in the ice sample and the implications of these results for environmental snow and ice.",

We show that the convergence velocities are perpendicular to the curvature of the arc, and decrease to the west and increase towards the east. Motion in the east is complicated due to intraplate deformation of India which we account for using a block model. We find that the fault is fully locked along its complete length, with no resolvable creeping patches in the 0-20km seismogenic depth range. We estimate the deficit of seismic moment which accumulates in the interseismic period and investigate how this moment could be released. Analysing the current seismic catalogue of this region, we find that a significant proportion of the moment building up has not been released seismically. We suggest various reasons for this and discuss possible solutions to close the slip budget.

            "abstract": "Bromine oxide (BrO) is a halogen radical that catalytically destroys ozone, modifies the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere and oxidizes atmospheric mercury. About 75% of the global tropospheric ozone loss occurs at tropical latitudes, where the ozone radiative forcing is most sensitive to changes in the ozone concentration. Here we report on BrO observations in the tropical and sub-tropical free troposphere and UTLS. Airborne measurements of BrO vertical profiles were performed by the University of Colorado Airborne Multi Axis DOAS (CU AMAX-DOAS) instrument aboard the NSF/NCAR GV aircraft. We compare BrO profiles measured at tropical and subtropical latitudes over the Western Pacific (CONvective TRansport of Active Species in the Tropics, CONTRAST, field campaign) with tropical BrO profiles measured over the Central (Mauna Loa Observatory fly-by) and Eastern Pacific ocean (Tropical Ocean tRoposphere Exchange of Reactive halogen species and Oxygenated VOC, TORERO, experiment). For selected case studies we compare BrO profiles from three independent instruments, i.e., CU AMAX-DOAS, mountain-top MAX-DOAS at Mauna Loa Observatory, and Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry and BrO predictions from global models (CAM-Chem, GEOS-Chem and RAQMS).",

            "abstract": "The Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals SHERLOC investigation was recently selected for the Mars 2020 integrated payload. SHERLOC enables non-contact, spatially resolved, and highly sensitivity detection and characterization of organics and minerals in the Martian surface and near subsurface. SHERLOC is an arm-mounted, Deep UV (DUV) resonance Raman and fluorescence spectrometer utilizing a 248.6-nm DUV laser and 50 micron spot size. The laser is integrated to an autofocusing/scanning optical system, and co-boresighted to a context imager with a spatial resolution of 30 µm. SHERLOC operates over a 7 × 7 mm area through use of an internal scanning mirror. The 500 micron depth of view in conjunction with the MAHLI heritage autofocus mechanisms enables arm placements from 48 ±12.5 mm above natural or abraded surfaces without the need for rover arm repositioning/movement. Additionally, borehole interiors to a depth of ~25 mm, at angles from normal incidence to ±20 degrees, can be analyzed.\nDeep UV induced native fluorescence is very sensitive to condensed carbon and aromatic organics, enabling detection at or below 10-6 w/w (1 ppm) at <100 µm spatial scales. SHERLOC’s deep UV resonance Raman enables detection and classification of aromatic and aliphatic organics with sensitivities of 10-2 to below 10-4 w/w at <50 µm spatial scales. In addition to organics, the deep UV Raman enables detection and classification of minerals relevant to aqueous chemistry with grain sizes below 20 µm grains.\nThe instrument goals are to assess past aqueous history, detect the presence and preservation of potential biosignatures, and to support selection of return samples. To do this, SHERLOC will measure CHNOPS-containing mineralogy, measure the distribution and type of organics preserved at the surface, and correlate them to textural features.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the interactions between groundwater and surface water is critical to the future sustainability of communities in semi-arid watersheds. Streamflow is the primary source of water for acequias and irrigation in many semi-arid watersheds and sustained perennial streamflow is thought to depend on greater fractions of deep groundwater following the snowmelt pulse. The persistent perception is that deep groundwater is not a significant component of streamflow generation despite recent observations in the Saguache Creek and Rio Hondo watersheds refuting this perception. Recent research indicates that groundwater/surface water interactions are very complex in the El Rito watershed, a mountainous, sedimentary watershed in northern New Mexico. The El Rito watershed can be broken into four distinct hydrogeological zones: 1) perennial streamflow in the headwaters maintained by springs and groundwater discharge, 2) losing conditions downstream of the headwaters, 3) a small, persistent 500 m gaining stretch in the mid-reach, and 4) losing conditions from the mid-reaches to the outlet. In this poster, we investigate the processes controlling zone 3. We hypothesize that extensional faulting associated with the Rio Grande Rift combined with the westerly dip of stratigraphic units are responsible for the creation of the small gaining reach. We test this hypothesis using high-resolution stream gauging, radon measurements in streams and springs, electrical resistivity surveys, geologic mapping, and temperature logging of streamflow. Our data show that the upwelling occurs near a small east-west trending fault contact characterized by a sharp contrast in water table depth (higher water tables downstream of the fault), persistent and spatially confined temperature anomalies in streamflow associated with the discharge of groundwater. These data provide support for the hypothesis and indicate that structural geologic and stratigraphic features may have profound effects on groundwater/surface water interactions. Without the fault, there would be no gaining reach and without the gaining reach, the acequias may not contain water. This research also highlights the need to properly characterize the 3D geologic structure of watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Melt inclusions provide important constraints on the behavior of magmatic volatiles; however, our understanding is hindered by a lack of temporal constraints on volatile evolution. Melt inclusions in zircon crystals have the unique potential to provide a temporal record of pre-eruptive magmatic volatile abundances through radiometric U-Pb or U-Th dating of zircon hosts.\nWe present work on zircon-hosted melt inclusions (ZHMIs) from the ~74 ka Youngest Toba Tuff (hereafter: Toba), Sumatra, Indonesia. Zircon separated from Toba pumice contain abundant melt inclusions of ovoid or irregular-wormy forms, which range in size from 5-50 μm. Cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging of Toba zircon show that many ovoid melt inclusions and all the irregular melt inclusions occur within areas of zircon growth following earlier dissolution events. These zones crosscut oscillatory-zoned zircon and have negligible CL variability, suggesting that remineralizion and entrapment of melt inclusions may have occurred relatively quickly. Some inclusions do occur within regions of oscillatory CL zonation, indicating melt entrapment also occurs during primary crystal growth.\nElectron microprobe analyses show no significant compositional differences between ovoid and irregular-shaped inclusions. Toba ZHMIs are chemically similar to quartz-hosted melt inclusions (Chesner and Luhr, 2010) and to the most differentiated Toba pumice glass (Chesner, 1998). Zircon saturation calculations (Boehnke et al, 2013) from ZHMI chemistries indicate that zircon saturated at ~750-770°C, consistent with Fe-Ti geothermometry from Toba pumice (700-780°C; Chesner and Luhr, 2010). Chlorine in zircon inclusions range from 0.11-0.17 wt%, which are within the range measured in quartz-hosted inclusions (0.11-0.20 wt%). Non-degassed matrix glass has a similar maximum chlorine content of 0.15 wt%, while out-gassed samples have Cl as low as 0.08 wt% (Chesner and Luhr, 2010). Evidence indicates that zircon saturated late and trapped melt compositions approaching the endpoint of Toba magmatic evolution prior to eruption.\nSIMS measurements of melt inclusion H, C, and S are planned for this fall. Additionally, U-Th age measurements of zircon surrounding the inclusions are planned to constrain timescales of the late chemical evolution of the Toba system.",

            "abstract": "Infrared radiation is used to remotely determine the mineralogical composition of planetary surfaces. However, determining the compositions of fine particulates has been a problematic task. This is due to an increased difficulty in determining the scattering properties for multiple scattering of light that occurs when regolith particles have diameters on the order of the wavelength of incident light. Radiative transfer models have been used to calculate the emissivity of closely-packed, fine particles with some success, but these models are not accurate enough. In particular, Mie theory has been used to obtain the necessary parameters for radiative transfer models in hope of capturing the diffraction effects. Although these methods have been adjusted to account for closely-packed particles, the physics of radiative transfer and Mie theory only holds for truly well-separated particles. Considering this, our study takes a different approach, Multiple Sphere T-Matrix (MSTM) method, to capture the multiple scattering process. For a cluster composed of many particles, MSTM solves Maxwell’s equations at every light and particle interface. Then, the cluster-averaged scattering properties of a single volume are input into equations of emissivity in Hapke [1996]. We generated a cluster of closely-packed spheres of forsterite composition with different diameters. Emissivities were calculated using MSTM/Hapke approach, then its quality was compared to that of Mie method. Furthermore, emissivity measurements were taken in a laboratory. Emission spectra derived from MSTM method resembled those from laboratory measurements closer than Mie method. This is an indication that MSTM method is capturing the multiple scattering process that increasingly becomes complex for particles with diameters on the order of the wavelength of incident radiation. MSTM method was shown to be more effective than Mie method, but not perfect; our next steps are to explore the effects of particle packing density, cluster size, particle size distribution, compositional heterogeneity, and particle shape to improve its accuracy. Our improved modeling capability will aid in analyzing remote sensed data in the infrared and determining the correct compositions of planetary surfaces covered with fine regolith particulates.",

Because p- and s-waves respectively travel faster and slower in the direction of an ice crystal c-axis, the velocities of these waves in a fabric are related to the clustering of ice crystal c-axes in the direction of wave propagation. Previous sonic logs at Dome C, NGRIP, WAIS, and NEEM have inferred a single component fabric description from the velocities of vertically-propagating p-waves around each ice core borehole. These records supplement thin-section measurements of crystal fabric by sampling larger numbers of crystals in a depth-continuous log.\nObservations of azimuthally anisotropic vertical-girdle fabrics at ice-core sites such as WAIS, NGRIP, and EDML underly a benefit for logging methods that are sensitive to such fabrics. We present a theoretical framework for using borehole flexural modes to measure azimuthal crystal-fabric anisotropy, and describe ongoing efforts to develop a sonic logging tool for this purpose. We also present data from p-wave logs and thin section measurements at the WAIS Divide, and describe how a flexural wave log could supplement the existing measurements.",

            "abstract": "Here we examine the role of slab dehydration in determining the elemental pattern of recycled noble gases. As a first step, we apply newly reported measurements of He-Ne-Ar (light noble gases) solubility and diffusivity in amphibole to parameterize a 1D diffusive-reaction transport model that simulates noble gas behavior during fluid loss from down-going oceanic crust. Recent experiments demonstrate that noble gases are highly soluble in ring-structured minerals, such as amphibole and other common hydrothermal products in slabs [1]. These results suggest that ring-structured minerals have the potential to strongly influence the budget of noble gases input into subduction zones and the elemental fractionations associated with volatile loss from slabs\nNew measurements of He-Ne-Ar solubility in a suite of amphiboles have been completed utilizing the methodology described in [1]. These new measurements confirm that all light noble gases are highly soluble in amphibole, and that noble gas solubility correlates with the availability of unoccupied ring sites. New experimental measurements of He and Ne diffusivity have also been completed using a step-degassing approach at the Berkeley Geochronology Center. These measurements suggest that vacant ring sites in amphibole act to slow noble gas diffusion. We combine the newly acquired He and Ne diffusivity measurements with literature values for Ar diffusivity [2] to parameterize the diffusive-reaction transport model.\nApplication of these data to the diffusive-reaction transport model yields several new insights. The relative mobility of Ne compared to Ar allows for efficient extraction of Ne from “hot” slabs by shallow depths (<50 km), while Ar is effectively retained to deeper depths, potentially past sub-arc conditions. Noble gas partition coefficients sharply increase with depth, following their increasing non-ideality in supercritical fluids, causing noble gases to partition back into minerals from any fluids retained in slabs at depth. The efficiency of noble gas extraction is particularly sensitive to the thermal regime and porosity of the slab (i.e. cold slabs with low porosity have the potential to recycle significant quantities noble gases).\nRefs: [1] Jackson et al.

            "abstract": "Ambient ozone has been monitored in the southern Sierra Nevada and White Mountains of California as 2-week average concentrations with Ogawa passive samplers and as 1-hour average concentrations with 2B Technologies UV absorption monitors. Our summer season investigations have included: (1) an elevational transect (1,237 to 4,342 masl) consisting of 5 sites in the White Mountains (2009 -2014); (2) a west to east southern Sierra Nevada transect consisting of 9 sites at elevations between 510 and 3,490 masl (2012 and 2013); and (3) two sites at the Devils Postpile National Monument at 2,130 masl (2007 – 2014). In the White Mountains average ozone concentrations increased with elevation, reaching the highest values at White Mountain Summit. A strongly pronounced diurnal distribution of ozone was observed at the low elevation site in Bishop (OVS), with low values at night and in the early morning and highest concentrations during mid-day. High elevation sites (Crooked Creek, Barcroft Station and Summit) were characterized by flat ozone curves with similar concentrations during daytime and nighttime, typically around 50 ppb. During the 2013 summer season, two-week averages from passive samplers ranged from 32 to 60 ppb for all White Mountains sites with the highest values at the Summit and the lowest at OVS. Along the southern Sierra Nevada transect, average concentrations in summer 2013 ranged from 36.5 to 54.0 ppb with the highest value recorded at the highest elevation eastern site, Piute Pass, and the lowest at low-elevation and western Shaver Lake site. Prather, Mountain Rest and Shaver Lake sites had the most exceedances of 8 h federal health standard of 75 ppb and the California health standard of 70 ppb. The Devils Postpile site was characterized by low ozone concentrations at night and in the early morning, and late afternoon maxima. In 2007 and 2008 the ozone values measured at Devils Postpile occasionally exceeded the federal health standard, with more numerous violations of the California health standard. These results will be discussed from a perspective of other monitoring campaigns conducted by our team in the Sierra Nevada, and they will be compared to concurrent results from nearby low elevation sites. We will also discuss effects of the recent Sierra Nevada wildland fires on ozone levels and distribution.",

            "abstract": "Perennial water systems are important ecological resources in the arid western US and provide many ecosystem services. Lakes can record fluctuations in climate (such as temperature and effective moisture) and can offer insight into regional variations in climate patterns. We studied a 7.65-m core from Swan Lake, which is a small lake and wetland complex that seasonally overflows, to examine small scale climate changes in its continuous sedimentary record. Our core is similar to that studied by Bright (1966), which exhibits two primary sedimentary facies, mud and peat, with a time span of 13.5 cal ka. The methodology includes radiocarbon dating, particle size analyses, sediment mineralogy, stable isotopes and clumped isotopes on calcium carbonate. Mud in the lower half of the core is primarily composed of clay and silt-size quartz-feldspar, but it transitions to calcium carbonate mud. Clays change from 660 to 585 cm and 350 to 220 cm in the core with an increase in kaolinite and illite upward. Ostracods in the carbonate muds are fairly uniform, indicating a mixture of wetland and lake environments from the last 5.8 ka. Similarly, summer temperatures obtained using Δ47 measurements show fluctuations in the range of 18.1 to 23.4 oC with carbonate muds generally corresponding to lower temperatures and peats to higher temperatures. We interpret muds as open water, shallow lake conditions and peats as wetlands across the floor of the ephemeral lake. If our interpretations are correct, the time from onset of the Younger Dryas to the end of the early Holocene was effectively dry, with low groundwater discharge. Similar events occurred from 4.7 to 1.0 ka and briefly at ~400 cal yr BP. Warmer climate may lead to effective moisture increase in this part of the eastern Great Basin.",

Topography also changes illumination conditions, creating light artifacts that affect satellite-measured reflectance. Before extracting semi-arid ecosystems properties from satellite measurements, topographic illumination artifacts need to be removed without altering the true topographic variability of such ecosystems. Many corrections techniques have been proposed, and their performance in reducing reflectance spatial variance have been extensively analysed and compared. Very little information is available on how topographic corrections affect the temporal variability of reflectance, although this type of information is critical when reflectance measurements are used to extract phenology or track recovery. We used the Google Earth Engine API to apply four different topographic corrections to a 10-years-long time series of Landsat TM images. The deviation of reflectance seasonality from known phenological information was then estimated and compared across vegetation classes and also correction methods. We will show our results using the Santa Ana Mountains as a study site, and will demonstrate the importance of topographic corrections in phenological studies.",

The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama Canal Watershed Experiment, Agua Salud Project, seeks to understand these processes and quantify the long-term effects of different land cover and use across the Panama Canal Watershed. In this study we used an ARS-type rainfall simulator to apply rainfall rates up to 200 mm per hour over a 2m by 6m area on deep saprolitic soils in forest and pasture land covers. A salinity contrast added to the applied rainwater allowed observation of bulk flow paths and velocities in the subsurface. The observed effects of land cover and land use on hydrological response were striking. In the forest site, we were unable to produce surface runoff even after the application of 600 mm of rainfall in three hours, and observed flow in soils down to approximately 2 m depth, and no downslope macropore flow. In the pasture site, surface runoff was produced, and we measured the permeability of the area with applied rainfall. Observed flow paths were much shallower, less than 1 m depth, with significant macropore flow observed at downslope positions. We hypothesize that land use and land cover have significant impacts on flow paths as they affect creation, connectivity, and function of biologically created macropores in the soil.",

Both the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) on the Gemini South Telescope and SPHERE on the Very Large Telescope provide an almost perfect correction of the atmospheric turbulences and are equipped with low-resolution integral field spectrograph and a polarimeter.\nWe will present the analysis of observations of (2) Pallas which was observed with GPI in direct imaging (without coronagraph) on March 22 2014 in Y, J, H, and K1 filters (from 0.95 to 2.19 μm) spectroscopically with a resolution varying from 34 to 70. The 540-km asteroid is well resolved and irregular. An ellipse of 540±9 mas and 470±9 mas fits its silhouette. The surface of the asteroid is mostly featureless but small differences of colors is currently being analyzed. No moons with a diameter larger than 0.5 km and at less than 1.2\" were detected on these observations.\nWe will discuss the future contributions of these Extreme AO systems, including SPHERE most recent observations, for the study of large main-belt asteroids addressing the number of targets that can be observed and comparing their on-sky efficiency with previous AO systems. Key scientific questions such as the possible differentiation of the primary of multiple asteroids (e.g. 45 Eugenia by Beauvalet and Marchis, Icarus, 2014 or 87 Sylvia in Berthier et al., Icarus, 2014), and the origin of these systems by comparison of the color of the moons and the primary (e.g. Marchis et al., AGU 2013) could be answered through intensive surveys conducted with these new AO systems.",

They are usually associated with open magnetic field regions, and their evolution can help us understand how the Sun’s magnetic field evolves in time and how these changes propagate out into the heliosphere.\nHere we discuss our method for detecting coronal holes in EUV imaging data. Our particular focus is on building instantaneous snapshots of hole boundaries by stitching together images from multiple vantage points (provided by STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and SDO), which allows us to study the evolution of large portions of the corona at high cadences for long periods of complete visibility.\nA key step in our methodology is the proper scaling and preprocessing of the data. Intensity histogram averaging of quiet sun regions over extended series of images is used to scale the instrument's data to each other, and along with a running average of coronal hole intensity, is utilized to fashion limb brightening correction curves, which when applied, remove natural disk-to-limb intensity variations. An image deconvolution using the instrument's known point-spread-functions is also used to reduce scattered light which can artificially brighten coronal holes. Our coronal hole detection method is discussed, which relies on an iterative double-threshold “flood-fill” algorithm. Time-dependent coronal hole maps produced by our method will be presented, and challenges of data flow, processing, and storage will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "California experiences droughts, so lets begin with the effects of streamflow variation on population evolution in a coastal lagoon-specialist endangered fish, the tidewater goby. Streamflow controls the closing and opening of lagoons to the sea determining genetic isolation or gene flow. Here evolution is a function of habitat preference for closing lagoons. Other estuarine fishes, with different habitat preferences, differentiate at larger spatial scales in response to longer glacio-eustatic control of estuarine habitat. Species of giraffes in Africa are a puzzle. Why do the ranges of large motile, potentially interbreeding, species occur in contact each other without hybridization? The answer resides in the timing of seasonal precipitation. Although the degree of seaonality of climate does not vary much between species, the timing of precipitation and seasonal \"greenup\" does. This provides a selective advantage to reproductive isolation, as reproductive timing can be coordinated in each region with seasonal browse availability for lactating females. Convective rainfall in Africa follows the sun and solar intensity is influenced by the precession cycle such that more extensive summer rains fell across the Sahara and South Asia early in the Holocene, this may also contribute to the genetic isolation and speciation of giraffes and others savanna species. But there also appears to be a correlation with rarity (CITES designation) of modern wetland birds, as the dramatic drying of the late Holocene landscape contributes to this conservation concern. Turning back to the West Coast we find the most diverse temperate coastal fauna in the world, yet this diversity evolved and is a relict of diversity accumulation during the apex of upwelling in the late Miocene, driven by the reglaciation of Antarctica. Lastly we can see that the deep-sea evolution is broadly constrained by the transitions from greenhouse to icehouse worlds over the last 90 mya as broad periods of warm climate coincide with episodic anoxia of the deep sea, influencing the evolutionary patterns seen in the fossil record and constraining the deep sea-vent faunas to be relatively young, having evolved/assembled from shallow water taxa late in the Cenozoic. Thus numerous discrete climate episodes yield the assembly of modern faunas.",

The NFMS forms the link between historical assessments and current/future assessments of forests, enabling consistency in the data and information to support the implementation of REDD+ activities. The creation of a reliable, transparent, and comprehensive NFMS is currently limited by a dearth of relevant data that are accurate, low-cost, and spatially resolved at subnational scales. With funding from a 3-year NASA Carbon Monitoring System project beginning in September 2013, we are developing, evaluating, and validating several critical components of an NFMS in Kalimantan, Indonesia, focusing on the use of LiDAR and radar imagery for improved carbon stock and forest degradation information. Here, we present results from an initial analysis of a spatially extensive set of LiDAR data collected across the Indonesian provinces on the island of Borneo together with RADAR and optical data. Our objectives are to evaluate sensor and platform tradeoffs systematically against in situ investments, as well as provide detailed tracking and characterization of uncertainty in a cost-benefit framework. Kalimantan is an ideal area to evaluate the use of remote sensing methods because measuring forest carbon stocks and their human caused changes with a high degree of certainty on the ground can be difficult. While our work focuses at the subnational scale for Kalimantan, we are targeting these methods for applicability across broader geographies and for implementation at various scales.",

            "abstract": "JPSS and GOES-R observations play important role in numerical weather prediction (NWP). However, how to best represent the information from satellite observations and how to get value added information from these satellite data into regional NWP models, including both radiance and derived products, still need investigations. In order to enhance the applications of JPSS and GOES-R data in regional NWP for high impact weather forecasts, scientists from Cooperative Institute of Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) at University of Wisconsin-Madison have recently developed a near realtime regional Satellite Data Assimilation system for Tropical storm forecasts (SDAT) (http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/sdat). The system consists of the community Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) assimilation system and the advanced Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model. In addition to assimilate GOES, AMSUA/AMSUB, HIRS, MHS, ATMS (Suomi-NPP), AIRS and IASI radiances, the SDAT is also able to assimilate satellite-derived products such as hyperspectral IR retrieved temperature and moisture profiles, total precipitable water (TPW), GOES Sounder (and future GOES-R) layer precipitable water (LPW) and GOES Imager atmospheric motion vector (AMV) products into the system. Real time forecasted GOES infrared (IR) images simulated from SDAT output have also been part of the SDAT system for applications and forecast evaluations. To set up the system parameters, a series of experiments have been carried out to test the impacts of different initialization schemes, including different background error matrix, different NCEP global model date sets, and different WRF model horizontal resolutions. Using SDAT as a research testbed, researches have been conducted for different satellite data impacts study, as well as different techniques for handling clouds in radiance assimilation. Since the fall of 2013, the SDAT system has been running in near real time. The results from historical cases and 2014 hurricane season cases will be compared with the operational GFS and HWRF, and presented at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "The Tjörnes Fracture Zone (TFZ) is a transform zone connecting the Kolbeinsey Ridge with North Iceland. The main transform motion takes place on the Húsavík-Flatey Fault (HFF). The zone contains two additional seismic lineaments: one named after Grímsey to the north of the HFF and another named after Dalvík to the south of the HFF. Most of the zone is offshore, which limits the historical information and geological observations. Between June and September of 2004, a temporary seismic network was operated offshore on the insular shelf of Iceland and onshore in North Iceland, during the project North ICeland Experiment (NICE). Data from this seismic array and data from the permanent Icelandic Network (SIL) have been used to constrain the sub-surface structure using local earthquake tomography. Comparison between results including and without NICE data shows the capability of this denser network to illuminate the upper-most crust. Although the microseismicity registered by the NICE network in a short period is dominated by low-magnitude, shallow events, SIL data recorded for more than ten years are useful to get information about the deeper crust. The results from the tomography reveal a transition from anomalously thick Icelandic crust to a more typical oceanic crust to the north of Grímsey. Major velocity anomalies are found along the Grímsey lineament and a low-velocity anomaly beneath Flatey Island along the HFF. The clustering of refined earthquake locations is enhanced. The seismicity is concentrated along the Grímsey Lineament, the Húsavík-Flatey Fault and a possible transversal lineament between them. Seismicity associated with the Grímsey lineament varies in depth down to 15 km.",

            "abstract": "A strong \"derecho\" (rapidly moving lines of convectively induced intense thunderstorms) was\ngenerated over the Midwestern United States on 12-13 June 2013 and propagated across the\nAppalachian Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean. Three hours after the derecho crossed the Atlantic\ncoast, a ~2-m high meteotsunami wave was reported to have hit the New Jersey coast. Significant\ntsunami-like oscillations, with wave heights of ~0.6 m, were also recorded by a number of tide-\ngauges located along the eastern seaboard from Nova Scotia to South Carolina, at Bermuda, and\nby open-ocean DART 44402. These observations triggered the tsunami-alert mode of the DART\nstation. Intense air pressure disturbances (with pressure change of 3-6 hPa in 20 min) and strong\nwinds were observed at a number of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and\nAutomated Surface Observing System (ASOS) stations to be propagating simultaneously with the\nderecho system, indicating that the pressure disturbances were the primary cause for the sea level\noscillations in Chesapeake and Delaware bays. The air pressure disturbance continued to propagate\nseaward over the continental shelf, thereby generating long waves via Proudman resonance at\nthose areas of the shelf where the propagation speed of the air pressure disturbance matched the\nlong wave speed. Upon reaching the shelf break, the long-waves were partly transmitted (reaching\nBermuda 5 hours later) and partly reflected (returning to the east coast of the US and Canada 3 to 6\nhours later). A numerical barotropic ocean model forced with idealized air pressure and wind fields\nwas used successfully to simulate the event. The meteotsunami arrival times and maximum wave\nheights obtained from the model closely match the measured values and confirm initial assumptions\nregarding the partitioning between transmitted and reflected meteotsunami waves.",

But these mathematical properties and physical constraints are important for predictive simulations in subsurface modeling. Recently, optimization-based methodologies have been proposed for diffusion-type equations that respect maximum principles and meet the non-negative constraint on general computational grids. Till date these methodologies have been tested only on small-scale academic problems with few thousands of degrees-of-freedom. But for practical problems in subsurface modeling, the degrees-of-freedom easily run into millions and sometimes into billions. The purpose of this research is to systematically study the performance of the non-negative methodologies for large-scale problems and in a parallel setting. We shall use PETSc for parallel environment, and TAO for parallel optimization solvers. Numerical simulations on real sites using our methodologies will be presented.",

Converting sonar data to a topographic map is a manual, labor-intensive process that can be greatly assisted by contextual information obtained from automated classification of geomorphological structures. Finding structures such as seamounts can be challenging, as there are no established rules that can be used for decision-making. Often times, it is a determination that is made by human expertise. A variety of feature metrics may be useful for this task and we use a large number of metrics relevant to the task of finding seamounts. We demonstrate this ability in locating seamounts by two related machine learning techniques. As well as achieving good accuracy in classification, the human-understandable set of metrics that are most important for the results are discussed.",

The toolbox includes two simplified hydrologic models, namely HBV-EDU and HBV-Ensemble, designed as a complement to theoretical hydrology lectures. The models provide an interdisciplinary application-oriented learning environment that introduces the hydrologic phenomena through the use of a simplified conceptual hydrologic model. The toolbox can be used for in-class lab practices and homework assignments, and assessment of students' understanding of hydrological processes. Using this modeling toolbox, students can gain more insights into how hydrological processes (e.g., precipitation, snowmelt and snow accumulation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration and runoff generation) are interconnected. The educational toolbox includes a MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) and an ensemble simulation scheme that can be used for teaching more advanced topics including uncertainty analysis, and ensemble simulation. Both models have been administered in a class for both in-class instruction and a final project, and students submitted their feedback about the toolbox. The results indicate that this educational software had a positive impact on students understanding and knowledge of hydrology.",

            "abstract": "This is a critical time for the geoscience community. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) have been released and are now being adopted by states (a dozen states and Washington, DC, at the time of writing this), with dramatic implications for national K-12 science education. Curriculum developers and textbook companies are working hard to construct educational materials that match the new standards, which emphasize a hands-on practice-based approach that focuses on working directly with primary data and other forms of evidence. While the set of 8 science and engineering practices of the NGSS lend themselves well to the observation-oriented approach of much of the geosciences, there is currently not a sufficient number of geoscience educational modules and activities geared toward the K-12 levels, and geoscience research organizations need to be mobilizing their education & outreach programs to meet this need. It is a rare opportunity that will not come again in this generation. There are other significant issues surrounding the implementation of the NGSS. The NGSS involves a year of Earth and space science at the high school level, but there does not exist a sufficient workforce is geoscience teachers to meet this need. The form and content of the geoscience standards are also very different from past standards, moving away from a memorization and categorization approach and toward a complex Earth Systems Science approach. Combined with the shift toward practice-based teaching, this means that significant professional development will therefore be required for the existing K-12 geoscience education workforce. How the NGSS are to be assessed is another significant question, with an NRC report providing some guidance but leaving many questions unanswered. There is also an uneasy relationship between the NGSS and the Common Core of math and English, and the recent push-back against the Common Core in many states may impact the implementation of the NGSS.",

The ALO is located in the Andes, where mountain waves are frequently generated. The large field-of-view of an All Sky imager provides extensive sky coverage for identifying mountain waves, making them a prime instrument for observing these waves that extend hundreds of kilometers along the mesosphere. A total of about 70 waves were identified each year. Based on these observations, mountain wave climatology over ALO is complied. It is found that there are markedly more mountain waves in the winter season than in the summer. Most mountain waves are oriented in the North-South direction, along the mountain range, as expected from the orientation of the Andes. The strength and frequency of the mountain waves are correlated with the low-level wind obtained from radio sonde data.",

            "abstract": "The multi-intensity changes of Hurricane Sandy (2012) are examined by using a cloud resolving WRF model. An analysis of Sandy's life cycle shows four distinct stages: (1) rapid deepening, (2) weakening, (3) deepening with little intensification of rotational wind, and (4) re-intensification of vortex winds. Results from the model simulations indicate that Sandy's multi-intensity changes are closely related to (i) changes in the magnitude and direction of environmental vertical wind shear (VWS), (ii) upper-tropospheric warming associated with deep convection in the core region, (iii) lower-stratospheric warmth as the storm moves poleward into lower-tropopause regions, and (iv) the possible roles of inertial instability in the upper outflow regions as approaching a upper-level trough/jet stream.\nSpecifically, Sandy intensifies steadily since October 24 as it moves over warm SST surface from Caribbean Sea to Cuba Island. After the storm passes Cuba Island, its warm core begins to tilt under the influence of increasing VWS as it approaches to an upper-level subtropical jet stream, leading to the weakening of the storm. After October 27, Sandy deepens as it moves far away from the upper-level jet core VWS, though over a colder SST surface. By hydrostatic reasoning, we find that during the 3rd stage Sandy's deepening results partly from the stacked upper-level warming in the core region but more from low stratospheric warmth as it moves to higher latitudes with lower tropopause height. Unlike the former scenario, this stratospheric warmth occurs over a meso-alpha-scale region encompassing the storm, thus causing widespread surface pressure falls. This explains why the rotational wind of Sandy shows little intensity changes while its central pressure keeps falling. During the final stage, organized deep convection in the core region increases upper-level tropospheric warming, leading to both the deepening of central pressure and re-intensification of rotational winds. It appears that the presence of inertial instability in the upper outflow channel may play some roles in the intensification of the storm. It is concluded that the intensity changes of Sandy are not only influenced by the tropospheric processes but also by the lower-stratospheric warmth, especially after moving into the mid-latitudes.",

Here, we present comparisons of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution estimated parameters for daily temperature and precipitation extremes over the globe for high-resolution (0.25 degrees) and low-resolution (1 degree) global pre-industrial and present day simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We also present comparisons of trends and dependence of extremes on natural modes of variability, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation and El Nino Southern Oscillation, to capture the non-stationary behavior of extremes by building suitable linear models of GEV distribution. Further, a correlation based moving window regionalization method is also designed to improve the poor sampling of extremes associated with grid point analysis. Preliminary results indicate that while the high-resolution models can better simulate the variability and extremes of daily precipitation, particularly over areas with varied topography - similar to previous findings, there are also gains in the simulation of the trends and impact of low-frequency natural variability on extremes based on comparisons with NASA MERRA reanalysis data.",

Environmentally sound strategies have to be developed to minimize these consequences. However, hazard-prone areas differ geographically, climatically, and culturally. There is no a one-size-fits-all solution. Thus, it is crucial that future decision-makers not only know the conditions that make some natural Earth processes hazardous to people, but also understand how people perceive and adjust to potential natural hazards in their regions. In May 2013, an ice jam caused major flooding in Galena, a remote village in interior Alaska. Within two days, flooding destroyed nearly the entire region’s infrastructure, and displaced over 400 residents. Almost a year later, a significant part of Galena’s population was still evacuated in Fairbanks and other neighboring towns. The rebuilding holdup reflected the federal government’s reluctance to spend millions of dollars an the area that may be destroyed again by the next flood. Massive floods inundated towns along the Yukon River before (e.g., Eagle in 2009 and Holycross in 1975), but people return to refurbish and again inhabit the same territories. Rivers have a significant importance to Alaskan rural communities. Not only do rivers provide food, drink, transportation, and in some cases arable land and irrigation, but they also carry cultural significance for the Native Alaskan people. The Galena case study provides a revealing example of challenges of communicating with and educating the public and policy makers about natural hazards.",

            "abstract": "SKS arrivals from ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) data of the ALBACORE\nexperiment offshore Southern California are analyzed for shear wave splitting. The\nALBACORE (Asthenospheric and Lithospheric Broadband Architecture from the\nCalifornia Offshore Region Experiment) project involved deployment of 34 OBSs\nfor 12 months in a region extending up to 500 kilometers west onto the oceanic\nPacific plate. Splitting fast directions are similar to on-land directions, WSW-ENE,\nand exhibit similar delays, 1.1-1.4 seconds. A numerical method to remove S-wave\ninterference with SKKS arrivals by f-k velocity filtering is tested with synthetic\nand the observed OBS data. The fast directions are at 45 degrees to the direction\nof absolute plate motion (APM) of the Pacific plate suggesting that either frozen-in\nanisotropy from paleo-spreading dominates over APM effects in the asthenosphere\nor that deeper mantle shearing has occurred unrelated to APM. A toroidal flow\naround slab rollback would be consistent with the splitting results if the slab\nrollback resulted in large-scale secondary flow well into Pacific plate, or if\nthe source of the splitting extended much deeper than 200 km.",

            "abstract": "Hyporheic zones at the margin of karst conduits occur at different spatial scales, from those associated with the smallest scales (cm) of conduit-wall topography (e.g., scallops) to large-scale (100 m) conduit sinuosity, and to even larger conduit network patterns. Hyporheic flows are believed to influence the processing of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon from the conduit flow, the evolution of karst-water chemistry, the reaction and sequestration of contaminants, and speleogenesis. Multiple spatial scales of hyporheic interaction lead to a wide distribution of hyporheic flow path lengths, residence times, and opportunities for both abiotic and microbially-mediated reactions of various kinetics.\nUsing mathematical modeling we examine hyporheic flows for a single karst conduit with two different scales of flow disturbance: wall topography at the sub-meter scale and sinuosity at the scale of 10’s of meters. By varying the amplitude of each disturbance we examine changes in hyporheic flow magnitude, paths, residence times, and other metrics. We test the hypothesis that while sinuosity-driven hyporheic flow occupies the greatest volume of karst matrix rock, with the longest residence times, the much smaller volume of topographically-driven hyporheic flow is more important because it turns over far more conduit flow and does so with much shorter and possibly more important residence times.",

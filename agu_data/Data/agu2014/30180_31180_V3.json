            "abstract": "The goal of NOAA’s beach quality forecasting program is to use a multi-faceted approach to aid in detection and prediction of bacteria in recreational waters. In particular, our focus has been on the connection between tributary loads and bacteria concentrations at nearby beaches. While there is a clear link between stormwater runoff and beach water quality, quantifying the contribution of river loadings to nearshore bacterial concentrations is complicated due to multiple processes that drive bacterial concentrations in rivers as well as those processes affecting the fate and transport of bacteria upon exiting the rivers. In order to forecast potential impacts of rivers on beach water quality, we developed a linked hydrologic-hydrodynamic water quality framework that simulates accumulation and washoff of bacteria from the landscape, and then predicts the fate and transport of washed off bacteria from the watershed to the coastal zone. The framework includes a watershed model (IHACRES) to predict fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) loadings to the coastal environment (accumulation, wash-off, die-off) as a function of effective rainfall. These loadings are input into a coastal hydrodynamic model (FVCOM), including a bacteria transport model (Lagrangian particle), to simulate 3D bacteria transport within the coastal environment. This modeling system provides predictive tools to assist local managers in decision-making to reduce human health threats.",

A terrestrial origin has been inferred for the odd carbon-numbered long-chain (>C27) n-alkanes. The entire n-alkane δ13C range between -31.7‰ and -36.8‰, which is the isotopic range occupied by C3 vegetation. The C29:C31 ratio shows that a gramineae contribution is higher during the Pleistocene than in Holocene. The n-alkanes concentration decrease between 32 000 – 18 000, suggesting a increase in arid conditions. The ACL index confirm this interpretation showing high values due the Pleistocene linked to more hydrological stress. A shift in the abundance of n-alkane and isotopic values are observed across the late Pleistocene glacial-Holocene interglacial climate change, suggesting a climate-induced vegetational change. During the middle Holocene the n-alcanes values decreases indicating rain forest regression accompanied by increase in the ACL values confirming the dry climate conditions. Comparison with other South American records, our record indicates regression/expansion of the rain forest linked to the South American System monsoon activity since 35 kyrs.",

            "abstract": "Interoperable sharing of groundwater data across international boarders is essential for the proper management of global water resources. However storage and management of groundwater data is often times distributed across many agencies or organizations. Furthermore these data may be represented in disparate proprietary formats, posing a significant challenge for integration. For this reason standard data models are required to achieve interoperability across geographical and political boundaries.\nThe GroundWater Markup Language 1.0 (GWML1) was developed in 2010 as an extension of the Geography Markup Language (GML) in order to support groundwater data exchange within Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI). In 2013, development of GWML2 was initiated under the sponsorship of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) for intended adoption by the international community as the authoritative standard for the transfer of groundwater feature data, including data about water wells, aquifers, and related entities. GWML2 harmonizes GWML1 and the EU's INSPIRE models related to geology and hydrogeology. Additionally, an interoperability experiment was initiated to test the model for commercial, technical, scientific, and policy use cases.\nThe scientific use case focuses on the delivery of data required for input into computational flow modeling software used to determine the flow of groundwater within a particular aquifer system. It involves the delivery of properties associated with hydrogeologic units, observations related to those units, and information about the related aquifers. To test this use case web services are being implemented using GWML2 and WaterML2, which is the authoritative standard for water time series observations, in order to serve USGS water well and hydrogeologic data via standard OGC protocols. Furthermore, integration of these data into a computational groundwater flow model will be tested. This submission will present the GWML2 information model and results of an interoperability experiment with a particular emphasis on the scientific use case.",

            "abstract": "Reaction forces are generated as energy is extracted from the motion of ocean waves relative to a wave energy converter (WEC). The reaction forces effect the momentum of the WEC, and in most cases it is beneficial to transfer the loads to a relatively stationary external body. It has become common for WECs to include reaction plates that use hydrodynamic damping to transfer the loads developed during energy extraction to the relatively stationary water below the surface of the ocean. Reaction plates allow WECs to use compliant moorings, which reduce mooring loads and are more easily deployed than taut moorings. Heave plates are commonly used on offshore platforms, but the design of reaction plates for wave energy converters has received little attention. This work presents an initial optimization of reaction plate form to improve the heave and surge performance of the WEC reference models developed for the US Department of Energy. The benefits and drawbacks of various reaction plate geometries are compared, and the impacts on WEC stability, peak loading, and energy production are considered.",

            "abstract": "The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) dedicated satellite gravity field mission was launched on March 17, 2009. The GOCE came to an end in October 21, 2013. Five generations of global geopotential models (GGMs) have been computed and released based on the data collected by GOCE so far. The models are available via IAG’s International Centre for Global Earth Models (ICGEM,\nhttp://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/ICGEM/\n). The first generation models were computed from the first two months of the data, but the final generation models have been recently computed based on approximately 42 months of GOCE observations. Evaluation of these models in North America is important in view of the availability of high quality geodetic data in Canada and USA and the upcoming redefinition of the North American vertical datum through a continental geoid model based on a GOCE GGM. In this study, the performance of the models, developed by ESA’s High-level Processing Facility (HPF), is evaluated by degree variances and also by comparing to the GNSS-levelling geoid undulations as independent control values. The GNSS-leveling stations in Canada, USA, Alaska and Mexico are used in this study.\nThe results provide evidence that the signal of the Earth’s gravitational field has been obtained solely from GOCE measurements up to degree and order (DO) 220, which corresponds to the spatial resolution of approximately 91 km. The cumulative global geoid error of TIM5 and DIR5 models up to DO 220 are 3.6 and 1.2 cm, respectively. The evaluation of the models by the North American GNSS-leveling stations in different spectral bands showed that the TIM5 and DIR5 models have slightly better performance than the EGM2008 model in the spectral band between DO 100 and 210 in Canada and the USA. The improvement brought by GOCE to Alaska and Mexico is more significant. In Alaska, the TIM5 and DIR5 models improve the geoid signal in the spectral band between DO 100 and 250. In Mexico, where good terrestrial gravity information is not available, the last generation of GOCE models improves the geoid signal between DO 110 and 280. The DIR models slightly perform better that the TIM models in North America. Standard deviations of the geoid height differences for the DIR5 model up to DO 300 are 25.5, 26.6, 35.7 and 49.0 cm in Canada, USA, Alaska and Mexico, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Ecosystem models play a critical role in understanding the terrestrial biosphere and forecasting changes in the carbon cycle, however current forecasts have considerable uncertainty. The amount of data being collected and produced is increasing on daily basis as we enter the “big data” era, but only a fraction of this data is being used to constrain models. Until we can improve the problems of model accessibility and model–data communication, none of these resources can be used to their full potential.\nThe Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) is an ecoinformatics toolbox and a set of workflows that wrap around an ecosystem model and manage the flow of information in and out of regional-scale TBMs. Here we present new modules developed in PEcAn to manage the processing of meteorological data, one of the primary driver dependencies for ecosystem models. The module downloads, reads, extracts, and converts meteorological observations to Unidata Climate Forecast (CF) NetCDF community standard, a convention used for most climate forecast and weather models. The module also automates the conversion from NetCDF to model specific formats, including basic merging, gap-filling, and downscaling procedures. PEcAn currently supports tower-based micrometeorological observations at Ameriflux and FluxNET sites, site-level CSV-formatted data, and regional and global reanalysis products such as the North American Regional Reanalysis and CRU-NCEP. The workflow is easily extensible to additional products and processing algorithms.\nThese meteorological workflows have been coupled with the PEcAn web interface and now allow anyone to run multiple ecosystem models for any location on the Earth by simply clicking on an intuitive Google-map based interface. This will allow users to more readily compare models to observations at those sites, leading to better calibration and validation. Current work is extending these workflows to also process field, remotely-sensed, and historical observations of vegetation composition and structure. The processing of heterogeneous met and veg data within PEcAn is made possible using the Brown Dog cyberinfrastructure tools for unstructured data.",

            "abstract": "The co-curricular summer research program, in which I was involved over three summers as an undergraduate student, greatly benefited me. In this paper I will briefly describe the program and how the experience contributed to my value and growth.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy operated the Global Change Education Program (GCEP), from 1999-2013, as an outreach to both undergraduate and graduate students. Its goals were to: provide students with hands-on research experience in a one-on-one setting with leaders in global change fields, encourage undergraduate students to enter graduate school, and increase the number of high quality U.S. scientists. I took part in GCEP as a Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) Fellow. Each Fellow was teamed with a scientist to conduct research over the summer. I spent one summer at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, WA working with Dr. William Shaw. The next two summers I spent working at Aerodyne Research, Inc. in Billerica, MA with Dr. Leah Williams.\nMy experiences as a SURE Fellow have benefitted me in many ways.\nThe research presentations, required of SURE Fellows, helped to improve my presentation skills.\nThe GCEP workshops expanded the scope of my knowledge about global change impacts at all scales.\nI was involved in two large, collaborative field studies, which provided experiences and examples that have helped me lead my own field studies.\nI took part in well-functioning research teams, helping me see the value of open communication in collaborative work.\nMy critical and analytical thinking abilities were continually honed.\nMy problem solving skills were challenged in laboratory and field work.\nI worked with talented professionals and students that are now part of my professional network.\nMy contributions resulted in being a coauthor on two peer-reviewed publications.\nI was able to experience research teams outside of academia, which included government and private sectors.\nThe time spent as a SURE Fellow sparked my desire to have a career in environmental research. This desire was a significant factor in my decision to return to school for a PhD, of which I am near completion. I have found my involvement in a co-curricular research program to be very valuable and beneficial in building my skills, network, and confidence.",

            "abstract": "The early Late Pliocene (3.6-3.0 Ma) is the last time atmospheric CO2 concentrations equaled today’s values (~400 ppm). Despite this, and the warmer than modern climate it fostered, this period experienced an intense global glaciation during marine isotope stage (MIS) M2 (~3.3 Ma). Constraints imposed by the estimated sea level drop associated with this event suggest ice growth was not isolated to Antarctica, as had previously been the case, but that ice grew in high northern latitudes as well. M2 is unique during the Pliocene and is likely the first attempt of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets to grow into those experienced during Pleistocene ice ages. However, the effects of MIS M2, and any attendant Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, on Arctic terrestrial temperature and hydrology are not well understood. Here we present and compare results from the biomarker-based MBT/CBT paleotemperature proxy with δDleaf wax results, sensitive to both temperature hydrology, from Lake El’gygytgyn (NE Russia) in an attempt to isolate and characterize variability in both air temperature and moisture source/availability. We compare our results with more coarsely resolved preexisting pollen-based temperature and moisture reconstructions. Our temperature reconstruction is, as far as we know, the highest resolution terrestrial record of this dramatic global cooling event. It implies a ~6°C cooling circa 3.29 Ma was accomplished in two steps before a rebound of ~7°C into the start of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period. Removal of the temperature effect from M2 δDleaf wax profiles using our MBT/CBT results provide insight into changes in local hydrology during this event that are compared with pollen-based estimates of minimum, maximum, and mean annual precipitation in order to discuss changes in amount and seasonality of moisture delivery to Lake El’gygytgyn (NE Russia) during the expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets.",

            "abstract": "On July 21st 2014 a group of earth scientists and students from the University of Iceland and University of Santa Barbara, Ca, visited the caldera lake Öskjuvatn Iceland. Lake Öskjuvatn is about 12 km2, elliptical with a diameter of some 3.5 to 2.5 km. It was formed after a major rifting event that began in 1875, and culminated in March the same year by a major Plinian eruption. The lake is about 220 m deep where it is deepest. During the visit of the group a major part of the south eastern corner of the caldera was beginning to fail, only observed by analyzing photographs taken on the evening of 21st July. The group left the area at about 21:00 in the afternoon. At about 23:20 a large part of the SE mountain range fell into the caldera and the lake occupying it. Photos taken from some 15 km distance at 23:27 show a large plume rising from the within the caldera. The day after the group returned to the caldera lake after receiving news of the event. A scar of some 0.7to 1 km wide and 400 m high indicated a major avalanche had fallen into the lake. Flood marks observed around the caldera lake indicated that a major tsunami had followed the avalanche. Around a solfatara Viti, situated in the NE corner of the lake highest flood marks indicated that squashes had reached as high as 55-60 m. The group did surveillance of highest flood marks around the lake. The measurements show that the wave was about 25 to 30 m high passing over the entire lake leaving behind marks in the snow and firn reaching down to previous lake level. Where the lake shallows flood marks could be traced up to 40 to 60 m. Further investigation of the wave showed that since the lake is enclosed a bathtub effect was initiated. Strandlines after more than 10 waves could be identified of which 4 reached above 20 m (with regard to the lake level 1050 m.a.s.l.). 19 hours after the avalanche fell into the lake there was still observed a resonance in the lake. High and low rise of the lake could be observed at an interval of some 20 min. Lake leveling indicates that the lake level rose some 2-5 m in the event, that suggests an injection into the lake of some 24-60 million m3 of debris. We shall present effects of the avalanche observed only 19 hours after the event and observations on the change in Lake Bottom by combining multi-beam measurements from 2012 with multi-beam measurements after the avalanche.",

            "abstract": "Debris-covered glaciers and rock glaciers encompass a range of compositions and activity, including relict glaciers containing ice that has survived long after accumulation has ceased. Hence they are useful paleoclimate indicators in some cases, and if currently active will respond differently to ongoing climate change than glaciers without a protective cover. Their flow dynamics are not well understood, partially due to their typically slow velocities (centimeters per year in many cases); furthermore, their unique surface morphologies, including lobate fronts and arcuate ridges, likely result from viscous flow influenced by a combination of composition, structure, and climatic factors. However, basic connections between flow kinematics and surface morphology have not yet been established, limiting our ability to understand these features and extract paleoclimate information.\nIn order to address this problem, we have acquired repeat, high-resolution topographic maps of debris-covered and rock glaciers in the Wrangell-St. Elias range of Alaska and Sierra Nevada, California. This was accomplished using both scanning LiDAR and photogrammetry to produce digital terrain models (DTMs) with approx. 25 cm resolution. Differencing the DTMs provides full-surface deformation fields that indicate up to meters of annual motion in some cases. The flow field is highly correlated with surface features; in particular, compressional ridges. We are undertaking surface geophysics measurements on Sourdough Rock Glacier in Alaska to relate internal structure and composition to the observed morphology and flow kinematics. Our results demonstrate the utility of repeat topographic mapping and will help provide new insights into the climatic significance of rock and debris-covered glaciers on both Earth and Mars.",

            "abstract": "The study of the intraplate seismicity is very important to help the understanding of the neotectonic processes. We present a discussion of the possible causes of intraplate seismicity in the region of Tocantins Province in Brazil from recent P- and S-wave seismic tomography results. The regional stress field in South America (SA) is dominated by compressions in east-west direction (Zoback, 1992). The origin of this system of tensions is mainly related to the formation of the South American plate from the mid-Atlantic ridge, and resistive forces exerted by the subduction of Caribbean and Nazca plate (Mendiguren & Richter, 1978; Coblentz & Richardson, 1996). Assumpção et al. (2004) that high seismicity regions in SA is due to the weakness of the lithosphere with his thinning. This hypothesis is based on the coincidence between seismic tomographic low-velocity anomalies and events locations, which could be indicate regions of lithospheric thinning. According to this model, stresses would be concentrated uniformly in depth along the lithosphere. In regions with thicker lithosphere, the intensity of the focused stress would be smaller than the thinner regions. Thus, the crust in regions of thinner lithosphere concentrates more intense stresses promoting a higher seismicity. We observed in the Tocantins Province, in Central Brazil, the same pattern observed in the work of Assumpção et al. (2004). The region of low velocity in the Tocantins Province center is usually accompanied by a high concentration of seismic events following the direction of the Transbrasiliano Lineament. Thus, this lineament could be reactivated by stresses accumulated in the crust due to thin lithosphere. Assumpção & Sacek (2013) proposed that flexural stresses from uncompensated lithospheric loads are high enough to explain the seismic zone, which continues for the northern part of the Tocantins Province. The improvement of the tomography results suggest that lithospheric thinning is still important to explain intraplate seismicity in the Central Brazil.",

            "abstract": "The 2004 Mw 9.2 Sumatra-Andaman great earthquake has been studied extensively. Most studies have inferred a combination of afterslip and viscoelastic mechanisms to be responsible for the postseismic deformation. Further off the coast of the Andaman islands, the northern terminus of the Ninety-East ridge has historically been a hotspot for seismic activity. On April 11, 2012, the largest intraplate strike-slip earthquakes recorded, Mw = 8.6 and Mw = 8.2, occurred separated by two hours and around 100 km. Previous studies have shown that these events are difficult to constrain geodetically due to the region’s complexities and lack of data density, but there are hints that they excited transient slip rate changes on the Andaman portion of the megathrust more than 1000 km away. Despite the attention these large events have deservedly received, there are additional constraints that can be brought to bear in more rigorous dynamical modeling than has been done thus far. In this presentation we use models developed by Sylvain Barbot (RELAX), E.A. Hetland and more basic finite element methods to examine the slip and viscous flow dynamics excited by these large events. We will process data from both the Andaman-Nicobar postseismic GPS array and Sumatran GPS array (SuGAr) to provide additional constraint on postseismic deformation processes, and examine the consistency of inferred slip processes excited by the 2004 and 2012 events. We will use CHAMP magnetic data to infer geometry and depths to the base of the seismogenic zone, assuming that it is found immediately above the high-susceptibility serpentinite body as in Cascadia. Gravity data from both GRACE and CHAMP also will be used to characterize coseismic slip and postseismic viscoelastic flow along the Sunda-Andaman arc.",

            "abstract": "Land-cover maps are important science products needed for natural resource and ecosystem service management, biodiversity conservation planning, and assessing human-induced and natural drivers of land change. Most land-cover maps at regional to global scales are produced with remote sensing techniques applied to multispectral satellite imagery with 30-500 m pixel sizes (e.g., Landsat, MODIS). Hyperspectral, or imaging spectrometer, imagery measuring the visible to shortwave infrared regions (i.e., full range) of the spectrum have shown improved capacity to map plant species and coarser land-cover associations, yet techniques have not been widely tested at regional and greater spatial scales. The Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission is a full-range hyperspectral and thermal satellite being considered for development by NASA (hyspiri.jpl.nasa.gov). A hyperspectral satellite, such as HyspIRI, will provide detailed spectral and temporal information at global scales that could greatly improve our ability to map land cover with greater class detail and spatial and temporal accuracy than possible with conventional multispectral satellites.\nThe broad goal of our research is to assess multi-temporal, HyspIRI-like satellite imagery for improved land cover mapping across a range of environmental and anthropogenic gradients in California. In this study, we mapped FAO Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) classes over 30,000 km2 in Northern California using multi-temporal HyspIRI imagery simulated from the AVIRIS airborne sensor. The Random Forests classification was applied to predictor variables derived from the multi-temporal hyperspectral data and accuracies were compared to that from Landsat 8 OLI. Results indicate increased mapping accuracy using HyspIRI multi-temporal imagery, particularly in discriminating different forest life-form types, such as mixed conifer and broadleaf forests and open- and closed-canopy forests.",

            "abstract": "The study was conducted from early May through late July of 2013 in a small suburban watershed, called the Dry Run Creek (DRC), in northeast Iowa. Flooding is considered one of the largest hazards in the United States, causing economic damage in billions of dollars. Investigations across the country have documented dramatic changes in river discharge over the past decades due to an increase in rainfall events. Consequently, many areas in the U.S. have been experiencing flash flood occurrences. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of flash flooding on shallow aquifers and the associated changes in water quality. On May 29, 2.81 inches of rain fell on the watershed from 4:30 to 8 p.m. causing the water level at the selected site to rise from 1.99 ft at 4:15 p.m. to 9.38 ft at 8:45 p.m. The event produced a severe flash flood condition in the creek by releasing discharge that is 562% higher than the average flow rate at the site for that time of the season. The water level eventually exceeded the bankfull stage. A considerable impact of the flood on the shallow aquifer was observed. The hydraulic gradient in the hyporheic zone reversed, resulting in the adjacent shallow groundwater table to rise by 4 ft. Several water quality parameters rapidly changed in values. The water temperature dropped from 11.26 degrees to 10.95 degrees C, and the total dissolved solids went down from 432 ppm to 426 ppm. On the other hand, turbidity went up from 72.4 NTU to 80.4 NTU and the dissolved oxygen (DO) increased from 7.54 ppm to 8.43 ppm. The changes took place within a 4-hour time period. The dramatic rise in water level as well as the increase in DO indicate rapid influx of stream water into the aquifers. The groundwater measurements were taken in a well that was 45 feet away from the creek. The aquifer response of this nature indicates that the hyporheic zone alongside the creek is much wider than expected for this small watershed. Wide and active hyporheic zones in a small watershed can be very effective in channeling high stream discharge at times of flash flooding.",

            "abstract": "Wet canopy evaporation is a significant component of the water budget in rainforests. Frequent precipitation events followed by drying produce spatial and temporal variation in wet/dry forest canopy conditions that influence processes such as photosynthesis and growth. Upper canopies contribute a disproportionately large fraction of transpiration and carbon assimilation relative to lower canopy layers as exposed leaves dry more rapidly following each rain event. However, the partitioning between wet canopy evaporation and dry canopy transpiration has not been extensively studied in tropical forests. As part of a larger study in central Costa Rica aimed at improving land-surface modeling of evapotranspiration (ET) processes in tropical montane forests, we compared transpiration among trees with exposed and shaded crowns under both wet and dry canopy conditions. Transpiration was measured using 33 sap flow sensors in 20 trees (7 dominant and co-dominant, 8 mid-story, and 5 suppressed) in a mature forest stand surrounding a 40-m tower equipped with eddy covariance and micrometeorological sensors. During the wet month of July, leaves were dry 53% of the time in the upper canopy compared with only 16% of the time in the lower canopy. Dominant and co-dominant trees contributed 68% to total transpiration at this site (23% mid-story, 9% suppressed). Under dry conditions, sap flow rates of dominant and co-dominant trees were about double that of suppressed trees, while suppressed trees differed little between wet and dry days. On partially wet days, all trees had similar sap flow rates, regardless of canopy exposure, with rates nearly as low as days that were entirely wet. This behavior is due to rapid individual tree responses to the transition between wet and dry conditions, indicating that persistently wet tropical environments are uniquely adapted to short-term dryness. ET has important influence on precipitation in tropical forests through land-atmosphere interactions, particularly in regions where “precipitation recycling” is high. Hence improvements in ET parameterizations can lead to changes in land-atmosphere feedbacks simulated by coupled atmosphere-land models and alter the role of recycling in the water cycle over tropical forests.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization over the last century has degraded our natural water resources by increasing storm-water runoff, reducing nutrient retention, and creating poor ecosystem health downstream. The loss of tree canopy and expansion of impervious area and storm sewer systems have significantly decreased infiltration and evapotranspiration, increased stream-flow velocities, and increased flood risk. These problems have brought increasing attention to catchment-wide implementation of green infrastructure (e.g., decentralized green storm water management practices such as bioswales, rain gardens, permeable pavements, tree box filters, cisterns, urban wetlands, urban forests, stream buffers, and green roofs) to replace or supplement conventional storm water management practices and create more sustainable urban water systems. Current green infrastructure (GI) practice aims at mitigating the negative effects of urbanization by restoring pre-development hydrology and ultimately addressing water quality issues at an urban catchment scale. \nThe benefits of green infrastructure extend well beyond local storm water management, as urban green spaces are also major contributors to human health. Considerable research in the psychological sciences have shown significant human health benefits from appropriately designed green spaces, yet impacts on human wellbeing have not yet been formally considered in GI design frameworks. This research is developing a novel computational green infrastructure (GI) design framework that integrates hydrologic requirements with criteria for human wellbeing. A supervised machine learning model is created to identify specific patterns in urban green spaces that promote human wellbeing; the model is linked to RHESSYS model to evaluate GI designs in terms of both hydrologic and human health benefits. An application of the models to Dead Run Watershed in Baltimore showed that image mining methods were able to capture key elements of human preferences that could improve tree-based GI design. Hydrologic benefits associated with these features were substantial, indicating that increased urban tree coverage and a more integrated GI design approach can significantly increase both human and hydrologic benefits.

            "abstract": "Multiple geodetic methods are in use to investigate and monitor ground deformation at active volcanoes worldwide. These methods include episodic and continuous GPS, InSAR, tilt, and borehole strain observations. Hekla volcano in Iceland has been subject to crustal deformation measurements since 1967, including all of the abovementioned methods. Here we present the first complete estimation of the GPS-derived co-eruptive deformation field for the February 26 to March 8, 2000, eruption of Hekla, which is Hekla's most recent eruption. The co-eruptive deformation field was challenging to obtain because of a) a temporal gap at most of the GPS sites between 1996 and 2000; b) deformation from two magnitude 6.5 earthquakes, which occurred ~50 km from Hekla in the South Iceland Seismic Zone in June 2000; and c) regional changes in site velocities, interpreted to be caused by increased melting rates of Iceland's glaciers. We interpret the new GPS deformation field with previously published dry-tilt (i.e., short leveling lines), InSAR, and borehole strain measurements, in a formal joint inversion. We model the surface deformation using elastic half-space models of the deflating magma chamber (modeled here as a sphere, ellipsoid, or vertical pipe) and the co-eruptive dike (modeled as a rectangular dislocation).\nOur preliminary results indicate that the magma chamber that deflated during the eruption was at approximately 20 km depth, when modeled as a spherical source, wheras, a pipe-shaped structure reaches more shallow depths. The co-eruptive dike that formed along Hekla was shallow, likely less than 1-2 km in depth, and connected to the magma chamber through a narrow conduit in general accordance with previously published results for Hekla. Each of the applied methods to measure crustal deformation has its advantages with respect to spatial and temporal resolution, long-term stability, and independence, arguing for continued multi-technique efforts for measuring crustal deformation at active volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "The melting curve of iron at the pressure of the inner core boundary places a strong constraint on the thermal profile within the Earth, the heat flux to the mantle, and also the power to drive the geodynamo. Recent static diamond anvil cell measurements by Anzellini et al. 2013 have accurately measured the melting curve of iron to 200 GPa, which is a tremendous improvement in the available data but is still only 60% of the pressure at the inner core boundary, and thus requires significant extrapolation. Nguyen and Holmes, 2004, have used the sound velocity technique to measure the melting transition on the principal Hugoniot, up to 270 GPa, but some still believe that sound velocity is not an accurate diagnostic of melting as it detects a loss of strength and also that kinetics can mitigate the utility of dynamic melting techniques.\nHere we use in-situ x-ray diffraction to unambiguously measure the melting transition on the principal Hugoniot of iron to 270 GPa. We also show that iron melts from the hcp phase at pressures up to 270 GPa, which is significantly closer to the inner core boundary than any previous melting curve measurement capable of phase discrimination. From comparison of our measurements to those of Nguyen and Holmes, we show that sound velocity measurements can accurately constrain the melting curve and that the kinetics of melting iron are faster than both laser shock and gas gun experimental timescales. Thereby, dynamic techniques should be trusted for probing the melting curve of metals and they also offer the greatest opportunity to probe the melting curve of iron at the pressure of the inner core boundary and also the higher pressures achieved within the interiors of super-Earths.

            "abstract": "In many ecosystems, nitrogen is the most limiting nutrient for plant growth and productivity. However mechanistic representation of nitrogen uptake linked to root traits, and functional nitrogen allocation among different leaf enzymes involved in respiration and photosynthesis is currently lacking in Earth System models.\nThe linkage between nitrogen availability and plant productivity is simplistically represented by potential photosynthesis rates, and is subsequently downregulated depending on nitrogen supply and other nitrogen consumers in the model (e.g., nitrification). This type of potential photosynthesis rate calculation is problematic for several reasons. Firstly, plants do not photosynthesize at potential rates and then downregulate. Secondly, there is considerable subjectivity on the meaning of potential photosynthesis rates. Thirdly, there exists lack of understanding on modeling these potential photosynthesis rates in a changing climate. In addition to model structural issues in representing photosynthesis rates, the role of plant roots in nutrient acquisition have been largely ignored in Earth System models. For example, in CLM4.5, nitrogen uptake is linked to leaf level processes (e.g., primarily productivity) rather than root scale process involved in nitrogen uptake.\nWe present a new plant model for CLM with an improved mechanistic presentation of plant nitrogen uptake based on root scale Michaelis Menten kinetics, and stronger linkages between leaf nitrogen and plant productivity by inferring relationships observed in global databases of plant traits (including the TRY database and several individual studies). We also incorporate improved representation of plant nitrogen leaf allocation, especially in tropical regions where significant over-prediction of plant growth and productivity in CLM4.5 simulations exist. We evaluate our improved global model simulations using the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) framework. We conclude that mechanistic representation of leaf-level nitrogen allocation and a theoretically consistent treatment of competition with belowground consumers leads to overall improvements in CLM4.5’s global carbon cycling predictions.",

            "abstract": "Using landslide morphology to determine the state of hillslope transience provides a diagnostic tool to identify the extent of landscape adjustment. Here we test for a temporal and spatial progression of landslides reflecting the degree of adjustment for a Waipaoa River catchment (North Island, New Zealand). Following the shift to a warmer, wetter climate after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (~18 ka), the Waipaoa River rapidly incised up to 120 m, leaving perched, low-relief hillslopes unadjusted to that base level fall. In the 16 km2 study catchment—principally comprised of weak mélange—pervasive post-LGM landslides responded to >50 m of fluvial incision by sculpting and denuding >99% of the catchment, but adjustment is not yet complete. Starting ~150 years ago, European settlers deforested ~95% of the landscape, which triggered a sharp increase in hillslope erosion as widespread earthflow complexes and gully systems reactivated and/or expanded in the weak lithology with the loss of vegetation cover. Most of the remaining relict (≥18 ka) landforms are confined to the upper watershed, upholding the proposed upstream progression of hillslope adjustment. Based on previous tephrochronology and surface roughness data, present-day earthflows follow this pattern of younging upstream. Here we analyze the size, location, and distribution of ~500 earthflows (mapped from 2010 lidar and orthophotos) to determine if there is a spatial progression of earthflows reflective of hillslope adjustment and correlated to the previously identified temporal progression. Morphologic evidence from this study indicates the younger earthflows in the upper watershed have smaller areas (6000 ± 600 m2 (mean ± s.e.)), a more elongate aspect ratio (AR=3.6 ± 1.6 (mean ± s.d.)), and are generally (>50%) deposited in axial gullies, whereas downstream earthflows are larger (20000 ± 9000 m2), statistically less elongate (AR=2.3 ± 0.9), and more frequently coupled with the main channel—in two cases, encompassing the entire sub-catchments. We suggest this difference in form is not necessarily reflective of activity, but rather a diagnostic indicator of relative age and progression of earthflow development.",

In 2010 The US Environmental Protection Agency established the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL), which seeks to protect the Bay’s living resources by reducing nutrient and sediment runoff to its waters, and sets pollution reduction targets for sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus across 64000 sq. miles watershed that includes parts of six states - Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia — and the entire District of Columbia. The Chesapeake Bay Program and the US EPA have developed a number of tools to track the progress of restoration. In this study we describe data management solutions, which were used in the integration of data such as land use, nutrient applications, management practices, policies among the bay jurisdictions, and a summary of a suite of tools that were developed and are being used to collect, process, and report data at various spatial scales for tracking the progress made by the seven Bay jurisdictions in achieving reductions in nutrient and sediment runoff. The described integration strategy and data management solutions can be used in the development and application of similar regulatory local or regional scale environmental management tools.",

            "abstract": "The reliability and accuracy of hydrological predictions are subject to various sources of uncertainty, including meteorological forcing, initial conditions, model parameters and model structure. To reduce the total uncertainty in hydrological applications, one approach is to reduce the uncertainty in meteorological forcing by using the statistical methods based on the conditional probability density functions (pdf). However, one of the requirements for current methods is to assume the Gaussian distribution for the marginal distribution of the observed and modeled meteorology. Here we propose a Bayesian approach based on Copula functions to develop the conditional distribution of precipitation forecast needed in deriving a hydrologic model for a sub-basin in the Columbia River Basin. Copula functions are introduced as an alternative approach in capturing the uncertainties related to meteorological forcing. Copulas are multivariate joint distribution of univariate marginal distributions, which are capable to model the joint behavior of variables with any level of correlation and dependency. The method is applied to the monthly forecast of CPC with 0.25x0.25 degree resolution to reproduce the PRISM dataset over 1970-2000. Results are compared with Ensemble Pre-Processor approach as a common procedure used by National Weather Service River forecast centers in reproducing observed climatology during a ten-year verification period (2000-2010).",

            "abstract": "The focus on ecosystem stress and climate change is currently relevant as researchers and policymakers strive to understand the feedbacks between soil C dynamics and climate change. Successful development of molecular profiles that link soil microbiology with soil carbon (C) to ascertain soil vulnerability and resilience to climate change would have great impact on assessments of soil ecosystems in response to climate change. Additionally, better understanding of the dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM) plays a central role to climate modeling, and fate and transport of carbon. The use of ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHR MS) has enabled the examination of molecules, directly from mixtures, with ultrahigh mass resolution and sub-ppm mass accuracy. In this study, EMSL’s extensive expertise and capabilities in UHR MS proteomics were leveraged to develop extraction protocols for the characterization of carbon compounds in SOM, thereby providing the chemical and structural detail needed to develop mechanistic descriptions of soil carbon flow processes. Our experiments have allowed us to identify thousands of individual compounds in complex soil mixtures with a wide range of C content representing diverse ecosystems within the USA. The yield of the chemical extraction was dependent on (1) the type of solvent used and its polarity, (2) sample-to-solvent ratios and (3) the chemical and physical nature of the samples including their origins. Hexane, a non-polar organic solvent, was efficient in extracting lipid-like compounds regardless of soil origin or organic carbon %. For samples with high organic carbon %, acetonitrile extracted a wide range of compounds characterized with high O/C ratios, identified as polyphenolic compounds that were not observed with methanol extraction. Soils extracted with pyridine showed a similar molecular distribution to those extracted by methanol. Solvent extraction followed by UHR MS is a promising tool to understand the dynamics of soil organic matter. The information gained from this study has been used on different user proposals assessing the sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change. We present examples of several studies and demonstrate its potential in other studies involving the simulated change or ecosystem gradients.",

            "abstract": "Perovskite is a very useful mineral for dating the age of emplacement of kimberlites and associated rocks. Conventionally, U-Pb dating of perovskite is achieved using isotope dilution (ID-TIMS) or ion-probe (SHRIMP) techniques, which are time- and cost-intensive. The potential of the rapid and inexpensive laser ablation ICP-MS technique for U-Pb dating of perovskite has been demonstrated recently. We investigated the benefits of single collector magnetic sectorfield ICP-MS (SF-ICP-MS) instruments for U-Pb dating of perovskite by laser ablation. To this end perovskites from two kimberlites from Garnet Lake, W Greenland, and Pyramidefjeld, SW Greenland, have been separated. Multigrain aliquots of both perovskite separates were U-Pb dated by ID-TIMS, yielding emplacement ages of 568 ±11 Ma for the Garnet Lake kimberlite and 151 ±2 Ma for the Pyramidefjeld kimberlite. Subsequently both samples have been dated in-situ by laser ablation employing a ThermoFinnigan Element2 SF-ICP-MS coupled to a NewWave UP 213 laser system. A common lead correction was applied based on the measured 204Pb intensity (after correction for the measured 204(Pb+Hg) gas blank). Perovskite from the Ice River Complex, British Columbia, was used as a secondary standard for quality control purposes. Multiple in-situ measurements of the Ice River perovskite in two different analytical sessions yielded concordia ages of 359 ±3 Ma and 357 ±3 Ma, in excellent agreement with the age of 356 Ma determined by ID-TIMS (Heaman, pers. comm.). Nineteen in-situ analyses of perovskite grains extracted from the Garnet Lake kimberlite yielded a concordia age of 566 ±5 Ma, also in excellent agreement with the age obtained by ID-TIMS. Because of the very low Pb contents in perovskites from the Pyramidefjeld (around 1 ppm) and the associated large uncertainties of the common lead correction, no concordia age could be obtained. However, the in-situ laser ablation analysis yielded a common lead corrected weighted average 206Pb/238U age of 152 ±3 Ma which is again in excellent agreement with the weighted average 206Pb/238U age of 152 ±2 Ma obtained by ID-TIMS. We therefore conclude that laser ablation SF-ICP-MS is a fast and inexpensive method for precise and accurate common lead corrected U-Pb dating of perovskite, and hence diamond exploration.",

            "abstract": "Land subsidence due to groundwater over-exploitation is a deformation process affecting many cities around the world. This type of subsidence develops gradual vertical deformations reaching only a few centimeters per year, but can affect large areas. Consequently, inhabitants of subsiding areas are not aware of the process until others effects are observed, such as ground surface faulting, damage to building, or changes in the natural superficial drain.\nIn order to mitigate and forecast subsidence consequences, it is useful to conduct numerical modeling of the subsidence process. Modeling the subsidence includes the following three basic tasks: a) Delimitation of the shape of the deforming body; b) Determination of the forces that are causing the deformations; and c) Determination of the mechanical properties of the deforming body according with an accepted rheological model. In the case of a land subsidence process, the deforming body is the aquifer system that is being drained. Usually, stratigraphic information from pumping wells, and other geophysical data are used to define the boundaries and shape of the aquifer system. The deformation governing forces, or stresses, can be calculated using the theory of \"effective stress\". Mechanical properties are usually determined with laboratory testing of samples from shallow strata, because the determination of these properties in samples from the deepest strata is economically or technically unviable. Consequently, the results of the numerical modeling do not necessarily match the observed subsidence evolution and ground faulting.\nWe present in this work numerical simulation results of the land subsiding of the Valley of Aguascalientes, Mexico. Two analyses for the same subsiding area are presented. In the first of them, we used the mechanical properties of only the shallow strata, whereas in the second analysis we used “macroscopic\" mechanical properties data determined for the whole aquifer system using InSAR observations, using in this way, the entire stratigraphy that is contributing to the surface deformation measured by InSAR. A discussion of the results of both analyses, as well as preliminary conclusions are presented.",

            "abstract": "The amplitude of tropical paleotemperature variability on glacial/interglacial time scales has been hotly debated for decades, as sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions from the tropics have repeatedly shown less warming than reconstructions from high elevations from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to present. This debate is complicated by the fact that SST and high elevation reconstructions rely on different proxies, which inherently contain different errors and assumptions. Here we present a new equatorial paleotemperature record from Lake Rutundu, Mt. Kenya (3081 m above sea level) based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) and compare it to previously published East African GDGT temperature reconstructions at different elevations to assess the timing and amplitude of temperature changes with altitude. We find that the overall amplitude of warming in the Lake Rutundu record is 6.8±1.0°C from the LGM to the present, with mid-Holocene temperatures 1.6±0.9°C warmer than modern.\nBy combining our Lake Rutundu record with three previously published GDGT temperature records from different elevations in East Africa (Sacred Lake, Lake Tanganyika, and Lake Malawi), we can calculate changes in lapse rates and freezing level heights (FLHs) through time. We find that lapse rates were steeper at the LGM (-7.4ºC/km) compared to the modern (-6.1ºC/km), likely due to widespread regional aridity at the LGM. FLHs were nearly 1000 m lower than they are today, which is supported by regional equilibrium line altitude (ELA) reconstructions from East African moraines. Patterns of altitudinal temperature variability and lapse rate changes reflect those from the TraCE-21 paleoclimate model, but amplitudes of model data variability are much smaller.",

            "abstract": "Mars does not have a global magnetic field, so the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) can impact the upper atmosphere and induce currents in the Martian ionosphere. During aerobraking maneuvers, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) made over 1000 passes through the Martian ionosphere. During the aerobraking phase, MGS measured the local magnetic field in the ionosphere. From measuring changes in the magnetic field, we can calculate the ionospheric currents. By only using measurements where the radial component of the magnetic field is zero and making some assumptions about the gradients in the magnetic field, we are allowed to classify data that meets those conditions as “good” data and calculate horizontal currents in the ionosphere. We focus on data taken over regions of Mars that had negligible crustal magnetic fields to simplify our analysis. The data being analyzed is observed at a maximum altitude of 250 kilometers with a solar zenith angle (SZA) range of 0 degrees to 50 degrees for the day side and 50 to 130 degrees for the terminator. For the day side of Mars, it was found that 24.06% of the data observed was usable data under the initial parameters that were set for “good” data. For the terminator, it was found that 32.08% of the data was usable. The currents that are computed using these “good” magnetic field profiles can give us insights into how the changing solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field can effect the upper atmosphere of mars. For example, induced currents can lead to Joule heating of the atmosphere potentially modifying the neutral dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Geysers are natural phenomena that episodically erupt water and steam. Geophysical observations at geysers are analyzed to shed light on subsurface multi-phase mass and heat exchange processes and geometries controlling geyser eruptions, which are still are not completely understood. Lone Star Geyser (LSG) in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA erupts every ~3 hours, with brief episodes (~5-10 min) of water and steam fountaining (preplays) leading up to the main eruption (~28 min), and the discharge evolves from a water-dominated phase to a steam-dominated phase as the main eruption proceeds in time. We describe observations from multiple seismometers deployed around LSG as part of a comprehensive geophysical survey conducted in April 2014. 3-component seismograms were continuously recorded at 250 samples per second by 6 Nanometrics Trillium 120 P/PA broadband seismometers (lower corner frequency at 120 seconds) and Taurus dataloggers at distances ~10 to 25 m from the geyser cone for a period of 3 days. We identify distinct episodes of hydrothermal tremor associated with preplay events and main eruptions. We find that the dominant tremor frequencies during main eruptions are consistently higher (> 10.0 Hz) than those during preplays (> 1.0 Hz) indicating slightly different source locations or processes controlling the two phenomena. Unlike seismic observations at the Old Faithful Geyser, we also observe subtle harmonic tremor and spectral gliding in the frequency range ~1.0-8.0 Hz towards the end of both main eruption and preplay tremor episodes. We interpret long-period pulses on horizontal components of the seismometers located close to the geyser and synchronous with preplays, as pseudo-tilts resulting from deformation of the sinter terrace. We also compare the evolution of hydrothermal tremor in time with synchronous changes in temperature, acoustic emission and discharge for interpretation of the possible tremor source processes.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate minerals are common in sedimentary rocks including in formations that serve as caprock seals. These formations are intended to stop migration of injected fluids, such as CO2 in the context of geologic carbon sequestration, ensuring permanent isolation from the atmosphere. Fractures in caprocks may allow injected CO2 and pressurized brine to escape. If the caprock contains substantial amounts of carbonates, flow of acidified fluids may cause substantial mineral dissolution which would increase the leakiness over time. Our research seeks to understand this process with particular attention to the evolution of fracture geometry and the implications for flow permeability. Our work combines high-pressure core flow experiments, x-ray imaging methods, reactive transport modeling, and computational fluid dynamics simulations. We have found that fracture permeability can increase substantially as a result of calcite dissolution. However, the extent of permeability increase is affected by complex alterations in fracture geometry. Newly-formed surface roughness and microporosity diminishes flow relative to what would be predicted by conventional practical models such as the local cubic law model. In contrast, channelization could lead to higher-than-expected flow rates because such fractures would stabilize open flow paths against geomechanical closure forces. Modeling these processes requires fine-scale 2D, if not 3D, reactive transport flow models that simulate not only the increase in fracture aperture but also the evolution in fracture geometry. Development of computationally-tractable reactive transport models that accurately predict reaction-induced changes in fracture permeability is an ongoing research priority in our lab. ",

            "abstract": "We have explored the new multiannual chemistry-aerosol assimilated datasets, available from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate) reanalysis, and tested their validity by comparison with independent observations from biomass burning regions. Our aim is to focus on quantifying the budget of primary and secondary emitted species and test current descriptions of chemical feedbacks between assimilated and non-assimilated species.\nAs emissions significantly influence gas-phase chemistry and aerosol concentrations, tropical biomass burning (BB) is an area of key uncertainty regarding regional atmospheric composition and climate. The recent SAMBBA (South AMerican Biomass Burning Analysis) field campaign in 2012 provides high quality ground and aircraft biomass burning observations. By comparing the MACC reanalysis, the same model system not initialised using chemical data assimilation, and in-situ observations from SAMBBA, we can quantify the influences of data assimilation on assimilated and non-assimilated species in BB regions.\nIn initial comparisons MACC O3 has a negative bias when compared to SAMBBA flight data, which is more significant in BB plumes and at high altitudes. Previous MACC data validation with other datasets generally showed a positive bias. This could indicate a greater influence of BB plumes on O3 concentrations, which is not picked up by the coarser reanalysis resolution. The high CO concentrations seen in biomass burning plumes in the campaign data is not picked up by the MACC reanalysis. This is likely due to the poor sensitivity of the IASI and MOPITT satellite at low altitudes which is used in the assimilation. The poster will show further comparisons with chemical and aerosol fields, including black carbon.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing (fracking) has become an increasingly popular method for extraction of oil and natural gas from tight formations. Concerns have been raised over a number of environmental risks associated with fracking, including contamination of groundwater by fracking fluids, upwelling of deep subsurface brines, and methane migration. Given the potentially long time scale for contaminant transport associated with hydraulic fracturing, numerical modeling remains the best practice for risk assessment. Oil shale in the Humboldt basin of northeastern Nevada has now become a target for hydraulic fracturing operations. Analysis of regional and shallow groundwater flow is used to assess several potential migration pathways specific to the geology and hydrogeology of this basin. The model domain in all simulations is defined by the geologic structure of the basin as determined by deep oil and gas well bores and formation outcrops. Vertical transport of gaseous methane along a density gradient is simulated in TOUGH2, while fluid transport along faults and/or hydraulic fractures and lateral flow through more permeable units adjacent to the targeted shale are modeled in FEFLOW. Sensitivity analysis considers basin, fault, and hydraulic fracturing parameters, and results highlight key processes that control fracking fluid and methane migration and time scales under which it might occur.",

            "abstract": "Located at the summit of Mount Washington (1917 m asl; ~800 hPa), the highest peak in the northeastern United States, the Mount Washington Observatory has meticulously recorded hourly temperature, humidity, cloud-cover, and other atmospheric variables for over 80 years using the same standard procedures to ensure high-quality, homogeneous data. Nearby Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (253 m asl; ~980 hPa), a Long-Term Ecological Research site, has recorded atmospheric and environmental data since 1956. Together, these two sites provide a unique opportunity to evaluate elevation-dependent climate changes.\nUsing Sen’s slope and the Mann Kendall non-parameteric test we examine annual and seasonal trends in minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures. Both Mount Washington and Hubbard Brook exhibit 56-yr warming trends for most seasons, however, the magnitudes and statistical significances are variable, suggesting the processes controlling these trends likely differ with elevation. Since 1957, for instance, spring maximum temperatures at Hubbard Brook have warmed 0.32 °C dec-1 and winter minimums have increased 0.54 °C dec-1, both well within the range reported for six neighboring low elevation stations from 1970-2012 (Wake et al, 2014a,b). In comparison, Mount Washington summit seasonal minimum temperature trends are typically weaker, with changes in winter minimums (the largest of the seasons) reaching only 0.33 °C dec-1.\nIn this presentation, we highlight differences between these two long-term records and discuss possible role of moist processes and boundary layer/free troposphere exposure in causing their divergence. Authors are planning to study the effects of humidity and cloud-cover on summit temperatures and to investigate how changes in the frequency with which the summit is exposed to boundary layer and free tropospheric air masses influences these relationships.",

The Bay-Delta also harbors important habitats for many organisms, including commercial and endangered species. Recently, the Delta Stewardship Council developed a two component mission (coequal goals) to 1) provide a more reliable water supply for California while 2) protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Bay-Delta ecosystem. Dissolved organic carbon, turbidity, and contaminants such as methylmercury represent important water quality issues for water management and in the context of wetland restoration in the Bay-Delta, and can threaten the achievement of the coequal goals. Here, we use field measurements of optical properties, chemical analyses, and remotely sensed data acquired with the airborne Portable Remote Imaging SpectroMeter (PRISM ;\nhttp://prism.jpl.nasa.gov/index.html\n) to demonstrate these water quality parameters and the study of their dynamics in the Bay-Delta are amenable to remote sensing. PRISM provides high signal-to-noise, high spatial resolution (~2 m), hyperspectral measurements of remote-sensing reflectance in the 350-1050 nm range, and therefore has the adequate resolutions for water quality monitoring in inland, optically complex waters. Remote sensing of water quality will represent a valuable complement to existing in situ water quality monitoring programs in this region and will help with decision-making to achieve the co-equal goals.",

            "abstract": "As climate change and weather variability raise issues regarding agricultural production, agricultural sustainability has become an increasingly important component for farmland management (Fisher, 2005, Akinci, 2013). Yet with changes in soil quality, agricultural practices, weather, topography, land use, and hydrology – accurately modeling such agricultural outcomes has proven difficult (Gassman et al, 2007, Williams et al, 1995). This study examined agricultural sustainability and soil health over a heterogeneous multi-watershed area within the Inland Pacific Northwest of the United States (IPNW) - as part of a five year, USDA funded effort to explore the sustainability of cereal production systems (Regional Approaches to Climate Change for Pacific Northwest Agriculture - award #2011-68002-30191). In particular, crop growth and soil erosion were simulated across a spectrum of variables and time periods - using the CropSyst crop growth model (Stockle et al, 2002) and the Water Erosion Protection Project Model (WEPP - Flanagan and Livingston, 1995), respectively. A preliminary range of historical scenarios were run, using a high-resolution, 4km gridded dataset of surface meteorological variables from 1979-2010 (Abatzoglou, 2012). In addition, Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5) global climate model (GCM) outputs were used as input to run crop growth model and erosion future scenarios (Abatzoglou and Brown, 2011). To facilitate our integrated data analysis efforts, an agricultural sustainability web service architecture (THREDDS/Java/Python based) is under development, to allow for the programmatic uploading, sharing and processing of variable input data, running model simulations, as well as downloading and visualizing output results. The results of this study will assist in better understanding agricultural sustainability and erosion relationships in the IPNW, as well as provide a tangible server-based tool for use by researchers and farmers – for both small scale field examination, or more regionalized scenarios.",

The spectroscopic observations lead us to determine the physical and chemical conditions (e.g., atmospheric pressure, temperatures, composition, abundances …). In order to avoid false interpretations of the observed spectra, the molecular spectroscopic information (either line parameters or cross sections) must be sufficiently accurate and complete.\n To achieve this goal, we employ a broad-band Fourier transform spectrometer, Bruker IFS-125HR equipped with multiple detectors (He-cooled bolometers, N2-cooled MCT and InSb, warm InGaAs, Boron-doped silicates, photodiode) and beamsplitters (Mylars, KBr, CaF2, Quartz) sufficient to cover entire infrared spectra region from 20 to 15000 cm-1. We vacuum-couple up to 15 different absorption cells to the FT-IR, including five coolable cells with optical path lengths ranging from 0.02 m to 52 m; three of them are capable of reaching temperatures down to 50 K. We also have one heatable cell reaching 400 K. Finally, an extra vacuum chamber newly implemented to the Bruker 125HR enables both emission and absorption spectroscopy utilizing the emission port of the FT-IR.\nRecently, several studies of atmospheric molecules have been completed using the FT-IR at JPL in support of the Earth, terrestrial and planetary atmospheric remote sensing. These include analyses of C3H8 (propane) and 16O12C17O mid- and near-infrared regions, 13C12CH6 and 12C2H6 at longer wavelengths. In addition, we are studying the O2(A) line mixing and collision-induced absorption in the O2 A-band at 0.76 µm, as well as temperature-dependent cross sections of C6H6 (benzene) and C3H6 (propene) in the mid-infrared region. We will present an overview of results and work in progress.\n[Research described in this paper was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Connecticut College, and NASA Langley Research Center, under contracts and cooperative agreements with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.]",

            "abstract": "There are many challenges in using, developing, and ensuring the viability of crowd-sourced data. Establishing and maintaining relevance is one of them but each participant in the challenge has different criteria for relevance. Consider, for example, the collection of data using smart phones. Some participants just like to contribute to something they consider good for the community. How do you engender that commitment? This becomes especially problematic when an additional sensor may need to be added to the smart phone. Certainly the humanitarian-egalitarian may be willing to “buy-in” but what value does it hold for the entrepreneurial-individualist? Another challenge is that of the crowd-sourced data themselves. Most readily available apps collect only one kind of data. The frontier lies in not only aggregating the data from those devices but in fusing the data with other data types (e.g. satellite imagery, installed sensors, radars, etc.). Doing this requires resources and the establishment and negotiation of data rights, how data are valued, how data are used, and the model used for support of the process (e.g. profit-driven, communal, scientific, etc.).\nIn this talk we will discuss a few problems that we have looked at wherein distributed sensor networks provide potential value, data fusion is a “value multiplier” of those crowd-sourced data and how we make that connection to decision makers.\nWe have explored active decision making through our Global Assimilation of Information for Action project (see our old website http://gaia.jhuapl.edu) and the use of “serious games” to establish affinities and illuminate opportunities and issues. We assert that the field of dreams approach (“build it and they will come”) is not a sufficiently robust approach; the decision-makers (or paying customers) must be involved in the process of defining the data system products and quantifying the value proposition for their clients.",

Calculated aggregate elastic moduli and acoustic velocities for the Mg-end member (x=0) are in excellent agreement with the latest high pressure and high temperature measurements. Consequences of the pressure induced iron displacement that results in an increase in iron Mössbauer quadrupole splitting (QS) are also investigated. The main difference on the elastic properties of these states is a softening of the shear modulus by ~1% when iron occupies the high-QS site. However, some other elastic anomalies exist when both iron states co-exist. ",

            "abstract": "Airmass type characterization is key in understanding the relative contribution of various emission sources to atmospheric composition and air quality and can be useful in bottom-up model validation and emission inventories. However, classification of pollution plumes from space is often not trivial. Sub-orbital campaigns, such as SEAC4RS (Studies of Emissions, Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys) give us a unique opportunity to study atmospheric composition in detail, by using a vast suite of in-situ instruments for the detection of trace gases and aerosols. These measurements allow identification of spatial and temporal atmospheric composition changes due to various pollution plumes resulting from urban, biogenic and smoke emissions. Nevertheless, to transfer the knowledge gathered from such campaigns into a global spatial and temporal context, there is a need to develop workflow that can be applicable to measurements from space. In this work we rely on sub-orbital in-situ and total column remote sensing measurements of various pollution plumes taken aboard the NASA DC-8 during 2013 SEAC4RS campaign, linking them through a neural-network (NN) algorithm to allow inference of pollution plume types by input of columnar aerosol and trace-gas measurements. In particular, we use the 4STAR (Spectrometer for Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research) airborne measurements of wavelength dependent aerosol optical depth (AOD), particle size proxies, O3, NO2 and water vapor to classify different pollution plumes. Our method relies on assigning a-priori “ground-truth” labeling to the various plumes, which include urban pollution, different fire types (i.e. forest and agriculture) and fire stage (i.e. fresh and aged) using cluster analysis of aerosol and trace-gases in-situ and expert input and the training of a NN scheme to fit the best prediction parameters using 4STAR measurements as input. We explore our misclassification rates as related to our “ground-truth” labels, and with multi-layered pollution plume cases. The next step in our analysis is to optimize parameter selection for a scheme that can be applied to space-borne aerosol and trace-gas observation platforms such as OMI, and future geostationary satellites such as TEMPO and GEO-CAPE.",

This works further develops an algorithm for retrieving surface melt magnitude using coupled near-IR and thermal surface measurements from MODIS, calibrated by estimates of liquid water fraction (LWF) in the upper 1cm of the firn derived from a one-dimensional thermal snowmelt model (SNTHERM). SNTHERM was forced by hourly meteorological data from automatic weather station (AWS) data at several reference sites spanning a range of melt conditions across the Greenland Ice Sheet during the most extensive melt season in the MODIS satellite record, 2012. Effective melt magnitude or LWF<eff> was derived for 8-day composite periods covering the summer months of July and August at a 1km resolution over the entire ice sheet. This work represents a step forward in characterizing not only melt occurrence and duration but also melt magnitude, and at a higher spatial resolution than current passive microwave melt detection methods. Calibration using the 2012 melt season will allow detection of a wider range of surface melt conditions than prior assessments.",

            "abstract": "Streamflow contributions from snowpack remain difficult to predict in snow dominated headwater catchments in the Rocky Mountains. There remains considerable uncertainty in how environmental change in mountain watersheds alter seasonal snowpack accumulation and development and how these relationships translate from gaged to ungaged catchments. Stable isotope analysis is a valuable tool for determining the contribution and changes of different source inputs to catchment water budgets. Stable isotope values in snowpack integrate source inputs and processes such as water vapor exchange, selective redistribution, and melt. For better understanding of how these physical processes vary at local and catchment scales, snowpack density, depth, snow water equivalence (SWE), δ2H and δ18O were examined at peak snowpack in spring 2013 and 2014 and at monthly time steps throughout the winter of 2013-2014. Distributed data and sample collection occurred between 2400 and 3300 m elevation across two pine beetle and spruce beetle impacted forest stands with variable canopy cover in the Libby Creek and Nash Fork Little Laramie River basins, Medicine Bow Range, Wyoming. Peak snowpack within these watersheds was 10% below historic average in 2013 and 50% above average in 2014 (NRCS Snotel data). Even with these contrasting peak snowpack patterns, elevation described less than 40% of the spatial variation of snow water equivalents (SWE) across the watersheds for both seasons. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratio values of snowpack sampled monthly in 2014 revealed early season separation from the local meteoric water line, suggesting some kinetic isotope effects. However, isotope ratio values at peak snowpack in 2013 reflected no such signal at any sampling location. The influence of landscape position and canopy cover will be modeled to detect and scale spatial and temporal changes in SWE and stable isotope composition of snowpack. Such an approach will provide increased understanding of how snowpack evolution varies across terrain features and how climate and land cover disturbances may affect snowpack development in Rocky Mountain watersheds.",

VISL will allow users to perform guided experiments using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), a state-of-the-art ice flow model developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and UC Irvine that simulates the near-term evolution of the ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. VISL users will access ISSM via a graphical interface that can be launched from a web browser on a computer, tablet or smart phone. Users select climate conditions and run time by moving graphic sliders then watch how a given region evolves in time under those conditions. Lesson plans will include conceptual background, instructions for table top experiments related to the concepts addressed in a given lesson, and a guide for performing model experiments and interpreting their results. Activities with different degrees of complexity will aim for consistency with NGSS Physical Science criteria for different grade bands (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12), although they will not be labeled as such to encourage a broad user base. Activities will emphasize the development of physical intuition and critical thinking skills, understanding conceptual and computational models, as well as observation recording, concept articulation, hypothesis formulation and testing, and mathematical analysis. At our present phase of development, we seek input from the greater science education and outreach communities regarding VISL’s planned content, as well as additional features and topic areas that educators and students would find useful.",

            "abstract": "Communities along the coast of Oregon, Washington, and northern California live with the threat of potentially devastating subduction zone earthquakes and subsequent tsunami that could happen at any time. Both residents and visitors to the coast need to be aware of the potential impacts such hazards can have on their lives as well as what to do during an earthquake and before a tsunami hits.\nTo raise awareness of both natural hazards and the technologies used to monitor them, UNAVCO designed and installed a museum exhibit on display at Oregon State University’s Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC) Visitor Center in Newport, Oregon. The objectives for the exhibit are to increase familiarization with the natural hazards of earthquakes and tsunamis in the Cascadia region, to explain the connection between the crust’s movement and compression over time with the potential strength of a subduction-zone earthquake, and to inform visitors about high-precision, high-rate GPS technology. The exhibit includes multiple hands-on models and an authentic GPS monitoring station. Additionally, panels explain the science behind the models, potential impacts of a great earthquake to society, and actions visitors can take to practice earthquake safety through the Great ShakeOut earthquake drill.\nOver the past year that the exhibit has been open to the public, it has been visited by over 100,000 people including students, family and senior groups, and the general public. Anecdotal evidence indicates that two components of the exhibit create the most visitor impact providing visitors with ‘ah ha moments': a real-scale tape measure showing the approximate 12 foot distance the coast has compressed over the past 300+ years, and a flexible map illustrating that the coastal areas are compressing the most compared to areas further inland.\nThrough HMSC's NSF-funded Cyberlab automated visitor data collection system, we have been able to document and analyze a variety of visitor characteristics including number of people visiting the various elements of the exhibit, time on exhibit elements, order of visitation, grouping characteristics, and basic use of the exhibit as a learning tool by groups. During this session we will share the successes and challenges of the exhibit and next steps to further raise awareness about natural hazards of the region.",

We can control the accuracy which can direclty impact how certain we are in final trend results. We can control how often we take measurements; for some parameters, such as trace gases, weekly, monthly or seasonal measurements are prohibited due to logistics or cost. We can control where we measure--including distributions of networks, or satellite footprint size. Finally, we can control what ancillary measurements are taken to determine the attribution of trends to better identify underlying trends.

            "abstract": "Recent research argued that the Hadley circulation (HC) is composed of three regional cells located at the eastern edges of the ocean basins, rather than a single, globe-encircling cell as the classic textbook view suggests. The HC is expected to expand in concert with global warming, which means that the dry regions beneath the descending branches of the HC are projected to become even drier. Changes in the HC are thus likely to impact freshwater resources on land, as well as the underlying ocean in the subtropics. The eastern edges of ocean basins are characterized by oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), which are regions of very low oxygen concentrations. They affect marine life, as many animals cannot handle the stress caused by such conditions. OMZs have expanded and shoaled in the last 50 years, and they are expected to continue to do so as global climate changes.\nThe purpose of this research is to find links between the projected changes in OMZs and the HC. The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model 1.0 (CESM), Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) experiment with a resolution of 0.9 by 1.25 degrees, which formed part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), was used for this analysis. Meridional winds and oceanic oxygen concentrations were the primarily analyzed variables. Latitudinal ocean oxygen slices demonstrate the OMZs’ location along the eastern edges of ocean basins. Meridional winds overlayed with oxygen concentration are consistent with the idea that surface meridional ‘Hadleywise flow’ (i.e., towards the equator at the surface and towards the poles aloft) and OMZs are linked through changes in upwelling. Area-averaged time series spanning the historical period through to the end of the 21st century with RCP8.5 confirm that future changes in OMZs and the HC may be connected. Further research could lead to improved understanding of the factors that drive changes in both, which could help anticipate and mitigate the consequences discussed previously.",

Outdoor experiences, including gardening and farming, are often among the motivations for students to take their first geoscience courses in college. The methods and theories of small agriculture translate well into geologic research questions, especially in the unique setting of college campus farms and gardens. We propose an activity or assignment to engage student-farmers in thinking about geosciences, and connect them with geoscience departments as a gateway to the major and career field. Furthermore, the activity will encourage a new generation of passionate young farmers to integrate the principles of earth science into their design and implementation of more sustainable food systems. The activity includes mapping, soil sampling, and interviewing professionals in agriculture and geology, and results in the students writing a series of recommendations for their campus or other farm. The activity includes assessment tools for instructors and can be used to give credit for a summer farming internship or as part of a regular course. We believe reaching out to students interested in farming could be an important recruitment tool for geosciences and helps build interdisciplinary and community partnerships.",

            "abstract": "CO2 emissions need not only stop; according the IPCC, emissions need to turn negative. This requires means to remove CO2 from air and store it safely and permanently. We outline a combination of secure geosequestration and direct capture of CO2 from ambient air to create negative emissions at remote locations. Operation at remote sites avoids many difficulties associated with capture at the source, where space for added equipment is limited, good storage sites are in short supply, and proximity to private property engenders resistance.\nLarge Igneous Provinces have been tested as secure CO2 reservoirs. CO2 and water react with reservoir rock to form stable carbonates, permanently sequestering the carbon. Outfitting reservoirs in large igneous provinces far from human habitation with ambient air capture systems creates large CO2 sequestration sites. Their remoteness offers advantages in environmental security and public acceptance and, thus, can smooth the path toward CO2 stabilization.\nDirect capture of CO2 from ambient air appears energetically and economically viable and could be scaled up quickly. Thermodynamic energy requirements are very small and a number of approaches have shown to be energy efficient in practice. Sorbent technologies include supported organoamines, alkaline brines, and quaternary ammonium based ion-exchange resins. To demonstrate that the stated goals of low cost and low energy consumption can be reached at scale, public research and demonstration projects are essential.\nWe suggest co-locating air capture and geosequestration at sites where renewable energy resources can power both activities. Ready renewable energy would also allow for the co-production of synthetic fuels. Possible locations with large wind and basalt resources include Iceland and Greenland, the north-western United States, the Kerguelen plateau, Siberia and Morocco. Capture and sequestration in these reservoirs could recover all of the emissions of the 20th century and still contribute to a carbon neutral economy throughout the 21st century. Mobilizing industrial infrastructure to these areas poses a challenge. However, the urgency of the climate problem requires immediate action, with economic incentives and commitments to site evaluation and engineering development.",

            "abstract": "We present the Ground Motion Parameters Map Generation (GMPMG) system developed by the Institute of Engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The system delivers estimates of information associated with the social impact of earthquakes, engineering ground motion parameters (gmp), and macroseismic intensity maps. The gmp calculated are peak ground acceleration and velocity (pga and pgv) and response spectral acceleration (SA). The GMPMG relies on real-time data received from strong ground motion stations belonging to UNAM's networks throughout Mexico. Data are gathered via satellite and internet service providers, and managed with the data acquisition software Earthworm.\nThe system is self-contained and can perform all calculations required for estimating gmp and intensity maps due to earthquakes, automatically or manually. An initial data processing, by baseline correcting and removing records containing glitches or low signal-to-noise ratio, is performed. The system then assigns a hypocentral location using first arrivals and a simplified 3D model, followed by a moment tensor inversion, which is performed using a pre-calculated Receiver Green's Tensors (RGT) database for a realistic 3D model of Mexico. A backup system to compute epicentral location and magnitude is in place. A Bayesian Kriging is employed to combine recorded values with grids of computed gmp. The latter are obtained by using appropriate ground motion prediction equations (for pgv, pga and SA with T=0.3, 0.5, 1 and 1.5 s ) and numerical simulations performed in real time, using the aforementioned RGT database (for SA with T=2, 2.5 and 3 s). Estimated intensity maps are then computed using SA(T=2S) to Modified Mercalli Intensity correlations derived for central Mexico. The maps are made available to the institutions in charge of the disaster prevention systems.\nIn order to analyze the accuracy of the maps, we compare them against observations not considered in the computations, and present some examples of recent earthquakes. We conclude that the system provides information with a fair goodness-of-fit against observations.\nThis project is partially supported by DGAPA-PAPIIT (UNAM) project TB100313-RR170313.",

            "abstract": "The recurrent ice ages of the Quaternary period (i.e., the past ~2.6 million years) have been linked to slow changes in the shape and orientation of Earth’s orbit and the tilt of its axis. But these orbital variations produce only very small changes in Earth’s global and annual mean radiation budget, implying that climate feedback mechanisms are essential to the large glacial-interglacial climate variations that are documented in the paleoclimate record. We examine the radiative feedbacks operating in simulations of the response of climate to orbital forcing with the GFDL CM2.1 coupled atmosphere-ocean model. When evaluated on an annual and global mean basis, such feedbacks are an order of magnitude larger that the direct radiative forcing that results from changes in orbital parameters. Cloud feedbacks are of particular interest, as they represent a net global cooling effect when the tilt of Earth’s axis is reduced and a warming effect when perihelion is shifted from summer to winter. At high northern latitudes in summer, where ice sheet growth originated during incipient glacial periods, cloud feedbacks oppose the direct effect of orbital forcing that was first identified by Milankovitch as the driver of glacial-interglacial climate variations. In contrast, the effects of growing ice sheets may induce a cloud feedback response that leads to cooling, as suggested by an analysis of simulations of the climate of the last glacial maximum made in conjunction with the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5).",

            "abstract": "The Udachnaya kimberlite pipe is dominated by ultramafic xenoliths; however, it is the diamondiferous eclogites that are most recovered, with precious few diamondiferous peridotites. A truly unique diamondiferous garnet-peridotite xenolith was recovered, consisting of equal amounts of enstatite (Mg# 92.7) and lherzolitic garnet (Mg# 83.8), with lesser unaltered olivine (Mg# 92-95). High-Resolution X-ray Computerized Tomography (HRXCT) of this strange xenolith produced numerous 2-D and 3-D images, revealing detailed relationship between the diamonds and the host minerals. The modal abundances of the minerals are: diamonds (9.5 vol%); enstatite (38 vol%); pyrope (35 vol%); sulfides (4 vol%; pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite); and the remainder being mainly alteration products, consisting of “spinach” – probably serpentine – mostly in the interior of the peridotite, along with the majority of the diamonds. This 10.5 g peridotite contains >30,000 colorless, all euhedral, octahedral micro-diamonds, with sizes of 100 to 700 mm, many occurring in clusters. This is the absolute highest-yield of diamonds ever in a mantle xenolith – 106 cts/tonne – but tiny Ds.\nThe δ13C isotopic composition in these crystals has a value of -22 ‰, not typical for diamonds of ultramafic paragenesis, which are usually in the narrow range in δ13C (-2 to -8 ‰), characteristic of the mantle (Cartigny, Elements, 2005). Diamonds with such light-isotopic carbon, as low as -44 ‰ typical for eclogitic diamonds, are considered as indicative of subduction of oceanic crust (Sobolev & Sobolev, Russ. G & G, 1980). The majority of diamonds are Type IIa; others are Type IaB. Nitrogen impurity is of the B form indicating a high-aggregation state, considered evidence for long mantle residence times at high temperatures.\nIn some Ds, nano-size inclusions were discovered using TEM techniques and composed of Mg-Al silicate-rich phases, a Ca-carbonate phase, graphite, and fluid. These micro-inclusions represent mantle fluid that had been captured in the diamond growth process, as described by Logvinova (Eur. J Min, 2008). The non-mantle δ13C values to the myriad of diamonds, combined with their nitrogen-aggregation states, are considered as supporting evidence for the formation of the diamonds from metasomatic fluids with crustal signatures.",

            "abstract": "The project 'Integrated Data and Evaluation System for Decadal Scale Prediction' (INTEGRATION) as part of the German decadal prediction project MiKlip develops a central evaluation system. The fully operational hybrid features a HPC shell access and an user friendly web-interface. It employs one common system with a variety of verification tools and validation data from different projects in- and outside of MiKlip. The evaluation system is located at the German Climate Computing Centre (DKRZ) and has direct access to the bulk of its ESGF node including millions of climate model data sets, e.g. from CMIP5 and CORDEX. The database is organized by the international CMOR standard using the meta information of the self-describing model, reanalysis and observational data sets. Apache Solr is used for indexing the different data projects into one common search environment. This implemented meta data system with its advanced but easy to handle search tool supports users, developers and their tools to retrieve the required information. A generic application programming interface (API) allows scientific developers to connect their analysis tools with the evaluation system independently of the programming language used. Users of the evaluation techniques benefit from the common interface of the evaluation system without any need to understand the different scripting languages. Facilitating the provision and usage of tools and climate data increases automatically the number of scientists working with the data sets and identify discrepancies. Additionally, the history and configuration sub-system stores every analysis performed with the evaluation system in a MySQL database. Configurations and results of the tools can be shared among scientists via shell or web-system. Therefore, plugged-in tools gain automatically from transparency and reproducibility. Furthermore, when configurations match while starting a evaluation tool, the system suggests to use results already produced by other users–saving CPU time, I/O and disk space. This study presents the different techniques and advantages of such a hybrid evaluation system making use of a Big Data HPC in climate science. website: www-miklip.dkrz.de visitor-login: guest password: miklip",

            "abstract": "Theory and high-pressure experiments imply a significant water storage capacity of nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs), such as olivine, wadsleyite and ringwoodite, composing the Earth’s upper mantle and transition zone to a depth of 660 km. The presence of water, dissolved as OH into such nominally anhydrous high-pressure silicates, notably influences phase relations, melting behavior, conductivity, elasticity, viscosity and rheology. The first direct evidence for hydration of the transition zone has recently been reported by Pearson et al. (2014) and Schmandt et al. (2014). Knowledge of absolute water contents in NAMs is essential for modeling the Earth’s interior water cycle. To take advantage of IR spectroscopy as highly sensitive water quantification tool, mineral-specific absorption coefficients are required. Such calibration constants can be derived from hydrogen concentrations determined by independent techniques, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), Raman spectroscopy or proton-proton(pp)-scattering. Broad beam pp-scattering has been performed on double-polished mm-sized mineral platelets (Thomas et al. 2008), but until recently analysis was not feasible for smaller samples synthetized in high-pressure apparati. Here we present first results from pp-scattering microscopy studies on µm-sized single crystals of hydrous olivine, wadsleyite and ringwoodite, which were synthesized at various pressure-temperature conditions in a multi-anvil press. The method allows us to quantify 3D distributions of atomic hydrogen in µm dimensions. These self-calibrating measurements were carried out at the nuclear microprobe SNAKE at the Munich tandem accelerator lab using a 25 MeV proton microbeam. We provide hydrogen depth-profiles, hydrogen maps and H2O concentrations. Pp-scattering data and results from independent Raman and SIMS analyses are in good agreement. Water contents for a set of high-pressure polymorphs with varying Fe-concentrations range from 0.8 wt% to 2.5 wt% H2O. From experimental data for Fo83, Fo87, Fo90 and Fo100 compositions we calculate mineral-specific absorption coefficients for the quantification of H2O using IR-spectroscopy, compare them with previously estimated values and discuss IR calibrations for major phases of the Earth’s mantle.",

            "abstract": "Spread of invasive plant species in the coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes is degrading wetland habitat, decreasing biodiversity, and decreasing ecosystem services. An understanding of the mechanisms of invasion is crucial to gaining control of this growing threat. To better understand the effects of land use and climatic drivers on the vulnerability of coastal zones to invasion, as well as to develop an understanding of the mechanisms of invasion, research is being conducted that integrates field studies, process-based ecosystem and hydrological models, and remote sensing.\nSpatial data from remote sensing is needed to parameterize the hydrological model and to test the outputs of the linked models. We will present several new remote sensing products that are providing important physiological, biochemical, and landscape information to parameterize and verify models. This includes a novel hybrid radar-optical technique to delineate stands of invasives, as well as natural wetland cover types; using radar to map seasonally inundated areas not hydrologically connected; and developing new algorithms to estimate leaf area index (LAI) using Landsat. A coastal map delineating wetland types including monocultures of the invaders (Typha spp. and Phragmites austrailis) was created using satellite radar (ALOS PALSAR, 20 m resolution) and optical data (Landsat 5, 30 m resolution) fusion from multiple dates in a Random Forests classifier. These maps provide verification of the integrated model showing areas at high risk of invasion. For parameterizing the hydrological model, maps of seasonal wetness are being developed using spring (wet) imagery and differencing that with summer (dry) imagery to detect the seasonally wet areas. Finally, development of LAI remote sensing high resolution algorithms for uplands and wetlands is underway. LAI algorithms for wetlands have not been previously developed due to the difficulty of a water background. These products are being used to improve the hydrological model through higher resolution products and parameterization of variables that have previously been largely unknown.",

            "abstract": "Experience modeling magnetotelluric (MT) data in a complex three-dimensional (3D) environment shows that analysis of the full impedance tensor is necessary, since using only the principal component (off-diagonal) data can produce artifacts in the imaging process. While analysis of only the off-diagonal components might be justified when the imaging grid is aligned with preferred structural trends in the data, for truly 3D environments this may be difficult if not impossible to achieve. Nevertheless, full MT tensor analysis has its own challenges, especially how one treats data noise in the inversion. For example, some suggest weighting the data with fixed percentages of impedance; however tensor elements can vary by several orders of magnitude at a single period. In these instances, the accuracy of error estimates in the data could be used as they contain useful information regarding measurement uncertainty. We investigate these technical aspects of data noise and appropriate weighting using a large MT survey (259 soundings over 1250 km2) recorded across New Zealand’s Taupo Volcanic Zone. These data have been acquired to explore the deep roots of high temperature geothermal systems, which are thought to arise from convective plumes that extend down to the brittle-ductile transition (~6-8 km depth). However, there is still much to learn about basement structures, permeability and the mechanisms of heat transport below depths of 3 km, which is the present maximum drilled depth. Treatment of full impedance data in the MT inversion process is used to help address these questions in our investigation.",

            "abstract": "2- and 3-Dimensional models obtained from the inversion of geophysical data are widely used to represent the structural composition of the Earth and to constrain independent models obtained from other geological data (e.g. core samples, seismic surveys, etc.). However, inverse modeling of gravity data presents a very unstable and ill-posed mathematical problem, given that solutions are non-unique and small changes in parameters (position and density contrast of an anomalous body) can highly impact the resulting model. Through the implementation of an interior-point method constrained optimization technique, we improve the 2-D and 3-D models of Earth structures representing known density contrasts mapping anomalous bodies in uniform regions and boundaries between layers in layered environments. The proposed techniques are applied to synthetic data and gravitational data obtained from the Rio Grande Rift and the Cooper Flat Mine region located in Sierra County, New Mexico. Specifically, we improve the 2- and 3-D Earth models by getting rid of unacceptable solutions (those that do not satisfy the required constraints or are geologically unfeasible) given the reduction of the solution space.",

The curlometer technique allows a derivation of the current density using measurements of the magnetic field at spatially separated points. At LEO altitudes this generally three dimensionally problem is simplified to a two dimensions by the fact that the current is almost solely flowing along the magnetic field lines. Strictly speaking the current density is derived from integration around a closed loop but in the curlometer technique this integration is simplified to a summation over just three points. In this paper we present a critical analysis of when and to what extend this approximation is valid. We show some simple theoretical considerations, results from a series of simulations, and finally apply the knowledge to ESA SWARM measurements.",

            "abstract": "Wetland inundation and saturation dynamics are the most important abiotic factor controlling the extent and functioning of wetlands. Remote sensing provides a major data source for monitoring wetland dynamics. In this study, we developed a new approach to map wetland inundation in the Delmarva Peninsula from 1985 to 2011. Highly accurate subpixel inundation percentage (SIP) maps were first derived at the 30 m resolution from LiDAR intensity data. These SIP maps were used as reference to establish statistical relationships between SIP and Landsat data. Regional wetland inundation was then mapped by applying the constructed model to Landsat scenes acquired in different years. Results showed that accurate maps of wetland inundation can be created using this approach, and that Landsat data can be calibrated to reveal the inundation state of wetlands and the long-term trend of wetland dynamics at the regional scale. Substantial changes in wetland inundation among dry, average, and wet years were observed, and the changes were found correlated with local drought conditions, particularly in highly inundated areas. Given the fact that Landsat data are globally available and LiDAR data are becoming increasingly affordable and available, the approach developed in this study has the potential for deriving historical inundation changes over the past decades and for monitoring ongoing changes over much larger areas.",

While the field is likely generated by a planetary dynamo in the iron core of Mercury, producing a weak dipolar magnetic field with a displaced magnetic equator has proven to be a challenge for dynamo modelers.\nRecent gravity measurements from the MESSENGER probe allow for a solid, dense layer at the base of Mercury’s mantle. The authors of this study have suggested that this could be a solid layer of FeS. This solid FeS could reduce the observed field strength due to the electromagnetic skin effect. It may also affect the character of the dynamo by coupling to the fluid flow via the Lorenz force.\nWe use a numerical dynamo model with an electrically conducting, solid mantle layer to determine whether this solid layer can help produce the strength and morphology of Mercury’s magnetic field.",

            "abstract": "Urban growth, related to urbanization and consequent land use and land cover changes, can directly modify the Surface Energy Balance (SEB), generating changes in the atmosphere that can vary from local to regional scales. Trying to understand these effects, the main objective of this work is to study the influence of urbanization on the local microclimate of the city of Manaus through numerical simulations using three different scenarios of urban area growth. These scenarios consider a representation of the anthropogenic energy fluxes and physical characteristics of the urban area of Manaus, with a scenario related to urban characteristics in 2008, 1973 and a future scenario considering that the physical area of Manaus will be duplicated as well as anthropogenic fluxes. A first analysis of the results showed that the model has an excellent skill in representing the diurnal cycle of temperature and humidity in urban area. It was observed that the presence of the urban area modifies significantly the SEB, generating a thermal gradient between the city adjacent regions, favoring the formation and intensification of local atmospheric circulations. The growth of the urban area of Manaus had a direct influence on the SEB, where it was observed that with increase in its area there is an increase in temperature, a decrease in moisture and water vapor, as well as significant changes in the flow at low levels (Figure 1) and the structure and characteristic of ABL on the urban region. Was also observed that the flow at low levels, related with breeze circulations, has greater intensity mainly due to the intensification of the thermal gradient. In the general context of the results it was observed that the process of urbanization and the consequently increased of anthropogenic heat fluxes is directly related to changes in local microclimate. It is emphasized so that public policies that aim an organized growth of urban areas and the comfort of the population are necessary for the effects of climate change are not potentiated by existing local microclimate effects related to the process of urbanization.",

The Rim Fire burned over 250,000 acres of forest in Yosemite National Park and Stanislaus National Forest between August and October of 2013. Enhanced post-fire erosion rates have already been well documented in other ecosystems, however these enhanced erosion rates need to be quantified and impacts on soil organic matter (SOM) quality need further investigation. Sediment fences were established along a singular hillslope in three separate combinations of fire severity (high or moderate) and hillslope steepness (high or moderate). Sediment was collected from these fences after each major precipitation event from after the fire through the spring of 2014. The initial storm events (one during February and one during March) transported an order of magnitude more sediment than the later events (sampled in April and May), however the initial events had more sand size class than the April and May events. This may be indicative of changes in the quality of organic matter and the quantity of C transported during the months following the Rim Fire. We will also present initial bulk C and nitrogen transported in sediment within this hillslope, with estimates of C mobilization throughout the fire area.",

In that study, the velocity distribution function (VDF) first formed a tail with the common spectral index of -5 and then gradually became a κ-r distribution, with κ = 1.5, corresponding to the common spectrum. The form of this distribution was found to relate to the electric field distribution function (EDF). These results were robust to a range of initialized densities and thermal speeds; however, this range of parameters did not include values close to those of the solar wind at 1 AU. Here we report on simulations of the same type but for a broader range of parameters, including those of the solar wind and corona. Our earliest findings indicate a lack of consistency in the VDF with the common spectrum, the cause of which again lies in the EDF. The results are instructive for understanding the solar wind ion VDF core and tail, as well as for κ distributed plasmas in general.",

            "abstract": "It can be shown that the field-field correlation function of an imperfectly diffuse wave field is equal to the (time derivative of) Green’s function times the specific intensity of the noise (Weaver, 2013). The theoretical understanding permits the interpretation of correlation amplitudes and promises to facilitate the retrieval of attenuation, site amplification factors, and scattering strengths from the noise correlation. In order to develop methods for extracting attenuation from ambient noise and apply to real data (particularly in Tibetan Plateau), we propose approaches with detailed formulations for a linear array and a more general 2D station network. A particular problem in retrieving amplitudes from noise is that seismic ambient noise source is not uniform and changes with time. We tested numerical simulations with azimuthally and temporally varying noise source, and have started to add internal scattering in the simulations. Our simulations validate that amplitudes and attenuations can indeed be extracted from noise correlations for a linear array or for a more general 2D array. We propose a temporal flattening procedure, which is effective in speeding up convergence while preserving relative amplitudes. For real data, we propose an “asynchronous” temporal flattening procedure that does not require all stations to have the data at the same time. Tests on real data suggest attenuations extracted are comparable with those from earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The Colorado River system is the predominant source of water supply for the Southwest U.S. and is already fully allocated, making the region’s environmental and economic health particularly sensitive to annual and multi-year streamflow variability. Observed streamflow declines in the Colorado Basin in recent years are likely due to synergistic combination of anthropogenic global warming and natural climate variability, which are creating an overall warmer and more extreme climate. IPCC assessment reports have projected warmer and drier conditions in arid to semi-arid regions (e.g. Solomon et al. 2007). The NAM-related precipitation contributes to substantial Colorado streamflows. Recent climate change studies for the Southwest U.S. region project a dire future, with chronic drought, and substantially reduced Colorado River flows. These regional effects reflect the general observation that climate is being more extreme globally, with areas climatologically favored to be wet getting wetter and areas favored to be dry getting drier (Wang et al. 2012). Multi-scale downscaling modeling experiments are designed using recent IPCC AR5 global climate projections, which incorporate regional climate and hydrologic modeling components. The Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) has been selected as the main regional modeling tool; the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC) will be used to generate streamflow projections for the Colorado River Basin. The WRF domain is set up to follow the CORDEX-North America guideline with 25km grid spacing, and VIC model is individually calibrated for upper and lower Colorado River basins in 1/8° resolution. The multi-scale climate and hydrology study aims to characterize how the combination of climate change and natural climate variability is changing cool and warm season precipitation. Further, to preserve the downscaled RCM sensitivity and maintain a reasonable climatology mean based on observed record, a new bias correction technique is applied when using the RCM climatology to the streamflow model. Of specific interest is how major droughts associated with La Niña-like conditions may worsen in the future, as these are the times when the Colorado River system is most critically stressed and would define the “worst case” scenario for water resource planning.",

            "abstract": "Concentric Gravity Waves (CGWs) have been intensively studied in the past few years because of its unique characteristic that shows the direct coupling between lower and upper atmosphere. However, the past studies were mostly based on a single event and gave only limited information. Therefore, a statistical study on global distribution of the CGWs is needed to get further comprehensive understanding on the generation, propagation and the dissipation of the waves. To address this issue, a space-based observation is preferable since it covers wider area. Until recently, IMAP/VISI has been the only space-based instrument that capable of imaging GWs above the troposphere in the nadir direction. We analyzed the CGWs events from IMAP/VISI data of 2013. We found total 172 CGWs events in the O2 (762 nm) airglow emissions (~95km) out of 4853 data paths. The monthly occurrence probability of the CGWs shows a clear seasonal dependence with peaks around March-April and August-September. The weak background winds in the middle atmosphere during the March and September equinox are likely responsible for the seasonal dependence. We determined the source of CGWs by estimating the center of the circular pattern. In most events, the sources (identified by meteorological satellite) were found to be convective activity (convective plum, tropical storm and typhoon). We found that the convective plum generated small-scale CGWs with the λh < 100 km. In the other hand, more intense convective activity such as typhoon generated small-scale as well as large-scale CGWs. We also found that the small-scale waves expanded from the center up to several hundred km, while the large scale expanded up to thousands of km. Generally, the concentric pattern appeared as arc like shape instead of full circle. It indicates that the background wind filter allows the wave to propagate in a particular direction and filter out the other directions. The data from March to December showed that in Japan and central Asia sector, the circular arc appeared mostly in the northeastward direction, while in Australia and south pacific sector dominated by the southeastward direction. The other sectors are still under the investigation. The detailed analysis of the background wind condition based on the GAIA model will be used to conduct further analysis in this study.",

            "abstract": "Despite scientific consensus that substantial anthropogenic climate change will occur during the 21st century and beyond, the social, economic and political will to address this global challenge remains mired in uncertainty and indecisiveness. One contributor to this situation may be that scientific findings are often couched in technical detail focusing on near-term changes and uncertainties and often lack a relatable long-term context. We argue that viewing near-term changes from a long-term perspective provides a clear demonstration that policy decisions made in the next few decades will affect the Earth’s climate, and with it our socio-economic well-being, for the next ten millennia or more. To provide a broader perspective, we present a graphical representation of Earth’s long-term climate history that clearly identifies the connection between near-term policy options and the geological scale of future climate change. This long view is based on a combination of recently developed global proxy temperature reconstructions of the last 20,000 years and model projections of surface temperature for the next 10,000 years. Our synthesis places the 20th and 21st centuries, when most emissions are likely to occur, into the context of the last twenty millennia over which time the last Ice Age ended and human civilization developed, and the next ten millennia, over which time the projected impacts will occur. This long-term perspective raises important questions about the most effective adaptation and mitigation policies. For example, although some consider it economically viable to raise seawalls and dikes in response to 21st century sea level change, such a strategy does not account for the need for continuously building much higher defenses in the 22nd century and beyond. Likewise, avoiding tipping points in the climate system in the short term does not necessarily imply that such thresholds will not still be crossed in the more distant future as slower components respond. Policies regarding conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity similarly must address contentious issues about the need for environmental triage so that societies invest resources where they are most likely to succeed when faced with an unavoidable trajectory of long-term change.",

            "abstract": "To quantify risk in New Zealand we examine the impact of updating the seismic hazard model. The previous RMS New Zealand hazard model is based on the 2002 probabilistic seismic hazard maps for New Zealand (Stirling et al., 2002). The 2015 RMS model, based on Stirling et al., (2012) will update several key source parameters. These updates include: implementation a new set of crustal faults including multi-segment ruptures, updating the subduction zone geometry and reccurrence rate and implementing new background rates and a robust methodology for modeling background earthquake sources. The number of crustal faults has increased by over 200 from the 2002 model, to the 2012 model which now includes over 500 individual fault sources. This includes the additions of many offshore faults in northern, east-central, and southwest regions. We also use the recent data to update the source geometry of the Hikurangi subduction zone (Wallace, 2009; Williams et al., 2013). We compare hazard changes in our updated model with those from the previous version. Changes between the two maps are discussed as well as the drivers for these changes. We examine the impact the hazard model changes have on New Zealand earthquake risk. Considered risk metrics include average annual loss, an annualized expected loss level used by insurers to determine the costs of earthquake insurance (and premium levels), and the loss exceedance probability curve used by insurers to address their solvency and manage their portfolio risk. We analyze risk profile changes in areas with large population density and for structures of economic and financial importance. New Zealand is interesting in that the city with the majority of the risk exposure in the country (Auckland) lies in the region of lowest hazard, where we don’t have a lot of information about the location of faults and distributed seismicity is modeled by averaged Mw-frequency relationships on area sources. Thus small changes to the background rates can have a large impact on the risk profile for the area. Wellington, another area of high exposure is particularly sensitive to how the Hikurangi subduction zone and the Wellington fault are modeled. Minor changes on these sources have substantial impacts for the risk profile of the city and the country at large.",

            "abstract": "The oceans display energetic dynamics across a wide range of spatial scales, and researchers have long worked to better understand the energy coupling between these various scales. While quantification of such scale-transfer has been previously attempted as part of this effort to understand energy pathways, assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy have presented a limitation upon the applicability of the analyses.\nHere we present a more general technique to the quantification of energy transfer between scales, unrestricted by the usual assumptions of homogeneity or isotropy, which allows one to simultaneously probe the dynamics in both space and time. The technique we apply makes use of a novel coarse-graining framework to directly analyze the coupling between scales. We apply this technique, with care to consider the spherical geometry of the problem, in order to study the energy pathways from strongly eddying simulations using LANL’s Parallel Ocean Program (POP). We examine the extent to which the traditional paradigm for such pathways is valid at various locations such as in western boundary currents, near the equator, and in the deep ocean. We investigate the contribution of various nonlinear mechanisms to the transfer of energy across scales such as baroclinic and barotropic instabilities.",

A constellation of systems operates in sync to accomplish these goals. Because of the complexity involved with operating such intricate systems, there are both high failure rates and high costs for hardware and system maintenance. Cloud computing has the potential to ameliorate cost and complexity issues. Over time, the cloud computing model has evolved and hybrid systems comprising off-site as well as on-site resources are now common.\nTowards our mission of providing the highest quality research products to the widest audience, we have explored the use of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud and Storage and present a case study of our results and efforts. This project builds upon NASA Langley Cloud and Radiation Group’s experience with operating large and complex computing infrastructures in a reliable and cost effective manner to explore novel ways to leverage cloud computing resources in the atmospheric science environment.\nOur case study presents the project requirements and then examines the fit of AWS with the LaRC computing model. We also discuss the evaluation metrics, feasibility, and outcomes and close the case study with the lessons we learned that would apply to others interested in exploring the implementation of the AWS system in their own atmospheric science computing environments.",

            "abstract": "The distribution of trace metals in the Arctic Ocean has implications for their global cycles, yet until recently few trace metal observations were available from this rapidly changing ocean. Profiles of dissolved Fe from recent Japanese field efforts in the Western Canada Basin (2008, 2010) indicate the broad Chukchi Shelf as a source of Fe to the halocline of the Western Canada Basin. Here we present dissolved and particulate data for crustal (Al, Mn, Fe) and non-crustal elements (Co, Cu, Zn) from the productive Chukchi Sea to characterize the sedimentary input of these metals to shelf waters contributing to the halocline layer of the Canada Basin. Water column profiles were collected in late summer 2013 onboard the R/V Mirai at 10 stations from the Bering Strait to the slope, and at a time-series (10 days) station located over the outer shelf. A narrow and variable (5-10 m) benthic boundary layer was sampled at the time-series station with highly elevated dissolved and suspended particulate metal concentrations. High metal concentrations were also observed in the subsurface at a station over Barrow Canyon where mixing is enhanced. Reactivity of suspended particulate metals was determined by the leachable vs. refractory fractions. Metal concentrations were determined by ICP-MS. Trace metal transport from the shelf to the interior will be discussed in context with shelf mechanisms contributing to this export, and to expected future changes in the Arctic Ocean.",

            "abstract": "Impact cratering is a fundamental geological process throughout the Solar System. The Moon is an ideal location to document the impact cratering process due to the number and excellent state of preservation of large craters and basins, and the wide range of geological, geophysical, topographic, mineralogic, remote sensing and returned sample data. Despite the number and excellent preservation state of many large complex craters and basins, their formation and the origin of their structural features and the stages in their evolution remain contentious. To more comprehensively document the final stage of lunar impact basin formation, we have compiled detailed topographic, geological and mineralogic maps of several type examples of peak-ring and multi-ring basins, including the Orientale basin. These data include the mineralogic characteristics of basin ring structures and assist in the interpretation of the target stratigraphy, and the depth of origin of basin rings. Data for the current structure of basins is compared to numerical model outputs of basin-forming impacts, which track formation to the conclusion of dynamic processes (2 to 3 hours after impact). We use the Orientale basin as an example and provide combined correlations and interpretations that assign rings to various stages in the numerical models, and compare these candidates to crustal stratigraphy, with the ultimate aim of producing a consistent model for large crater/basin formation. The shock physics code iSALE is used to numerically model the basin-scale impacts. Constitutive equations and equations of state for materials analogous to the lunar crust (gabbroic anorthosite) and mantle (dunite) are used. Aspects of the numerically-produced lunar basins (e.g., material distribution and accumulated stress) are compared and contrasted to remote observations and geological maps of the Orientale rings and geological units, including ejecta and impact melt deposits.",

            "abstract": "Cholera is a global disease, with significantly large outbreaks occurring since the 1990s, notably in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and recently in Haiti, in the Caribbean. Critical knowledge gaps remain in the understanding of the annual recurrence in endemic areas and the nature of epidemic outbreaks, especially those that follow extreme hydroclimatic events. Teleconnections with large-scale climate phenomena affecting regional scale hydroclimatic drivers of cholera dynamics remain largely unexplained. For centuries, the Bengal delta region has been strongly influenced by the asymmetric availability of water in the rivers Ganges and the Brahmaputra. As these two major rivers are known to have strong contrasting affects on local cholera dynamics in the region, we argue that the role of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), or other phenomena needs to be interpreted in the context of the seasonal role of individual rivers and subsequent impact on local environmental processes, not as a teleconnection having a remote and unified effect.\nWe present a modified hypothesis that the influences of large-scale climate phenomena such as ENSO and IOD on Bengal cholera can be explicitly identified and incorporated through regional scale hydroclimatic drivers. Here, we provide an analytical review of the literature addressing cholera and climate linkages and present hypotheses, based on recent evidence, and quantification on the role of regional scale hydroclimatic drivers of cholera. We argue that the seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature, and resulting river discharge in the GBM basin region during ENSO and IOD events have a dominant combined effect on the endemic persistence and the epidemic vulnerability to cholera outbreaks in spring and fall seasons, respectively, that is stronger than the effect of localized hydrological and socio-economic sensitivities in Bangladesh. In addition, systematic identification of underlying seasonal hydroclimatic drivers will allow us to harness the inherent system memory of these processes to develop early warning systems and strengthen prevention measures.",

Interpretation of site BC retention is important for assessing feedbacks to ecosystem processes including nutrient and water cycling. However, interaction between vegetation disturbance, BC formation, and off site transport may exist that complicate interpretation of BC addition to soils from wildfire or prescribed burns directly. To investigate the relationship between disturbance and site retention on soil BC, we determined BC concentrations for a woodland in central Texas, USA, from study plots in hilly terrain with a fire scar dendrochronology spanning 100 years. BC values were determined from 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Estimated values showed mean BC concentration of 2.73 ± 3.06 g BC kg-1 (0.91 ± 0.51 kg BC m-2) for sites with fire occurrence within the last 40 years compared with BC values of1.21 ± 1.70 g BC kg-1 soil (0.18 ± 0.14 kg BC m-2) for sites with fire 40 – 100 years ago. Sites with no tree ring evidence of fire during the last 100 years had the lowest mean soil BC concentration of 0.05 ± 0.11 g BC kg-1 (0.02 ± 0.03 kg BC m-2). Molecular proxies of stability (lignin/N) and decomposition (Alkyl C/O-Alky C) showed no differences across the sites, indicating that low potential for BC mineralization. Modeled soil erosion and time since fire from fire scar data showed that soil BC concentrations were inversely correlated. A modified the ecosystem process model, Biome-BGC, was also used simulate the effects of fire disturbance with different severities and seasonality on C cycling related to the BC production, effect on soil water availability, and off-site transport. Results showed that BC impacts on ecosystem processes, including net ecosystem exchange and leaf area development, were predominantly related to fire frequency. Site BC loss rates were affected by initial slope-affected erosion, fire severity, vegetation type, and rate of vegetation recovery. The simulation results showed that fire types, such as high severity, was generally associated with low site BC retention related to low vertical transfer of BC into soils, buoyancy of BC particles, and surface runoff from unvegetated soils.",

Often distributed within a matrix of sandy pine flatwoods and hammocks, these wetlands have a seasonally variable water table, alternating between inundation and complete drydown. Though these landforms are typically small individually, they comprise a substantial component of the landscape and provide vital habitat for an array of flora and fauna. Given their fluctuating hydrology, conditions for soil and plant carbon (C) exchange mechanisms can vary greatly both spatially and temporally. In this study, we are developing a C budget for depressional marsh landforms by assessing ecosystem carbon exchange along an ecotone gradient and quantifying belowground C stocks using non-invasive geophysical methods (ground penetrating radar, GPR) at the Disney Wilderness Preserve (DWP) in Kissimmee, FL, USA. Using a series of closed chambers transecting the marsh from the center outward into the surrounding flatwoods, we are quantifying the effects of seasonal water table change on the magnitude of C exchange. Three dimensional GPR surveys were used to quantify peat layer thickness, and were constrained with direct core sampling to verify subsurface lithology and to assess peat C content. Using the relationship between landform surface area and belowground C volume, we assessed the cumulative C storage in depressional marshes across the DWP landscape. In conjunction with a nearby eddy covariance tower and seasonal hydrologic data, these response functions will help to evaluate the contribution of these small but widespread landscape features on regional C cycling.",

However, these airborne flights require a twin-engine aircraft and a detector with a computer that weighs 250 kg, which is unsuitable for use with unmanned airborne systems (UAS), our primary interest. Here we describe results of tests of a compact gamma detector weighing 2 kg. The envisioned deployment of this detector is on a small quad-copter UAS that can hover low over remote clearings in the boreal forest of interior Alaska. Such a technique may allow SWE estimates in places that otherwise would be difficult to measure. We tested the detector over snow and water bodies and found for SWE between 0 and 50 cm a sensitivity of ± 2 cm SWE, which is sufficient to resolve any significant snowfall in the region. In this presentation we will discuss our preliminary results and our future strategy for deploying the sensor on a UAS.",

            "abstract": "Sustainable biofuel feedstock production — environmental sustainability and economic sustainability — may be achieved by using a multi-faceted approach. This study focuses on quantifying the water sustainability of an integrated landscaping strategy, by which current land use and land management, cropping system, agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs), and economics play equal roles. The strategy was applied to the South Fork watershed, IA, including the tributaries of Tipton and Beaver Creeks, which expand to 800-km2 drainage areas. The watershed is an agricultural dominant area covered with row-crops production. On the basis of profitability, switchgrass was chosen as a replacement for row crops in low-productivity land. Areas for harvesting agricultural residue were selected on the basis of soil conservation principals. Double cropping with a cover crop was established to further reduce soil loss. Vegetation buffer strips were in place at fields and in riparian areas for water quality control, resource conservation, and eco service improvement. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to evaluate source reduction under various management schemes and land use changes. SWAT modeling incorporated 10-yr meteorological information, soil data, land slope classification, land use, four-year crop-rotation cycle, and management operations. Tile drain and pothole parameters were modeled to assess the fate and transport of nutrients. The influence of landscape management and cropping systems on nitrogen and phosphorus loadings, erosion process, and hydrological performance at the sub-watershed scale was analyzed and key factors identified. Results suggest strongly that incorporating agricultural BMPs and conservation strategies into integrated landscape management for certain energy crops in row-crop production regions can be economical and environmentally sustainable.",

The SAGE 2014 data collection was part of an integrated geophysical study of the area initiated in 2010 and adds data and interpretations to a W to E transect of the RGR.  The transect includes previous SAGE seismic refraction and CMP reflection profiles recorded in 2010 and 2011, some industry seismic reflection data, and detailed gravity observations. Seismic data consisted of a 4.8 km NW to SE profile (120 three-component stations in four overlapping deployments, 20 m station spacing, using a Vibroseis source – 20 m spacing for reflection VPs; 800 m spacing for refraction VPs) along the Borrego Canyon road with both refraction and CMP reflection coverage. About 50,000 seismograms were recorded. The surface conditions (dry unconsolidated sediments) increased surface wave energy and limited the signal-to-noise level of reflection arrivals although some wide-angle reflections with two-way times as great as 1.8 s were visible. The refraction data were modeled with first arrival travel time methods and mainly helped identify the velocity and minimum thickness of the Tertiary Santa Fe group sedimentary rocks in the Santo Domingo Basin. Interpretation of the seismic and gravity data along the transect was aided by refraction velocities, the existence of a nearby regional seismic reflection profile from industry, and lithologies and well-logs from a deep well. Gravity modeling, with significant control on depths of interfaces and densities from the seismic and drill hole data, indicates that the Santo Domingo sedimentary basin has a total depth of about 6 km.

            "abstract": "Stormwater management is an important aspect of highway operation, as the quantity and quality of stormwater generated from road surface can have important legal, economical, and environmental safety concerns. Vegetated filter strips (VFS) are best management practices (BMPs) that are designed to infiltrate and treat sheet-flowed runoff along roads and highways. The effectiveness of the VFS depends on factors like width, slope, vegetation type, flow rate, and soil texture. Despite the broad use of VFS, there is no standard design criteria for roadside infiltration strips in wet climate, such as found in Western Oregon. The objective of this study is to monitor and collect highway runoff generated from road surface within Western Oregon. The data will be used to develop design equations and protocols for sizing and implementing roadside infiltration strips under wet climates.\nA monitoring network was established in Oregon from the west slope of the Coast Range to the west slope of Cascades which encompassed Willamette valley. Five monitoring sites were built on highway 18, 20, 22, 34, and Interstate highway 5 to collect surface runoff, soil moisture, and precipitation data. Ten feet by ten feet and ten feet by twenty feet plots were used along the roadside to harvest runoff water. A novel \"Groovy Bucket\" design together with a digital data logger were employed to monitor runoff flow rate. Physical properties of the soils on highway embankment were also investigated. The results showed that soil texture varies from loamy sand to silty clay among different locations. After the first monitoring period from October 2013 to April 2014, the data showed that VFS worked effectively as the buffer zone to store runoff water in the soils, however, a minimum width of 10 feet can not capture runoff generated by intensive rainfalls. Relationship between soil saturation and runoff flow rate revealed that wet antecedent soil conditions generated more runoff compared to dry antecedent soil conditions. Infiltration tests indicated that soil infiltrability of the filter strips decreased dramatically after receiving the winter precipitation (rainfall and snowfall), which reduces the ability of the filter strips for retaining runoff for the forthcoming storm events.",

            "abstract": "Current generations of global climate models continue to struggle with simulating many of the observed features of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and suffer from low skill regarding initiation forecasts. While recent work has focused on those mechanisms thought to be important for MJO initiation, fewer studies have examined the large-scale conditions associated with quiescent periods of the MJO and the decay of existing events. Understanding these mechanisms may provide a valuable context toward improving simulations of MJO initiation and propagation in climate and operational weather forecast models.\nThis study presents an analysis of the precursor environmental conditions related to the termination of MJO events. A simple climatology is created using a real-time MJO monitoring index, documenting the locations and frequencies of MJO decay. Lead-lag composites of several atmospheric variables including temperature, moisture, and intraseasonal wind anomalies are generated from three reanalyses. Long-term, lower tropospheric moisture deficits over the local domain best identify terminating events over the Indian Ocean, with a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and corresponding lead times as much as 20 days prior to MJO decay.\nStatistically significant differences are also identified more than 10 days in advance of MJO termination events in the west Pacific, though the vertical velocity and moisture anomalies are more symmetric about the equator. We also present results for those MJOs that terminate over the maritime continent. Unlike the Indian Ocean and west Pacific, the likelihood of an MJO to cross the maritime continent appears related to its own intensity, rather than the upstream environmental conditions, with only the strongest MJOs propagating into the warm pool region.\nFinally, a budget analysis is performed on the three-dimensional moisture advection equation in order to better elucidate what time-scales and physical mechanisms are most important for MJO termination. The combination of intraseasonal vertical circulation anomalies coupled with the mean state specific humidity best explain the anomalous moisture patterns associated with MJO termination, suggesting that the upstream influence of the MJO circulation can eventually lead to its own demise.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forests constitute a globally important carbon sink but it is unclear how their productivity and carbon storage depend upon nutrients. There is increasing evidence of an ecosystem carbon-nitrogen feedback mechanism, by which symbiotic dinitrogen (N2) fixing trees can provide the nitrogen needed to maintain high rates of forest biomass growth following disturbance. Field-based evaluation of this feedback is difficult, however, as the expected effects on forest carbon stores would emerge very slowly, over decades to centuries of ecological succession. Moreover, there is no known way to inhibit the fixation process in trees without causing structural damage and perturbing the carbon cycle. Coupled land biogeochemistry-vegetation models offer a way to examine the role of feedbacks that unfold over successional time. However, it is unclear how the process of nitrogen fixation ought to be represented in models so that they can capture the potential effect of fixation on the long-term forest carbon sink. In this study, we integrate a newly developed individual-based model with field observations across Panamanian tropical forests to address: 1) whether N2 fixation enhances tropical forest carbon storage; 2) whether models must resolve fixation at the individual plant level to capture the fixation feedback; and 3) whether fixation interacts with plant functional types (i.e., early, mid, vs. late succession) to determine the carbon sink? We find that forests that have fixation recover faster and store more carbon in the long term than forests without fixation. This results in 94-118% more plant carbon stored by 30 years and an additional 13 tons C ha -1 stored over 300 years when compared to forests without fixation. Additionally, resolving fixation at the individual plant level is necessary to capture nitrogen dynamics over time and is particularly important for modeling succession and disturbance events. Finally, we find that the overall fixation effect is the result of two processes, the direct effect of the fixation on carbon accumulation and the indirect effect of fixation on the successional plant functional type sequence.",

            "abstract": "The geologic reservoirs that could be used for long-term sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) may have natural or manmade pathways that allow injected CO2, or the brine it displaces, to leak into overlying formations. Using a basin-scale leakage estimation model, we investigated the geophysical parameters that govern this leakage, and the resulting accumulations of leaked fluids in overlying formations. The results are discussed in the context of two polices aimed at governing long-term sequestration and protecting groundwater: the U.S. DOE guideline for storage permanence and the U.S. EPA UIC Program Class VI Rule. For a case study of CO2 injection into the Mt. Simon sandstone in the Michigan sedimentary basin, we showed that (1) the U.S. DOE guideline would allow for more leakage from larger injection projects than for smaller ones; (2) leakage amounts are determined mostly by well leakage permeability rather than by variation in formation permeabilities; (3) numerous leaking wells with anomalously high leakage permeabilities are necessary in order to achieve substantial leakage rates; (4) leakage can reach potable groundwater but intervening stratigraphic traps reduce the amount to be multiple orders of magnitude less than the leakage out of the reservoir, and (5) this leakage can reduce the Area of Review that is defined by the U.S. EPA as the area within which leakage can threaten groundwater. In summary, leakage that exceeds the U.S. DOE storage permanence goal would occur only under extreme conditions, the amount that reaches shallow potable groundwater may be inconsequential from a pollution standpoint, and leakage may be beneficial. Future federal policies should be harmonized to achieve the dual goals of protecting groundwater while allowing for adaptive management that incorporates uncertainties and imperfections inherent in geologic reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "While the density of seawater is basically determined by its temperature, salinity and pressure, the effective density becomes higher when the water mass contains suspended sediment. On the other hands, effective density declines when water mass contains fine scale materials of lower density such as bubbles and ice crystals. Such density anomaly induced by small scale materials suspended in water masses sometimes plays important roles in the sub-mesoscale ocean physics. To simulate these small scale oceanic multiphase flow, a new modeling framework using an online Lagrangian particle tracking method is developed. A Lagrangian particle tracking method has substantial advantages such as an explicit treatment of buoyancy force acting on each individual particle, no numerical diffusion and dissipation, high dynamic range and an ability to track the history and each individual particle. However, its numerical cost causes difficulty when we try to simulate a large number of particles. In the present study we implement a numerically efficient particle tracking scheme using linked-list data structure, which is coupled with a nonhydrostatic dynamical core. This newly developed model successfully reproduces characteristics of some interesting small scale multiphase processes, for example hyperpycnal flow (a sediment-rich river water plume trapped at ocean floor) and grease ice cover (a slurry mixture of frazil ice crystals and seawater).",

This project will design and construct a first-of-its-kind, near-zero emissions coal-fueled power plant that incorporates CCS. The project will implement a suite of monitoring technologies that includes early-leak-detection monitoring directly above the primary confining zone in regions of increased leakage potential (e.g., near wells that penetrate the caprock). In support of early leak-detection monitoring systems design, numerical models were developed and used to evaluate the relative value of various leak detection metrics over a range of hypothetical leakage scenarios. This preliminary modeling evaluation was based on a simplified model that assumed uniform properties for each model layer and interrogated both pressure and geochemical response in the first permeable interval overlying the primary confining zone. Simulation results indicate that pressure is likely to be the earliest indicator of leakage, given the rapid and areally extensive nature of this response. Simulated geochemical signals are much more localized and take much longer to develop than the pressure responses. Because of the buoyancy effect associated with supercritical CO2 (scCO2), early leak-detection monitoring for these leakage scenarios would be best achieved through monitoring in the upper portion of the interval near the contact with overlying low-permeability materials. Conversely, monitoring for geochemical signals associated with brine leakage exhibited less lateral spread than for scCO2 cases and detection of leakage would be best achieved through monitoring at the base of the interval. Results from these preliminary models for a suite of leakage scenarios and monitoring location distances will be presented. These preliminary models will be updated as new site characterization data become available.",

            "abstract": "The POR schist is thought to comprise much of the lower crust of southern California, and is one of the archetypes for understanding shallow slab subduction and subduction erosion. Porter et al. (2011) attributed anisotropy in the lower crust of southern California to the POR schist, and interpreted the orientation of anisotropy beneath the Mojave block to result from fossil fabric related to initiation of the San Andreas Fault. Most seismic methods for analyzing anisotropy employ the assumption of transverse isotropic (TI) symmetry, where velocities are symmetric about 1 unique axis. The effects of this simplification have not been critically evaluated using measurements of the full symmetry of rock samples. We measured mineral crystal preferred orientations (CPO), and calculated elastic tensors for samples of lower crustal rocks of the Mojave block, including POR schist and plutonic rocks. This method captures the full elastic tensor with no enforced symmetry, and thus allows evaluation of simplified symmetry assumptions.\nVelocity anisotropy in individual samples of the POR schist ranges from ~2–12% in VP and ~3–15% in VS, which is consistent with results of Porter et al. (2011). When all schist samples are averaged together to approximate the bulk schist, the anisotropy is significantly reduced to ~6% in VP and ~8% in VS, which is lower than the average values inferred by Porter et al. (2011). Felsic schist samples are fairly well approximated by TI symmetry, whereas mafic schist, and mylonitic samples have a strong orthorhombic component. Felsic plutonic rocks have low anisotropy, and complicated low-order symmetry, while plutonic rocks with significant hornblende content have orthorhombic symmetry. The symmetry of the average lower crust beneath the Mojave block is not likely to be purely TI, and this contributes to differences between seismic interpretations of anisotropy and the intrinsic elasticity inferred from laboratory measurements.",

            "abstract": "We assessed the potential of water-soluble fraction of atmospheric fine aerosols in the southeastern US to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS-generation potential of particles was quantified by the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay and involved analysis of fine particulate matter (PM) extracted from high-volume quartz filters (23 h integrated daily samples) collected for one year at various sites in different environmental settings in the southeast, including three urban Atlanta sites, and one rural site in Yorkville. Water-soluble PM extracts were further separated into the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions using a C-18 column, and both fractions were analyzed for the DTT activity. Organic aerosol (OA) composition was measured at selected sites using a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrophotometer (HR-ToF-AMS). The various factors of the organic aerosols, i.e. Isoprene OA (Isop-OA), hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), less-oxidized oxygenated OA, (LO-OOA), more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA), cooking OA (COA), and biomass burning OA (BBOA) were also resolved, and their ability to generate ROS investigated by linear regression techniques.\nAmong all OA factors, BBOA was most consistently associated with ROS, with the highest intrinsic DTT activity of 151±20 pmol/min/μg. The water-soluble bioavailable fraction of BBOA-DTT activity is 2-3 times higher than the reported total-DTT activity of diesel exhaust particles. The total contribution of various aerosol sources to the ROS generating potential was also determined by the positive matrix factorization approach. Interestingly, biomass burning appears as the strongest source of ROS generation, with its annual contribution of 35 % to DTT activity; the contribution was higher in winter (47 %), than summer (24 %) and fall (17 %) seasons. The good agreement between the hydrophobic DTT activity with that estimated from the summed OA components, indicates that humic-like substances (HULIS), which are abundantly emitted in biomass burning is the most important class of organic compounds associated with ROS-generation. Collectively, these results imply that biomass burning emissions is a potentially serious health hazard, as they tend to be widespread, unregulated and likely to rise in future.",

            "abstract": "The frequency and intensity of extreme climate events such as drought is expected to increase with climate change, particularly in the Amazon. Reduced dry season precipitation can affect forest growth, while long-term drought can increase tree mortality. Understanding the effects of changing precipitation patterns on tree growth is essential for anticipating the effects of climate change on tropical forests. To address this question we investigate the effect of precipitation variability on tropical forest tree growth using tree data from annually censused 1-ha monitoring plots from the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network, and 5-day precipitation data from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). Significant regional patterns of precipitation variability are apparent across the monitoring sites in the TEAM network, particularly the strong Amazon drought in 2010.\nUsing CHIRPS data, we calculate the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and model the effects of varying SPI on tree growth, while controlling for potential differences in growth between different stem diameter and wood density classes. We find that annual growth increases with declining wood density (p < .01), increasing diameter (p < .01), and increasing SPI (p < .01). We also find statistically significant interaction effects (p < .01) between SPI and wood density: the relationship between SPI and growth is strongest for lower wood densities. This suggests that trees with lower wood density are more sensitive to drought. Interaction effects between diameter class and SPI are not significant. Given the greater sensitivity of fast growing low-density trees to drought, reduced growth of these trees is likely to affect carbon uptake during drought periods disproportionately.",

However, processing waveform lidar data raises some challenges compared to analyzing discrete return data. The overall goal of this study was to present a robust de-convolution algorithm- Gold algorithm used to de-convolve waveforms in a lidar dataset acquired within a 60 x 60m study area located in the Harvard Forest in Massachusetts. The waveform lidar data was collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). Specific objectives were to: (1) explore advantages and limitations of various waveform processing techniques to derive topography and canopy height information; (2) develop and implement a novel de-convolution algorithm, the Gold algorithm, to extract elevation and canopy metrics; and (3) compare results and assess accuracy. We modeled lidar waveforms with a mixture of Gaussian functions using the Non-least squares (NLS) algorithm implemented in R and derived a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and canopy height. We compared our waveform-derived topography and canopy height measurements using the Gold de-convolution algorithm to results using the Richardson-Lucy algorithm. Our findings show that the Gold algorithm performed better than the Richardson-Lucy algorithm in terms of recovering the hidden echoes and detecting false echoes for generating a DTM, which indicates that the Gold algorithm could potentially be applied to processing of waveform lidar data to derive information on terrain elevation and canopy characteristics.",

New results from stations in Ghana, Nigeria, Mozambique, Botswana, Angola, Namibia and South Africa are presented in this study that when combined with previously published measurements help to map the pattern of seismic anisotropy over much of the African continent. A general pattern of fast polarization directions, characterized by NE orientations, is found, and superimposed on this subcontinental-scale pattern is local and regional variability, most notably around the Archean Tanzania craton in eastern Africa. The subcontinental-scale pattern, as well as local and regional variations in this pattern, are interpreted in terms of large-scale mantle flow from the African Superplume, fossil anisotropy in the lithosphere, and shape anisotropy in magmatic regions of the East African rift system.",

            "abstract": "Positive trends in surface water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations have been observed in recent decades across many, but not all, surface water monitoring sites in eastern North America and northern Europe. The drivers of these trends are not necessarily clear, although declining acidic deposition is often cited as a likely cause for increased DOC mobilization. Here we used long-term records (16-31 years) of monthly streamwater and soil solution chemistry data from two headwater catchments at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (NH, USA) to evaluate DOC trends in response to the recovery from acidification. We compared the concentrations and trends of DOC in Hubbard Brook’s Watershed 6 (W6) and Watershed 1 (W1). W6 is the biogeochemical reference watershed and W1 underwent a treatment with calcium silicate in 1999 to mitigate the effects of long-term acid deposition. Streamwater DOC in W6 initially decreased through the 1980s and 1990s, but has leveled over the past 10-15 years, coincident with a period of modest pH increase. In contrast, W1 streamwater DOC concentrations have significantly increased since the calcium treatment which has led to more marked increases in pH. Greater mobilization of DOC in soil solution in W1 appears to be driving the higher streamwater DOC concentrations. We are analyzing these trends spatially within the watersheds and in conjunction with major solute chemistry to further explain the observed changes in DOC.",

The model is an aquaplanet model, and includes a slab ocean with a mixed layer. Changing the transmissivity of the atmosphere through altering the longwave absorber optical thickness made it possible to study how moisture transport and monsoon circulation change as climate conditions change. The depth of the slab ocean mixed layer was also changed to further compare the development of Hadley circulation in different climate regimes. The goal of this research was to examine how monsoon centers, extents, and timing vary under a wide range of climates. Evidence of changing monsoon conditions can be seen in the significant shifts of the stream function, which in turn causes changes in temperature, precipitation, and meridional winds. The understanding of changes to monsoons during climate change could make it possible to analyze the response of the hydrological cycle in a variety of climate extremes such as Snowball Earth and Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum periods.",

There are many approaches to choosing a regularization parameter, but it is still an open question as to how to weight the additional information. The discrepancy principle considers the residual norm to determine the regularization parameter or weight while a similar approach, the chi-squared method, uses the regularized residual in a statistical test to find the weight. Using the regularized residual has the benefit of giving a clear chi-squared test with a fixed noise level. Recently, this approach has been developed for nonlinear problems. We will give the appropriate chi-squared tests in the Gauss-Newton and Levenburg Marquart algorithms, and these tests are used to find a regularization parameter or weight on initial parameter estimate errors. This algorithm is applied to two benchmark problems in nonlinear geophysics: two-dimensional cross-well tomography, and one dimensional subsurface conductivity estimation.",

The recent announcement of the instrument package for the proposed NASA Mars2020 rover mission, including micro x-ray fluorescence (PIXL) for elemental mapping as well as scanning ultraviolet laser fluorescence and Raman (SHERLOC) suggests a shift in emphasis of Mars surface science towards spatially resolved geochemical analysis that will support the selection and acquisition of samples for coring, caching, and possible return to Earth for further analysis. During a recent field expedition to investigate Archean and Proterozoic biosignatures in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, we deployed a dry, rotary percussive coring drill with a bit assembly analogous to that being considered for Mars2020. Six targets of varying age and lithology were sampled with the coring drill, and surrounding and adjacent rock samples were collected simultaneously. These samples were subsequently prepared and subsampled for bulk and in situ, spatially resolved analysis using conventional laboratory methods as well as the existing PIXL and SHERLOC platforms currently in development. Here we present new approaches and data from this integrated and ongoing program of “sample return science” designed to simulate, and eventually reduce risk associated with a long-term effort towards Mars sample return.\n[1] Grotzinger, J.P. et al. 2014.

Canadian response to potential oil spills along its coast is being improved under a high-level federal government strategy, falling under the rubric of the World Class Tanker Safety System (WCTSS). The first component of this strategy focuses on the Kitimat area and its marine approaches on the northern British Columbia (BC) coast. This initiative reflects concerns around both existing ship traffic, and potential increases in tanker traffic associated with the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline. The project includes joint development, between multiple federal departments, of an operational modeling system to predict currents in the coastal ocean. One of Environment Canada’s (EC) contributions is the development and implementation of a short-term forecast model of river flows with corresponding stream temperatures. These quantities influence currents in the coastal ocean, which in turn affect oil spill fate and transport.\nOur platform is based on the Surface Prediction System (SPS), which is essentially a driver for a land surface scheme (LSS) linked to a hydrological routing model, and is related to the earlier MESH platform. LSS’s under consideration for use in this mountain rainforest environment are the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS), and the Soil and Vegetation Simulator (SVS), which is an evolution of the Interactions Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere (ISBA) model. Runoff and drainage outputs are then routed through the stream network by WATROUTE. The River Basin Model (RBM), a physically-based stream temperature simulator, is also being integrated into SPS to additionally enable water temperature forecasting. The freshwater modelling system will be directly driven by EC’s numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems.\nPreliminary results from this ambitious modeling program are presented, along with recommendations for improvements to physical process representation in the various models employed.",

The summer cohort participates in weekly research and professional development seminars along with group field exercises. Topics include graduate school, career preparation, research ethics, sustainability, global change, environmental justice, and research communication. These activities plus the student’s individual research comprise a portfolio that culminates in a reflection essay integrating the concepts, methods, and perspectives gained over the 10-week program. Program alumni were surveyed in 2014 to gauge long-term impact and outcomes. Of the 76 surveyed from 2006-2013, 39% responded. 67% have earned or are working on a graduate degree, and 94% of the graduate programs are in STEM. 93% of the responding alumni felt that the program “influenced my job and educational choices” and 97% felt that the program “helped me better understand scientific research.” 40% presented their findings at a conference and 17% authored or co-authored a peer-reviewed publication.

            "abstract": "There is a recognition from academics and stakeholders that climate science has a fundamental role to play in the decision making process, but too frequently there is still uncertainty about what, when, how and why to use it. Stakeholders suggest that it is because the science is presented in an inaccessible manner, while academics suggest it is because the stakeholders do not have the scientific knowledge to understand and apply the science appropriately. What is apparent is that stakeholders need support, and that there is an onus on academia to provide it.\nThis support is even more important with recent developments in climate science, such as extreme weather event attribution. We are already seeing the impacts of extreme weather events around the world causing lost of life and damage to property and infrastructure with current research suggesting that these events could become more frequent and more intense. If this is to be the case then a better understanding of the science will be vital in developing robust adaptation and business planning.\nThe use of games, role playing and simulations to aid learning has long been understood in education but less so as a tool to support stakeholder understanding of climate science. Providing a ‘safe’ space where participants can actively engage with concepts, ideas and often emotions, can lead to deep understanding that is not possible through more passive mechanisms such as papers and web sites.\n\nThis paper reports on a game that was developed through a collaboration led by the Red Cross/Red Crescent, University of Oxford and University of Reading to help stakeholders understand the role of weather event attribution in the decision making process. The game has already been played successfully at a number of high profile events including COP 19 and the African Climate Conference. It has also been used with students as part of a postgraduate environmental management course. As well as describing the design principles of the game, the paper also evaluates the success of the game as well as future developments.",

            "abstract": "Manizales is a city located in west-central Colombian Andes in the Caldas province, whose spatial location coincides with one of the most threatened areas of Colombia (landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, other).\nAs a middle Andean mountainous city and for being located in the area of influence of the ITCZ presents an equatorial mountain climate with a bimodal rainfall regime, and with an average annual rainfall around 2000 mm, it shows very significant rates of precipitation, on average, 70% of the days of the year it is rainy. This situation favors the formation of large masses of clouds and the presence of macroclimatic phenomena such as ENSO, which has historically caused large-scale impacts in both warm and cold phase.\nSince last decade different entities have implemented a hydro-meteorological network which measures and transmits telemetrically every five minutes hydro-climatic variables. In general, the real-time weather monitoring should be used for a better understanding of our environmental urban environment and to establish indicators of quality of life and welfare for the community.\nDespite the city has telemetric data on atmospheric and hydrological variables, there is still no tool or a methodology able to generate a spatio-temporal description of these variables. So, the aim of this work is to establish guidelines to sort all this information of atmospheric variables monitored in real time with the help of data mining techniques, machine learning tools to improve the knowledge of atmospheric patterns at Manizales and to serve for territorial planning and decision makers.\nTo reach this purpose the current data warehouse available at the National University of Colombia at Manizales will be used, and it will be fed with observed variables from hydro-meteorological monitoring stations that transmit in real-time. Then, as mentioned this information will make the corresponding processing with data mining techniques to describe the rainfall patterns. All this complemented with the application of statistical techniques for data analysis and exploration.\nThe main contribution of this research is the creation of tools to be used in numerical modeling with forecasting purposes, aiming to improve the resolution given by mesoscale models, which are currently used for weather forecast in Colombia.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the present-day impacts of aircraft emissions on surface air quality is essential to plan potential mitigation policies for future growth. Stringent regulation on mobile source-related emissions in the recent past coupled with anticipated rise in the growth in aviation activity can increase the relative impacts of aviation-attributable surface air quality if adequate measures for reducing aviation emissions are not implemented. Though aircraft emissions during in-flight mode (at upper altitudes) contribute a significant (70 - 80%) proportion of the total aviation emissions, landing and takeoff (LTO) related emissions can have immediate impact on surface air quality, as most of the large airports are located in urban areas, specifically those that are designated in nonattainment for O3 and/or PM2.5. In this study, we modeled impacts of aircraft emissions during LTO cycles on surface air quality using the latest version of the CMAQ model for two contemporary years (2005, 2010) and one future year (2018). For this regional scale modeling study, we used highly resolved aircraft emissions from the FAA’s Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT), meteorology from NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) downscaled with the WRF model, dynamically varying chemical boundary conditions from the CAM-Chem global model (which also used the same AEDT emissions but at the global scale), and spatio-temporally resolved lightning NOx emissions estimated using National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) flash density data. We evaluated our model results with air quality observations from surface-based networks and in-situ aircraft observation data for the contemporary years. We will present results from model evaluation using this enhanced modeling system, as well as the trajectories in aviation- related air quality (focusing on O3, NO2 and PM2.5) for the three modeling years considered in this study. These findings will help plan potential strategies to be considered for overall reduction in aviation-related air quality and health impacts on U.S. wide basis in future years. ",

            "abstract": "The majority of the population in southwest Virginia depends economically on coal mining. In 2011, coal mining generated $2,000,000 in tax revenue to Wise County alone. However, surface mining completely removes land cover and leaves the land exposed to erosion. The destruction of the forest cover directly impacts local species, as some are displaced and others perish in the mining process. Even though surface mining has a negative impact on the environment, land reclamation efforts are in place to either restore mined areas to their natural vegetated state or to transform these areas for economic purposes. This project aimed to monitor the progress of land reclamation and the effect on the return of local species. By incorporating NASA Earth observations, such as Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), re-vegetation process in reclamation sites was estimated through a Time series analysis using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). A continuous source of cloud free images was accomplished by utilizing the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STAR-FM). This model developed synthetic Landsat imagery by integrating the high-frequency temporal information from Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and high-resolution spatial information from Landsat sensors  In addition, the Maximum Entropy Modeling (MaxENT), an eco-niche model was used to estimate the adaptation of animal species to the newly formed habitats. By combining factors such as land type, precipitation from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and slope from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), the MaxENT model produced a statistical analysis on the probability of species habitat. Altogether, the project compiled the ecological information which can be used to identify suitable habitats for local species in reclaimed mined areas.",

            "abstract": "Efforts to understand the dynamics of the Earth's core are hampered by the intrinsic numerical stiffness of the governing equations. It is thought, however, that motions in the core are balanced in the sense that fluid acceleration is subdominant in comparison to the other forces present (Coriolis, pressure, Lorentz, etc.). By exploiting the idea of balanced motions, Busse (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 173, 1986, p. 545) developed a simplified analogue of the Earth's core by restricting the flow to lie within a radially narrow, axially-aligned cylindrical annulus, though the model is limited to motions that are invariant in the direction of the rotation axis and thus outer boundaries that are of small slope. Calkins, Julien and Marti (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 732, 2013, p. 214) extended the two-dimensional annulus model of Busse to three dimensions such that the more physically realistic case of steeply sloping endwalls can be studied. Numerical simulations of this new model show that it can reproduce phenomena that are thought to be present in the Earth's core and other natural systems, such as large-scale vortices and strong zonal jets. We find that the predominantly axially-aligned convective cells that form when the thermal forcing is weak quickly break down into strongly three-dimensional flows as the forcing is increased; the resulting Reynolds stresses lead to axially-aligned mean flows that dominate the kinetic energy spectrum (see figure). Furthermore, this new model has the advantage that it employs physically realistic parameters that are not currently accessible to simulations of the full governing equations.",

These studies suggest the technique provides total column water vapor with high accuracy and with a high degree of stability over time making it very useful for many research applications over a variety of time scales.\nThe Experiment has two principal scientific aims:\n(1) to address basic science questions regarding the role of water vapor fluxes in the SMO in initiating deep convection and growth into MCSs by utilizing a novel measurement technique.\n(2) to improve NAM operational forecasts through PWV data assimilation\nBroader impacts of the experiment also include strengthening the international long-term collaborative efforts between Mexico and the US focusing on the climate and meteorology of Northwest Mexico and the Southwest US.\n10 GPS meteorological stations in addition to 7 existing Suominet sites (\nhttp://www.suominet.ucar.edu/\n) . were arranged in 3 specific transects, each with a particular observational goal. To cover the highest reaches of the SMO, a transect from Bahía de Kino to Chihuahua City was constructed providing the opportunity to evaluate convective initiation and the diurnal cycle of precipitable water vapor fields over complex terrain. The second transect along the Gulf of California (GoC) coastal plains was motivated by the need to capture of low-level moisture “gulf surges” propagating up the GoC in addition to other tropical disturbances. The third transect, Los Mochis to Badiraguato, captures the strong precipitation gradient between the GoC and the foothills of Sinaloa.\nWe present initial results on the diurnal cycle of precipitable water vapor as a function of elevation for both convective and non-convective days. In addition, we introduce typical deep convective timescales derived from GPS precipitable water vapor for convective development across the SMO and along the GoC.

            "abstract": "We studied and discussed the depositional mechanisms of a PDC deposit recognized in the Oligocene turbite system of the Val d'Aveto Formation (Northern Italian Apennines). The deposit is characterized by a sandy-sized base (4 m-thick), overlain by a massive conglomerate (46 m-thick), whose gravel-sized detritus is overall represented by substrate-derived clasts (~80%), rather than volcaniclastic ones. Optical, diffractometric (XRD) and minero-chemical (SEM-EDS) analyses on matrix samples reveal a welded volcanic felty texture, rich in plagioclase and horneblende, with accidental metamorphic rock fragments and loose crystals that tend to upward increase along the deposit. Lithological association and roundness of gravel-sized detritus, together with the accidental lithics and loose crystals in the matrix fraction, suggest that this PDC ran channelized in a continental (mountain?) drainage before entering the basin. Channelization in this type of setting 1) enhanced the PDC erosion capacity during the motion and 2) partially cooled it. Flow reached the water at temperatures which triggered the formation of a trapped gas carapace, able to inhibit the water-flow mixing (Sparks et al. (1980-Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research). This preserved the current from a shocking water mix and favored its welding. Thus, we suggest that this model can be generally applied when PDC temperatures trigger a stable heat transfer between the flow and the water, which allows the generation of trapped gas carapace and preservation from phreatomagmatic explosions. In contrast, depositional mechanisms inferred by Whitman (1989-Marine Geology) and the ones proposed through the direct observation and sampling of a hot PDC at Montserrat Volcano (Trofimovs et al., 2006-Geology) are developed when fundamental role is played by phreatomagmatic explosions and violent water-flow mix.",

            "abstract": "Biochar (BC) is a carbon-rich product produced by thermal degradation of biomass in an oxygen-free environment, whose application to sediment is said to improve water retention. However, BC produced from different feedstocks and pyrolyzed at different temperatures have distinct properties, which may alter water retention in ways difficult to predict a priori. Our goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of BC addition on water retention by examining the impact of BC from two feedstocks, poultry litter (PL) and hardwood (HW), on the soil-water retention curves (SWRC) of a uniform sand and a sandy loam (SL). For experiments with sand, BC and sand were sieved to the same particle size (~ 0.547 mm) to minimize effects of BC addition on particle size distribution. Experiments with SL contained the same sieved BC. PL and HW bicohars were added at 2 and 7% (w/w), and water retention was measured from 0 to -4.38 × 106 cm-H2O.\nBoth BCs increased porosities for sand and SL, up to 39 and 13% for sand and SL, respectively, with 7% HW BC addition. The primary cause for these increases was the internal porosity of BC particles. While the matric potential for air-entry was unchanged with BC addition, BC amendment increased water retention for sand and SL in the capillary region (0 to -15,000 cm-H2O) by an average of 26 and 33 % for 7% PL and HW BC in sand, respectively, but only 7 and 14 % for 7% PL and HW BC in SL. The most dramatic influence of BC amendment on water retention occurred in the adsorption region (< -15,000 cm-H2O), where water retention increased by a factor of 11 and 22 for 7% PL and HW BC in sand, respectively, but by 140 and 190 % for 7% PL and HW BC in SL, respectively. The impact of BC on water retention in these sediments is explained primarily by the additional surface area and internal porosity of PL and HW BC particles.\nvan Genuchten (VG) models were fitted to the water retention data. For SL where the impact of BC addition on water retention was less significant, a unimodal model fit water retention data well for unamended and BC-amended media: the addition of BC did not create a new class of small pores that could not be described with a unimodal VG model. While a unimodal model fitted the sand data well, a bimodal model was required for all BC-amended sand. The influence of BC type, mass fraction and sediment on water retention models will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Rock-salt NaCl is an important mineral in our daily lives, in high pressure science/technology, and in the oil/gas industry. The latter has come to prominence since the discovery of deep water pre-salt structures containing great hydrocarbon reserves out of the SE coast of Brazil. The unique aspects of these regions, such as deep water (greater than 2 km below sea level) and deep hydrocarbon reserves (more than 5 km deep) are challenging for oil/gas explorations. Oil/gas field imaging algorithms require good velocity models for seismic wave-propagation within the salt layer. Despite its importance, there is still insufficient information on the elasticity of and sound velocities in NaCl at relevant P,T conditions. Here we report such properties in rock-salt NaCl at relevant P,T conditions as obtained by first principles (DFT) quasiharmonic calculations. We compare intermediate and final results with available experimental data on thermodynamics and thermoelastic properties and combine them for optimum accuracy. These results should be useful for and facilitate imaging pre-salt hydrocarbon reserves.\nResearch supported by CAPES from Brazil, NSF/DMR, and NSF/EAR.",

            "abstract": "The circulation of the Arctic Ocean is of great interest to both the oceanographic and cryospheric communities. Understanding both the steady state and variations of this circulation is essential to building our knowledge of Arctic climate.\nWith the advent of high inclination altimeter missions such as CryoSat and ICESat, it is now feasible to produce Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) products for the region, which allow a comprehensive investigation of geostrophic currents. However, the accuracy of these products is largely limited by our knowledge of the marine geoid in the Arctic.\nThere are a number of publicly available gravity models commonly used to derive the geoid. These use different combinations of available data (satellite gravimetry, altimetry, laser ranging, and in-situ) and are calculated using different mathematical techniques. However, the effect of these differences on the real world performance of these models when used for oceanographic studies in the Arctic is not well known. Given the unique problems for gravimetry in the region (especially data gaps) and their potential impact on MDT products, it is especially important that the relative performance of these models be assessed\nWe consider the needs of the “end user” satellite oceanographer in the Arctic with respect to gravimetry, and the relationship between the precision of gravity data and the accuracy of a final MDT/current velocity product.\nUsing high-precision aerogravity data collected over 3 years of campaigns by NASA’s Operation IceBridge we inter-compare 10 of the leading gravity models and assess their performance in the Arctic. We also use historical data from campaigns flown by the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) to demonstrate the impact of gravity errors on MDT products. We describe how gravity models for the region might be improved in the future, in an effort to maximize the level at which Arctic currents may be resolved.",

            "abstract": "The drivers of day-to-day and interannual variability in ground level ozone concentrations are often difficult to identify. Traditionally, analyses of variability in ozone pollution, especially in urban settings, have been focused on the factors that influence the production of ozone, specifically precursor emissions and favourable meteorological conditions. However, factors that govern the sinks of ozone can also strongly impact average and extreme concentrations. Based on a statistical analysis of 20 years of ground level ozone data in the United States and Canada, we observe that, in many regions, a significant amount of that variability can be attributed to climate-ecosystem interactions. In rural and urban environments with high leaf area indices (LAI), daily ground level ozone concentrations are strongly associated with vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture in the summer, suggesting that reduced stomatal conductance is a significant factor in summer time ozone episodes. We propose that the role of a meteorologically dependent vegetative dry deposition sink for ozone has been underappreciated in the interpretation of ambient ozone data from North America. The role of vapour pressure deficit in controlling ozone in highly vegetative urban regions, like the Southeastern US, is especially significant. The strength of this correlation in the observational record suggests that this interaction may be important to properly represent in chemistry-climate projections.",

            "abstract": "The climate science community has recently proposed techniques to develop probabilistic projections of climate change from ensemble climate model output. These methods provide a means to incorporate the formal concept of risk, i.e., the product of impact and probability, into long-term planning assessments for local systems under climate change. However, approaches for pdf development often assume that different climate models provide independent information for the estimation of probabilities, despite model similarities that stem from a common genealogy. Here we utilize an ensemble of projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to develop probabilistic climate information, with and without an accounting of inter-model correlations, and use it to estimate climate-related risks to a local water utility in Colorado, U.S. We show that the tail risk of extreme climate changes in both mean precipitation and temperature is underestimated if model correlations are ignored. When coupled with impact models of the hydrology and infrastructure of the water utility, the underestimation of extreme climate changes substantially alters the quantification of risk for water supply shortages by mid-century. We argue that progress in climate change adaptation for local systems requires the recognition that there is less information in multi-model climate ensembles than previously thought. Importantly, adaptation decisions cannot be limited to the spread in one generation of climate models.",

This course provides an introduction to astronomy, geology, oceanography, and meteorology. By design, the class is content-heavy. Despite this, with so many current environmental and societal issues directly tied to the Earth Sciences, it is essential to address contemporary problems and to educate students about the changes and challenges in the world around them. I have made a commitment to doing this by incorporating relevant societal and environmental issues into every topic and every class session. While this may sound basic, doing so requires diligence and research. For example, when teaching about weathering and erosion, I discuss soils, soil quality and erosion, and the impact this has on our global food supply. A hands-on mineral activity lends itself to looking at the energy and waste involved in ore extraction. A lecture on ocean circulation results in an opportunity to analyze the consequences of the interruption of this pattern due to global warming. Through this approach, students are provided with necessary content; furthermore, by linking traditional content to modern issues on a regular basis, students see the relevance of what they are learning and become more aware of the environmental issues facing society today.\nStudent evaluations indicate that this approach has been successful: 100% of students reported that they learned a great deal from the course, and 100% of students agreed that the quality of the course was high. In addition, prior to the class 55.8% of the students indicated interested in the content; whereas, after the course 88.6% indicated interest, with strong interest in the content increasing from 16.3% to 41%.",

            "abstract": "The North Atlantic is the most intense region of CO2 uptake by the world oceans. Though characterization of the mean sink is robust across methodologies [1], a detailed understanding of variability remains lacking, seriously complicating interpretation of observations [2,3]. We investigate the causes of decadal scale variability in the North Atlantic carbon cycle using a regional numerical simulation driven by realistic climate for 1948-2013 and preindustrial atmospheric pCO2. Modeled decadal-timescale variability in air-sea CO2 fluxes and surface ocean pCO2 are dominantly controlled by basin-averaged sea surface temperature (SST). This SST signal is composed of two parts: the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), associated with the model AMOC, and a positive trend. AMO dominates long-term pCO2 variability, with positive AMO leading to pCO2 declines in the subpolar gyre and pCO2 increases in the subtropical gyre. Decomposition of pCO2 into chemical (pCO2-chem) and temperature (pCO2-SST) drivers is instructive. Maximum positive AMO causes subpolar pCO2-SST to increase by ~10 uatm, but also for pCO2-chem to decline by ~20 uatm. Reduced subpolar pCO2-chem is due to reduced supply of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by winter deep mixing and to enhanced DIC horizontal divergence. On net, positive AMO substantially depresses subpolar North Atlantic pCO2.\nAMO had maximum negative amplitude in the 1980s and maximum positive amplitude in the mid-2000s, which coincides with the observed record of surface ocean pCO2 [2]. This model suggests that the changing sign of AMO drove trends in the natural component of surface ocean pCO2 of approximately -7 uatm / decade in the subpolar gyre since the 1980s. This trend is significant in comparison to observed changes in surface ocean pCO2 [3], and thus impacts our understanding of the changing ocean carbon sink in this critical region.\n[1] Schuster et at 2013\n[2] McKinley et al. 2011, McKinley and Fay 2013\n[3] Metzl et al. 2010",

It also has rich experience in teaching by using modern Interactive Computer Technology (ICT) tools and e-learning platform. I present examples about teaching of Astronomical issues through teacher training both as hands on workshops as well as through e-learning.\nE-learning is playing an important role in organizing educational activities not only in the field of modern didactic but also in learning Science subjects. Teachers find e-learning as a very economical, easy and convenient way of learning and developing their knowledge and skills. Moreover, they are no longer afraid of using new ICT tools and programs which help them to cooperate with students effectively. Since 2011 RTTC in Skierniewice has been an organizer of many on-line in-service programs for teachers, in learning Science. Some of them are organized as blended-learning programs which allow teachers to participate first in hands on activities then continue learning on the Moodle platform. These courses include two 15 and 30-hours of Astronomical topics. Teachers have the opportunity to gain knowledge and receive materials not only about the Universe and the Solar System but also can learn to use tools like Stellarium, Celestia, WorldWide Telescope, Your Sky and other tools. E-learning modules consist of both publishing learning materials in various forms, eg. PowerPoint Presentations, Word & PDF materials, web sites, publications, working sheets as well as practical duties like participation in chats, forums, tasks, Wiki, group workshop.\nTeachers use these materials for extending their knowledge as well as for preparing their own tasks, like lesson’s scenarios and school projects. Realizing school projects pay an important role in students’ education. It is obligatory for students representing lower secondary level to implement school project during their 3 years education. Some of these projects are devoted to Astronomy.",

            "abstract": "Widespread near synchronous retreat of marine terminating outlet glaciers has been observed across wide swaths of the Greenland Ice Sheet. However, despite large-scale patterns of retreat, there is considerable variability in the timing and retreat patterns of individual glaciers with geographically adjacent glaciers that experience similar climate and meteorological forcing displaying markedly different behavior. Here we applied an automated identification algorithm that we developed to track the terminus and melange in order better understand the complex dynamics and varying drivers of glacier retreat. The algorithm was applied to three major glaciers (Helheim Glacier, Fenris Glacier and Midgard Glacier) that terminate in Greenland’s Sermilik Fjord over the period of 2000- 2014. The terminus position and the percentage of the fjord filled with melange or sea ice from 2001 to present was determined. Since these glaciers exist within the same fjord system, they should experience comparable environmental forcing conditions, but appear to respond to these conditions differently causing them to have varying patterns of retreat. Helheim Glacier and Fenris Glacier have terminus locations closely spaced in the fjord but Helheim Glacier’s terminus retreated over 7 km before advancing to stabilize at a 5 km retreat over the observation period and Fenris Glacier’s terminus has stayed in roughly the same place. Midgard Glacier is located across the fjord from Helheim Glacier and its terminus has continuously retreated with a retreat of approximately 8 km. This asynchronous retreat shows that proximity alone cannot determine retreat behavior, and a more complex interaction between internal variability and external forcing must be taking place. To better understand the variability within the system and the cause of asynchronous retreat, ocean and air temperature datasets, in conjunction with the fjord geometry, were compared with our derived melange/sea ice and terminus position data.",

            "abstract": "Previous research in the Arctic has demonstrated changes associated with a warming climate including shrub expansion northward, drying of lakes, increasing active layer depths, and decreasing ice and snow cover. With a warming climate, potential for permafrost thaw, increased evapotranspiration from shrubs, and drying lakes, there have likely been widespread changes in patterns of surface soil moisture across the Arctic landscape over the past 20 to 30 years. We investigated trends in soil moisture in Arctic Alaska using the two-decade long data record of ERS-1 and -2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data and ground based measurements of precipitation and soil moisture. SAR data have long been known to be highly sensitive to changes in soil moisture condition, and the C-band SAR (~5.6 cm wavelength) of ERS-1 and 2 are particularly useful for monitoring moisture in the low biomass, open ecosystems of the tundra. Eight sites in Alaska, spanning low to high Arctic and coastal to interior tundra, have been used to develop methodologies and relationships between SAR backscatter and soil moisture in tundra ecosystems. Given the dearth of long-term, in-situ soil moisture data, methods have been investigated using surrogate soil moisture information derived from weather station data and the use of the Fire Weather Index (FWI) subsystem of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System. Previous SAR work in boreal regions has demonstrated high correlations between SAR backscatter at C-band and the drought code (DC) component of the FWI subsystem. DC is a measure of moisture in the deep organic soil layers of 10-20 cm. This paper will present temporal and spatial trends in soil moisture over the two-decade long observation period among the eight study sites. Differences in soil moisture mapping using SAR data between Arctic and boreal systems will be discussed. Recommendations for the use of ERS-1 and -2 data in longitudinal studies will also be highlighted given calibration and data processing issues encountered in this study.",

It is well known that the difficulty in prediction of water contamination is rooted in the stochastic variability of microbes in the environment, and in the complexity of environmental systems.\nTo address these issues, we employ a risk-based design format to compute the variability in microbial concentrations and the probability of exceeding the E. Coli target in the Ohio River Basin (ORB). This probability is then mapped onto the basin’s stream network within the ArcGIS environment. We demonstrate how spatial risk maps can be used in support of watershed management decisions, in particular in the assessment of best management practices for reduction of E. Coli load in surface water.\nThe modeling environment selected for the analysis is the Schematic Processor (SP), a suite of geoprocessing ArcGIS tools. SP operates on a schematic, link-and-node network model of the watershed. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is used as the basis for this representation, as it provides the stream network, lakes, and catchment definitions. Given the schematic network of the watershed, SP adds the capability to perform mathematical computations along the links and at the nodes. This enables modeling fate and transport of any entity over the network.\nData from various sources have been integrated for this analysis. Catchment boundaries, lake locations, the stream network and flow data have been retrieved from the NHDPlus. Land use data come from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), and microbial observations data from the Ohio River Sanitation Committee. The latter dataset is a result of a 2003-2007 longitudinal study. Samples for E. coli analysis were collected approximately every five miles along the entire length of the Ohio River, with additional samples collected at the mouths of over 125 direct tributaries to the Ohio River.",

            "abstract": "A community well is the primary water supply to the town of El Rito. This small rural town in is located in a semi-arid, mountainous portion of northern New Mexico where water is scarce. The well is 72 meters from a nearby intermittent stream. Initial tritium sampling suggests a groundwater connection between the stream and well. The community is concerned with the sustainability and future quality of the well water. If this well is as tightly connected to the stream as the tritium data suggests, then the well is potentially at risk due to upstream contamination and the impacts of extended drought. To examine this, we observed the well over a two-week period performing pump and recovery tests, electrical resistivity surveys, and physical observations of the nearby stream. We also collected general chemistry, stable isotope and radon samples from the well and stream. Despite the large well diameter, our pump test data exhibited behavior similar to a Theis curve, but the rate of drawdown decreased below the Theis curve late in the test. This decrease suggests that the aquifer is being recharged, possibly through delayed yield, upwelling of groundwater, or from the stream. The delayed yield hypothesis is supported by our electrical resistivity surveys, which shows very little change in the saturated zone over the course of the pump test, and by low values of pump-test estimated aquifer storativity. Observations of the nearby stream showed no change in stream-water level throughout the pump test. Together this data suggests that the interaction between the stream and the well is low, but recharge could be occurring through other mechanisms such as delayed yield. Additional pump tests of longer duration are required to determine the exact nature of the aquifer and its communication with the well.",

            "abstract": "A high-resolution greenhouse gas modeling framework was developed on top of the WRF-Chem model version 3.5.1 (coupled the VPRM model) for the Los Angeles megacity. One-way two-nested domains with horizontal resolutions of 12- and 4-km were used. All domains used 51 vertical levels, with 25 vertical layers below 2 km. The 32-km North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data were used to provide the initial and boundary conditions for meteorological fields, and an urban canopy model was used for an accurate representation of the urban environment. Other than that, the model system also takes into account anthropogenic and biogenic CO2 fluxes and initial and boundary conditions for CO2 from the GEOS-Chem model, which aims at disentangling atmospheric CO2 signals from different sources. The purpose of the model configuration is to present realistic greenhouse gas transport with respect to the complex meteorology of the Los Angeles basin: terrain induced mesoscale phenomena such as sea-land-breeze circulation, mountain-valley circulations, urban heat islands, etc.\nSimulated meteorological fields and CO2 are compared against in-situ and CLARS-FTS measurements. The comparison shows that the model is able to capture the main observed features in the CO2 distribution reasonable well. The simulations show that the diurnal variations of CO2 over Los Angeles basin can be strongly affected by the complex terrain and the land-water contract. The evolution of urban CO2 dome over the Los Angeles basin is analyzed as well. Such high-resolution model outputs are also valuable to regional inverse modeling.",

            "abstract": "Deposition and accumulation of atmospheric mercury has led to the ubiquitous enrichment of this toxic metal in surficial soils around the planet. Remobilization of mercury into the atmosphere is generally associated with landscape disturbance, in particular wildfire, and is a significant component of annual global atmospheric mercury loading. In addition to atmospheric transport, wildfire may indirectly mobilize mercury into local surface waters through soil destabilization and increased watershed runoff. Transport of mercury into surface water and sulfate reducing environments may result in conversion of ionic mercury into methylmercury; a highly toxic and bioaccumulative form of the metal. Although increases in methylmercury production have been observed following wildfire, there is relatively little information regarding chemical and physical processes responsible for post-fire mercury mobilization and methylation. In this study, soils, fire debris, and reservoir sediments have been collected from a watershed-reservoir system burned in the 2012 Hewlett Gulch Fire, near Ft. Collins, Colorado. Subsequent coring of the reservoir sediment was conducted at multiple times to assess how early diagenesis of fire debris affects the fate of associated mercury. In addition to environmental sampling, laboratory microcosm experiments using fire debris are employed to assess the influence of redox driven processes on the fate of mercury in recently deposited reservoir sediments. Debris collected from the drainage and reservoir bottom are represented by charred and destabilized organic material which have total mercury concentrations of around 50 ng g-1, similar to native sediment; however, post-wildfire reservoir sediment have dramatically increased methylmercury concentrations. The influence of sulfur speciation, determined by X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, on mercury binding is measured using competitive ligand exchange techniques and indicates enhanced mercury binding capacity in aged wildfire debris and sediments.",

            "abstract": "The University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, part of the Jackson School of Geosciences, annually offers a three-week marine geology and geophysics field course during the spring-summer intersession. The course provides hands-on instruction and training for graduate and upper-level undergraduate students in high-resolution seismic reflection, CHIRP sub-bottom profiling, multibeam bathymetry, sidescan sonar, several types of sediment coring, grab sampling, and the sedimentology of resulting seabed samples. Students participate in an initial three days of classroom instruction designed to communicate geological context of the field area along with theoretical and technical background on each field method. The class then travels to the Gulf Coast for a week of at-sea field work. Our field sites at Port Aransas, and Galveston, TX, and Grand Isle, LA, provide ideal locations for students to investigate coastal processes of the Gulf Coast and continental shelf through application of geophysical techniques in an exploratory mode.\nAt sea, students assist with survey design and instrumentation set up while learning about acquisition parameters, data quality control, trouble-shooting, and safe instrument deployment and retrieval. In teams of four, students work in onshore field labs preparing sediment samples for particle size analysis and data processing. During the course’s final week, teams return to the classroom where they integrate, interpret, and visualize data in a final project using industry-standard software such as Echos, Landmark, Caris, and Fledermaus. The course concludes with a series of final presentations and discussions in which students examine geologic history and/or sedimentary processes represented by the Gulf Coast continental shelf with academic and industry supporters. Students report a greater understanding of marine geology and geophysics through the course’s intensive, hands-on, team approach and low instructor to student ratio (sixteen students, three faculty, and three teaching assistants). This course (to our knowledge) remains the only one of its kind, satisfies field experience requirements for some degree programs, and provides an alternative to land-based field courses. www.ig.utexas.edu/research/mgg/courses/geof348K/",

            "abstract": "Several key features of the Madden-Julian Oscillation, the dominant mode of intraseasonal (20-100-day) variability in the Tropics, remain poorly understood and inadequately depicted in global climate models. Two primary challenges that impede progress toward more accurate MJO simulation include the representation of multiscale cloud processes and air-sea coupling over a range of space-time scales. To address these challenges, we examine composite MJO behavior in Superparameterized CAM (SP-CAM) simulations using prescribed SST distributions corresponding to neutral and positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) phases. The SP-CAM, which explicitly simulates multiscale cloud interactions by using cloud-resolving models to replace CAM's conventional convective parameterizations, produces realistic intraseasonal variability and is an optimal testbed to investigate the impact of different air-sea background states on the MJO. Previous observational studies demonstrate that the IOD, a zonal shift of SST anomalies in the equatorial Indian Ocean, strongly modulates the MJO and the background atmosphere-ocean state in which it operates. Our SP-CAM results provide new insights into the impact of IOD-modified SST distribution (applied both locally in the Indian Ocean and globally) on the propagation and intensity of the MJO.",

A pervasive and long lasting question regarding this spatially inhomogeneous atmosphere is whether it is supported primarily by volcanic emission, or by the sublimation of the large reservoir of SO2 frost found on the surface, and what the relative contributions are between these mechanisms. The source and variability of this SO2 is important because it significantly contributes to the Io torus and surrounding environment.\nHere, we discuss observations of Io’s atmosphere entering and exiting Jupiter eclipse, which helps separate the sublimation component of the atmosphere in vapor pressure equilibrium with the surface from the volcanic component. We present HST-COS UV (220nm) eclipse egress spectra taken in December 2011, and Gemini-TEXES mid-IR (19µm) eclipse ingress spectra from November 2013 at the beginning of JAXA’s Sprint-A/EXCEED mission. The UV spectra do not display significant variation coming out of eclipse, as would be expected if the atmosphere is in vapor pressure equilibrium. The mid-IR spectra, which are the first ever observation of Io’s bulk atmosphere going into and in eclipse, however do show significant change in the SO2 absorption bands of SO2. We will discuss the implications of these apparently contradictory results for the mechanisms supporting Io’s atmosphere.",

A deep low-velocity anomaly is seen in regions of recent volcanic activity in the central and northern regions of the island. The primary data used are from the 2011-2013 MACOMO (Madagascar, the Comoros, and Mozambique) broadband seismic array from the PASSCAL program of IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology), funded by the NSF. Additional data came from the RHUM-RUM project (led by G. Barruol and K. Sigloch), the Madagascar Seismic Profile (led by F. Tilmann), and the GSN. For the ambient-noise study, Rayleigh wave green’s functions for all interstation paths are extracted from the broadband seismic data recorded from August 2011 until October 2013. Rayleigh wave group and phase velocity dispersion curves are extracted in the 8 – 50 s period range, identifying shallow crustal structure. For deeper structure, the two-plane-wave method is used on teleseismic earthquake data to obtain surface wave phase velocities in the 20 – 182 s period range. In the inversion, a finite-frequency kernel is used for each period, and a 1-D shear velocity structure is determined at each location. A three-dimensional S-wave velocity model of the crust and upper mantle is obtained from assembling the 1-D models. Preliminary results show a good correlation between the Rayleigh wave velocities and the geology of Madagascar, which includes areas of ancient Archaean craton. The slowest seismic velocities are associated with known volcanic regions in both the central and northern regions, which have experienced volcanic activity within the past million years.",

The expectation is that – like RCE self-aggregation – SPCAM's simulated MJO should shut down at sea surface temperatures significantly less than 25 degrees Celsius. Remarkably, the MJO in SPCAM is resilient to extreme cooling down to one degree Celsius. With cooling, the simulated MJO becomes more barotropic and its zonal wavelength decreases. The amplitude decrease and horizontal scale contraction are consistent with the theoretical prediction from Yang and Ingersoll (2014, GRL).",

            "abstract": "Dynamic processes that impact estuarine sediments (mixing, erosion) typically result in poor sediment record preservation in these environments. Therefore, establishing high resolution records of sediment flux and source to estuaries is a major challenge. Sediment cores from mini-basins directly adjacent to estuarine systems may provide an alternative for establishing the estuarine geochronology. As a recently-established mini-basin with historically high rates of sedimentation, Cape Lookout Bight, NC presents an ideal coastal environment to capture a long-term (century) record of sedimentation. In 2010, a 4.6 m long core was extracted from the deepest portion of the basin. Through lithologic description, grain-size, water content and radio-isotope analysis (excess 210Pb) conducted at 1-cm intervals, a high-resolution geochronology was established. Basin formation was initiated by spit elongation that captured the marine shelf environment. A transition in sediment source from marine-dominant deposition (storm-induced over-wash events) to estuarine-dominant deposition was identified. This transition reflects the increased trapping efficiency of fine estuarine mud due to the changing geomorphology of the mini-basin. An abrupt increase in the rate of estuarine sedimentation from a moderate (~3 cm/yr) to a high (~10 cm/yr) rate of sedimentation occurred around 1984. After careful reconstruction of basin geomorphology, this increased rate of sedimentation cannot be attributed to internal basin dynamics, but instead is the result of increased estuarine sediment flux from the upper estuary. Unlike records collected in the central estuary, which are prone to modification and can be incomplete, this work demonstrates that rapidly accreting mini-basins have the potential to collect high-resolution records of estuarine sedimentation when placed in the context of changing geomorphology, sediment source and flux of the estuarine system.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the occurrence of anomalous hydraulic under-pressures observed within low hydraulic conductivity (<10-14 m/s) Paleozoic age sediments on the eastern flank of the Michigan Basin. The primary goal of the study was to explore hypotheses regarding the nature of long-term phenomena responsible for the generation and preservation of formation under-pressures. This approach has provided a unique basis to develop an understanding of up-scaled aquiclude properties, and groundwater system evolution and stability as influenced by external perturbations on geologic time scales. The analysis is based on evidence gathered during detailed field investigations of an 840 m thick sedimentary sequence at the location of a proposed deep geologic repository for low and intermediate level radioactive waste in Ontario, Canada. At a nominal depth of 460 to 820 m below ground surface, hydraulic formation pressures of 300 m below hydrostatic were measured within Ordovician age carbonates and shales. Three hypotheses for under-pressure formation are examined by means of 1-dimensional numerical analyses: 1) glacial ice-sheet loading; 2) sedimentary erosion and exhumation; and 3) the presence of an immiscible gas phase. Calibration of the numerical models to observed conditions was achieved through manipulation of formation hydraulic diffusivity, loading efficiencies, and hydraulic boundary conditions. In all cases, the calibrated numerical models were able to replicate the observed hydraulic pressure profiles. Simulations of glacial ice-sheet advance-retreat required three 120 ka cycles to yield observed head conditions. The exhumation model suggests that the erosion of approximately 1-2 km of overlying rock can lead to the formation of under-pressures only if the scaled hydraulic diffusivities are 3-4 orders of magnitude less than observed. The immiscible gas analysis, using TOUGH2-MP, provides a favourable match between the simulated and the measured under-pressures if the effective permeabilities are reduced by 2-3 orders of magnitude from observed values. Formation scale hydraulic properties must be exceedingly small to allow under-pressure development and preservation and reflects the value of self-analogues in developing an integrated understanding of deep-seated groundwater systems.",

            "abstract": "The sparse crater population (~1000 craters) on Venus is the most important clue of determining the planet's surface age and aids in understanding its geologic history. What processes (volcanism, tectonism, weathering, etc.) modify the total impact crater population? Are the processes regional or global in occurrence? The heated debate on these questions points to the need for better approaches.\nWe present new statistical methods for the analysis of the crater locations and characteristics. Specifically:\n1) We produce a map of crater density and the proportion of no halo craters (inferred to be modified) by using generalized additive models, and smoothing splines with a spherical spline basis set. Based on this map, we are able to predict the probability of a crater has no halo given that there is a crater at that point. We also obtain a continuous representation of the ratio of craters with no halo as a function of crater density. This approach allows us to look for regions that appear to have experienced more or less modification, and are thus potentially older or younger.\n2) We examine the randomness or clustering of distributions of craters by type (e.g. dark floored, intermediate). For example, for dark floored craters we consider two hypotheses: i) the dark floored craters are randomly distributed on the surface; ii) the dark floored craters are random given the locations of the crater population. Instead of only using a single measure such as average nearest neighbor distance, we use the probability density function of these distances, and compare it to complete spatial randomness to get the relative probability density function. This function gives us a clearer picture of how and where the nearest neighbor distances differ from complete spatial randomness. We also conduct statistical tests of these hypotheses. Confidence intervals with specified global coverage are constructed.\nSoftware to reproduce the methods is available in the open source statistics software R. Both the methods and the code are extensible to similar marked spatial point process applications.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric ammonia plays an important role in aerosol particle formation and growth, as well as in nitrogen deposition to sensitive ecosystems. However, significant uncertainties are associated with the distribution and strength of emission sources, and many of the processes that control its atmospheric fate are not fully understood. The high density of agricultural and urban sources located in close proximity to more pristine mountainous areas to the west make the Colorado Front Range a unique area for studying atmospheric ammonia. The meteorology of the region, where heavy monsoon rains can be followed by rapid evaporation, can also impact surface-atmosphere partitioning of ammonia. As part of the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Éxperiment (FRAPPÉ), vertical profiles of ammonia were measured throughout the boundary layer aboard a moveable platform on the 300 m Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) tower.\nChanges in ammonia concentration and its vertical structure were driven not only by changes in wind direction and estimated source region, but also by fluctuations in surface and atmosphere water content. For example, large increases in atmospheric ammonia mixing ratios were observed following rain events. This may be explained by surface-atmosphere exchange of wet-deposited ammonia associated with rapid evaporation following the event, and likely impacts particle formation. This may also play a role in transport from ammonia-rich agricultural areas towards the mountainous regions to the west during periods of upslope flow. The vertical ammonia concentration gradients observed throughout the structured early morning boundary layer also provide insight into the possible causes of early morning spikes in ammonia – a phenomenon that has been well-documented in many other locations. A box model was used to assess the relative importance of surface emissions due to the evaporation of morning dew versus entrainment of ammonia-rich air from above the nocturnal boundary layer.",

In this context, an understanding of shifts in the extreme event seasons—emerging, weakening or intensification within seasonal windows is an important step. In this study, we applied a nonparametric circular method to assess the temporal changes in the seasonality of the extreme precipitation for 10 USHCN stations across the state of Maine. Two 30-year blocks (1951-1980 and 1981-2010) of daily annual maximum precipitation were used for the analysis. Extreme precipitation dates were used to compute the circular probability distribution. Important information regarding the multimodality in the seasonal distribution of extreme precipitation dates were obtained from the probabilistic assessment of seasonality using the kernel circular density estimates. Nonstationarity in seasonality was observed for most of the stations; some stations exhibit shifting of significant mode towards Spring season for the recent time period while some stations exhibit multimodality for both the time periods. Despite the limitation of being sensitive to the smoothing parameter, the kernel circular density estimates method is clearly superior and robust when dealing with diverse seasonal pattern of extreme rainfall comprising of multiple seasonal modes.",

            "abstract": "The atmosphere is often considered an extreme microbial environment with limited water and resource availability and high levels of UV radiation. Despite these extremes, diverse assemblages of microorganisms have been sampled from the atmosphere. The study of temporal variation of atmospheric microbial communities has led to an increased understanding of the role of dispersal from source environments in structuring these communities. Seasonal variation in overall community composition and in the relative abundances of specific taxonomic groups is thought be related to seasonal changes in local sources environments (i.e. snow cover, leaf surfaces). However, studies on shorter time scales have yielded conflicting results including communities that are highly variable from day to day and communities that are relatively stable across days. It is unknown if there are diurnal changes in airborne community composition and how changes may be related to atmospheric dynamics and inputs of microbes into the atmosphere. In this study, sampling of airborne bacterial communities was conducted at Mt. Bachelor Observatory from 8/12/13 – 8/17/13. Samples were collected onto filters at 4-hour intervals for the duration of the sampling campaign resulting in 30 total samples. DNA was extracted from the filters, and bacterial community composition was determined by sequencing partial 16S genes. Various environmental and meteorological data were also collected. Community composition varied between day and night samples but not across days. The relative abundances of five species including two members each from the phyla Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi were found to have significant diurnal periodicity. Community richness varied across days and was greater is day versus night samples. These findings demonstrate that bacterial communities in the atmosphere are variable over multiple timescales, and diurnal variation may be more pronounced than variation across days under some conditions.",

            "abstract": "The visualization of and scientific “sense-making” from large datasets varying in both space and time is a challenge; one that is still being addressed in a number of different fields. The approaches taken thus far are often specific to a given academic field due to the unique questions that arise in different disciplines, however, basic approaches such as geographic maps and time series plots are still widely useful. The proliferation of model estimates of increasing size and resolution further complicates what ought to be a simple workflow: Model some geophysical phenomen(on), obtain results and measure uncertainty, organize and display the data, make comparisons across trials, and share findings.\nA new tool is in development that is intended to help scientists with the latter parts of that workflow. The tentatively-titled “Carbon Data Explorer” (http://spatial.mtri.org/flux-client/) enables users to access carbon science and related spatio-temporal science datasets over the web. All that is required to access multiple interactive visualizations of carbon science datasets is a compatible web browser and an internet connection. While the application targets atmospheric and climate science datasets, particularly spatio-temporal model estimates of carbon products, the software architecture takes an agnostic approach to the data to be visualized. Any atmospheric, biophysical, or geophysical quanity that varies in space and time, including one or more measures of uncertainty, can be visualized within the application.\nWithin the web application, users have seamless control over a flexible and consistent symbology for map-based visualizations and plots. Where time series data are represented by one or more data “frames” (e.g. a map), users can animate the data. In the “coordinated view,” users can make direct comparisons between different frames and different models or model runs, facilitating intermodal comparisons and assessments of spatio-temporal variability. Map views can display data anomalies (values relative to the measure of central tendency), aggregate data, or difference data. New features are forthcoming as the application is currently in constant development but an early version is available for the public to try out on the web (http://spatial.mtri.org/flux-client/).",

The dust loading within the PBL was a maximum around summer solstice and then declined over the next 60 Martian days (sols). Detached layers of dust were also detected above the top of the PBL around summer solstice. An atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) was applied to simulate the variability in the total dust loading and the detached layers. The model showed that the enhanced dust loading and the detached layers around summer solstice could be traced back to dust storm activity near the edge of the north polar ice cap.

            "abstract": "Monitoring human-environment interactions in tropical forest protected areas requires linking interdisciplinary datasets collected across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Recent assessments have shown that forest degradation and loss outside of protected areas is strongly associated with declines in biodiversity within protected areas. Biodiversity monitoring efforts must therefore develop approaches that consider change in the broader landscape, using biophysical and socioeconomic datasets that not only cover the extent of a protected area, but also the region surrounding it. The Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network has developed an approach for linking remotely sensed imagery from Landsat and MODIS sensors with in-situ ecological data and socioeconomic datasets to better understand the effects of landscape change on biodiversity. The TEAM Network is a global system for monitoring biodiversity, land use/cover change (LUCC), and climate in sixteen tropical forest sites evenly distributed across global biophysical gradients (rainfall and seasonality) and gradients of expected climate change and land use change.\nTEAM adopts the Zone of Interaction (ZOI) concept to delineate the spatial extent around protected areas for linking broader-scale trends in LUCC to plot-based monitoring data. This talk reports on a cross-site comparison examining LUCC and biodiversity change across the TEAM network. The analysis indicates a gradient of forest loss in the tropics dependent on landscape-level human factors, such as population and road density. The highest losses of forest cover are associated with changing patterns of land use and agricultural development, particularly plantation forestry in Southeast Asia.\nWhile the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing-derived datasets continues to increase, a key challenge for monitoring efforts is linking this data to spatially explicit socioeconomic datasets for use in statistical modeling. We will discuss best practices for handling major global datasets (i.e. GRUMP, gROADS, WorldPop, Landscan) in the context of ongoing LUCC and biodiversity monitoring programs.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the fate of carbon (C) in thawing permafrost is an unresolved challenge of modern biogeochemistry and climate change. The associated C pools are large (~1700 PgC), and their dynamics under thaw are complex: old C decomposes as it is liberated from thawing permafrost as CO2 or CH4, even as new C accumulates due to thaw-initiated ecological succession. The interconnected wetland and aquatic landscapes commonly associated with thaw are critically important to tracing C fate, with a significant fraction cycling through lake sediments. Microbes mediate C loss across this landscape, but a mechanistic microbes-to-emissions scaling is missing. Our team is investigating in situ changes in C cycling and microbiology across a thawing permafrost mosaic palsa-bog-fen-lake landscape, at Stordalen Mire (68°21′N, 19°02′E) in Arctic Sweden. At this site, wetlands and lakes each account for roughly half of total landscape emissions (eg Wik et al 2013). Along the thaw gradient, vegetation shifts from ericaceous shrubs to mosses and sedges, and then aquatic plants, while organic matter becomes increasingly reduced and labile, with evidence of greater humification rates and faster decomposition (Hodgkins et al 2014). C gas emissions peak in the fen habitat, with increasing relative production ratios of CH4 to CO2 (McCalley et al in review, Hodgkins et al 2014). The microbial communities mediating these transformations and losses are markedly complex, and change dramatically across the landscape. Notable community shifts include high abundances of an undescribed group of Caldiserica in intact and freshly-thawed permafrost, and of newly-identified family of hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanoflorentaceae) (Mondav and Woodcroft et al., 2014) in bog and fen, as well as anaerobic methane oxidizers of the ANME-2d lineage present in the lake sediments. Methanogenesis shifts both isotopically and by lineage-abundance from hydrogenotrophy in the bog to a mixture with acetoclasty in the fen. Unraveling the interconnections of microbial lineages and carbon transformations is ongoing.",

Rocket-triggered lightning experiments are performed at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) located at Camp Blanding, Florida. Long-distance ELF observations are performed in California, Greenland, and Antarctica. The lightning current waveforms directly measured at the base of the lightning channel (at the ICLRT) along with pertinent Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) data are used together with the Long Wavelength Propagation Capability (LWPC) code to predict the radio atmospheric (sferic) waveform observed at the receiver locations under various ionospheric conditions. We identify fitted exponential electron density profiles that accurately describe the observed propagation delays, phase delays, and signal amplitudes. The ability to infer ionospheric characteristics using distant ELF observations greatly enhances ionospheric remote sensing capabilities, especially in regard to interpreting observations of transient luminous events (TLEs) and other ionospheric effects associated with lightning.",

            "abstract": "Magnetite intertwined with the evolution of human civilizations, and remains so today. It is technologically and scientifically important by virtue of its unique magnetic and electrical properties. Magnetite is a common mineral found in a variety of geologic environments, and plays an important role in deciphering the oxygen evolution in the Earth’s atmosphere and its deep interiors. The latter application asks for the knowledge of the thermal and elastic properties of magnetite at high pressures and temperatures, which is currently not available in literature.\nWe have carried out a few in-situ diffraction experiments on magnetite using white synchrotron radiation at beamline X17B2 of National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS). A DIA module in an 1100-ton press and WC anvils were employed for compression, and diffraction spectra were collected at simultaneous high pressures (P) and temperatures (T) (up to 9 GPa and 900 oC). Mixture of amorphous boron and epoxy resin was used as pressure medium, and NaCl as pressure marker. Temperature was recorded by W-Re thermocouples. Commercially purchased magnetite powder and a mixture of the said powder and NaCl (1:1) were used as starting material in separate experiments. Preliminary data analyses have yielded following observations: (1) Charge disordering seen at ambient pressure remains active in current experiments, especially at lower pressures (< 6 GPa); (2) Though at each condition potentially complicated by charge disordering process, isothermal compression curves remains simple and reproducible; (3) During cooling, the reversibility and degree of cation disordering depend on the starting material and/or experimental P-T path; and (4) cation disordering notably reduces the apparent bulk moduli of magnetite.",

            "abstract": "By 2050, more than 70% of the world’s population is expected to be living in a city. In many of the urbanizing regions in Asia and Africa, most new development is taking place without adequate urban or regional planning, and a majority population is crowded into densely populated unplanned settlements, also known as slums. During the same period, precipitation and temperature patterns are likely to see significant changes in many of these regions while coastal megacities will have to accommodate sea-level rise in their ecosystems. The rapid increase in population is usually observed in fringes of the urban sprawl without adequate water or sanitation facilities or access to other municipal amenities (such as utilities, healthcare, and education). Collectively, these issues make the ever increasing slum dwellers in emerging megacities significantly vulnerable to a combination of climatic and anthropogenic threats. However, how the growth of unplanned urban and peri-urban sprawl and simultaneous change in climatic patterns have impacted public health in the emerging megacities remain largely unexplored due to lack of readily available and usable data.\nWe employ a number of Remote Sensing products (GRACE, LANDSAT, MODIS) to bridge above knowledge gaps and to identify relevant hydrologic and anthropogenic changes in emerging megacities that are most vulnerable due to the climate-water-health nexus. We explore one of the largest and the fastest growing megacities in the world – Dhaka, Bangladesh – on identifying and investigating the changes in the water environment and growth of slum areas, and impact on water services and health outcomes. The hydroclimatology of South Asia is highly seasonal and the asymmetric availability of water affects vast areas of Bangladesh differently in space and time, exposing the population of Dhaka region to both droughts and floods and periodic spring-fall outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, such as cholera and rotavirus. This research focuses on stretching this understanding to water and health implications in this growing megacity and adjoining slum areas, and how satellite remote sensing data products and derived knowledge can inform urban planning, water management, and public health sectors to adapt to these climatic and anthropogenic changes for the benefit of societies.",

            "abstract": "Development of accurate field-scale deformation models requires use of a constitutive framework that is capable of representing material behavior, and can be calibrated using available mechanical response data. This study focuses on the formulation of such a constitutive framework for Castlegate sandstone, which is a high porosity fluvial-deposited reservoir analog rock. In developing a constitutive framework, researchers must balance the complexity of the mathematics required to represent all aspects of mechanical response, with the ease of implementation. Central to this effort is identifying and modeling the most fundamental material behaviors. For Castlegate sandstone, experimentalists (e.g., AGU Abstract 30068, Issen et al.) report three behaviors that are essential in characterizing deformation response: 1) dependence of the moduli on stress (nonlinearity), 2) evolution of the moduli with plastic strain, and 3) non-normality of the plastic strain increment to the yield surface (non-associativity).\nThis work employs the principles of hyperplasticity (e.g., Houlsby and Puzrin, 2006) to develop a thermodynamically sound constitutive framework for Castlegate sandstone. This requires selection of two potentials: 1) a thermodynamic potential (i.e., internal energy, enthalpy, Helmholtz function, or Gibbs’ function) and 2) a dissipation function or yield surface. Furthermore, the elastic, plastic, and coupled strain increments are derived from these potentials. This study uses a Gibbs’ function to define expressions for the evolution of the elastic moduli, from which elastic and coupled strain increments are determined. The yield surface in dissipative stress-space is used to derive the plastic strain increments. A key result of this formulation is that normality is predicted in dissipative stress space; this result is evaluated against experimental data from work discussed in AGU Abstract 30068, Issen et al.",

            "abstract": "We present our research on the de-noising and interpolation of missing continuous GPS data and the subsequent un-mixing of transients based on the assumption that there are relatively few signals of interest linearly mixed in the data, resulting in a low rank subspace. Continuous GPS measurements contain high levels of noise from a variety sources that can be treated as a combination of Gaussian white noise, spatially correlated noise, and flicker noise. The noise obscures various weak transient signals arising from either tectonic or seasonal hydrologic processes. Both noise and numerous gaps in the data recordings due to weather or station failure complicate identification of transient events. When continuous GPS network data is represented as matrix, we demonstrate that the transient signals of interest are low rank. Based on this assertion, we apply a set of rank penalized algorithms that interpolate and de-noise GPS data. Furthermore, to isolate the mixed transients, we apply Independent Component Analysis (ICA), a technique that separates signals based on statistical independence, and compares the performance to existing techniques that use Principle Component Analysis (PCA). We apply these techniques on both synthetic and real position time series from UNAVCO’s Plate Boundary Observatory in southern California.",

Near the coast of British Columbia (BC), the tsunami was measured by 15 permanent tide gauges, including gauges located well inside the Strait of Georgia and at Patricia Bay in Saanich Inlet (the site of the Institute of Ocean Sciences, IOS). Tsunami waves were also recorded by 5 temporary tide gauges within Victoria Harbour waterways (Gorge and Portage inlets), by 4 NEPTUNE-Canada bottom cable observatories on the Vancouver Island shelf and by 3 VENUS bottom pressure recorders within Saanich Inlet. Maximum tsunami wave heights observed on the outer BC coast were 1.0-1.5 m, while those within the sheltered basins of the inner coast were about ten times lower. The tsunami wave signal was also observed in the temperature, salinity and current velocity records of CTDs and an ADCP installed in an anoxic Canadian fjord on the coast of Vancouver Island. The collected data enabled us to examine the statistical and spectral properties of the 2011 Tohoku tsunami on the coast of British Columbia and to estimate the relative tsunami risk for this coast from distant earthquakes. The tsunami record from the deepest NEPTUNE (CORK) station was used as the input function for the IOS regional tsunami forecast model. The computed and observed tsunami wave forms for this event were in good agreement.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands are the largest source of CH4 to the atmosphere, but emissions measurements are highly uncertain, particularly in the tropics. We examine CH4 production and transport in a pristine tropical peatland in Borneo. We use the carbon isotopic (stable and radioactive) composition of dissolved CH4, DIC and DOC within the peat porewater to identify the source and mechanism of CH4 production in tropical peat. First, we measure 14C in all carbon phases to identify the source of CH4. In contrast to the peat, which ages with depth to nearly 3000 cal BP, DOC is modern throughout the peat column, to depths of 4.5m. The 14C content of CH4 and DIC are nearly identical, and are intermediate between the DOC and peat 14C content. Thus, despite the presence of modern carbon throughout the peat profile, peat decomposition is an important source of CH4 production. Next, we use the δ13C of CH4 and DIC to identify the mechanism of CH4 production. Within the peat profile, CH4 and DIC concentrations increase with depth and DIC becomes increasingly enriched in 13C. The δ13C of CH4 is relatively uniform with depth, resulting in a δ13C fractionation between DIC and CH4 of 55-70‰ (αCCO2-CH4 = 1.06-1.07). This fractionation suggests CO2 reduction is the dominant pathway for CH4 production at the site. We find consistent trends with depth across the peatland, attributable to the unique hydrologic behavior of the dome. These trends are similar to those observed in northern peat bogs. Finally, we use information on site hydrology, CH4 and DIC concentrations, isotopic compositions and fluxes to build a model of CH4 production and transport. This model allows us to partition CH4 losses from the peat due to diffusion, tree-mediated transport, and ebullition.",

            "abstract": "Tidal wetlands have a large capacity for producing and storing organic matter, making their role in the global carbon budget disproportionate to their land area. Most of the organic matter stored in these systems is in soils where it contributes 2-5 times more to surface accretion than an equal mass of minerals. Soil organic matter (SOM) sequestration is the primary process by which tidal wetlands become perched high in the tidal frame, decreasing their vulnerability to accelerated sea level rise. Plant growth responses to sea level rise are well understood and represented in century-scale forecast models of soil surface elevation change. We understand far less about the response of soil organic matter decomposition to rapid sea level rise. Here we quantified the effects of sea level on SOM decomposition rates by exposing planted and unplanted tidal marsh monoliths to experimentally manipulated flood duration. The study was performed in a field-based mesocosm facility at the Smithsonian’s Global Change Research Wetland. SOM decomposition rate was quantified as CO2 efflux, with plant- and SOM-derived CO2 separated with a two end-member δ13C-CO2 model. Despite the dogma that decomposition rates are inversely related to flooding, SOM mineralization was not sensitive to flood duration over a 35 cm range in soil surface elevation. However, decomposition rates were strongly and positively related to aboveground biomass (R2≥0.59, p≤0.01). We conclude that soil carbon loss through decomposition is driven by plant responses to sea level in this intensively studied tidal marsh. If this result applies more generally to tidal wetlands, it has important implications for modeling soil organic matter and surface elevation change in response to accelerated sea level rise.",

It is well understood that life requires energy not only to grow, but also to support standing biomass without new growth. Quantifying this “maintenance energy” requirement is critical for understanding the biological potential of low energy systems, including many systems of astrobiological interest, but field- and culture-based estimates differ by as much as three orders of magnitude. Here, we evaluate and compare these estimates to environmental energy supply in two examples: methanogenic metabolism in serpentinizing systems and a hypothetical “thermotrophic” metabolism. In both cases, evaluation of the power budget introduces constraint and resolution beyond that provided by evaluation of Gibbs energy change for metabolic reactions.",

TGFs have long been associated with radio pulses detected at VLF receivers, but recent evidence indicates that the radio pulse may be from the TGF itself, rather than from a stroke or pulse that either precedes or follows the TGFs.\nUnfortunately, subionospheric propagation of VLF/LF smooths the radio pulse and destroys in particular the high frequency content, so that the radio signal looks similar to those from ordinary lightning strokes.\nSince TGFs have a broad range of durations as detected by satellites, these variations should be apparent in the LF radio pulse from the TGF, which may confirm that the TGF is the dominant source of the associated radio pulse and identify a distinguishing feature of TGF-associated pulses.\nWe report on an effort to detect and characterize the LF radio pulses associated with TGFs at close range (<1000 km) with a high sensitivity LF receiver in the Caribbean. This requires some luck and time since TGFs, at least those detectable by satellites, are not especially common.

While the advantages of this approach include a reduction in the number of uncertain closure assumptions, a corresponding drawback is its much greater computational expense, as compared to traditional parameterization schemes. However, this drawback is becoming less of an issue with recent computing advances, so much so, that superparameterized models can now be regarded as relatively inexpensive tools for developing global cloud resolving models of the future. Indeed, there is growing evidence that even the latter models suffer from the same sorts of climatological biases as much coarser resolution models of the past. The implication is that deficiencies in the treatment of unresolved (microscale) processes are still playing an important role. With these issues in mind, a superparameterized version of the Weather Research and Forecast model has been developed for studying the sensitivities of weather and climate simulations to formulations and parameter settings in microscale physics schemes. Here the primary phenomena of interest include the MJO and climatological pattern of rainfall during boreal summer. Preliminary results show surprisingly strong sensitivities to the choice of turbulent Prandtl number, as well as to the choice of the rain collection efficiency factor.",

            "abstract": "Semiarid shrublands and other dryland ecosystems are highly sensitive to precipitation pulses. Because the frequency and magnitude of precipitation events have been projected to change for these ecosystems, the nature of these pulses and how they are distributed as moisture in the soil profile are also expected to change. Previous research has suggested that transpiration dynamics in drylands are associated with deep soil moisture, which accumulates after large rainfall events. Because transpiration is the productive component of evapotranspiration in that it is water used toward biomass accumulation, a hypothetical decrease in large rainfall events would have major consequences for the health and functioning of dryland ecosystems. Furthermore, as drylands account for nearly 40% of terrestrial biomes, these cascading changes have the potential to impact global water and carbon budgets. Still, in pulse-dependent dryland ecosystems, the relative contribution of transpiration to evapotranspiration and the temporal dynamics of this contribution are not well understood. The objective of this research is to better characterize the temporal dynamics of transpiration in dryland ecosystems. We present the relative contribution of transpiration to evapotranspiration over the course of a year from eddy covariance and sap flow measurements taken at a creosotebush-dominated shrubland ecosystem in southern Arizona. We analyze soil moisture and stable water isotopes within the context of a two-layer soil moisture conceptual framework in an attempt to identify the source water for transpiration. We use these results to explain the temporal dynamics of transpiration in this semiarid shrubland. Finally, we put our results in the context of regional climate projections to suggest how this dryland ecosystem might be impacted in the future. We expect our study will contribute to understanding where precipitation pulses are distributed in the soil moisture profile and when these pulses are used for transpiration in dryland ecosystems; ultimately these findings should improve how drylands are represented in models of land-atmosphere exchange.",

            "abstract": "Weak intermolecular interactions play an important role in nature and are involved in the stabilization of a variety of different molecular aggregates. Carbon dioxide clusters (CO2)n are a good example in which monomers interact through London dispersion forces. The ability to accurately describe these types of interactions is crucial in understanding fundamental molecular-scale processes controlling the chemistry of carbon dioxide, ranging from CO2 self-organization into monolayer films on metal and mineral surfaces, formation of CO2 clouds and molecular interactions in supercritical CO2. Weak interactions in (CO2)n clusters pose a challenge for experimental techniques, and are therefore in many cases either difficult or impossible to explore. Density functional theory with dispersion correction (DFT-D), on the other hand, can provide insight into intermolecular interactions among CO2 molecules, provided that dispersion correction is properly accounted for. In this presentation results from dispersion sensitive DFT (M05-2X, B97-D, B2PLYPD) and MP2 theory will be shown, that describe interactions in (CO2)n clusters over a broad range of temperatures, and in particular, in those clusters with magic number sizes 6 and 13. Briefly, structure determinations and thermodynamic calculations for (CO2)n clustering reactions by DFT-D compare well against benchmark MP2 and CCSD(T)/CBS results, and therefore may be extended to significantly larger systems than accessible with highly correlated methods. The stepwise free energies of CO2 cluster formation at temperatures from 60-400K reveal valuable new insights, the most important being that the stacked cyclic hexamer and tridecameric cluster, consisting of a 3-6-3 ring structure with a centrally enclosed CO2 monomer, are highly stable clusters and therefore should be spectroscopically detectable. These results indicate that DFT-D provides an accurate and cost effective description of non-covalent interactions in (CO2) clusters, and thus may provide important information on nucleation phenomena in CO2 phases with gas-like densities.",

The chemical composition of the emitted particulate emissions were characterized using an Aerodyne Soot Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SP-AMS) and will be presented in the context of the fire location and source. The SP-AMS was operated with both laser and resistively heated tungsten vaporizers, alternatively turning the laser vaporizer on and off. With the laser vaporizer off, the instrument operated as a standard HR-AMS. Under these sampling conditions, the non-refractory chemical composition of the biomass burning particles will be characterized as a function of the fuel type burned and the observed modified combustion efficiency and observed changes during downwind transport. Specific attention will focus on the level of oxidation (i.e., O:C, H:C, and OM:OC ratios), anhydrosugar, and aromatic content. With the laser vaporizer on, the SP-AMS was also sensitive to the refractory black carbon content, in addition to the non-refractory components, and will be presented within the context of technique-specific collection efficiencies.

The high clouds associated with precipitating weather systems tend to reduce the ARC, and so act to damp fluctuations of the global hydrologic cycle. In contrast, on the regional scale, high clouds cause the precipitation rate and the ARC to be negatively correlated in both space and time. The radiative warming associated with the high clouds promotes regional-scale rising motion and so feeds back to enhance the regional precipitation rate. We have used precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project and radiative flux data (used to calculate the ARC) from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project to investigate the relationships between the ARC and the precipitation rate on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Results show that the ARC and the precipitation rate are positively correlated globally and in middle and high latitudes, and negatively correlated in the tropics.",

While the majority of precipitation falls in the form of rain and snow during the winter months, smaller discrete precipitation events occur during the summer months. These events play an important role in regulating soil moisture dynamics, and biogeochemical cycling of essential elements, including carbon and nitrogen. Preliminary data from a large subalpine meadow in Yosemite National Park, shows a marked decrease in the number of June, July and August pulse events over the last 30 years and a shift toward more smaller events earlier in June and infrequent larger events in July and August. In order to better understand the overall impact these changes have on carbon cycling in meadow ecosystems, detailed studies of current ecosystem functioning is critical. The overall objective of this study is to clarify the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture and carbon dioxide fluxes in response to precipitation pulses extending from spring melt through late summer in dry vs. wet meadow sites at a high elevation ecosystem. We found that: (1) Vertical and horizontal heterogeneity in soil moisture is a function of the timing, amount and duration of summer convective precipitation pulse events; (2) The effect of summer convective precipitation pulse events on soil respiration is most heavily influenced by timing between events rather than the magnitude of each event, with more pronounced effects in dry rather than wet meadow locations.",

            "abstract": "In this work we propose an efficient approach to solve morphodynamics in complex river geometries, with a particular emphasis for river deltas. We use a novel immersed boundary method of solution in Delft3D, an open source hydrodynamic model that employs a Cartesian structured grid. Our approach employs a hybrid cut-cell/ghost-cell method: ghost cells are used for the flow momentum equations in order to prescribe the correct boundary condition at the immersed boundary, while cut-cells are used in the continuity equation in order to conserve mass. The resulting scheme is robust, does not suffer any time step limitation for small cut cells and conserves fluid mass up to machine precision. The model has been coupled with the existing Delft3D morphodynamic module, adapted for the presence of immersed irregular boundaries cutting through the regular grid. A cut-cell technique is proposed for both the bed-load and suspended load components. The bed-load component, without any modification, turns out to trigger bed instability in small cut-cells, especially for high values of the morphodynamic factor. We therefore propose a simple \"virtual merging technique\" that guarantees stability even for very high values of the morphodynamic factor. A bank erosion module provides for lateral displacement of the immersed boundaries in proportion to excess bank shear stress. The model has been tested against different analytical and reference solutions. Moreover, morphodynamic simulations of river deltas show that deltas with various channel networks arise as a consequence of jet momentum and stability, and sediment size and geotechnical properties.",

The first AVOID project succeeded in providing the UK Government with evidence to inform its position on climate change. A key part of the work involved developing a range of global emissions pathways and estimating and understanding the corresponding global impacts. This made use of a combination of complex general circulation models, simple climate models, pattern-scaling and state-of-the art impacts models. The results characterise the range of avoidable impacts across the globe in several key sectors including river and coastal flooding, cooling and heating energy demand, crop productivity and aspects of biodiversity. The avoided impacts between a scenario compatible with a 4ºC global warming and one with a 2ºC global warming were found to be highly sector dependent and avoided fractions typically ranged between 20% and 70%. A further key aspect was characterising the magnitude of the uncertainty involved, which is found to be very large in some impact sectors although the avoided fraction appears a more robust metric. \nThe AVOID2 programme began in 2014 and will provide results in the run up to the Paris CoP in 2015. This includes new post-IPCC 5th assessment evidence to inform the long-term climate goal, a more comprehensive assessment of the uncertainty ranges of feasible emission pathways compatible with the long-term goal and enhanced estimates of global impacts using the latest generation of impact models and scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Understanding microbial fate and transport in surface water and making accurate predictions is a formidable task. Evidence from experimental and observational studies unequivocally points to temporal and spatial variability in microbial distributions with significant correlation structure; and to the critical role of processes at the microscopic level.\nThe temporal and spatial variability in microbial distributions arises from inherently random environmental factors and processes. Many cannot be described accurately using deterministic methods, necessitating a stochastic approach to microbial modeling. At the same time, microbial tracking studies identified significant spatial and temporal correlations in microbial distributions in streams, and highlighted the necessity of including microbial interactions with sediments, settling and re-suspension in models of microbial transport. Such understanding must be gained from microscopic, particle-scale research, because microdynamic interactions ultimately give rise to phenomena on higher scales. The challenge then is to be able to describe microbial behavior in probabilistic terms to take care of random drivers, while incorporating processes on microscopic scale and bridging the gap to macroscopic entities like concentrations that are used in watershed management.\nWe have derived a stochastic modeling paradigm that bridges microscopic processes to macroscopic manifestation of microbial behavior in time and space, where the Markov behavior of individual microbes collectively translates into a non-homogeneous Poisson random field that describes microbial population dynamics. The Poisson framework is applied to a mixed-use watershed and implemented within ArcGIS, which makes a wealth of geographic, topologic, soil and other information, as well as data from national and regional datasets, instantly available. Probabilities of exceeding microbial safety thresholds are then obtained at any point in time and space in the watershed.",

The HSPF Watershed Model (WSM) is used as an accounting tool in the development of the TMDL to track progress and guide implementations of best management practices.\nPublished research has shown that precipitation has increased in the US during 20th century by about ten percent, and half of the increase is due to changes in frequency and intensity in the upper tenth percentile of the distribution. Projections from global climate models suggest that these trends are anticipated to continue over the next century. Our analysis of climate data over the last three decades show similar trends in observed precipitation in the CB Watershed. The impact of climate change on the CB TMDL will be examined in a 2017 assessment of progress in the State and Federal partnership of the Chesapeake Bay Program. This is consistent with the CB Executive Order of May 12, 2009 mandates assessment of the impacts of climate change on the CB TMDL.\nThe WSM has a simulation period of more than 3 decades from 1985 to 2011. Over the simulation period precipitation intensity, temperatures, and CO2 levels are increasing. A study conducted by Najjar et al. (2010) that included regional climate projections suggests that pollutant loads in the CB region will increase over the next century. Butcher et al. (2014) demonstrated that a watershed model parameter needs to be adjusted to compensate for the effect of elevated CO2 concentrations on plant transpiration in climate projection applications. This raises the question of whether parameters within a watershed model calibrated using historical climate data are sufficient for assessing hydrologic and water quality impacts of climate change. Here we present an analysis of HSPF model parameters and calibrations to examine parameter sensitivity to a changing climate and their associations with trends in climate. This study explores ways to improve confidence in model predictions to support management actions.",

The HSRL systems provide direct measurements, in the form of vertical profiles, of the particulate depolarization ratio, extinction coefficient, lidar ratio, and backscatter coefficient.\nSince the systems operate continuously the data volume is somewhat large and manual inspection of all the data is not possible, nor efficient for a human operator. For the SEAC4RS campaign we’ve developed new manual quality control (QC) procedures for spot checking the data, as well as refined existing, and implemented new automated quality assurance (QA) algorithms to produce QA data products for end users.

Support began during the early planning phase of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Project and continues today with a major collaboration involving the NCAR Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL), the NCAR Computational Information Systems Laboratory (CISL), the UCAR Unidata Program, and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), in the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information System (ACADIS). These groups have managed thousands of datasets for hundreds of Principal Investigators.\nThe datasets, including the metadata and documentation held in the archives vary in size from less than 30 kilobytes to tens of gigabytes and represent dozens of research disciplines. The ACADIS holdings alone include more than 50 scientific disciplines as defined by the NASA/GCMD keywords. The data formats vary from simple ASCII text to proprietary complex binary and imagery.\nA lot has changed in the way data are collected due to improved data collection technologies, real time processing and wide bandwidth communications. There have been some changes to data management best practices especially related to metadata, flexible formatting, DOIs, and interoperability with other archives to take advantage of new technologies, software and related support capabilities. ACADIS has spent more than 7 years working these issues and implementing an agile service approach.\nThere are some very interesting challenges that we have been confronted with and overcome during the past 20 years. However, with all those improvements there are guiding principles for the data managers that are robust and remain important even after 20 years of experience. These include the provision of evolving standards and complete metadata records to describe each dataset, International data exchange and easy access to the archived data, and the inclusion of comprehensive documentation to foster long-term reuse potential of the data. The authors will provide details on the handling of these specific issues and also consider some other more subtle situations that continue to require serious consideration and problem solving.",

            "abstract": "Shale oil and gas are being developed widely in the United States despite the potential for long-term climate impacts driven by burning these new hydrocarbon resources and by fugitive emissions from fractured formations. Here the carbonation of calcium-based silicates is studied as a method to re-seal fractured shale formations and to store significant amounts of CO2 after hydrocarbon extraction. Ex situ mineral carbonation has been studied extensively for trapping CO2 from power plants but the application of these reactions directly within shale matrix under in situ conditions to seal shales and sequester carbon has not been studied. The reaction requires the solid calcium-based silicates being present within the shale fracture matrix and flooded with high-pressure CO2. The pressure and temperature within most shale formations would enable this carbonation reaction to precipitate solid calcium carbonate, which would clog fractures. Silicates could be injected in the same way that proppants are injected into shale gas wells. Wollastonite was tested here but other silicate minerals such as olivine could also be used in much the same way.\nTo prove this concept, batch experiments were carried out under reservoir conditions representative of the Marcellus Shale in the presence of ground shale particles (39-177µm) and CaSiO3 powder. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns revealed the conversion of CaSiO3 into CaCO3 after 24 hours. Quantitative XRD analysis was used to determine that the conversion ratio of CaSiO3 was ~55% at 3100 Psi and 75oC. The reaction was sensitive to both temperature and pressure with ~58% conversion at an increased temperature of 95oC and only ~50% at lower pressure (2200psi). The morphology observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) reveals that the shale particle surfaces are covered with precipitated calcite crystals ranging in size from 1 to 5 µm. Using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), the locations of residual CaSiO3and crystallized CaCO3 were determined. The cavities of Ca and Si on the corresponding elemental distribution map indicated the areas where the dissolution of CaSiO3 happens. In a fractured rock, the layer of precipitated CaCO3 would be likely to block the flow pathways and decrease the conductivity of the fractured formation.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen isotopic compositions are among the most important constraints on the origin of Earth’s water. Earth’s bulk water content, which is small but not negligible, is significantly greater than what the thermal gradient of the solar nebula disk would suggest for planetesimal materials condensed at one astronomical unit. The proto-solar nebula is a likely source of early Earth’s water, with probable contributions from one or more of the following: water-rich planetesimals, ordinary and carbonaceous meteorites, comets, asteroids, and interplanetary dust particles. However, all of these sources have been questioned, and the proposed proto-solar nebular origin has been disputed in light of the large difference in hydrogen isotopic composition between it and terrestrial water. Current opposition to the solar nebular hypothesis is based on the critical assumption that no processes in the interior of the early Earth changed the isotopic composition of hydrogen. Nevertheless, a hypothesized hydrogenation reaction of liquid iron (2Fe + xH2 ↔ 2FeHx) during core formation likely provided a fractionation mechanism between hydrogen and deuterium (D). We propose that modern D/H ratios at Earth’s surface resulted from this isotopic fractionation and that terrestrial water originated from oxidation of proto-solar hydrogen dissolved in the magma ocean in the early Earth by coexisting oxides (such as FeO). Thus, the isotopic composition of water on Earth can be mainly explained by internal terrestrial processes.",

            "abstract": "Oklahoma has experienced a very significant increase in seismicity rates over the last 5 years with the greatest increase occurring in 2014. The observed rate increase indicates that the seismic hazard for at least some parts of Oklahoma has increased significantly. Many seismologists consider the large number of salt-water disposal wells operating in Oklahoma as the largest contributing factor to this increase. However, unlike many cases of seismicity induced by injection, the greatest increase is occurring over a very large area, about 15% of the state. There are more than 3,000 disposal wells currently operating within Oklahoma along with injection volumes greater than 2010 rates. These factors add many significant challenges to identifying potential cases of induced seismicity and understanding the contributing factors well enough to mitigate such occurrences. In response to a clear need for a better geotechnical understanding of what is occurring in Oklahoma, a multi-year multidisciplinary study some of the most active areas has begun at the University of Oklahoma. This study includes additional seismic monitoring, better geological and geophysical characterization of the subsurface, hydrological and reservoir modeling, and geomechanical studies to better understand the rise in seismicity rates. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission has added new rules regarding reporting and monitoring of salt-water disposal wells, and continue to work with the Oklahoma Geological Survey and other researchers.",

In this work the influences caused by changes in patterns of land cover and land use in Brazil on the behavior of the water balance over South America were evaluated. To fulfill this objective numerical experiments were carried out with the regional model ETA for the period between 1979 and 2008, in which three different conditions of land use and land cover in Brazil was used: 1) Potential Experiment, which are not included the anthropogenic changes in vegetation cover; 2) Control Experiment, in which the map of land use and land cover used the conditions of the 90s; 3) New Experiment, which represents the current conditions of land use and land cover. The results show clearly that the constant changes in patterns of land cover and land use in Brazil cause an increase in precipitation and moisture convergence, and reduced evapotranspiration over the Amazon Region. In other words, it can be stated that with the advance of changes in patterns of land use and land cover, Amazon further intensified their behavior as a sink of moisture, mainly due to increased precipitation and significant reduction in evapotranspiration, noting also that reduction of moisture available in the atmosphere was not offset by increased moisture convergence. The results on the La Plata Basin shows that initially (CONTROL) there is an increase in precipitation and evapotranspiration over the region and reduction in moisture convergence, which is later (NEW) modified to a pattern of reduction in precipitation and evapotranspiration followed by an increase in moisture convergence. These changes in the patterns of land use and land cover of the 90s make the area potentially source of moisture to the atmosphere, even with the reduction in moisture convergence, but reversing their behavior to sink moisture by inserting current vegetation cover modifications, mainly due to reduced precipitation and evapotranspiration over the basin. Thus, we can conclude that the constant changes in the land use and land cover in Brazil have direct influence on the continent water balance, influencing directly the availability of moisture to the atmosphere and moisture transport between the tropics and extratropics.",

            "abstract": "Observations of extreme solar energetic particle (SEP) events associated with coronal mass ejection driven shocks have detected particle energies up to a few GeV at 1 AU within the first ~10 minutes to 1 hour of shock acceleration. It is currently not well understood whether or not shock acceleration can act alone in these events or if some combination of successive shocks or solar flares is required. To investigate this, we updated our current model which has been successfully applied to the termination shock and traveling interplanetary shocks. The model solves the time-dependent Focused Transport Equation including particle preheating due to the cross shock electric field and the divergence, adiabatic compression, and acceleration of the solar wind. Particle interaction with MHD wave turbulence is modeled in terms of gyro-resonant interactions with parallel propagating Alfvén waves and diffusive shock acceleration is included via the first-order Fermi mechanism for parallel shocks. The observed onset times of the extreme SEP events place the shock in the corona when the particles escape upstream, therefore, we extended our model to include coronal conditions for the solar wind and magnetic field. Additional features were introduced to investigate two aspects of MHD wave turbulence in contributing to efficient particle acceleration at a single fast parallel shock; (1) We simulate field-line random walk on time scales much larger than a particle gyro-period to investigate how the stochastic element added to particle injection and the first-order Fermi mechanism affects the efficiency of particle acceleration. (2) Previous modeling efforts show that the ambient solar wind turbulence is too weak to quickly accelerate SEPs to GeV energies. To improve the efficiency of acceleration for a single shock, we included upstream Alfvén wave amplification due to gyro-resonant interactions with SEPs and we constrained the wave growth to not violate the Bohm limit.",

The Murray Darling Basin Plan, drafted in 2008 and enacted in November 2012, has at its core the establishment of environmentally sustainable diversion limits based on a threshold of water extraction which, if exceeded, would cause harm to key environmental assets in the MDB. The overall goal of the Plan is to balance economic, social and environmental outcomes within the Basin.\nBecause irrigated agriculture is the major water user in the MDB, it is important to understand the factors that influence irrigation water use. We applied a mental modeling approach to assessing farmer water use decisions. The approach allowed us to solicit and document farmer insights into the multifaceted nature of irrigation water use decisions in the MDB. Following are a few insights gained from the workshops: 1) For both environmental and economic reasons, irrigators in the MDB have become experts in water use and water efficiency. Water managers and government officials could benefit by partnering with farmers and incorporating this expertise into water management decisions. 2) Irrigators in the MDB may have been misperceived when it comes to accepting policy change. Many, if not most, of the farmers we talked to understood the need for, or at least the inevitability of, governmental policies and regulations. But a lack of accountability and predictability has added to the uncertainty in farming decisions. 3) Irrigators in the MDB subscribe to the concept of environmental sustainability, although they might not always agree with how the concept is implemented. Farmers should be recognized for their significant investments in the long-term sustainability of their farms and their communities and appreciated for their role in the sustainability of the Basin. The mental modelling approach used in this research could be used to educate all stakeholders in differences in perspectives and common goals and bridge the gap into how to implement sustainable management practices.",

            "abstract": "Microbial activity is responsible for the mineralization of Fe(III)-oxides in high-temperature chemotrophic communities that flourish within oxygenated zones of low pH (2.5 - 4) geothermal outflow channels (Yellowstone National Park, WY). High-temperature Fe(II)-oxidizing communities contain several lineages of Archaea, and are excellent model systems for studying microbial interactions and spatiotemporal dynamics across geochemical gradients. We hypothesize that acidic Fe(III)-oxide mats form as a result of constant interaction among primary colonizers including Hydrogenobaculum spp. (Aquificales) and Metallosphaera spp. (Sulfolobales), and subsequent colonization by archaeal heterotrophs, which vary in abundance as a function of oxygen, pH and temperature. We are integrating a complementary suite of geochemical, stable isotope, genomic, proteomic and modeling analyses to study the role of microorganisms in Fe(III)-oxide mat development, and to elucidate the primary microbial interactions that are coupled with key abiotic events. Curated de novo assemblies of major phylotypes are being used to analyze additional –omics datasets from these microbial mats. Hydrogenobaculum spp. (Aquificales) are the dominant bacterial population(s) present, and predominate during early mat development (< 30 d). Other Sulfolobales populations known to oxidize Fe(II) and fix carbon dioxide (e.g., Metallosphaera spp.) represent a secondary stage of mat development (e.g., 14 - 30 d). Hydrogenobaculum filaments appear to promote the nucleation and subsequent mineralization of Fe(III)-oxides, which likely affect the growth and turnover rates of these organisms. Other heterotrophs colonize Fe(III)-oxide mats during succession (> 30 d), including novel lineages of Archaea and representatives within the Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota and Nanoarchaeota. In situ oxygen consumption rates show that steep gradients occur within the top 1 mm of mat surface, and which correlate with changes in the abundance of different organisms that occupy these microenvironments. The relative consumption of oxygen by different members of Fe(II)-oxidizing mat communities has implications for autotroph-heterotroph associations and the dynamic micromorphology of active Fe(III)-oxide terraces.",

VERITAS addresses the highest priority Decadal survey questions: 1) Did Venus host ancient aqueous environments? 2) Can understanding the roles of physics, chemistry, geology, and dynamics in driving planetary atmospheres lead to a better understanding of climate change on Earth? 3) How have chemical and physical processes operated, interacted, and evolved? Using an interferometric mapping radar, a near infrared spectrometer, and radio science experiment, VERITAS will examine 1) the similarity of tessera plateau formation to continents on Earth, 2) the current forces driving tectonics and volcanism, and, perhaps most importantly, 3) inform our understanding of how stagnant lid planets evolve. Data from VIRTIS on Venus Express show that the highly deformed tessera plateaus, possible remnants of a prior regime on Venus, may be more felsic in composition than the surrounding plains, supporting the hypothesis they are similar to Earth’s continents. However this interpretation is equivocal due to uncertainty in the available altimetry. VERITAS is designed to collect data with sufficient resolution to answer this question definitively, and also aid in the assessment of tesserae as a touchdown point for a future lander. Similarly, the enormous rift zones and mountain belts are manifestations of global scale tectonics within the last billion years on Venus, but present data are not adequate to determine the driving forces or whether they are presently active. VERITAS will provide such data through fine-resolution topographic maps and, if possible, measurements of any current-day crustal deformation. Finally, current data are highly suggestive of recent and active volcanism. VERITAS observations can tell us if current volcanism is limited to mantle plume heads or is more widespread. The geologic setting of present day volcanism or tectonism also holds lessons for predicting activity on Earth-sized planets elsewhere in the galaxy. Together these investigations allow us to assess just how similar or dissimilar the evolution of Venus and Earth has been.",

Eolian dust (loess) is a major source of this micronutrient, and its deposition has important implications for the global CO2 budget. In this study, we explore distributions of potentially bioreactive Fe, the soluble fraction required by phytoplankton for photosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation, in deep-sea sediments in the North and South Atlantic Oceans. We used a state-of-the-art Fe speciation technique to characterize Fe inputs from different source regions, specifically North Africa and Patagonia to address the patterns and implications across glacial-interglacial time scales.\n In many open-ocean regions the input of new iron to the surface waters is dominated by the atmospheric deposition of soluble iron in eolian dusts. Multiple records have shown dust accumulation is correlated with glacial-interglacial cycles – glacial periods are substantially dustier. Furthermore, the delivery of eolian dust to the North and South Atlantic Oceans are from two very different source regions and soil types. We analyzed IODP cores from these two regions and our preliminary data shows similar pattern of iron distribution from both the North and South Atlantic Oceans. To date we have found no simple global pattern of bioavailable iron distribution during glacial and interglacial periods. We have analyzed a range of size distributions to isolate the dust-dominated fraction and the data shows no size effects in bioavailable form of iron distribution. We will explore the role of deep-water dust dissolution and sedimentary redox implications and its role on the bioreactive Fe record in marine cores.",

            "abstract": "It has long been assumed that higher moments of velocity and acceleration affect the motion and transport of mobile sediment beds. The goal of this effect is to identify the influence of wave shape on sediment motion and mobile layer thickness. Theoretic predictions of neared velocity and horizontal pressure gradient will be approximated with Dean's 1965 stream function theory for representing nonlinear waves. The formulation also allows for the inclusion of mean flow. Wave nonlinearity is characterized with skewness and asymmetry of the wave shape. An incipient motion criterion that resolves the fluid forcing due to both the bed shear stress and the horizontal pressure gradients is applied to a slab of sediment. The resulting formulation provides a measure of sediment transport vulnerability to commonly available wave parameters (wave height, wave period, water depth, skewness, and asymmetry). The formulation is compared with several available data sets with a range of forcing and sediment conditions. Particle image velocimetry observations of velocity and sediment motion and acoustic Doppler observations of the three-dimensional velocity field provide high resolution of the near bed dynamics. The wave shape is characterized with mid water column pressure sensors and wave gages. As the wave nonlinearities increase, the role of the horizontal pressure gradient also increases. The influence of the pressure gradient also is shown to be particularly sensitive to a decrease in the wave period and an increase in the wave asymmetry. The influence of the bed shear is shown to be particularly sensitive to wave skewness. The analysis demonstrates the potential for improving the larger scale predictions of sediment transport in our nearshore and coastal waters.",

            "abstract": "The fate and transport of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in the presence of active microbial communities has not been widely investigated. These emerging contaminants are commonly utilized in aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF) and have often been detected in groundwater. This study explores the transport of a suite of perfluorocarboxylic acids and perfluoroalkylsulfonates, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), in microbially active settings. Single point organic carbon normalized sorption coefficients derived by exposing inactive cellular material to PFASs result in more than an order of magnitude increase in sorption compared to soil organic carbon sorption coefficients found in literature. For example, the sorption coefficients for PFOS are 4.05±0.07 L/kg and 2.80±0.08 L/kg for cellular organic carbon and soil organic carbon respectively. This increase in sorption, coupled with enhanced extracellular polymeric substance production observed during growth of a common hydrocarbon degrading soil microbe exposed to source-level concentrations of PFASs (10 mg/L of 11 analytes, 110 mg/L total) may result in PFAS retardation in situ. To address the upscaling of this phenomenon, flow-through columns packed with low-organic carbon sediment and biostimulated with 10 mg/L glucose were exposed to PFAS concentrations from 15 μg/L to 10 mg/L of each 11 analytes. Breakthrough and tailing of each analyte was measured and modeled with Hydrus-1D to explore sorption coefficients over time for microbially active columns.",

            "abstract": "Tree biomass and forest soils are both difficult to quantify with confidence, for different reasons. Forest biomass is estimated non-destructively using allometric equations, often from other sites; these equations are difficult to validate. Forest soils are destructively sampled, resulting in little measurement error at a point, but with large sampling error in heterogeneous soil environments, such as in soils developed on glacial till. In this study, we report C contents of biomass and soil pools in northern hardwood stands in replicate plots within replicate stands in 3 age classes following clearcut harvesting (14-19 yr, 26-29 yr, and > 100 yr) at the Bartlett Experimental Forest, USA. The rate of C accumulation in aboveground biomass was ~3 Mg/ha/yr between the young and mid-aged stands and <1 Mg/ha/yr between the mid-aged and mature stands. We propagated model uncertainty through allometric equations, and found errors ranging from 3-7%, depending on the stand. The variation in biomass among plots within stands (6-19%) was always larger than the allometric uncertainties. Soils were described by quantitative soil pits in three plots per stand, excavated by depth increment to the C horizon. Variation in soil mass among pits within stands averaged 28% (coefficient of variation); variation among stands within an age class ranged from 9-25%. Variation in carbon concentrations averaged 27%, mainly because the depth increments contained varying proportions of genetic horizons, in the upper part of the soil profile. Differences across age classes in soil C were not significant, because of the high variability. Uncertainty analysis can help direct the design of monitoring schemes to achieve the greatest confidence in C stores per unit of sampling effort. In the system we studied, more extensive sampling would be the best approach to reducing uncertainty, as natural spatial variation was higher than model or measurement uncertainties. ",

            "abstract": "The abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger events define Northern Hemisphere (NH) climate variability during the last glacial period. They are out of phase with gradual temperature variations recorded in Antarctic ice cores. Ocean teleconnections are thought to link the temperatures of both hemispheres via the thermal bipolar seesaw. Additionally, atmospheric teleconnections link the NH to tropical circulation – in particular the position of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Recent modeling has demonstrated the influence of the ITCZ on the Southern Hemisphere (SH) jets. In the context of millennial variability, this suggests that changes in high latitude SH atmospheric circulation could have been in-phase with the distant D-O signal, rather than local temperatures. To date, there has been little proxy evidence spanning the last glacial period to support this prediction.\nWe examine phasing between δ18O, methane concentration, and deuterium excess data form the new West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core. Deuterium excess is a second order isotope parameter, sensitive to ocean surface conditions and atmospheric circulation. We resolve a long-standing issue by redefining this parameter, revealing zonally coherent millennial-scale sea surface temperature changes in the Southern Ocean. Superimposed upon this variability, we find evidence for changes in SH atmospheric circulation in phase with the D-O events. This is found in the strong and in-phase coherence between deuterium excess and atmospheric methane. Methane records tropical hydrological changes and is identical to the abrupt D-O signal. WAIS deuterium excess tracks methane during D-O events, showing large variability significantly before local temperature change. We interpret Antarctic deuterium excess to be driven by two primary signals: 1) variability in Southern Ocean sea surface temperatures at fixed locations, and 2) variability in the spatial sampling of that surface water. The latter is driven by atmospheric circulation and teleconnetions to the tropics. This interpretation is supported by water tracing atmospheric model experiments. Our results highlight the role for atmospheric processes, and tropical teleconnections in particular, in addition to oceanic processes in the machinery of millennial climate change.",

Pit craters have been observed on multiple planetary bodies and currently efforts are underway to characterize these crater types. In this work we focused on finding and evaluating pitted craters and their morphologic habits on the lunar surface to better constrain pit crater formation on a relatively dry body (compared to Mars and Ganymede). The study area ranged across the entire lunar surface from -20 to 50 degree latitudes and included both highland and maria terrains. The diameter range of the crater population evaluated was 20 – 60 km. The diameter range was chosen to include complex crater morphology (minimum diameter ~20 km) but to not include larger impacts (>60 km) to prevent misinterpretation of central regions. An overall population of 1490 craters were evaluated, of which 115 craters were characterized as pit craters. The LOLA data set along with NAC+WAC, Clementine visible imagery were used to locate and assess the pit craters in addition to generated digital elevation models of the craters. Our results show that pitted craters have variable morphologies, where the pitted features could be oblique or linear in shape. Summit and floor pit craters were found in both maria and highland terrain. The Moran index and Chi statistical tests were applied and determined that the population is randomly distributed across the study area. Evaluation of the individual pit craters show that they may potentially have one or more formational mechanisms associated. The statistical tests coupled with the variant morphologies may indicate multiple relations to possible formational mechanisms (volcanic, volatile release, or structural deformation).",

            "abstract": "Satellite observations play a significant role in supporting disaster response and risk management, however data complexity is a barrier to broader use especially by the public. In December 2013 the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites Working Group on Information Systems and Services documented a high-level reference model for the use of Earth observation satellites and associated products to support disaster risk management within the Global Earth Observation System of Systems context. The enterprise architecture identified the important role of user access to all key functions supporting situational awareness and decision-making. This paper focuses on the need to develop actionable information products from these Earth observations to simplify the discovery, access and use of tailored products. To this end, our team has developed an Open GeoSocial API proof-of-concept for GEOSS. We envision public access to mobile apps available on smart phones using common browsers where users can set up a profile and specify a region of interest for monitoring events such as floods and landslides. Information about susceptibility and weather forecasts about flood risks can be accessed. Users can generate geo-located information and photos of local events, and these can be shared on social media. The information architecture can address usability challenges to transform sensor data into actionable information, based on the terminology of the emergency management community responsible for informing the public. This paper describes the approach to collecting relevant material from the disasters and risk management community to address the end user needs for information. The resulting information architecture addresses the structural design of the shared information in the disasters and risk management enterprise. Key challenges are organizing and labeling information to support both online user communities and machine-to-machine processing for automated product generation.",

            "abstract": "Methods that use seismic noise or microtremors have become very useful tools worldwide due to its low costs, the relative simplicity in collecting data, the fact that these are non-invasive methods hence there is no need to alter or even perforate the study site, and also these methods require a relatively simple analysis procedure. Nevertheless the geological structures estimated by this methods are assumed to be parallel, isotropic and homogeneous layers. Consequently precision of the estimated structure is lower than that from conventional seismic methods. In the light of these facts this study aimed towards searching a new way to interpret the results obtained from seismic noise methods.\nIn this study, seven triangular SPAC (Aki, 1957) arrays were performed in the city of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, varying in sizes from 10 to 100 meters. From the autocorrelation between the stations of each array, a Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion curve was calculated. Such dispersion curve was used to obtain a S wave parallel layers velocity (VS) structure for the study site. Subsequently the horizontal to vertical ratio of the spectrum of microtremors H/V (Nogoshi and Igarashi, 1971; Nakamura, 1989, 2000) was calculated for each vertex of the SPAC triangular arrays, and from the H/V spectrum the fundamental frequency was estimated for each vertex. By using the H/V spectral ratio curves interpreted as a proxy to the Rayleigh wave ellipticity curve, a series of VS structures were inverted for each vertex of the SPAC array. Lastly each VS structure was employed to calculate a 3D velocity model, in which the exploration depth was approximately 100 meters, and had a velocity range in between 206 (m/s) to 920 (m/s). The 3D model revealed a thinning of the low velocity layers. This proved to be in good agreement with the variation of the fundamental frequencies observed at each vertex.\nWith the previous kind of analysis a preliminary model can be obtained as a first approximation, so that more careful studies can be conducted to assess a detailed geological characterization of a specific site. The continuous development of the methods that use microtremors, create many areas of interest in the seismic engineering study field. This and other reasons are why these methods have acquired more presence all over the globe.",

High-resolution sea surface salinity (SSS) measurements from the Aquarius satellite reveals more detail in the band of lower salinity and a sharp front that aligns with the strong ITCZ atmospheric convection. In the upper ocean, the strong salinity gradient (i.e. the salinity front, SF) can be the main contributor for sharp surface density fronts where the sea surface temperature in near homogeneous under the ITCZ. To check the possible mechanisms by which the SF form and grow, we examine (a) the freshwater flux to study how the intensity of precipitation contributes to the strength of SF, and (b) the ocean surface currents and study how the horizontal advection changes the SSS gradients. From this, we expect to achieve a better understanding of the fine scale upper ocean dynamics under the Pacific ITCZ.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes, including large damaging events, are as central to the geologic evolution of the Island of Hawai`i as its more famous volcanic eruptions and lava flows. Increasing and expanding development of facilities and infrastructure on the island continues to increase exposure and risk associated with strong ground shaking resulting from future large local earthquakes. Damaging earthquakes over the last fifty years have shaken the most heavily developed areas and critical infrastructure of the island to levels corresponding to at least Modified Mercalli Intensity VII. Hawai`i’s most recent damaging earthquakes, the M6.7 Kiholo Bay and M6.0 Mahukona earthquakes, struck within seven minutes of one another off of the northwest coast of the island in October 2006. These earthquakes resulted in damage at all thirteen of the telescopes near the summit of Mauna Kea that led to gaps in telescope operations ranging from days up to four months.\nWith the experiences of 2006 and Hawai`i’s history of damaging earthquakes, we have begun a study to explore the feasibility of implementing earthquake early warning systems to provide advanced warnings to the Thirty Meter Telescope of imminent strong ground shaking from future local earthquakes. One of the major challenges for earthquake early warning in Hawai`i is the variety of earthquake sources, from shallow crustal faults to deeper mantle sources, including the basal decollement separating the volcanic pile from the ancient oceanic crust. Infrastructure on the Island of Hawai`i may only be tens of kilometers from these sources, allowing warning times of only 20 s or less. We assess the capability of the current seismic network to produce alerts for major historic earthquakes, and we will provide recommendations for upgrades to improve performance.",

            "abstract": "Variation in weather and crop management practices strongly determines direct greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 and N2O) from agricultural crop land. Thus a long-term study was established to relate weather and management variations to direct emissions in the Northern Great Plains of Canada. Continuously emission determinations of CO2 and N2O were established at the Trace Gas Manitoba (TGAS-MAN) Long Term Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Site at Glenlea, Manitoba, using the flux gradient micrometeorlogical technique with a tunable diode laser analyzer. The soil is poorly drained clay in the Red River Valley. The field experiment consisted of four 4-hectare plots planted to corn in 2006 and faba bean in 2007. In 2008, grass-alfalfa forage was introduced to two plots (annual - perennial) and grown until 2011 whereas the other two plots (annual) were planted to annual crops: spring wheat, rapeseed, barley and spring wheat in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. In late September of 2011 the grass-alfalfa forage was killed and in 2012, 2013 and 2014 all four plots were planted with corn, soybean and spring wheat, respectively. Management decisions increased emissions such as fertilizer N addition, and hay, straw and silage crop removal greatly increased emissions while choosing legume grain and perennial crops reduced emissions. Weather variation affecting seasonal and daily soil moisture, length of spring freeze-thaw period, and crop yield served to increase or decrease emissions. The variation in management and weather will be discussed in regards to impact on net emissions over the nine year study and answer if development of greenhouse gas neutral cropping systems is possible.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate records from the mid-continental United States that span the Holocene with sub-decadal resolution are rare. This is especially true for geochemical records that capture the isotopic composition of precipitation or local precipitation/evaporation balances. As a result, many questions remain about the hydrologic expression of abrupt climate events in this region that today is one of the world’s largest agricultural centers. Here, we present sedimentological, geochemical, and chronological data spanning the last 3,000 years from a set of sediment cores from Martin Lake in northeastern Indiana. Today, this kettle lake is hydrologically open with persistent water column stratification and bottom water anoxia. Radiometric dating shows that the lake formed at approximately 16,000 cal yr BP and continuously accumulated sediment thereafter. We focus here on developing a stable isotope record of the late Holocene at decadal resolution to provide a detailed view of precipitation isotopic variability during this time. The Midwest has been influenced by changes in atmospheric circulation patterns throughout the late Holocene, leading to climate events like the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly, which significantly changed temperature and precipitation regimes. The isotopic composition of precipitation in the Midwest has been shown to be heavily influenced by the source of atmospheric moisture as mediated by the Pacific North American mode of atmospheric variability that in turn affects the position of the Polar Front Jetstream. Using high-resolution stable isotope measurements and ultimately climate modeling, we seek to reconstruct the isotopic expression of late Holocene climate events in the mid continental United States and assess the possible relationship with these dominant modes of atmospheric variability. Future work includes extending this reconstruction through the Holocene and increasing the temporal resolution of the data.",

            "abstract": "The last of remaining multi-year ice exits the Arctic Ocean via Nares Strait to the west of northern Greenland. Measuring ice draft and velocity directly, we maintained moored sensors in Nares Strait from 2003 through 2009. Two ice profiling sonars measured acoustic travel times from about 100-m depth to the bottom of the sea ice. Estimates of ice draft result, if vertically averaged density, speed of sound, and depth of the sensor are known. We use concurrently measured temperature, salinity, and pressure at nearby mooring locations for those properties at daily time scales. Sensitivity tests reveal that our ice draft estimates are accurate to within 0.1 m.\nWith ice drafts sampled at 15 second intervals, we construct ice draft probability density functions to define ice categories and to compare these at inter-annual and seasonal time sales. Categories are open water (no ice), thin ice (< 0.5 m), first year ice (0.5- 2 m; FYI), multi year ice (>2 m; MYI). FYI dominated the ice draft distribution from 2003 to 2006 when it was observed about half of the time. It diminished to ~20% from 2006 to 2009 when much FYI was replaced by a combination of thin ice and MYI. We interpret this finding as a transition towards a more dynamic and advective ice regime in Nares Strait.\nAt seasonal time scales we found the largest ice drafts always during the period prior to prolonged periods of zero ice velocity, that is, the onset of landfast ice conditions. The duration of this landfast season reduced from more than 180 days per year on average for the 2003-06 period to less than 20 days per year on average for the 2006-09 period. Implications on ice flux are profound as the transition from landfast to mobile ice conditions enhances both local wind forcing, local ice formation (thin ice), and ice export. We emphasize that this transition precedes the record setting Arctic ice minimum in the summer of 2007.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a localized surface albedo modification technique that shows promise as a method to increase reflective multi-year ice using floating materials, chosen so as to have low subsidiary environmental impact. It is now well-known that multi-year reflective ice has diminished rapidly in the Arctic over the past 3 decades and this plays a part in the continuing rapid decrease of summer-time ice. As summer-time bright ice disappears, the Arctic is losing its ability to reflect summer insolation, and this has widespread climatic effects, as well as a direct effect on sea level rise, as oceans heat and once-land-based ice melts into the sea.\nWe have tested the albedo modification technique on a small scale over six Winter/Spring seasons at sites including California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains, a Canadian lake, and a small man-made lake in Minnesota, using various materials and an evolving array of instrumentation. The materials can float and can be made to minimize effects on marine habitat and species. The instrumentation is designed to be deployed in harsh and remote locations.\nLocalized snow and ice preservation, and reductions in water heating, have been quantified in small-scale testing. We have continued to refine our material and deployment approaches, and we have had laboratory confirmation by NASA.\nIn the field, the materials were successfully deployed to shield underlying snow and ice from melting; applications of granular materials remained stable in the face of local wind and storms. We are evaluating the effects of snow and ice preservation for protection of infrastructure and habitat stabilization, and we are concurrently developing our techniques to aid in water conservation.\nLocalized albedo modification options such as those being studied in this work may act to preserve ice, glaciers, permafrost and seasonal snow areas, and perhaps aid natural ice formation processes. If this method is deployed on a large enough scale, it could conceivably bring about a reduction in the Ice-Albedo Feedback Effect, possibly slowing one of the key effects and factors in climate change.",

Although they are more abundant than silver, and some of them are more abundant than lead, they are known as rare-earth (RE) elements. The \"rare\" in their name refers to the difficulty of obtaining the pure elements, not to their abundances in nature. They are never found as free metals in the Earth's crust and do not exist as pure minerals. Using first-principles plane-wave calculations, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of rare-earth cobaltites (RECoO3). Structurally consistent Hubbard U treatment was shown to essential for proper description of strongly correlated cobalt-d electrons. We successfully capture the experimentally observed structural trends and give first-principles insights on interesting phenomena related with the cobalt spin state change. It was demonstrated that increase of crystal-field splitting energy between eg-t2g orbitals and shrinking of unoccupied σ*-bonding eg bands are responsible for the increase of onset spin-state transition temperature along the series.",

The telescope on the mast will be used to focus the 1064 nm laser and generate a LIBS plasma from which the elemental composition will be determined up to a 7 m standoff distance. Some of the 1064 nm laser will be directed through a doubling crystal to produce 532 nm light for Raman mineralogical analysis out to 12 m from the mast. The ChemCam visible and near infrared (VNIR) spectrometer will be replaced with a transmission spectrometer and intensified charge coupled device (ICCD) that is designed to maximize the Raman mineralogical sensitivity. This transmission spectrometer and ICCD was also designed to collect time-resolved fluorescence spectra that can distinguish short lived organic fluorescence from long lived inorganic signatures. The SuperCam instrument also includes a Visible and Infrared (VISIR) Reflectance Spectrometer (400 – 900 nm, 1.3 – 2.6 µm) designed to remotely detect minerals. Finally, the ChemCam black and white RMI that is integrated into the telescope will be replaced with a color RMI with the same spatial resolution to provide context images of the samples probed with the SuperCam spectrometers. In this paper, some of the geochemical and mineralogical laboratory tests will be presented to highlight the SuperCam capabilities under both terrestrial and Mars conditions.",

            "abstract": "The use of water level oscillations driven by earth tides is a technique which has been used to infer rock properties such as permeability and storage at the field scale. The tidal method is attractive because it provides passively estimated permeability time series, allows identification of dynamic changes over time, and measures a hard to access scale ranging from a meters to tens of meters. It consists of computing the phase shift between tidally induced water level changes measured in boreholes, and theoretical earth tide strains. This leads to an estimate of the transmissivity, from which permeability can be deduced. To our knowledge, it has not been compared to standard method, such as pumping test analysis.\nIn this work, water level data monitored before, during, and after two constant rate pumping tests performed in a shallow fractured aquifer were used, at the Santa Susana Field Site in Southern California. The two tests were one to five months long, the recordings lasting approximately 6 months. Tidal frequency oscillations appearing in the measurements were used to get permeability at thirteen locations, some of the wells providing several isolated open screened intervals at depth. As a comparison, permeabilities were also estimated from the fit of two aquifer tests at both early and late stages, using Theis solution (Gringarten solution gives similar results). The simple Theis solution is selected because it includes assumptions consistent with the assumptions in the isotropic and homogeneous tidal solution. The values obtained from both methods are consistent. No significant relation between permeability and faults located in the vicinity of the wells was identified, however, we do observe some variations at depth. Furthermore, some variability is observed in permeability time series during the pumping phases. This study shows that tidal responses lead to a passive and accurate capture of the shallow aquifer properties.",

            "abstract": "The Chino Basin, located in southern California, is a large alluvial groundwater basin with storage in excess of five million acre-feet. The basin has a long history of groundwater development for various uses dating back to the early 1900s. As a result, piezometric heads declined basin-wide during the past century – in some areas by more than 200 feet. Declines of this magnitude typically cause irreversible aquifer-system compaction, which in turn results in subsidence at the ground surface. In portions of Chino Basin, land subsidence has been differential and accompanied by ground fissuring, which damaged existing infrastructure and poses concerns for new and existing development.\nChino Basin Watermaster, the agency responsible for groundwater basin management, has recognized that land subsidence and ground fissuring should be minimized to the extent possible. At the same time, Watermaster is implementing aggressive groundwater-supply programs that include controlled overdraft and the possibility of causing head declines in areas prone to subsidence and fissuring. The groundwater-supply programs must also address the subsidence and fissuring phenomena.\nFrom 2001 to 2005, Watermaster conducted a technical investigation to characterize the extent, rate, and mechanisms of subsidence and fissuring. The investigation employed InSAR and ground-level surveying of benchmarks to monitor ground-surface deformation, and borehole extensometers and piezometric monitoring to establish the relationships between groundwater production, piezometric levels, and aquifer-system deformation.\nBased on the results of the investigation, Watermaster developed: (i) subsidence-management criteria for the areas experiencing acute subsidence and fissuring, and (ii) an adaptive management program to minimize the potential for future subsidence and fissuring across the entire Chino Basin. The science-based program includes ongoing monitoring, which now includes sophisticated fissure-monitoring techniques, data analysis, annual reporting, and adjustment to the program as warranted by the data.",

            "abstract": "We present an extensive hydrologic and reactive transport analysis of the Little Grand Wash fault zone (LGWF), a natural analog of fault-associated leakage from an engineered CO2 repository. Injecting anthropogenic CO2 into the subsurface is suggested for climate change mitigation. However, leakage of CO2 from its target storage formation into unintended areas is considered as a major risk involved in CO2 sequestration. In the event of leakage, permeability in leakage pathways like faults may get sealed (reduced) due to precipitation or enhanced (increased) due to dissolution reactions induced by CO2-enriched water, thus influencing migration and fate of the CO2. We hypothesize that faults which act as leakage pathways can seal over time in presence of CO2-enriched waters. An example of such a fault ‘self-sealing’ is found in the LGWF near Green River, Utah in the Paradox basin, where fault outcrop shows surface and sub-surface fractures filled with calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The LGWF cuts through multiple reservoirs and seal layers piercing a reservoir of naturally occurring CO2, allowing it to leak into overlying aquifers. As the CO2-charged water from shallower aquifers migrates towards atmosphere, a decrease in pCO2 leads to supersaturation of water with respect to CaCO3, which precipitates in the fractures of the fault damage zone. In order to test the nature, extent and time-frame of the fault sealing, we developed reactive flow simulations of the LGWF. Model parameters were chosen based on hydrologic measurements from literature. Model geochemistry was constrained by water analysis of the adjacent Crystal Geyser and observations from a scientific drilling test conducted at the site. Precipitation of calcite in the top portion of the fault model led to a decrease in the porosity value of the damage zone, while clay precipitation led to a decrease in the porosity value of the fault core. We found that the results were sensitive to the fault architecture, relative permeability functions, kinetic parameters for mineral reactions and treatment of molecular diffusion. Major conclusions from this analysis are that a failed (leaking) engineered sequestration site may behave very similar to the LGWF and that under similar conditions some faults are likely to seal over time.",

            "abstract": "Multidisciplinary research has long sought the ability to estimate the parameters of plant functions such as photosynthetic capacity under stress conditions from remotely sensed data. Yet, the main goal has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of saline water irrigation and the rate of fertilizer application on the photosynthetic response of wheat in a greenhouse based experiment. After two weeks of germination, the plants were subjected to irrigation with sea water blended with high quality reverse osmosis (RO) water. Three levels of water salinity having electrical conductivities (EC) of 0.3, 7.0, 14.0 dSm-1 were obtained by mixing sea water with RO water and plants were irrigated to approximately 70% of field capacity without excess drainage. Three levels of NPK fertilizer at the rate of null, half and full recommended doses were also employed in the experiment. The two key determinants of photosynthetic capacity, the maximum rates of RuBP carboxylation (Vcmax) and the maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport based on NADPH requirement (Jmax), were obtained through standard gas exchange technique.CO2 response curves of net CO2 assimilation (An) against variable CO2 concentrations in the intracellular spaces (Ci) at constant environmental conditions were drawn and a Sharkey model was fit to the obtained data. Hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 350-2500 nm) of fresh leaves were obtained and the hyperspectral characteristics and their correlations with the photosynthetic parameters were drawn. Unique contributions from different spectral regions of the hyperspectral data were analyzed. Our results revealed that saline irrigation adversely affects some of the biochemical photosynthetic parameters while favors others and it can be reflected in shifts in patterns at various regions of the hyperspectral data. These results suggest a promising strategy for developing remote sensing methods to characterize photosynthetic activity of stress plants on regional scale. However, further investigations are needed to ascertain the interpretation of hyperspectral data to estimate the photosynthetic capacity of plants grown under stress environment.",

            "abstract": "The coverage, design, operation and monitoring capabilities of the strong ground motion program at the Institute of Engineering (IE) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) is presented. Started in 1952, the seismic instrumentation intended initially to bolster earthquake engineering projects in Mexico City has evolved into the largest strong ground motion monitoring system in the region. Today, it provides information not only to engineering projects, but also to the near real-time risk mitigation systems of the country, and enhances the general understanding of the effects and causes of earthquakes in Mexico.   The IE network includes more than 100 free-field stations and several buildings, covering the largest urban centers and zones of significant seismicity in Central Mexico. Of those stations, approximately one-fourth send the observed acceleration to a processing center in Mexico City continuously, and the rest require either periodic visits for the manual recovery of the data or remote interrogation, for later processing and cataloging. In this research, we document the procedures and telecommunications systems used systematically to recover information. Additionally, we analyze the spatial distribution of the free-field accelerographs, the quality of the instrumentation, and the recorded ground motions. The evaluation criteria are based on the: 1) uncertainty in the generation of ground motion parameter maps due to the spatial distribution of the stations, 2) potential of the array to provide localization and magnitude estimates for earthquakes with magnitudes greater than Mw 5, and 3) adequacy of the network for the development of Ground Motion Prediction Equations due to intra-plate and intra-slab earthquakes.   We conclude that the monitoring system requires a new redistribution, additional stations, and a substantial improvement in the instrumentation and telecommunications. Finally, we present an integral plan to improve the current network's monitoring capabilities.",

Analysing the influence of urban form on intra-urban temperature dynamics could be a helpful way of reducing its negative consequences. Also, it would help untangle the urban effect from the effect caused by atmospheric conditions. The present paper presents the effect of atmospheric conditions as exemplified by atmospheric stability (modified Pasquill-Gifford-Turner classification system) and urban morphology as measured by the Sky View Factor (SVF) on intra-urban variations in air temperature in a cold climate city, in and around the mature urban area of Glasgow, UK (55° 51' 57.294\"N, 4° 15' 0.2628\"W). The aim is to highlight their combined importance and to make preliminary investigations on the local warming effect of urban morphology under specific atmospheric stability classes. The present work indicates that the maximum intra-urban temperature differences (i.e. temperature difference between the coolest and the warmest spots in a given urban region) is strongly correlated with atmospheric stability. The spatial patterns in local temperature variations consistently show that water bodies and urban parks have lower temperature variations. Thus, greenery and urban materials could play an important role in influencing the local climate in cold cities. The knowledge of urban morphology’s influence on local temperature variations could be an important tool for devising appropriate planning/design strategies to face urban overheating in the coming years as the background climate continues to warm.",

            "abstract": "Glyoxal (C2H2O2) is a ubiquitous small molecule that is observed in the terrestrial biogenic, urban, marine and arctic atmosphere. It forms secondary organic aerosol (SOA) as a result of multiphase chemical reactions in water. The rate of these reactions is controlled by the effective Henry’s law partitioning coefficient (Heff) which is enhanced in the presence of inorganic salts by up to 3 orders of magnitude (Kampf et al., 2013, ES&T). Aerosol particles are among the most concentrated salt solutions on Earth and the SOA formation rate in aerosol water is strongly modified by this ‘salting-in’ mechanism. We have studied the effect of gas-phase ammonia on the rate of SOA formation in real particles composed of different inorganic salts (sulfate, nitrate, chloride). A series of simulation chamber experiments were conducted at the Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland during Summer 2013. The SOA formation rate in experiments with added gas-phase ammonia (NH3) was found to be greatly accelerated compared to experiments without added NH3. Product analysis of particles included online HR-ToF-AMS and offline nano-DESI and LC-MS. We find that imidazole-like oligomer compounds dominate the observed products, rather than high-O/C oligomers containing solely C, H, and O. We further employed isotopically labelled di-substituted 13C glyoxal experiments in order to unambiguously link product formation to glyoxal (and separate it from chamber wall contamination). We present a molecular perspective on the reaction pathways and evaluate the effect of environmental parameters (RH, particle pH, seed chemical composition) on the formation of these imidazole-like oligomer compounds. The implications for SOA formation from photosensitized oxidation chemistry is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Low albedo streaks on Martian slopes have been cited as possible evidence for present-day intermittent and repeated surface flow of water, or brine (Mushkin et al., 2010). Also termed as Recurring Slope Lineae (1), such streaks can grow, fade, and recur repeatedly on the same slopes. Although distinguishable by being darker than surrounding terrain slope streaks have no diagnostic spectral absorption features (2). A leading hypothesis is formation by multiple wetting and drying events. Laboratory investigations have previously explored this possibility (e.g 3). When wetted with brines, soils darken, but as the sample dries, it brightens again. Wetting also results in absorption bands near 1.5 and 2 microns, which are not detected in spectra of slope streaks. Additionally, dried brines of most salts such as MgSO4, or other sulfates and many chlorides are brighter than Martian soils. However, iron chlorides are a salt that have lower albedo than most other salts and may present a mechanism for darkening slope streaks without inducing a spectral absorption feature. To explore this hypothesis, we have begun to conduct experiments investigating the spectra of iron chloride chloride solutions wetting palagonite and subsequently drying under Martian atmospheric conditions. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that FeIII chloride dried onto palagonite has no absorption features in the NIR and SWIR and remains dark and red. However, these chlorides will oxidize under terrestrial conditions forming Fe2O3 as they dry. We have constructed an environmental chamber that mimics Martian oxygen fugacity though a combination of vacuum and N2 purging, allowing for sample wetting and drying while concurrently taking spectra from 0.4 to 2.4 microns.

            "abstract": "The core location of my research project was the Arabuko Sokoke Forest. The forest is located along the east coast of Kenya and belongs to the coastal forest zone of eastern Africa. The forest is considered a biodiversity hotspot, having many species being endemic to this habitat. The Arabuko Sokoke Forest is not a rainforest, like the Kakamega Forest in western Kenya, but a tropical dry forest. The objective of my research was to create a general checklist of the ant species collected in teh Arabuko Sokoke Forest in 2009. The general checklist of ant species will be used to document the differences between the three different forest habitat types (Cynometra, Brachystegia and mixed forest) and ant communities found within the forest, as well as the fauna found in those locations. The ants were collected using the leaf litter extraction method and were then mounted and idenified. The results from my research were that out of 73 specimens, there were 13 genera and 24 different species. Four of the 24 species have not been recorded for this forest before and one of the Tetramorium is likely to be a new species. The results also showed that the species diversity on the two transects are almost the same. There was very low overlap between the two transects as well: there were two shared species between the two different forest habitat types. For future work, there are still many undiscovered ant species in the Arabuko Sokoke Forest. In order to get a more complete faunal overview, more samples have to be collected from different parts of the forest. To do this, the canopy ant fauna might offer additional species that were not collected in the leaf litter samples.",

            "abstract": "Determining the internal structure of the solar system’s gas and ice giant planets is key to understanding their formation and evolution (Hubbard et al., 1999, 2002, Guillot 2005), and in turn the formation and evolution of the solar system. While internal structure can be constrained theoretically, measurements of internal density distributions are needed to uncover the details of the deep interior where significant ambiguities exist. To date the interiors of giant planets have been probed by measuring gravitational moments using spacecraft passing close to, or in orbit around the planet. Gravity measurements are effective in determining structure in the outer envelope of a planet, and also probing dynamics (e.g. the Cassini and Juno missions), but are less effective in probing deep structure or the presence of discrete boundaries.\nA promising technique for overcoming this limitation is planetary seismology (analogous to helioseismology in the solar case), postulated by Vorontsov, 1976. Using trapped pressure waves to probe giant planet interiors allows insight into the density and temperature distribution (via the sound speed) down to the planetary core, and is also sensitive to sharp boundaries, for example at the molecular to metallic hydrogen transition or at the core-envelope interface. Detecting such boundaries is not only important in understanding the overall structure of the planet, but also has implications for our understanding of the basic properties of matter at extreme pressures. Recent Doppler measurements of Jupiter by Gaulme et al (2011) claimed a promising detection of trapped oscillations, while Hedman and Nicholson (2013) have shown that trapped waves in Saturn cause detectable perturbations in Saturn’s C ring. Both these papers have fueled interest in using seismology as a tool for studying the solar system’s giant planets. To fully exploit planetary seismology as a tool for understanding giant planet structure, measurements need to be made from space, however, much can be learned about Jupiter and Saturn using ground-based measurements.\nWe will present the first results from a ground-based observing campaign of Jupiter and Saturn, made from the Bok 90” telescope on Kitt Peak, intended to validate the work of Gaulme et al, and extend such observations to Saturn.",

            "abstract": "On Earth, meandering streams occur where the banks are resistant to erosion, which enhances narrow and deep channels. Often this is because the stream banks are held firm by vegetation. The ancient, highly sinuous channels with cutoffs found on Mars are enigmatic because vegetation played no role in providing bank cohesion and enhancing fine sediment deposition. Possible causes of the meandering therefore include ice under permafrost conditions and chemical processes. We conducted carbonate flume experiments to investigate possible mechanisms creating meandering channels other than vegetation. The experiment includes a tank that dissolves limestone by adding CO2 gas and produces artificial spring water, peristaltic pumps to drive water through the system, a heater to control the temperature of the spring water, and a flume where carbonate sediment deposits. Spring water containing dissolved calcium and carbonate ions moves through a heater to increase temperature, and then into the flume. The flume surface is open to the air to allow CO2 degassing, decrease temperature, and increase pH, which promotes carbonate precipitation. A preliminary experiment was done and successfully created a meander pattern that evolved over a 3-day experiment. The experiment showed lateral migration of the bend and avulsion of the stream, similar to a natural meander. The lateral variation in flow speed increased the local residence time of water, thus increasing the degassing of CO2 on the two sides of the flow and promoting more precipitation. This enhanced precipitation on the sides provided a mechanism to build levees along the channel and created a stream confined in a narrow path. This mechanism also potentially applies to Earthly single thread and/or meandering rivers developed and recorded before vegetation appeared on Earth’s surface.",

            "abstract": "Panamint Valley lies within the Owens River system which linked southeastern Sierra Nevada basins between Mono Lake and Death Valley during glacial-pluvial times. Previous work indicates that late Pleistocene glacial-pluvial Lake Gale, Panamint Valley was an open system during OIS-6, a closed ground water supported shallow lake during OIS-4, and the terminal lake basin for the Owens River system during OIS-2. We here report the first occurrence of fossil fish from the Plio-Pleistocene Panamint basin. Fish remains are present in late Pleistocene OIS-6 nearshore deposits associated with a highstand that was spillway limited at Wingate Wash. The deposits contain small minnow-sized remains from both Siphateles or Gila sp. (chubs) and Catostomus sp. (suckers) from at least four locations widely dispersed in the basin. Siphateles or Gila sp. and Catostomus are indigenous to the Pleistocene and modern Owens River system, in particular to the historic Owens Lake area. Cyprinodon (pupfish) and Rhinichthys (dace) are known from the modern Amargosa River and from Plio-Pleistocene deposits in Death Valley to the east. The late Pleistocene OIS-6 to OIS-2 lacustrine and paleohydrologic record in Panamint basin is interpreted from ostracod assemblages, relative abundance of Artemia sp. pellets, shallow water indicators including tufa fragments, ruppia sp. fragments and the relative abundance of charophyte gyrogonites obtained from archived core, as well as faunal assemblages from paleoshoreline and nearshore deposits. The OIS-4 groundwater supported shallow saline lake had sufficiently low ratios of alkalinity to calcium (alk/Ca) to support the occurrence of exotic Elphidium sp. (?) foraminfera which are not observed in either OIS-2 or OIS-6 lacustrine deposits. The arrival of Owens River surface water into Panamint Basin during OIS-2 is recorded by the first appearance of the ostracod Limnocythere sappaensis at ~27 m depth in an ~100 m archived core (Smith and Pratt, 1957) which extends between OIS-5 and post OIS-2 based on based on proxy correlation with the marine oxygen isotope record.",

            "abstract": "Tharsis formed early in the history of Mars, likely during the Noachian but later than the hemispheric crustal dichotomy that it partially overprints (Johnson and Phillips, 2005; Solomon et al., 2005; Wenzel et al., 2004). It has been suggested that the crustal dichotomy may have been formed by a giant impact (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2008; Marinova et al., 2008; Nimmo et al., 2008). Several models have been proposed to explain a localized orogeny, but predict multiple, evenly-spaced plumes or have instability growth and rise times which are longer than Tharsis formation. We use fluid dynamic experiments to model the differentiation process during Mars accretion using low viscosity glucose syrup solutions and an emulsion of liquid gallium for the metal-rich magma ocean and a high viscosity glucose syrup for the mantle. Our experiments demonstrate the formation of metal-silicate diapirs from metal emulsion drops that form a pond at the base of the magma ocean. The diapirs descend through the underlying mantle with trailing conduit of low viscosity silicate material. The silicate material is buoyant and eventually ascends back through the conduit. Remaining emulsion drops that do not adhere with the diapir fall through the conduit, forcing the buoyant molten silicate material to exit the conduit laterally and ascend along a new trajectory. The time elapsed between diapir formation and ascent of the chemical plume in experiments scales with the time between the formation of the crustal dichotomy on Mars and the formation of Tharsis. Our model offers an explanation for the rapid formation of Tharsis on the edge of the crustal dichotomy via a single large upwelling event followed by smaller upwellings producing and the late stages of effusive volcanism observed in the Tharsis region.",

            "abstract": "Increased streamflow in many southern and west-central Minnesota rivers in recent decades has contributed to higher rates of streambank erosion. Some rivers in the region have experienced a doubling of mean annual flow in the past 30 years, yet the relative importance of changes in climate and land-use, and increases in sub-surface drainage to these flow increases is undetermined. We used oxygen and hydrogen isotopes, specific conductivity, nutrient ratios from riparian zone wells, stream erosion measurements and groundwater seepage surveys to assess the sources of water contributing to streamflow, the mechanisms of streambank collapse and the spatial distribution of streambank collapse in the main channels of three rural Minnesota watersheds. By volume most of the water in these streams is sourced from sub-surface drainage. Surface runoff events are rare and concentrated in the spring and fall. Fluvial erosion undercuts the toe of banks during high flow, thus decreasing bank stability, which then leads to a mass collapse after the hydrograph recedes. While most erosion occurs at high flow events, subsurface drainage may add to the peak of high streamflow events by increasing the initial stage of the hydrograph, particularly in the spring months of April-June. Monitoring wells within the riparian zone of two streams in west-central Minnesota showed that reaches of the streams may be gaining or losing depending on season and water stage. Loss of water to streambank storage may be substantial in regions with intermittent flow and permeable streambanks in late summer to fall. Groundwater seepage was very sporadic longitudinally and laterally along the study rivers yet is important for aquatic life health. Seepage occurred primarily low in the soil profile and was not a major contributor to mass wasting of banks, though it is thought to be a bigger factor in ravine and bluff erosion where different strata are exposed. The study points to the dynamic nature of riparian zone hydrologic dynamics both spatially and temporally within rivers of the region. Further research into the processes discussed here is needed to better understand riparian zone hydrology and management issues in streams of the north-central U.S. that border on the semi-arid climate zone.",

            "abstract": "The particle, rock and boulder size distribution of a planetary surface bring important implications not only to crucial aspects of future missions but also to the better understanding of planetary and earth sciences. By exploiting a novel statistical model, the evolution of particle fragmentation phenomena can be understood in terms of a descriptive maturity index, a measure of the number of fragmentation events that have produced the soil. This statistical model, which is mathematically constructed via fundamental physical principles, has been validated by terrestrial mineral grinding data and impact experiments.\nApplying the model to planetary surfaces, the number of fragmentation events is determined by production function curves that quantify the degree of impact cratering. The model quantifies the variation of the maturity index of the regolith with depth, with a high maturity index at the surface decreasing to a low index corresponding to the megaregolith of a blocky population and fractured bedrock. The measured lunar and martian particle size distributions at the surface is well matched by the model over several orders of magnitude. The continuous transition invoked by the model can be furthermore synthesised to provide temporal and spatial visualisations of the internal architecture of the Martian and Lunar regolith.\nFinally, the model is applied to the risk assessment and success criteria of future mission landings as well as drilling on planetary surfaces. The solutions to a variety of planetary fragmentation related problems can be found via exact mathematical foundations or through simulations using the particle population provided by the model’s maturation.",

            "abstract": "The subglacial chemical weathering environment is characterized by low temperatures and the hydrolysis and carbonation of freshly comminuted mineral surfaces. Such conditions motivate the hypothesis that relatively low silica fluxes should be found in glacierized basins. Additionally, it is often assumed that glacier meltwaters are far from saturation and that the water chemistry is controlled solely by the dissolution of primary silicates and trace quantities of sulphide and carbonate minerals. Alternatively, we propose that the formation of secondary minerals and precipitates in the delayed drainage system play an important role in controlling the low silica fluxes observed in subglacial envrionments.\nBorehole and proglacial meltwater samples were collected from a polythermal surge-type glacier overlying granodiorite bedrock in the St. Elias Mountains of Yukon, Canada. The meltwater chemistry, along with the mineralogy of the bedrock and suspended sediments indicate the presence of mineral precipitation accompanied by substantial basal freeze-on. This is supported by field evidence of debris rich basal ice at the terminus and at the base of a borehole. The surplus of Cl- above the supraglacial input is used to calculate the amount of basal freeze-on in the delayed drainage system, and the amount of mixing between the delayed and fast drainage systems. We use Geochemist’s Workbench for reaction path modelling with a focus on the silica composition to simulate the chemical evolution of glacial meltwater from (1) the initial water rock contact, (2) basal freeze on, and (3) mixing and post mixing reactions. Unless there is a substantial degree of non-stoichiometric dissolution, we find that the observed proglacial water chemistry at the terminus is largely controlled by the hydrochemistry of water in the delayed drainage system. Lastly, we use this model to explore the relationship between the proglacial water chemistry and the daily glacier surface velocities for the period of July, 2013, with an eye to identifying a relationship between water chemistry and short-term glacier dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The Curiosity rover spent sols 606-630 analyzing an outcrop in a region dubbed the Kimberley. Three rock targets at this location were found to have Mn concentrations strongly elevated above that of martian primary crust: Stephen (sols 611, 619, 630), Neil (sol 619), and Mondooma (sol 625). Stephen and Neil are adjacent to one another and appear as more resistant, fin-like layers subparallel to sedimentary bedding, and are interpreted as bedding-parallel mineralized fractures. Mondooma is located in the same bedrock unit a few meters away and has a similar geological context. After dust cleaning by ChemCam, Stephen and Neil exhibited dark, shiny surfaces. The dust-cleared surface of Mondooma is also dark and exhibits an angular, shallow fracture pattern. ChemCam observations indicate high Mn concentrations (~20-40 wt% MnO) for all three targets in which Mn abundances are higher in the first shots and decrease systematically with succeeding shots (i.e. increasing depths). The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) also analyzed Stephen (sols 627, 629) and observed elevated manganese abundances (~4 wt% MnO) that are the highest detected by that instrument in Gale thus far. APXS data show that Stephen also exhibits relatively high Ni abundances (~1000 ppm) that correlate with Mn. The difference between the two instruments’ measurements is likely due to differences in interaction volumes and footprint areas (1.7 cm APXS versus ~400 μm ChemCam). In addition to these three high Mn targets, other fin-like features are observed throughout the unit. Based on morphology and chemistry, these thin Mn-rich fins likely represent fracture-filling authigenic minerals emplaced by secondary fluids percolating through the strata. The appearance and correlation between Mn and Ni strongly suggest the presence of Mn-oxide phase(s). Mn-oxides are important because they require extremely strong oxidants and sufficient volumes of liquid water to form. Environments of Mn cycling on Earth are uniformly habitable and Mn-oxides provide for the microbial respiration of a wide variety of reduced compounds. Thus, these results suggest that Mars may have hosted a broader range of habitable environments than previously recognized.",

            "abstract": "Accurate knowledge of atmospheric greenhouse gas CO2 and CH4 concentrations and fluxes is a key element of current climate change research. Methane (CH4) is the third most important greenhouse gas (GHG) in the atmosphere after water vapour (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), and the second anthropogenic GHG after CO2.\nMERLIN (The Methane Remote Sensing Lidar Mission) is a new Franco-German (CNES and DLR) space borne Lidar mission initiated late 2009, now in Phase B, for global monitoring of atmospheric methane (CH4) the second anthropogenic greenhouse gas. The two national agencies CNES and DLR, the French Space Agency and German Space Administration, respectively, set up jointly to bodies: a Group Project and a Science Advisory Group, to drive the mission development until achievement.\nThe MERLIN mission is based on a small satellite. The launch is foreseen in 2019 for 3 years operation. The space segment consists of the new platform product line named MYRIADE Evolutions (total mass) developed under CNES control, and an advanced IPDA (Integrated Path Differential Absorption) Lidar instrument under DLR responsibility to be developed by ASTRIUM Germany.\nThe 1st science objective is to provide a significant improvement on retrieval of CH4 fluxes at synoptic scales, which in turn calls for 1% accuracy on CH4 column averaged air dry-mixing ratio (XCH4) at a 50 km horizontal resolution. A second objective is to contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric chemistry at global scale.\nA first prototype has been developed to process the raw lidar signal that will be delivered by the MERLIN lidar instrument. This last will allow the extraction of the XCH4 concentration and corresponding weighting function. These two parameters will allow to determine the map of the radiative transfers due to CH4 concentration. Here, we will present the breakdown of the level 2 performance (on XCH4) into major contributors.\nTo complete these objectives, and due to the lack of real datasets before the launch of the MERLIN mission, we develop a MERLIN data simulator, called LIDSIM, allowing us to make some tests on the MERLIN data processor, and characterize the expected performances of this last before the launch. The Lidar Signals Simulator module is composed of 3 sub modules: the Geometry, the Scene Generation and the Instrument.",

            "abstract": "Plate tectonics initiation has been simulated by convection with yield stress, which is a simplification that can be linked to brittle failure or mechanisms that reduce the strength of the lithosphere. Convection with yield stress is usually occurs in one of the three regimes: mobile lid regime, transitional regime with some episodic failure, and stagnant lid regime. These convective regimes can be recognized as the stable and unstable states of convection behavior. Steady-state stagnant lid convection is a stable state, and the yield stress can be considered as a control parameter that alters the stability. Below a critical value, instability will emerge as the lithosphere is sufficiently weakened. This critical value, which is termed the critical yield stress, can be understood as the bifurcation point where the dynamics of convection changes such that it deviates from the stable stagnant lid regime to a new state. For the lithosphere to become unstable, convective stresses will have to overcome the yield stress. Therefore in estimating the critical yield stress, we have to assess the magnitude of convective stresses. The width of convecting cells is a major factor in determining lithospheric stresses. At high Rayleigh numbers, convection is chaotic and the width of the individual subcell fluctuates with time. We observe that for a given set of parameters with the same yield stress but different initial states, the time of failure is different. We inspect these fluctuations and their effects on convective stresses. We find that even if the convective stresses in the lid is not high enough to cause subduction right away, the convective cells may evolve to a configuration in which the lid stresses are sufficiently large to overcome the yield stress. Our results show that it is important to address not only the question of whether plate tectonics can occur on a planet but also the probability that it will occur within a certain time after planetary formation.",

We selected large SEP events, which showed intensity enhancements in the >500 MeV and >700 MeV GOES energy channels. A study of cycle 24 and the first half of cycle 23 ground level enhancements (GLEs) by Gopalswamy et al. 2014 showed that typically, SEP events with intensity enhancement at >700 MeV have been associated with GLEs. We have extended the survey to cover the whole cycle 23. Our preliminary survey confirms this to be true for all except for three cases. There were two GLEs (1998/05/06 and 2006/12/06) for which a clear increase in >700 MeV protons was not observed by GOES. There was one high energy SEP event (2000/11/08), for which GOES observed >700 MeV protons but no GLE was produced. Here we compare all the high-energy particle events from cycles 23 and 24 with GLEs. We also compare energy spectra of all high-energy SEP events with those that produced GLEs.\nWork supported by NASA’s Living with a Star Program.\nRef.: Gopalswamy et al. 2014, GRL, 41, 2673",

The team successfully produced ionospheric electron density profiles and continues to operate the CanX-2 GPS payload and collect reliable data six years into the mission. Recently the University of Calgary partnered with Spire to develop low-cost atmospheric sounding methods based on GNSS radio occultations for nanosatellite platforms. The rapidly increasing capabilities on nanosatellites with regards to power production, pointing accuracy and antenna sensitivities provide an ever more attractive platform to create relevant solutions for space and terrestrial weather data.\nThis paper describes future mission concepts and capabilities for multi-GNSS methods to generate high-resolution atmospheric profiles. Building on lessons learned from CanX-2, the system requirements are defined and recommendations made for efficient GNSS payload operations. New methods are assessed for multi-frequency multi-constellation GNSS radio occultation approaches. Software and hardware simulations are conducted for validation of proposed methods using appropriate receiver architectures. Analyses include signal tracking for LEO trajectories (and Dopplers) and high-precision navigation solutions. Initial data analysis is also presented for a miniaturized, multi-frequency, software-­defined GNSS receiver currently operating onboard Spire’s innovative CubeSat platform.",

This work presents in-situ aircraft measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration and derivations of aerosol hygroscopicity, water uptake, and light scattering. Aerosol hygroscopicity is derived from CCN and aerosol measurements. Inorganic water uptake is calculated from aerosol composition using ISORROPIA, a chemical thermodynamic model, while organic water uptake is calculated from organic hygroscopicity.

            "abstract": "We seek to understand the δ18O signal of n-alkanols, a biosynthetically similar compound group to the highly studied n-alkanes. Alkanols of >24 carbons are produced at the leaf level, incorporating a transpiration enriched oxygen and hydrogen signal. The use of δ18O as a proxy is of great interest because of the more simplistic biosynthetic sourcing of oxygen in lipids. Complete equilibration of organic and water bound oxygen atoms is achieved in the Calvin cycle (all oxygen atoms are at some point in an exchangeable carbonyl group). This leads to a uniform signal among oxygen atoms incorporated through photosynthesis. Although it is analytically useful, the larger abundance of hydrogen isotopes in the same molecule leads to a more ambiguous signal, especially when integrating through soils and sediments. This study stems from recent work in our lab, which has shown significant relationships between an applied evapotranspiration deficit and δ18O in bulk lipid (hexane) extracts of plant material. While it is exciting that bulk lipids show this relationship, it is critical to first demonstrate that the isotopic signal is stable in order to use the signal from preserved alkanols as an integrator in soils and sediments. In this experiment, we show for the first time that a series of n-alkanols do not exchange oxygen with environmental water. Moving forward we are developing methods to address the analytical challenges of measuring oxygen isotope ratios of these compounds. Once this is overcome, we will be able to measure δD, δ18O, and δ13C from a single compound in a homogenized sample. The end result will be an improvement in the ability to interpret changes in field scale evapotranspiration, moving from a 2 dimensional (δD and δ13C only) to 3 dimensional (i.e. the addition of δ18O) model. This will apply to both modern and paleohydrologic relationships, improving our ability to reconstruct and predict the impacts of water balance variability across spatiotemporal scales, especially in terrestrial environments.",

Information about the geological activities on and below a moons surface is contained in the types and amounts of organic and inorganic components embedded in the dominant surface material. The basic idea of the proposed compositional mapping [2] is that moons without an atmosphere are wrapped in clouds of dust particles (roughly micron sized) ejected by micro-meteroid impacts from the moons surfaces [1]. The composition of these dust particles can be analysed by an orbiter instrument. The ejecta particles move on ballistic trajectories and most of them recollide with the moon. As a consequence, an almost isotropic dust cloud forms around the moon. From the statistics of the particles in the cloud, one can constrain their location of origin on the surface. Thus, from their composition one can conclude, with given probability, on the composition of a certain part of the surface. In this way, recording a large sample of dust grains with an orbiter, it will be possible to resolve compositional variations on the surface and relate them to topological features.\n[1] Krueger et al., Nature, 399, 1999.\n[2] Postberg et al., Planetary and Space Science, 59, 2011.\n[3] Postberg et al., Nature, 459, 2009.\n[4] Postberg et al., Icarus, 183, 2006.",

            "abstract": "Space physics and aerospace engineering experiments are becoming readily accessible to STEM undergraduates. A number of ionospheric physics experiments and guidance and navigation components were designed, built, integrated, and tested by STEM students at West Virginia University in the 2013-2014 academic year. A main payload was flown on NASA’s annual RockSat-C two-stage rocket launched from Wallops Flight Facility in Chincoteague, VA on the morning of June 26, 2014. A high-altitude balloon with a reduced payload was released from Bruceton Mills, WV, prior to the rocket and reached 30,054 m. The geographic distance between the two launch points is small compared to the footprint of geomagnetic and solar-terrestrial disturbances. Aerospace sensors provided flight profiles for each of the two platforms. Daytime E region electron density was measured via a Langmuir probe as a function of altitude from 90 km to the apogee of 117 km. Geomagnetic activity was low (Dst>-7 nT, AE<500 nT) so geomagnetic disturbances were probably due to solar quiet (Sq) currents. Earlier solar wind activity included two high-plasma-density regions measured by NASA’s ACE which impacted the magnetosphere producing two sudden impulses at midlatitudes (Dst=+19 and +13 nT). In an airglow experiment, the altitude range of the sodium layer was estimated to be 75-110 km based on in situ measurements of the D2emission line intensity. Acceleration, rotation-rate, and magnetic-field data are useful in reconstructing the trajectory and flight dynamics of the two vehicles and comparing with video from onboard cameras.\nParticipation in RockSat and similar programs is useful in ushering space science and spaceflight concepts in the classroom and lab experience of STEM undergraduates.

            "abstract": "The biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) promoted by the cultivation of soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merrill], consists in a significant input of reactive nitrogen (N) in the system. The availability of this nutrient to plants occurs through the mineralization of organic-N of the soil, conducted by soil organic matter and / or crop residues. Thus, understanding the fate of this increased supply, as well as changes in the dynamics of N in the system is essential in the context of the recent expansion of soybean in the Amazon. This work aims to understand the dynamics of N in the soil cultivated with soybean, through the determination of ammonium and nitrate concentrations, as well as, mineralization and nitrification rates in soybean fields under till and no-till systems in the municipality of Santarém, Brazil. We collected 12 soil samples (0-10cm depth) in each crop and the extractions were done in 2M KCl solution using 10 g of soil. The samples were incubated for 7 days when new extractions were done to determine the rates of mineralization and nitrification. The till system showed higher concentrations of nitrate (0.82 ± 0.13 mg kg-1) and ammonium (8.15 ± 0.54 mg kg-1) compared to the results found in no-till system (0.59 ± 0.09 mg kg-1 and 5.25 ± 0.28 mg kg-1 for nitrate and ammonium respectively). The mineralization rates were negative in the till system, indicating possible immobilization of N in the soil during that period. In contrast, no-till system showed higher rates of mineralization in the soil. Although there is a great removal of N by grain harvest, it is possible to infer that no-till system has higher nitrogen availability to soybean and that this management could contribute to an increased productivity mainly due to deposition of crop residues enriched in N on the soil.",

            "abstract": "High temporal resolution data is required to take channel bed movement data beyond time integrated changes between measurements where many of the subtleties of bedload movement patterns are often missed. This study used continuous bedload scour sensors (flexible, fluid-filled pans connected to a pressure transducer) to collect high temporal resolution, long term bedload movement data for 4 high elevation (1500-1800 m) Sierra Nevada headwater streams draining 1 km2 catchments and to investigate the physical channel characteristics under which they perform best. Data collected by the scour sensors were used to investigate the disturbance and recovery patterns of these streams, to relate the observed patterns to channel bed stability, and to evaluate whether the channel bed is acting as a sediment source, sink, or storage across various temporal scales. Finally, attempts are made to identify discharge thresholds for bed movement from scour sensor and discharge data and to compare these threshold values to observed changes in the channel bed.\nBedload scour data, turbidity data, and stream discharge data were collected at 15 minute intervals for (WY 2011 to WY 2014), including both above average (2011) and below average (2012, 2013, 2014) water years. Bedload scour sensors were found to have a relatively high (60%) failure rate in these systems. In addition, they required in situ calibrations as the factory and laboratory calibrations did not translate well to the field deployments. Data from the working sensors, showed patterns of abrupt channel bed disturbance (scour and/or fill) on an hour to day temporal scale followed by gradual recovery on a day to month scale back to a stable equilibrium bed surface elevation. These observed patterns suggest the bed acts as a short term source or sink for sediment, but is roughly sediment neutral over longer time periods implying the changes in bed elevation are reflective of fluctuations in storage rather than a true source or sink. Overall, these sensors show promise for collecting continuous data for high gradient, forested, mountain streams. Additional benefits include their relatively low cost both monetarily (under $1000) and in labor compared to traditional methods as well as not requiring the trade-off between temporal resolution and length of study that traditional methods do.",

            "abstract": "Instrumental climate data, paleoclimate data, and climate models show that large volcanic eruptions cause significant global cooling by injecting reflective aerosols into the upper atmosphere, increasing planetary albedo (see Robock et al., 2000 and references therein). As such, these eruptions provide an empirical constraint on the relationship between radiative forcing and climatic response – a key uncertainty in numerical simulations of future climate change. However, the overall magnitude of a large eruption’s climatic effects, and their regional expression, remain highly uncertain, and are the subject of heated debate in the peer-reviewed literature (Robock et al., 2005; Timmreck et al., 2009; Mann et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2013; Anchukaitis et al., 2012). As the largest eruption of the last 2 million years, the Toba eruption ~74 thousand years before present (kybp) on Sumatra presents an opportunity to probe the climatic responses associated with a massive perturbation to the Earth’s radiative balance. Here we present trace metal as well as isotopic data from U/Th-dated stalagmites from Gunung Mulu National Park, in northern Borneo, across the Toba depth horizon. Previously published timeseries of stalagmite oxygen isotopes (Carolin et al., 2013) document a significant positive anomaly contemporaneous with the Toba super-eruption (interpreted as dry conditions at the site), but the degree to which Toba contributed to this anomaly has remained uncertain. We present new synchrotron-based micro x-ray fluorescence data showing the presence of distinct horizons in the Toba time interval with elevated concentrations of Fe, Mn, and Co, possibly indicating the presence of Toba ash in the samples. Working with an array of trace elements, we compare the stalagmite geochemistry in these horizons to the geochemistry of 1) distal ash samples from the Younger Toba Tuff (Smith et al., 2011), 2) clays isolated from the Gunung Mulu caves, and 3) depth horizons marked by brown layers and/or known hiatuses. We illustrate the promise of synchrotron-based fluorescence for identifying trace volcanic ash in stalagmites, with potentially broad applications in paleoclimate.",

JPSS replaced the afternoon orbit component and ground processing system of the old POES system managed by the NOAA. JPSS satellites will carry sensors designed to collect meteorological, oceanographic, climatological, and solar-geophysical observations of the earth, atmosphere, and space. The ground processing system for the JPSS is the Common Ground System (CGS), and provides command, control, and communications (C3), data processing and product delivery. CGS processes the data from the JPSS satellites to provide environmental data products (including Sensor Data Records (SDRs) and Environmental Data Records (EDRs)) to the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility.\nThe first satellite in the JPSS constellation, known as the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite, was launched on 28 October 2011. CGS is currently processing and delivering SDRs and EDRs for S-NPP and will continue through the lifetime of the JPSS program. The EDRs for S-NPP are undergoing an extensive Calibration and Validation (Cal/Val) campaign. Changes identified by the Cal/Val campaign are coming available for implementation into the operational system in support of both S-NPP and JPSS-1. Raytheon is supporting this effort through the development and use of tools, techniques, and processes designed to detect changes in product quality, identify root causes, and rapidly implement changes to the operational system to bring suspect products back into specification. This paper will describe the theoretical framework underpinning the analysis techniques, as well as the tools and processes used to support the cal/val effort.",

China has seen rapid population growth and economic development in the last fifty years, coupled with a rapid increase in environmental pollution. Freshwater ecosystems have been particularly affected. Lake Tai, China’s 3rd largest freshwater lake by volume, has seen a severe reduction in water quality since economic reforms began in the 1970s. Thus, significant interest for establishing riparian buffer strips in agricultural watersheds and freshwater systems within China is warranted. Eight 50 m x 20 m plots adjacent to a rice-phragmites farm were cleared within the Lake Tai basin region in Jiangsu Province, China. Seven plots were planted with either a Poplar hybrid, Cypress hybrid or a combination of both at varying densities, while the control and final plot allowed only for local vegetation to grow naturally. Soil, tree and groundwater samples were collected from all plots and analyzed for nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. At this time in the study, results have been analyzed only for nitrogen concentrations using the ANOVA procedure. Results for both nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are currently being analyzed.",

            "abstract": "The knowledge of stress field is fundamental not only to understand driving forces and plate deformation but also in the study of intraplate seismicity. In Brazil, the stress field has been determined mainly using focal mechanisms and a breakout data and in-situ measurements. However, the stress field still is poorly known in Brazil.\nWe show a recent compilation of focal mechanism determined in Brazil (Fig 1). The focal mechanisms of some recent earthquakes (magnitude lower than 5 mb) were studied using waveform modeling. We stacked the record of several teleseismic stations (> 30°) with a good signal/noise ratio and we grouped then according to distance and azimuth.\nWith the focal mechanisms available in literature and those obtained in this work, we were able to identify some patterns: the central region shows compressional pattern (E-W SHmax), which is predicted by regional theoretical models ( Coblentz & Richardson, 1996 and the TD0 model of Lithgow & Bertelloni, 2004). This compression is mainly due to the interaction of tectonic plate forces.\nMeanwhile in the Amazon region, we find an indication of SHMax oriented in the SE-NW direction, probably caused by the Caribbean plate interaction (Meijer, 1995) and Amazon Fan, we have flexural stresses caused by sedimentary load with is in agreement with local theoretical models (Watts et al., 2009) . In northern coastal region, the compression rotates following the coastline, which indicates an important local component related to spreading effects at the continental/oceanic transition (Assumpção, 1998).\nWe determine the focal mechanism of several events in Brazil using different techniques according to the available data. The major difficulty is to determine focal mechanism of low magnitudes events (< 5.0 mb) using distant or few seismograph stations. We find examples of stress perturbations induced by local effects (e.g. flexure and continental spreading). The results of this work should be useful for future numerical modeling of global/regional intraplate stress field.",

            "abstract": "The principles of Integrated Water Resource Management outline the importance of stakeholder participation in water management processes, but in practice, there is a lack of meaningful engagement in water planning and implementation, and participation is often limited to public consultation and education. When models are used to support water planning, stakeholders are usually not involved in their development and use, and the models commonly fail to represent important feedbacks between socio-economic and physical processes.\nThis paper presents the development of holistic models of the Du Chêne basin in Quebec, and the Rechna Doab basin in Pakistan, that simulate socio-economic and physical processes related to, respectively, water quality management, and soil salinity management. The models each consists of two sub-components: a System Dynamics (SD) model, and a physically based model. The SD component was developed in collaboration with key stakeholders in the basins. The Du Chêne SD model was coupled with a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, while the Rechna Doab SD model was coupled with SahysMod, a soil salinity model.\n The coupled models were used to assess the environmental and socio-economic impacts of different management scenarios proposed by stakeholders.\nResults indicate that coupled SD – physically-based models can be used as effective tools for participatory water planning and implementation. The participatory modeling process provides a structure for meaningful stakeholder engagement, and the models themselves can be used to transparently and coherently assess and compare different management options.",

The Great Sumatra Earthquake also highlighted the need for tsunami warning systems in other ocean basins. Instruments for recording earthquakes and sea-level data useful for tsunami monitoring did not exist outside of the Pacific Ocean in 2004. Seismometers were few in number, and even fewer were high-quality long period broadband instruments. Nor was much of their data made available to the US tsunami warning centers (TWCs). In 2004 the US TWCs relied exclusively on instrumentation provided and maintained by IRIS and the USGS for areas outside of the Pacific.\nSince 2004, the US TWCs and their partners have made substantial improvements to seismic and sea-level monitoring networks with the addition of new and better instruments, densification of existing networks, better communications infrastructure, and improved data sharing among tsunami warning centers. In particular, the number of sea-level stations transmitting data in near real-time and the amount of seismic data available to the tsunami warning centers has more than tripled. The DART network that consisted of a half-dozen Pacific stations in 2004 now totals nearly 60 stations worldwide.\nEarthquake and tsunami science has progressed as well. It took nearly three weeks to obtain the first reliable estimates of the 2004 Sumatra Earthquake’s magnitude. Today, thanks to improved seismic networks and modern computing power, TWCs use the W-phase seismic moment method to determine accurate earthquake magnitudes and focal mechanisms for great earthquakes within 25 minutes. TWC scientists have also leveraged these modern computers to generate tsunami forecasts in a matter of minutes.\nProgress towards a global tsunami warning system has been substantial and today fully-functioning TWCs protect most of the world’s coastlines. These improvements have also led to a substantial reduction of time required by the TWCs to detect, locate, and assess the tsunami threat from earthquakes occurring worldwide.",

            "abstract": "Deterministic snow accumulation and ablation simulation models are widely used by runoff managers throughout the world to predict runoff quantities and timing. Model fitting is typically based on matching modeled runoff volumes and timing with observed flow time series at a few points in the basin. In recent decades, sparse networks of point measurements of the mountain snowpacks have been available to compare with modeled snowpack, but the comparability of results from a snow sensor or course to model polygons of 5 to 50 sq. km is suspect. However, snowpack extent, depth, and derived snow water equivalent have been produced by the NASA/JPL Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) mission for spring of 20013 and 2014 in the Tuolumne River basin above Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. These high-resolution snowpack data have exposed the weakness in a model calibration based on runoff alone. The U.S. Geological Survey's Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) calibration that was based on 30-years of inflow to Hetch Hetchy produces reasonable inflow results, but modeled spatial snowpack location and water quantity diverged significantly from the weekly measurements made by ASO during the two ablation seasons. The reason is that the PRMS model has many flow paths, storages, and water transfer equations, and a calibrated outflow time series can be right for many wrong reasons. The addition of a detailed knowledge of snow extent and water content constrains the model so that it is a better representation of the actual watershed hydrology. The mechanics of recalibrating PRMS to the ASO measurements will be described, and comparisons in observed versus modeled flow for both a small subbasin and the entire Hetch Hetchy basin will be shown. The recalibrated model provided a bitter fit to the snowmelt recession, a key factor for water managers as they balance declining inflows with demand for power generation and ecosystem releases during the final months of snow melt runoff.",

            "abstract": "Channel morphology and dynamics strongly influence fish populations in running waters by defining habitat template for movement, spawning, incubation, and foraging. In this research we adopted a modeling approach to investigate how body size controls the relationship between salmonid fish and their foraging habitat in streams. Body size is a fundamental ecological parameter which affects resource acquisition, locomotory costs, metabolic rates, and competitive abilities. We focus on two specific questions. First, we examined how distinct types of channel morphology and associated flow fields shape specific growth potential for different body size classes of trout. Second, we modeled these fish-habitat relationships in a size-structured population in the presence of intraspecific competition. In the latter scenario, fish may not be able to occupy energetically optimal foraging habitat and the predicted specific growth potential may differ from the intrinsic habitat quality. To address the research questions, we linked a 2D hydrodynamic model with a bioenergetic foraging model for drift-feeding trout. Net energy intake, simulated for four study reaches with different channel morphology, was converted into maps of specific growth rate potential. We extended this model by including a component that enabled us to estimate territory size for fish of a given body size and account for the effects of competition on spatial distribution of fish. The predictions that emerge from our simulations highlight that fish body size is an important factor that determines the relationship between channel morphology and the quality of foraging habitat. The results also indicate that distinct types of channel morphology may give rise to different energetic conditions for different body size classes of drift-feeding salmonids.",

            "abstract": "The Azores are a volcanic archipelago located 1500km west of Lisbon, Portugal in the North Atlantic Ocean. A 2351 meter dormant volcano lies on the 447 km2island of Pico with a population of around 15,000. Its location and orography are such that the summit typically lies above the well mixed marine boundary layer. A station was established in the caldera of the volcano at 2225 m by the late Dr. Richard Honrath in collaboration with the University of the Azores and began collecting data in 2001. A seven-wavelength aethalometer was employed to measure the black carbon equivalent mass concentration in the free troposphere since then. In 2012 a three wavelength nephelometer was added to measure total light scattering and back scattering due to aerosol. In 2013 an optical particle counter was added. Aerosol, including black carbon, play an important role in atmospheric processes for a number of reasons including different radiative forcing effects, acting as a cloud condensation and ice nuclei and changing surface albedo of snow.\nWe present the wavelength-dependent aerosol optical properties measured during the 2012, 2013 and 2014 sampling seasons along with particle count data when available. Several events with high aerosol concentrations are investigated in detail.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the long-term responses of ecosystems to climate change is important for quantifying the strength of carbon–climate feedbacks and informing carbon management and energy policies. Using simulations from the Community Earth System Model version 1.0 (CESM1-BGC), we quantified the effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 and the resulting increases in temperature and changes in precipitation from 1850 to 2300 on terrestrial ecosystems. We analyzed the evolution of the global carbon and water cycles in four sets of Historical (1850–2005), Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (2006–2100), and Extended Concentration Pathway 8.5 (2101–2300) simulations with active land and ocean biogeochemical cycles. In the first set of simulations, the increasing atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases and aerosols were radiatively coupled. In the second set, the CO2 was radiatively uncoupled; while in the third, CO2 and the other atmospheric forcing agents were radiatively uncoupled. The fourth set was radiatively coupled, but the ocean and land biogeochemistry experienced only the pre-industrial CO2 forcing. We found that carbon–climate feedbacks intensify as a consequence of weakening CO2 uptake by oceans and the terrestrial biosphere through the end of the 23rd century. We also investigated the effects of changing water availability on land uptake and biosphere productivity, and found an increase in terrestrial water storage globally as a result of intensification of the water cycle. Water cycle changes were driven by the balance between increasing temperatures, changing precipitation, melting snow and ice, thawing permafrost, and increasing leaf area and water use efficiency. Regional changes in precipitation and runoff were not consistent within latitude zones, resulting in differential effects on ecosystem productivity and fire frequency, particularly in the tropics. While tropical and mid-latitude productivity increases largely slowed or became negative at or before 2250, when atmospheric CO2 was stabilized, productivity in high latitudes continued to rise as temperatures and soil moisture continued to increase.",

Comprised of over 160,000 frames and spanning 15 years of the Terra platform mission, the ASTER Volcano Archive (AVA: http://ava.jpl.nasa.gov) is the world’s largest (100+Tb) high spatial resolution (15-30-90m/pixel), multi-spectral (visible-SWIR-TIR), downloadable (kml enabled) dedicated archive of volcano imagery. We will discuss the development of the AVA, and describe its growing capability to provide new easy public access to ASTER global volcano remote sensing data. AVA system architecture is designed to facilitate parameter-based data mining, and for the implementation of archive-wide data analysis algorithms. Such search and analysis capabilities exploit AVA’s unprecedented time-series data compilations for over 1,550 volcanoes worldwide (Smithsonian Holocene catalog). Results include thermal anomaly detection and mapping, as well as detection of SO2 plumes from explosive eruptions and passive SO2 emissions confined to the troposphere. We are also implementing retrospective ASTER image retrievals based on volcanic activity reports from Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs) and the US Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). A major planned expansion of the AVA is currently underway, with the ingest of the full 1972-present LANDSAT, and NASA EO-1, volcano imagery for comparison and integration with ASTER data.

            "abstract": "Drilling an entire section of the oceanic crust and through the Moho has been a goal of the scientific community for more than half of a century. On the basis of ODP and IODP experience and data, this will require instruments and strategies working at temperature far above 200°C (reached, for example, at the bottom of DSDP/ODP Hole 504B), and possibly beyond 300°C. Concerning logging and monitoring instruments, progress were made over the past ten years in the context of the HiTI (“High Temperature Instruments”) project funded by the european community for deep drilling in hot Icelandic geothermal holes where supercritical conditions and a highly corrosive environment are expected at depth (with temperatures above 374 °C and pressures exceeding 22 MPa).\nFor example, a slickline tool (memory tool) tolerating up to 400°C and wireline tools up to 300°C were developed and tested in Icelandic high-temperature geothermal fields. The temperature limitation of logging tools was defined to comply with the present limitation in wireline cables (320°C). As part of this new set of downhole tools, temperature, pressure, fluid flow and casing collar location might be measured up to 400°C from a single multisensor tool. Natural gamma radiation spectrum, borehole wall ultrasonic images signal, and fiber optic cables (using distributed temperature sensing methods) were also developed for wireline deployment up to 300°C and tested in the field. A wireline, dual laterolog electrical resistivity tool was also developed but could not be field tested as part of HiTI.\nThis new set of tools constitutes a basis for the deep exploration of the oceanic crust in the future. In addition, new strategies including the real-time integration of drilling parameters with modeling of the thermo-mechanical status of the borehole could be developed, using time-lapse logging of temperature (for heat flow determination) and borehole wall images (for hole stability and in-situ stress determination) as boundary conditions for the models. In all, and with limited integration of existing tools, to deployment of high-temperature downhole tools could contribute largely to the success of the long awaited Mohole project.",

It’s a time when many high school science educators, who otherwise would venture outside with their classes, hunker down and are wary of the outdoors. However, a plethora of learning opportunities lies just beyond the classroom. Working collaboratively, a high school science teacher and a snow scientist have developed multiple activities to engage students in the scientific process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting the winter world using snow data to (1) learn about the insulative properties of snow, and (2) to learn about the role of snow cover on winter climate through its reflective properties while participating in a volunteer network that collects snow depth, albedo (reflectivity), and density data. These outdoor field-based snow investigations incorporate Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and disciplinary core ideas, including ESS2.C: The roles of water in Earth’s surface processes and ESS2.D: Weather and Climate. Additionally, the lesson plans presented address Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in Mathematics, including the creation and analysis of bar graphs and time series plots (CCSS.Math.HSS-ID.A.1) and xy scatter plots (CCSS.Math.HSS-ID.B.6). High school students participating in the 2013/2014 snow sampling season described their outdoor learning experience as “authentic” and “hands-on” as compared to traditional class indoors. They emphasized that learning outdoors was essential to their understanding of underlying content and concepts because they “learn through actual experience.”",

            "abstract": "Rising winter air temperatures, snowpack declines, and warmer and drier summers have resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of late-summer low-flow events across south coastal British Columbia. Negative impacts, particularly those associated with deteriorating water quality, decreased water supply for hydroelectric power generation, and the survivorship of migrating Pacific salmon, have been observed and are expected to intensify. It is not known whether these earlier, longer, and/or lower low-flows are anomalous relative to historical streamflow patterns since available gauged flow data is restricted to the last five decades.\nWe used networks of high-elevation tree-ring data to model historical low-flow (late-summer) season streamflow regionalized across a group of hydrologically similar watersheds that were identified as susceptible to low-flow events. Our approach contrasts with typical dendrohydrological approaches in that the study watersheds are relatively small in size, and we have not employed moisture-limited tree-ring records as model predictors. In these rainfall-dominated streamflow regimes, late-summer discharge is driven by a combination of persisting snowmelt-derived inputs and variations in summer temperature. We used correlation analysis to prescreen a large pool of tree-ring chronologies as candidate model predictors, retaining those whose annual radial growth is limited by variability in those climate variables driving low-flow season discharge. We conducted principal components analysis on the retained chronologies to derive a set of tree-ring based predictors, which were entered into a stepwise multiple linear regression model to estimate historical regionalized low-flow season flows. Our model explains approximately 60% of streamflow variance, elucidates the frequencies and magnitudes of past low-flow episodes not represented within the instrumental record, and provides a historical context for contemporary shifts in the regional hydrology of south coastal British Columbia.",

A recent two-year time series from eight moorings provides the first long-term simultaneous observations of the hydrographic properties and transport of Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) flowing westward through the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone. Using the isohaline 34.94 to define the ISOW layer, the two year mean and standard deviation of ISOW transport was -1.7 ± 1.5 Sv, compared to -2.4 ± 3.0 Sv reported by Saunders for a 13-month period in 1988-1989 using the same isohaline. Differences in the two estimates could reflect the difficulty of defining the long-term mean in the presence of strong transport variability on multiple time scales: ten 13-month mean transport estimates from the new two-year record range from -2.0 to -1.4 Sv. Furthermore, the temperature/salinity time series indicate large fluctuations in ISOW layer thickness: for example, thickness over the northern rift valley had a mean value of about 1400 m and ranged from 400 to 2100 m (compared to Saunders’ fixed value of 2200 m at this site). A time series of ISOW transport through CGFZ estimated from a multi-decadal run of the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) shows a similar level of interannual variability as the observations.",

The IcePod system, mounted on a New York Air National Guard LC-130, can measure high-resolution surface elevations with a Riegl VQ580 scanning laser altimeter and Imperx Bobcat IGV-B6620 color visible-wavelength camera (6600x4400 resolution); the surface temperature with a Sofradir IRE-640L infrared camera (spectral response 7.7-9.5 μm, 640x512 resolution); and the structure of snow and ice with two radar systems. We show the use of IcePod imagery to develop DEMs across calving fronts and meltwater channels in Greenland. Multiple over-flights of the Kangerlussaq Airport ramp have provided a test of the technique at a location with accurate, independently-determined elevation. Here the photogrammetric DEM of the airport, constrained by ground control measurements, is compared with the Lidar results.\nIn July 2014 the IcePod ice-ocean imaging system surveyed the calving fronts of five outlet glaciers north of Jakobshavn Isbrae. We used Agisoft PhotoScan to develop a DEM of each calving front using imagery captured by the IcePod systems. Adjacent to the ice sheet, meltwater plumes foster mixing in the fjord, moving warm ocean water into contact with the front of the ice sheet where it can undercut the ice front and trigger calving. The five glaciers provide an opportunity to examine the calving front structure in relation to ocean temperature, fjord circulation, and spatial scale of the meltwater plumes. The combination of the accurate DEM of the calving front and the thermal imagery used to constrain the temperature and dynamics of the adjacent plume provides new insights into the ice-ocean interactions.\nIce sheet margins provide insights into the connections between the surface meltwater and the fate of the water at the ice sheet base. Surface meltwater channels are visualized here for the first time using the combination of Lidar, photogrammetry DEMs and infrared imagery. These techniques leverage electromagnetic surface properties that allow us to identify the presence of water, measure the slope and elevation of the channel, as well as the two-dimensional temperature variability of the water/ice/snow in multiple melt channels within a drainage system.",

            "abstract": "An ad-hoc cubesat-based satellite network project known as ANDESITE is under development at Boston University. It aims to develop a dense constellation of easy-to-use, rapidly-deployable low-cost wireless sensor nodes in space. The objectives of the project are threefold: 1) Demonstrate viability of satellite based sensor networks by deploying an 8-node miniature sensor network to study the filamentation of the field aligned currents in the auroral zones of the Earth’s magnetosphere. 2) Test the scalability of proposed protocols, including localization techniques, tracking, data aggregation, and routing, for a 3 dimensional wireless sensor network using a “flock” of nodes. 3) Construct a 6U Cube-sat running the Android OS as an integrated constellation manager, data mule and sensor node deplorer. This small network of sensor nodes will resolve current densities at different spatial resolutions in the near-Earth magnetosphere using measurements from magnetometers with 1-nT sensitivities and 0.2 nT/√Hz self-noise. Mapping of these currents will provide new constraints for models of auroral particle acceleration, wave-particle interactions, ionospheric destabilization, and other kinetic processes operating in the low-beta plasma of the near Earth magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Our previous work considered North American monsoon climate variability with a monsoon-sensitive network of tree-ring chronologies in the Southwest. We were able to identify a very low-frequency centennial scale climate signal responsible for megadroughts of the past four centuries. Here we continue to investigate very low-frequency climate variability within the context of a twentieth-century atmospheric reanalysis that has been dynamically downscaled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. We apply several different matrix methods techniques to these data to identify dominant and statistical significant spatiotemporal cool and warm season precipitation patterns. Our main question of interest is to ascertain whether the major western U.S. droughts in the last 140 years are driven by very low-frequency climate variability on the decadal to centennial time scale. We present evidence that the answer to this question is affirmative and that major droughts are tied to coherent changes in atmospheric circulation at a planetary scale in this very-low frequency regime. Use of a regional atmospheric model is necessary to resolve the spatial variability in precipitation patterns that are associated with the droughts. The downscaled 20th century reanalysis product is thus suitable to be applied to a hydrologic model to estimate impacts of historical dry and wet periods in the 20th century on water resources.",

            "abstract": "In the central Andes of Peru, climate change is altering fire risk through changes in local meteorology and fuel loading. Greater moisture and favorable growing conditions are increasing vegetative productivity, which in turn increases fuel loads. This process is accentuated during El Nino events and potentially results in increased fire occurrence and frequency during relatively dry La Nina events. Park officials are concerned about the ramification of the changes on local ecology and tourist use of the resources. However, using a time-series of two different products from the MODIS Terra and Aqua platforms (Active Fire and Burned Area), TRMM 3B43 precipitation data, and Multivariate ENSO Index data we document fire occurrence and extent from 2000 to 2010 and our analysis indicates that fires are burning exclusively during winter months when there are no natural ignition sources. Globally, fire is used in conjunction with grazing to improve the regeneration and yield of grasses. During our interviews, locals claimed to only set fires in the buffer zone outside of the park, but our analysis indicates that the buffer zone rarely burns and that most fires begin within the park and only occasionally move into the buffer zones. Additionally, we determined that although this is small-scale fire activity every year, overall fire is having a very minor effect on local systems. The park service must develop programs to work with local grazing stakeholders to better limit the impacts of fire, while also address the negative perceptions from tourists in the future. In this instance, fire perception and fire reality are not the same and the challenge for resource managers is how to reconcile these two factors in order to more effectively manage the parklands.",

            "abstract": "Temporal changes in the periodic stick-slip events on the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) help to understand the hydrosphere-cryosphere coupling in West Antarctica. Previous studies have shown that the periodic behavior has been ongoing for a number of years but the record of slip events is incomplete. Rayleigh waves from WIS grounding line events exhibit different patterns than events from the interior of the glacier. An algorithm using a backpropagation neural network is proposed to efficiently extract surface waves that are a result of stick slip events. A neural network approach has its advantages of machine learning, simplified mathematics, and eliminates the need for an analyst to correctly pick first arrivals. Training data has been assembled using 107 events occuring during the 2010 austral summer that were previously identified to correspond to stick slip events at the grounding line as well as the interior of the WIS. A 0.1 s moving window of 3 s of each of the preprocessed attributes is input into the neural network for automated surface wave detection. Following surface wave detection a much longer 30 minute sliding window is used to classify surface wave detections as grounding line, interior, or non-stick slip events. Similar to the automatic detection algorithms for body waves, preprocessing using STA/LTA ratio, degree of polarization, variance, and skewness exhibit obvious patterns during the onset of surface waves. The The automated event detection could lead to more cost effective means of data collection in future seismic experiments especially with an increase in array density in cold weather regions.",

            "abstract": "XCOR Aerospace, a commercial space company, is planning to provide frequent, low cost access to near-Earth space on the Lynx suborbital Reusable Launch Vehicle (sRLV). Measurements in the external vacuum environment can be made and can launch from most runways on a limited lead time. Lynx can operate as a platform to perform suborbital in situ measurements and remote sensing to supplement models and simulations with new data points. These measurements can serve as a quantitative link to existing instruments and be used as a basis to calibrate detectors on spacecraft. Easier access to suborbital data can improve the longevity and cohesiveness of spacecraft and ground-based resources. A study of how these measurements can be made on Lynx sRLV will be presented. At the boundary between terrestrial and space weather, measurements from instruments on Lynx can help develop algorithms to optimize the consolidation of ground and satellite based data as well as assimilate global models with new data points. For example, current tides and the equatorial electrojet, essential to understanding the Thermosphere-Ionosphere system, can be measured in situ frequently and on short notice. Furthermore, a negative-ion spectrometer and a Faraday cup, can take measurements of the D-region ion composition. A differential GPS receiver can infer the spatial gradient of ionospheric electron density.\nInstruments and optics on spacecraft degrade over time, leading to calibration drift. Lynx can be a cost effective platform for deploying a reference instrument to calibrate satellites with a frequent and fast turnaround and a successful return of the instrument. A calibrated reference instrument on Lynx can make collocated observations as another instrument and corrections are made for the latter, thus ensuring data consistency and mission longevity. Aboard a sRLV, atmospheric conditions that distort remotely sensed data (ground and spacecraft based) can be measured in situ. Moreover, an active instrument can be deployed in a sRLV under a satellite track, and serve as a “standard candle” for instruments on satellites. Yearly calibrations of the Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Experiment (SEE) instrument aboard the TIMED orbiter using sounding rockets depict the necessity of calibrations and illustrates calibration frequency.",

            "abstract": "While historically flow and transport in porous media has focused on low Reynolds number and Peclet number regimes there are a variety of examples relevant to environmental fluid dynamics where higher Reynolds number flows are important. A common example might include flow and transport through wetlands where plants act as the solid phase of an effective porous medium. In particular, heterogeneity in the flow field due to presence of the solid phases gives rise to complex transport and mixing behaviors that cannot be upscaled at pre-asymptotic times using conventional approaches. We numerically simulate pore-scale flow and transport through obstructed domains over a range of Reynolds numbers from 15 to 280 and then upscale transport. We upscale using a correlated continuous time random walk (correlated CTRW) model, originally introduced in [1]. We then assess the correlated CTRW's ability to predict observables for both asymptotic and pre-asymptotic time scales and compare our results to those of a classical CTRW to determine when velocity correlations must be accounted for.\nREFERENCES\n[1] T.L.

            "abstract": "The first stroke in a cloud-to-ground lightning discharge is thought to follow (or be initiated by) the preliminary breakdown process which often produces a train of relatively large microsecond-scale electric field pulses. This process is poorly understood and rarely modeled. Each lightning stroke is composed of a downward leader process and an upward return-stroke process, which are usually modeled separately. We present a unified engineering model for computing the electric field produced by a sequence of preliminary breakdown, stepped leader, and return stroke processes, serving to transport negative charge to ground. We assume that a negatively-charged channel extends downward in a stepped fashion through the relatively-high-field region between the main negative and lower positive charge centers and then through the relatively-low-field region below the lower positive charge center. A relatively-high-field region is also assumed to exist near ground. The preliminary breakdown pulse train is assumed to be generated when the negatively-charged channel interacts with the lower positive charge region. At each step, an equivalent current source is activated at the lower extremity of the channel, resulting in a step current wave that propagates upward along the channel. The leader deposits net negative charge onto the channel. Once the stepped leader attaches to ground (upward connecting leader is presently neglected), an upward-propagating return stroke is initiated, which neutralizes the charge deposited by the leader along the channel. We examine the effect of various model parameters, such as step length and current propagation speed, on model-predicted electric fields. We also compare the computed fields with pertinent measurements available in the literature.",

            "abstract": "Edge detection identifies seismic or aseismic fault motion, as demonstrated in repeat-pass inteferograms obtained by the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) program. But this identification is not robust at present: it requires a flattened background image, interpolation into missing data (holes) and outliers, and background noise that is either sufficiently small or roughly white Gaussian. Identification and mitigation of nongaussian background image noise is essential to creating a robust, automated system to search for such features. Clearly a robust method is needed for machine scanning of the thousands of UAVSAR repeat-pass interferograms for evidence of fault slip, landslides, and other local features.\nEmpirical examination of detrended noise based on 20 km east-west profiles through desert terrain with little tectonic deformation for a suite of flight interferograms shows nongaussian characteristics. Statistical measurement of curvature with varying length scale (Allan variance) shows nearly white behavior (Allan variance slope with spatial distance from roughly -1.76 to –2) from 25 to 400 meters, deviations from –2 suggesting short-range differences (such as used in detecting edges) are often freer of noise than longer-range differences. At distances longer than 400 m the Allan variance flattens out without consistency from one interferogram to another. We attribute this additional noise afflicting difference estimates at longer distances to atmospheric water vapor and uncompensated aircraft motion.\nParadoxically, California interferograms made with increasing time intervals before and after the El Mayor Cucapah earthquake (2008, M7.2, Mexico) show visually stronger and more interesting edges, but edge detection methods developed for the first year do not produce reliable results over the first two years, because longer time spans suffer reduced coherence in the interferogram. The changes over time are reflecting fault slip and block motion, indicating the continuing slip along minor faults in the post seismic phase of the main rupture. We show current results using computer vision methods that respect the noise and coherence characteristics.",

This contribution presents thermobarometric results obtained from lavas of the Caburgua-Huelemolle Small Eruptive Centers (CHSEC), composed of pyroclastic cones and associated lava flows of basaltic composition, belonging to the Southern Volcanic Zone. These results are compared with those available data in Holocene volcanic products of the Villarrica Volcano located 10 km south of the CHSEC.\nPhenocrysts consist of isolated crystals and clots of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and olivine. Plagioclase phenocrysts are commonly unzoned (An88-92), although a very small (> 20 μm) rim of more albitic (An55-70) composition occurs. Olivines mainly have composition Fo85 with a 50-80 μm rim of Fo79. Clinopyroxene phenocrysts exhibit a narrow compositional range (Wo44-46, En45-47, Fs7-9). Chromian spinels (#Mg= 43-94, #Cr= 16-33) are commonly found as inclusions in olivine phenocrysts. Microlites include plagioclase (An59-77), clinopyroxene (Wo8-40, En45-63, Fs13-31), olivine (Fo70-76) magnetite and titanomagnetites (Mgt = 77, Usp = 23).\nPre-eruptive temperatures of the CHSEC between 1,221 and 1,227 ± 6 °C were obtained from olivine-augite phenocrysts. Olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts crystallized at pressures between 8.6 and 12.8 kbar consistent with a reservoir located at the base of the crust. The maximum syn-eruptive temperatures of 1,170 ± 6 °C were obtained in olivine-augite groundmass microcryst pairs, the loss of temperature is consistent with an adiabatic ascent from the base of the crust without an intermediate reservoir.\nThe CHSEC pre-eruptive conditions are different from those obtained from Holocene lavas and bombs of the Villarrica Volcano. Pre-eruptive temperatures between 1,041 and 1,168 °C and pressures between 0.2 and 0.6 kbar were obtained in the Villarrica Volcano. In addition, chromian spinel inclusions in olivine of Villarrica Volcano bombs (#Al= 2-19) have compositions that differ from those of the CHSEC (#Al= 29-33) , suggesting independent reservoirs.",

Information on winds, chemistry, and solar effects is gained by observing temporal and spatial variation in nightglow intensity. One of the brightest nightglow features on Earth is the OI (1S-1D) 557.7 nm line (oxygen green line). This emission is primarily due to photodissociation/transport but is also seen in the aurora as electron precipitation. Unlike Earth, the Venusian green line is highly temporally variable. The chemistry and mechanisms responsible are still unknown. We observe the Venusian nightglow before and after solar flares, which produce large amounts of EUV emission, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) impacts, which inject a large number of higher energy charged particles in the the Venusian atmosphere. We consistently detect green line emission after large charged particles injections from CMEs. However we do not detect the OI (1D) red line at 630.0 nm, which is quenched below 150 km. We propose that the Venusian green line is an auroral-type emission due to electron precipitation and is occurring deep in the atmosphere, near 125 km. To investigate how CMEs and solar flares affect the electron energy, flux, and density in the Venusian nightside atmosphere, we compare data taken by ASPERA and ELS onboard Venus Express (VEX) before and after solar storms. We find that both electron energy and flux increase after CMEs, but only flux increases after solar flares. Additionally, the V1 ionospheric layer at 125 km increases in electron density while the V2 at 150 km decreases in density after CMEs but not after solar flares. We model the nightside Venusian ionosphere using the observed electron energy and fluxes from VEX in an effort to constrain the chemical processes and mechanisms responsible for green line emission. We will present the results of our ground-based observations and modeling.",

Successful strategies (developed over the years) of the program include teamwork experience, mentoring of REUs (by faculty and more senior students), cultural interchange due to students from many campuses across the U.S. and international graduate students, including industry visitors who work with the students and provide networking, a capstone experience of the summer program that includes all students making a “professional-meeting” style presentation of their research and submitting a written report, a follow-up workshop for the REU students to enhance and broaden their experience, and providing professional development for the REUs through oral or poster presentations and attendance at a professional meeting. Program challenges include obtaining funding from multiple sources; significant time investment in program management, reporting, and maintaining contact with our many funding sources and industry affiliates; and, despite significant efforts, limited success in recruiting racial and ethnic minority students to the program.",

            "abstract": "Slab-continent interactions drive most non-collisional orogenies; this has led us to usually anticipate that temporal changes or spatial variations in orogenic style are related to changes in the slab, most especially in the slab's dip. This is most dramatically evident for orogenies in the foreland, well away from the trench, such as the Laramide orogeny. However, the physical means of connecting slab geometry to crustal deformation remain obscure. Dickinson and Snyder (1978) and Bird (1984) laid out a conceptually elegant means of creating foreland deformation from shear between a slab and overriding continental lithosphere, but such strong shear removed all of the continental lithosphere in the western U.S. when included in a numerical simulation of flat slab subduction (Bird, 1988), a removal in conflict with observations of volcanic rocks and xenoliths in many locations. Relying on an increase in edge normal stresses results, for the Laramide, in requiring the little-deformed Colorado Plateau to either be unusually strong or to have risen rapidly enough and high enough to balance edge stresses with body forces. Early deformation in the Plateau rules out unusual strength, and the accumulation and preservation of Late Cretaceous near-sea level sedimentary rocks makes profound uplift unlikely (though not impossible). Relying on comparisons with the Sierras Pampeanas is also fraught with problems: the Sierras are not separated from the Andean fold-and-thrust belt by several hundred kilometers of little-deformed crust, nor were they buried under kilometers of marine muds as were large parts of the Laramide foreland. We have instead suggested that some unusual interactions of an obliquely subducting plate with a thick Archean continental root might provide a better explanation than a truly flat slab (Jones et al., 2011). From this, and given that several flat-slab segments today are not associated with foreland orogenesis and noting that direct evidence for truly flat-slab subduction is limited in cases like the Laramide, arguably flat slabs are neither necessary nor sufficient to drive foreland deformation. Clearly additional aspects of continent-ocean interaction (such as, perhaps, interaction of continental keels) need to be brought into play to understand non-collisional orogenies.",

            "abstract": "Observed changes in the decay rate of methyl chloroform (MCF; CH3CCl3) have been the traditional top-down constraint for variability in tropospheric abundances of the hydroxyl radical (OH), and thereby the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. However, as atmospheric MCF concentrations approach detection limits following its ban under the Montréal Protocol, it is necessary to identify new proxies for global OH and its variability. We present here a novel proxy for tropospheric OH using convolved observations of total and tropospheric columns of ozone, water vapor, NO2, and CO, available from the Aura and Aqua satellites in the NASA Earth Observing System constellation. Derived from photochemical steady-state assumptions, the satellite proxy generates spatiotemporally coherent monthly percent anomalies in column OH for Oct. 2004 through Sept. 2012. We demonstrate that the temporal evolution of the globally integrated signal is statistically consistent with changes inferred by the MCF decay rate during this period. The magnitude of interannual variability in the satellite OH proxy is smaller than that from MCF, more consistent with global chemical transport models (CTMs). We evaluate the proxy by comparing to 9-year hind-cast simulations of the GEOS-Chem global CTM driven by MERRA reanalysis meteorology at 2° x 2.5° horizontal resolution, and find that the satellite proxy correlates with the airmass-weighted tropospheric monthly mean OH anomalies (R = 0.6; n = 96 months). The satellite proxy and model simulations indicate regional-scale coherent OH anomalies for many regions and seasons; where discrepancies occur, we highlight possible causes. We present a source attribution of the spatial and temporal patterns in the satellite OH proxy, informed by the individual components of the satellite proxy, a series of zero-emission sensitivity simulations with GEOS-Chem, and independent proxies for major modes of climate variability.",

            "abstract": "The Rim Fire in 2013 burned approximately 1036 km2 in the Sierra Nevada (including 312 km2 within Yosemite National Park), generating considerable public concern regarding potential impacts to the Tuolumne River watershed, in terms of water quality and water supply infrastructure serving the City of San Francisco. Land management responses included a multi-million dollar watershed treatment project on USFS lands near Cherry Creek, with similar actions suggested for areas in the Hetch Hetchy and Lake Eleanor watersheds. In response to the concern that the post-burn landscape will negatively impact water quality, we are investigating hydrologic effects and hillslope erosion in two small burned basins (2.2 and 5.2 km2) within the Tuolumne River basin in Yosemite National Park. Within a month after fire containment, sites were equipped with instrumentation to record stream stage, turbidity, and total suspended sediment. We also installed 21 sediment fences that trap all sediment silt sized and larger on moderate (20%) to steep (50%) hillslopes from 100 m2 plots within moderate and high severity burn areas. Accumulated sediment is collected, weighed, and sub-sampled after each storm event, and, analyzed for dry weight, particle size, gravimetric water content, bulk density, pH, color, carbon and nitrogen content from % fine organics, and % coarse organics. As of July 31, 2014, four discrete storm events had been sampled. Data are used to calculate annual sediment yield, and to investigate organic carbon storage, deposition, and transport. We are also collecting repeat terrestrial laser scans to assess topographic change and identify the hillslope processes that contribute to erosion and deposition at plot- and hillslope-scale. These findings provide analogs for possible changes in adjacent burned areas and to inform management decisions in response to future fires and potential impacts to water quality in areas valued by the park, the City of San Francisco and other beneficial uses of water from Hetch Hetchy reservoir.",

Most floats are programmed to drift for two years, obtaining position fixes and temperature/pressure measurements three times daily. More than 80 floats have completed their missions, and results from the trajectories will be described with a focus on mesoscale eddying behavior.

Lett. 96, 255002 (2006)] are predicted to drive arched flux ropes in the solar corona to erupt. In recent line-tied flux rope experiments conducted in the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX), however, we find that quasi-statically driven flux ropes remain confined well beyond the predicted torus instability threshold. In order to understand this behavior, in situ measurements from a 300 channel 2D magnetic probe array are used to comprehensively analyze the force balance between the external (potential) and internal (plasma-generated) magnetic fields. We find that forces due to the line-tied toroidal magnetic field, which are not included in the basic torus instability theory, can play a major role in preventing eruptions. The dependence of these toroidal magnetic forces on various potential field and flux rope parameters will be discussed.\nThis research is supported by DoE Contract Number DE-AC02-09CH11466 and by the NSF/DoE Center for Magnetic Self-Organization (CMSO).",

These irregular meander events have been referred to as Natal Pulses.\nHere we present new observations and analyses of Agulhas meanders using full-depth velocity mooring observations from the Agulhas Current Time series experiment (ACT). Detailed analyses of the in-situ velocity reveal important differences between the behavior of the flow during solitary meander events and during meander events of smaller amplitude. During solitary meanders, an onshore cyclonic circulation and an offshore anticyclonic circulation act in concert to displace the jet offshore, leading to sudden and strong positive conversion of kinetic energy of the mean flow to the meander. In contrast, smaller amplitude meanderings are principally represented by a single cyclonic circulation spanning the entire jet that acts to displace the jet without significantly extracting kinetic energy from the mean flow. Solitary meander events can be traced upstream using satellite altimetry and linked to either Mozambique Channel eddies or Madagascar dipoles, the latter possibly part of a basin-wide pattern of propagating sea level anomalies consistent with Rossby wave dynamics. However, only a small number of these anomalies lead to solitary meanders. Altimetric observations suggest 1.5 meanders per year and show that the two-year period during ACT when no events were observed is unprecedented in the 20-year satellite record.",

Numerous aspects of the design and operational activities of the CO2 storage site are dependent on the geomechanical properties of the targeted reservoir zone, as well as of the overlying confining zone and the underlying crystalline Precambrian basement. Detailed determination of the state-of-stress within the subsurface is of paramount importance in successfully designing well drilling/completion aspects, as well as assessing the risk of induced seismicity and the potential for creating and/or reopening pre-existing fractures; all of which help ensure the safe long-term storage of injected CO2. The quantitative determination of the subsurface fracture gradient is one of the key geomechanical parameters for the site injection design and operational limits (e.g., maximum safe injection pressure). A characterization well drilled in 2011 provides subsurface geomechanical characterization information for the FutureGen 2.0 site, and includes: 1) continuous elastic properties inferred from sonic/acoustic wireline logs 2) discrete depth geomechanical laboratory core measurements and 3) results obtained from hydraulic fracturing tests of selected borehole/depth-intervals. In this paper, the precise fracture gradients derived from borehole geomechanical test results are compared with semi-empirical, fracture gradient calculation/relationships based on elastic property wireline surveys and laboratory geomechanical core test results. Implications for using various fracture-gradients obtained from the different methods are assessed using PNNL’s subsurface multiphase flow and transport simulator STOMP-CO2. The implications for operational activities at the site (based on using different fracture gradients) are also discussed.",

While ARs have been studied in the United States (US) and Europe using reanalyses and satellite remote sensing, few if any studies have applied an AR analysis framework to regions in South Asia. In this research, we develop and test AR detection algorithms for Nepal by modifying a proven algorithm used in the western US and Europe. Nepal faces challenges in forecasting extreme precipitation events due to the region’s complex topography and lack of forecasting infrastructure. Accordingly, any tools that can lead to enhanced lead time of extreme weather forecasts, or help guide water management decisions, will have a substantial positive impact on the region’s coping ability.\nOur AR algorithm uses ERA-Interim reanalysis data to compute integrated water vapor transport (kg m-1s-1) and determine the latitude specific threshold values, for four seasons. After detecting AR events, we test if those events correlate with observed extreme daily precipitation events. Extreme precipitation is determined annually and for non-monsoon months. Our initial results indicate that ARs coincide with extreme precipitation mostly in the cold season. We are extending our analyses to better understand how ARs relate to extreme precipitation events in all seasons. New methods to monitor the role of ARs in precipitation events will help manage water resources, which is critical given the melting of Himalayan glaciers that feed major watersheds of Nepal. In addition to understanding extreme events, our study will also aid in a better understanding of seasonal climate anomalies and the global water cycle.",

            "abstract": "Mercury deposition from natural and anthropogenic sources is known to accumulate in subarctic environments, particularly peatlands, due to their abundant organic matter that effectively sequester mercury and other heavy metals. Given direct links between mercury mobilization and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem health, it is vital to understand the degree to which thawing peatlands serve as sinks or sources of mercury to the environment. In a peat mire underlain by permafrost in subarctic Sweden (Stordalen Mire, lat. 68°21' N, lon. 19°03' E), the onset of climate-driven permafrost thaw influences regional hydrology and therefore the composition of plant communities. The purpose of this work is to assess mercury content of vegetation and underlying peat across a thaw gradient. The study was conducted on two transects that transition from an unthawed dwarf shrub-dominated hummock community to a fully thawed graminoid-dominated wet depression community. Drained hummock sites at initial stages of the thaw sequence are characterized by a diverse graminoid and shrub community, including Eriophorum, Andromeda, and Empetrum populations underlain by Sphagnum litter. Semi-wet sites are characterized by moist Sphagnum mats with sparse populations of Eriophorum and Empetrum. Wet sites are characterized by tall graminoid Eriophorum underlain by submerged Sphagnum mats. Total mercury abundances in vegetation was analyzed via thermal decomposition. Generally, mercury contents in plant tissues exhibit decreasing concentrations of mercury with increasing thaw. Higher concentration of mercury in vegetation in drained sites versus that in wet sites supports the notion that mercury in the dry mire is exported into the local water and peat column. Changing mercury concentration profiles in peat core afford a means to assess that mercury is mobilized during the thaw but not fully exported from the thawed wetlands. Our results, coupled with earlier findings of mobilization and subsequent partial retention of mercury in peat along other thaw sequences, suggest complex pathways for mercury reallocation during the thawing process.",

            "abstract": "The USGS constructed a freshwater-wetland complex on Twitchell Island in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta (Delta), California, USA, in 1997 and maintained it until 2012 to investigate strategies for biomass accretion and reduction of oxidative soil loss. We studied an area of the wetland complex covered mainly by dense patches of hardstem bulrush (Schoenoplectus acutus) and cattails (Typha spp.), with smaller areas of floating and submerged vegetation, that was maintained at an average depth of 55 cm.\nUsing eddy covariance measurements of carbon and energy fluxes, we found that the combination of water management and the region’s Mediterranean climate created conditions where peak growing season daily means of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) reached -45 gCO2 m-2 d-1 and averaged around -30 gCO2 m-2 d-1 between 2002 through 2004. However, when measurements resumed in 2010, NEE rates were a fraction of the rates previously measured, approximately -6 gCO2 m-2 d-1. Interestingly, NEE rates in 2011 doubled compared to 2010 (-13 gCO2 m-2 d-1). Methane fluxes, collected in 2010 to assess a complete atmospheric carbon budget, were positive throughout the year, with daily mean flux values ranging from 50 to 300 mg CH4 m-2 d-1. As a result, methane flux reduced NEE values by approximately one-third, and when the global warming potential was considered, the wetland became a net global warming potential source.\nWe found that carbon cycling in a constructed wetland is complex and can change over annual and decadal timescales. We investigated possible reasons for differences between flux measurements from 2002 to 2004 and those from 2010 and 2011: (1) changes in methodology, (2) differences in weather conditions, (3) differences in gross primary productivity relative to respiration rates, and (4) the amount of living plant tissue relative to brown accumulations of senesced plant litter. We hypothesize that large mats of senesced material within the flux footprint could have contributed to the difference in flux rates by reducing the productivity of the emergent marsh species. We conclude that for restored or constructed wetlands, it is important to implement long-term monitoring strategies to assess and manage environmental processes associated with carbon storage.",

            "abstract": "As the decision to construct a hazard map is frequently precipitated by the sudden initiation of activity at a volcano that was previously considered dormant, timely completion of the map is imperative. This prohibits the calculation of probabilities through direct sampling of a numerical ash-transport and dispersion model. In developing a probabilistic forecast for ash cloud locations following an explosive volcanic eruption, we construct a number of possible meta-models (a model of the simulator) to act as fast surrogates for the time-expensive model. We will illustrate the new fast surrogates based on both polynomial chaos and multilevel sparse representations that have allowed us to conduct the Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in a timely fashion. These surrogates allow orders of magnitude improvement in cost associated with UQ, and are likely to have a major impact in many related domains.\nThis work will be part of an operational and research volcanic forecasting system (see the Webley et al companion presentation) moving towards using ensembles of eruption source parameters and Numerical Weather Predictions (NWPs), rather than single deterministic forecasts, to drive the ash cloud forecasting systems. This involves using an Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) as input to an ash transport and dispersion model, such as PUFF, to produce ash cloud predictions, which will be supported by a Decision Support System. Simulation ensembles with different input volcanic source parameters are intelligently chosen to predict the average and higher-order moments of the output correctly.",

            "abstract": "We attempt to infer cloud vertical structure and improve estimates of cloud microphysical properties through the application of an Adiabatic Spectrally Consistent Retrieval (ASCR) to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. The MODIS Cloud Product provides estimates of cloud optical thickness and droplet effective radius for three near-infrared absorption wavelengths (1.6, 2.1 and 3.7 mm) under the assumption of a plane-parallel, vertically homogeneous (VH) cloud. This is not a physically realistic assumption for boundary layer clouds, where an adiabatically stratified liquid water content profile conforms better. ASCR transforms VH retrievals of optical thickness and droplet effective radii into adiabatically stratified retrievals, exploiting the varying photon penetration depth of each absorption channel. Taking advantage of the data screening and quality controls applied to the MODIS Cloud Product, existing retrievals of optical thickness and droplet effective radii are inverted to obtain equivalent scene reflectances from which two-channel and four-channel adiabatically stratified retrievals of cloud geometrical thickness (H) and cloud droplet number concentration (N) are performed using an optimal estimation framework. Through a comparison of the 2-channel and 4-channel N and H retrievals, we attempt to estimate the degree to which a cloud conforms to an adiabatically stratified model, near cloud-top. Results will be presented, demonstrating ASCR’s performance relative to VH retrievals from the cloud product through an analysis of one year’s observations of marine stratocumulus from MODIS near the South American and African Continents.",

            "abstract": "Following up initial observations of coincident ground-level AKR-like signals and outgoing AKR measured with the GEOTAIL satellite [LaBelle and Anderson, Geophys. Res. Lett., L04104, doi:10.1029/2010GL046411, 2011], investigation of 2008 data from four Antarctic observatories yields 37 additional examples. The occurrence rate of the ground-level AKR-like signals peaks near 22 UT similar to that of AKR. Because the distant satellite observes AKR from many sources, and because many effects can hinder transmission of AKR from the sources to either the distant satellite or the ground, a perfect correlation between ground-level AKR-like signals and outgoing AKR at GEOTAIL is not expected, and indeed correlation analysis of the ten longest-duration events suggests an imperfect correlation with 2-3 sigma significance, although at time much better correlations occur. Statistical analysis of the existing data is therefore suggestive but not does not prove a connection between the ground-level AKR-like signals and outgoing AKR. Two other methods provide strong evidence in favor of a connection between the phenomena, however. The first full-resolution measurements of ground-level AKR using a digital receiver at South Pole Station show that its fine structure closely resembles that of AKR measured by spacecraft receivers and is completely different from that of auroral hiss, the other auroral emission in the kilometric wavelength range. The digital receiver also determined the polarization of the AKR-like emissions to be right-hand, implying propagation in the whistler mode in the ionosphere. A weaker form of evidence comes from considering the locations of the ground station, satellite, and active aurora during coincident events. Two case studies suggest that the location of the active aurora, presumed connected with the AKR sources, controls whether or not the ground station detects the AKR, or which of several ground stations detects it most strongly. Taken together, these investigations significantly strengthen the hypothesis that through some unknown mechanism, the sources of outgoing AKR detected by distant satellites on occasion generate signals which are detectable as whistler mode waves at low altitude or right-hand polarized signals at ground level.",

            "abstract": "Whole air samples have been collected throughout Southern California during the previous five years of the NASA Student Airborne Research Program (SARP). During a flight over the Salton Sea in 2014, higher concentrations of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a known marine emitted gas, were observed over neighboring agricultural land than over the sea itself. A comparison of DMS to methyl iodide, another known marine emitted gas, showed minimal correlation, revealing that DMS was being emitted from local sources. Ground samples at the Salton Sea verified that the DMS was not transported from the Pacific Ocean. Previous SARP studies have shown that DMS is emitted from dairies. The enhancements in ethanol (another dairy tracer) and DMS in several airborne samples collected south of the Salton Sea suggest dairy emissions of the observed DMS. DMS is a compound of interest because its oxidation can form cloud condensation nuclei. Based on data from all six SARP flights between 2009-2014, we propose that dairy and farming emissions of DMS in the San Joaquin Valley may be impacting aerosol loading in this region. A simple model that takes into account the particulate matter mass loadings was used to calculate the percent contribution of DMS to aerosol formation for the San Joaquin Valley.",

            "abstract": "Since June 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has maintained a stable polar orbit enabling the twin Narrow Angle Cameras (NACs) to acquire high-resolution observations of the lunar surface (pixel scale of 0.25 to 2 m/pixel). This orbital configuration facilitates occasional repeat coverage with nearly identical lighting geometries. These before and after observations, referred to in this study as temporal pairs, enable the identification of changes to the surface using a series of automated change detection techniques.\nInitial manual inspection of temporal pairs resulted in the discovery of many changes across the lunar surface [1]. However, this manual process is time consuming (2-4 hours per temporal pair) and each analyst must apply their own judgment on whether they have discovered a real change or an artifact in the image pair. This manual approach resulted in the identification of 650 surface changes as well as 19 resolved craters.\nLeveraging image processing techniques developed by the LROC team, we started automatically scanning and identifying temporal changes. The new automated algorithm locates changes based on reflectance variations and changes in surface texture. The program provides a list of potential new features for later manual inspection and classification (disturbance lacking resolvable crater or crater with a rim diameter of x meters). This new approach reduces the time to manually inspect a temporal pair by over a factor of 200 by providing cropped cutouts with the putative changes centered in a thumbnail.\nThe LROC NACs have already collected thousands of temporal pair observations and will continue to do so over the remaining extended mission. Highest fidelity change detection comes from temporal pairs with nearly identical lighting geometries (i.e. sub-solar points within 3°), of which over 5000 pairs exist. In our initial scan of 1645 temporal pairs, over 8000 surface changes were identified along with over 50 new impact craters with diameters ranging from 1.7 m to 18 m. Continued scanning of temporal pairs will enable refinements to the current cratering rate, quantify the risk of small secondary impacts, and enhance our knowledge of the ejecta formation.\n",

            "abstract": "Carbonatites are carbon-rich magmas that participate in the deep-Earth carbon cycle, and may be precursors to many types of terrestrial magmatism. [1] Viscosity is a crucial parameter in determining migration rates and behavior of melts from the upper mantle to Earth's surface, but very little is known about the viscosity of carbonate-silicate liquids at conditions relevant to Earth's interior. To examine the viscosity of carbonate-silicate liquids as a function of composition, we performed in situ falling sphere viscosity experiments using a high speed X-ray camera and Paris-Edinburgh press at the HPCAT beamline (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory). Mixtures from the CaCO3-CaSiO3 (calcite-wollastonite) binary system were used to simulate mantle silicate carbonatites. Samples were loaded using the experimental setup of Yamada et al [2], held at 3 GPa, and heated until the sample was fully molten (between 1350-1650 oC). The high speed camera recorded the falling rate of a platinum sphere placed near the top of the sample chamber, enabling the calculation of terminal velocity and hence viscosity.\nResults indicate that pure CaCO3 at upper mantle conditions has a very low viscosity of ~0.006 Pa-s, only a little higher than that of water. This viscosity is 2-6 times lower than that of potassium carbonates at similar pressures (2.5-4.0 GPa) but at somewhat lower temperatures (800-1200 oC). [3] Our measured viscosity as a function of increasing silicate content increases along a log-linear trend, reaching 0.256 Pa-s for CaSiO3 liquid. This heavy dependence of viscosity on composition has implications for melt migration processes at different depths, suggesting either viscosity-driven or porosity-driven migration depending on both extent of melting and carbonate content.\n[1] Dasgupta, R. et al.

Advanced training and active involvement of early-career scientists is an important component of this cross-disciplinary approach. This effort led by the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) started in 2003. The newly supported project in 2013 is planning four summer schools (one per year) focused on four themes in four different Arctic locations. It provides the participants with an interdisciplinary perspective on Arctic change and its impacts on diverse sectors of the North. It is linked to other ongoing long-term observational and educational programs (e.g. NABOS, Nansen and Amundsen Basins Observational System; LTER, Long Term Environmental Research) and targets young scientists by using the interdisciplinary and place-based setting to broaden their perspective on Arctic change and to enhance their communication skills.

            "abstract": "The flare-excited standing slow waves were first detected by SOHO/SUMER as Doppler shift oscillations in hot (>6 MK) coronal loops. It has been suggested that they are excited by small or micro- flares at one loop's footpoint. However, the detailed excitation mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we report an oscillation event observed by SDO/AIA in the 131 channel. The intensity disturbances excited by a C-class flare propagated back and forth along a hot loop for about two period with a strong damping. From the measured oscillation period and loop length, we estimate the wave phase speed to be about 410 km/s. Using a regularized DEM analysis we determine the loop temperature and electron density evolution and find that the loop plasma is heated to a temperature of 8-12 MK with a mean about 9 MK. These measurements support the interpretation as slow magnetoacousic waves. Magnetic field extrapolation suggests that the flare is triggered by slipping and null-point-type reconnections in a fan-spine magnetic topology, and the injected (or impulsively evaporated) hot plasmas flowing along the large spine field lines form the oscillating hot loops. To understand why the propagating waves but not the standing waves as observed previously are excited in this event, we preform simulations using a 3D MHD model based on the observed magnetic configuration including full energy equation. Our simulations indicate that the nature of loop temperature structure is critical for the excitation of whether propagating or standing waves in a hot loop. Our result demonstrates that the slow waves may be used for heating diagnostics of coronal loops with coronal seismology. We also discuss the application of coronal seismology for estimating the average magnetic field strength in the hot loop based on the observed slow waves.",

            "abstract": "Water quality impairment is among the highest ranking public issues of concern in the developed world. While, in Europe and North America, many water quality programs have been put in place over the past half century, regulators difficulties tackling the geographically most widespread water quality degradation in these regions: pollution of groundwater (as opposed to surface water) from diffuse sources (as opposed to point sources), including contamination with nitrate (affecting drinking water supplies in rural areas and at the rural-urban interface) and salinity (affecting irrigation water quality). Other diffuse pollution contaminants include pesticides and emerging contaminants (e.g., antibiotics and pathogens from animal farming). The geographic and hydrologic characteristics of nonpoint source pollution of groundwater are distinctly different from other types of water pollution: individually liable sources are contiguous across the landscape, and internally heterogeneous in space and time. On annually aggregated time scales (most relevant to groundwater), sources are continuously emitting pollution, while pollution levels typically do not exceed MCLs by less than a factor 2. An analysis of key elements of existing water pollution policies to control groundwater pollution from diffuse sources demonstrates the lack of both, science and institutional capacity, while existing point-source approaches cannot be applied toward the control of diffuse pollution to groundwater. For the latter, a key to a successful policy is a tiered, three-way monitoring program based on proxy compliance metrics instead of direct measurement of pollutant discharge, research linking actual pollutant discharges to proxy metrics, and long-term regional groundwater monitoring to establish large scale, long-term trends. Several examples of emerging regulations from California and the EU are given to demonstrate these principles.",

            "abstract": "Subglacial environments are amongst the least known places on Earth. We have combined five different types of geophysical investigations in order to better understand the complex morphology of the >250 km long bed of Bering Glacier. The transect includes the bed segment underlying the present glacier and the segment previously under the glacier’s seaward extension when it reached its maximum limit during the Pleistocene. This transect represents Bering Glacier’s bed from the distal edge of the continental shelf, to its up-glacier point of origin east of the U.S.-Canadian border.\nThe datasets used were: 1) marine air-gun and sparker seismic profiles used to define the bedrock morphology of Bering Trough, Bering Glacier’s Pleistocene fiord cut into the Gulf of Alaska; 2) binary-explosive seismic refraction profiles used to confirm that fiord depth bedrock underlies the Bering Foreland coastal plain; 3) high-resolution mini-sparker seismic reflection profiles collected from Vitus Lake, Bering Glacier’s ice marginal lake that confirm complex bed morphology buried under up to 100 m of recent glacial-marine sediment; 4) ice penetrating radar soundings used to measure the ice thickness and depth to bedrock at more than 30 Bering Glacier piedmont lobe locations; and 5) airborne monopulse radar profiles used for mapping nearly 190 km of glacier’s current bed.\nCombining the results of these five geophysical investigations permits us to produce numerous cross-sections and maps that show the complexities of Bering Glacier’s bedrock morphology. At its offshore end on the outer continental shelf, the bed is a trough as deep as 500 m below sea level. At its origin, east of the U.S.-Canadian Border the bed elevation is ~1,600 m above sea level.",

            "abstract": "Observations show that hot electrons above solar flare looptops can reach tens of kev, but the specific heating mechanism remains unclear. When an electron passes through a reconnection exhaust region, its speed increases by an amount on the order of the Alfven speed. Due to the small mass and thus high thermal speed (on the order of 10 times the Alfven speed) of hot electrons, a single pass does not heat electrons effectively. However, if electrons are confined in the exhaust region by double layers (localized regions of electrostatic field) [1], so that they can pass this region multiple times, the speed of electrons may increase multiple times as well. So we perform particle-in-cell simulations of the related model system known as the Riemann problem [2] in order to test whether trapping via double layers can result in more effective electron heating. Preliminary results suggest that this mechanism does not produce sufficient heating to account for solar observations. [1] Li, T. C., Drake, J.

            "abstract": "Aerosols and precipitation are among the agents responsible for the ongoing changes in the Arctic climate and the hydrological cycle. The seasonal variations of Arctic aerosols (Arctic haze for e.g.) are linked to the transport efficiency as well as precipitation (wet) scavenging. Aside from affecting aerosol concentrations, precipitation is an important hydrological variable that affects the moisture budget of the atmosphere. Aerosols, in turn, influence the vertical distribution of clouds and this induces changes in the precipitation pattern. The spatial and temporal sparsity of precipitation measurements over the Arctic region means that satellite remote sensing techniques take on an importance that considerably exceeds their role south of the Arctic circle. Radar reflectivity and snow profiles from CloudSat (in support of cloud and precipitation analyses) and backscattering measurements from CALIOP (investigations of aerosol and small cloud particle properties) can be used to study Arctic winter clouds and precipitation and the role of aerosols in their formation.\nIn this study we attempt to validate satellite-based profiling retrievals of precipitation parameters using AHSRL (Arctic High Spectral Resolution Lidar), CRL (CANDAC Raman Lidar) and MMCR (Milli-Meter Cloud Radar) profiles acquired at the PEARL high-Arctic site in Eureka (80 °N, 86 °W), Nunavut, Canada. As part of the process of validating the profiling retrievals we aspire to learn more about the mechanisms controlling aerosol, cloud and precipitation inter-dynamics. In addition, ground-based, high-frequency observations of precipitation will be used for characterizing precipitation totals as well as the conditional probability of the type of precipitation (rain or snow) and thus to help understand and validate comparable information extracted from the satellite retrievals. We also aim to characterize different particle types using AHSRL and CRL depolarization profiles, MMCR Doppler velocity profiles and information garnered from MMCR / lidar effective radius retrievals. Finally, passive measurements of precipitation and possibly modelling simulations will add a contextual and spatial-continuity context to the spatially sparse CloudSat and CALIOP retrievals.",

            "abstract": "Electron heating in collisionless magnetic reconnection is explored in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations with non-zero guide fields so that electrons remain magnetized. We address two important sources of particle energization: electric fields parallel to the magnetic field, and electric fields parallel to the curvature-drift (the latter associated with acceleration by Fermi reflection). In the case of a small guide field (20% of the magnitude of the reconnecting field) the curvature drift is the dominant source of electron heating, while for a larger guide field (equal to the magnitude of the reconnecting component) the electron acceleration by the curvature drift is comparable to that of the parallel electric field. We find that in both simulations, however, acceleration at high electron energies is primarily due to the curvature-drift, which suggests that this mechanism may be more important for the generation of energetic (nonthermal) electrons. Additionally, heating by the curvature-drift is distributed over a large area, while the parallel electric field is localized near X-lines. This in turn suggests that acceleration by parallel electric fields may play a smaller role in large systems where the X-line occupies a vanishing fraction of the system. Finally, both simulations exhibit a significant electron temperature anisotropy due to the parallel heating produced by both curvature-drift acceleration and parallel electric fields. This anisotropy is more pronounced in the simulation with the larger guide field where the electrons are more strongly magnetized.",

There are multiple aquifers within this region used for public consumption, livestock production, and agriculture. Initial observations by the United States Geological Survey and independent residential water quality assessments have identified some wells containing arsenic concentrations an order of magnitude greater than the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Maximum Contaminant Level of 10 parts per billion for drinking water. However, these data are inadequate to characterize the spatial extent of arsenic contamination throughout the basin; it remains unclear which aquifers are contaminated. The basin contains a geology comprised of tuffaceous sedimentary rocks and basalt formations with extensive faulting. Productive wells range in depth from 6 to 240 meters. The present study examines the spatial extent and seasonal variation of arsenic concentrations due to changing water levels stemming from agricultural pumping. These data will aid in the development of a regional model of arsenic contamination throughout the basin.",

            "abstract": "The deformation behavior of quartz and feldspar controls the rheology of large parts of the continental crust. One way to understand the deformation of these abundant and important minerals in the deep crust is to compare their behavior within and outside of naturally-deformed shear zones. To this end, three samples of quartzofeldspathic gneiss within and adjacent to the Salt Mylonite Zone, a discrete ductile deformation zone in the ultrahigh-pressure Western Gneiss Region of Norway, are investigated in terms of microstructure, chemical composition, and fabric. The three samples represent the microstructural variation across the shear zone including grain size variation, layered (quartz ribbon bearing) v. non-layered gneiss, and variation in modal abundance. Layered gneiss is composed of one grain thick, laterally continuous quartz ribbons with plagioclase and accessory phases in the intervening regions. Non-layered gneiss consists of isolated quartz (individual grains or clusters of up to four grains) within an interconnected network of plagioclase and accessory phases. In layered gneiss, quartz preserves a well-developed crystallographic preferred orientation consistent with dominant activation of the prism and rhomb <a> slip systems, and plagioclase preserves a nearly random fabric. Quartz fabrics from layered shear zone gneiss are stronger than those of quartz from layered gneiss outside of the shear zone. In non-layered gneiss, plagioclase develops a fabric that is consistent with activation of the (001) <010> slip system whereas quartz exhibits a random fabric. Plagioclase in all samples is zoned from Na-richer cores to Ca-richer rims (reverse zoning); zoning is weaker outside of the shear zone (average core-to-rim ΔAn 6%) than within the shear zone (average core-to-rim ΔAn 10%). Results suggest a change in plagioclase and quartz deformation mechanisms occurred during decompression and shear zone development owing to strain/strain-rate variation.",

A weak, bimodal seasonal cycle of 2-3‰ exists in northern Borneo rainfall δ18O, with relative minima during winter/summer and relative maxima during spring/fall. The seasonal cycle in rainfall δ18O, however, is poorly correlated to seasonal variations in precipitation amount. As a result, the processes driving rainfall δ18O seasonality at Borneo remain unclear. To better constrain the controlling mechanisms, we compare a 7-yr-long timeseries of daily Borneo rainfall δ18O to overlapping satellite-based measurements of GOSAT and TES tropospheric water vapor δD. To investigate the role of moist processes such as evaporation, condensation, and convection, we explore the relationship between seasonal composites of water vapor δD and specific humidity in the Borneo region. We also use HYSPLIT air mass back-trajectories to differentiate local (e.g. moisture recycling, local convection/evaporation) versus regional (e.g. moisture source region, trajectory, and convective activity) controls on the seasonal isotopic composition of Borneo rainfall. Given the sensitivity of Borneo rainfall δ18O to interannual shifts in the zonal location of deep convection in the western Pacific – which drive rainfall δ18O variations of up to 6-8‰ – we perform similar investigations during the weak-to-moderate and moderate-to-strong ENSO cycles of 2006-2008 and 2009-2011 respectively. With this study, we identify the relative influence of local moist processes as well as meridional and zonal shifts in regional hydrology on past western Pacific hydroclimate variability as revealed by Borneo stalagmite δ18O. More generally, we outline a roadmap for how local high-frequency monitoring of water isotopes in conjunction with satellite-based products can improve interpretations of δ18O-based paleoclimate reconstructions from terrestrial archives.",

The Rhône channel was engineered for navigation prior to 1900, and since then has been dammed and diverted at 18 sites for hydropower and irrigation. We conducted extensive forest inventories and sampled fine sediment depth in regulated reaches within both systems, and compared pre- versus post-dam patterns of deposition and linked forest development. We sampled 441 plots (500 m2 each) along 160 km of the Sacramento, and 88 plots (1256 m2) stratified by management epoch (pre-river engineering, pre-dam, post-dam) along 160 km of the Rhône.\nOn the Sacramento, forest composition showed shifting tree species dominance across a chronosequence of aerial photo dates over 110 years. The transition from willow to cottonwood (Populus) occurred within 20 years, and the transition to mixed forest started after 50-60 years. On the Rhône, the pre- versus post-dam surfaces at each site had distinct geomorphic and floristic characteristics. Floodplain areas that emerged and were forested in the pre-dam period were at higher elevation, and supported 30-50% more basal area, 20-30% more vine cover, and greater plant species diversity than those that emerged in the post-dam period. The shift from Populus dominance to other species began approximately a decade earlier on the Rhône compared to the Sacramento. Both rivers showed a strong understory presence on young floodplains by Acer negundo (box elder), which is non-native and invasive in Europe, suggesting similar processes of colonization and propagation in both systems. Overall, the Sacramento can serve as a predictive reference system for the Rhône, where significant restoration efforts are undeway to improve riparian structure and function in diverted river reaches.",

            "abstract": "Global cooling over the last 5 myrs, from the warm Pliocene to the cold ice ages, is associated with changes in circulation and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Since primary productivity is limited by bioavailable nitrogen (N), fluctuations in the oceanic fixed N inventory potentially played an important role in these cooling trends. This inventory of fixed N is a balance of fixation and denitrification; both processes impart N isotope effects. Published records of increasing N isotopic values of bulk sediment have been interpreted as indicating intensification of denitrification with global cooling. However, most data, such as from California margin ODP Site 1012 (Liu et al., 2007), are from upwelling regions of the east Pacific where changes in N utilization may have occurred, obscuring the signature of changes in the N isotopic value of source nitrate which is affected by denitrification. Our study focuses on Site 1010, located off-shore from Site 1012 in a region of compete N utilization where we can obtain a record of isotopic values of source N, and thus of the evolution of denitrification during global cooling.",

NASA continues to fund efforts to refine the mission design and to examine alternative platforms, such as the International Space Station (ISS), focusing on lower cost implementation while achieving a majority of the CLARREO science objectives. The focus of this presentation will be on progress made since 2010, focusing on smaller, more compact instrument designs and mission architectures. In addition, the presentation will focus on the considerable progress made by the formal Science Definition Team (selected in 2010 and concluding in 2014) in advancing the rigor of climate Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs), comparing CLARREO-like datasets with climate models, defining the complementary applications of CLARREO IR, RS, and GNSS-RO observations for climate signal benchmarking, and advancing the procedures for reference intercalibration.",

In this study a statistical modelling for the estimation of sediment yield based on observations of water discharge and suspended sediment concentration was performed. A multivariate model was used to analyze a 33 years period of daily suspended sediments load available at the La Garrucha gauging station. A regional analysis was conducted to develop a non-dimensional sediment load duration curves. These duration curves were used to estimate flow and sediments regimen at other inner point at the basin where there are located the Calderas reservoir, scaling the suspended sediment load by the basin area. The observed data of sediments in the reservoir were used to validate the model results. The obtained non-dimensional sediment load duration curve was used to estimate the sediment concentration during high flow regimen (10% of time the values were met or exceeded).A periodical reservoir flushing, by the opening of the bottom gate, it is necessary to maintain it at the best operating capacity. The sediment concentration during high flows has been assumed as a concentration that allows an ‘environmental flushing’. The sediment transport capacity for the sediment load was verified with a 1D model in order to include the environmental constraints downstream of the dam. Field data were collected to understand the physical phenomena involved in flushing dynamics into the reservoir and downstream of the dam. The model allows to define an operation rules for the flushing to minimize the environmental effects.",

            "abstract": "The presence of much of the marine dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) pool as uncharacterized, biologically recalcitrant molecules is a central mystery in the marine nitrogen cycle. Radiocarbon (Δ14C) isotopic measurements have been perhaps the most important data constraining the cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM), but little Δ14C data specific to DON is available. Amino acids (AAs) are the major component of DON that can be isolated on a molecular level. Δ14C measurements for the operational “protein-like” fraction of DOM in the deep ocean indicate that this compound class has radiocarbon ages greater than several ocean mixing cycles, suggesting remarkable preservation of labile AAs exported from the surface. However, it is possible that the previously defined operational “protein-like” fraction may also contain non-AA material. Radiocarbon measurement of purified individual AAs would provide a more direct and reliable proxy for DON Δ14C age and cycling rate.\nWe present here Δ14C blank characterization of an AA purification method based on HPLC, with on-line fraction collection. This method allows the recovery of unmodified AAs, but accurate measurement of small AA samples that can be extracted from DOM requires a system with extremely low Δ 14C blanks. Here we assess the impact of HPLC purification on the Δ14C age of known amino acids standards. Individual AA standards with contrasting (modern vs. dead) and well- characterized Δ14C ages were processed in a range of sample sizes. The eluted peaks were collected and dried, and measurement of their post-chromatography Δ14C content allowed for determination of the Δ14C blank by method of additions. The same protocol was applied to a mixture of six AA standards, to evaluate tailing effects in consecutive AA peaks of contrasting Δ14C age. AA standards were selected to include both Δ14C modern and dead AAs that elute both early and late in the chromatographic solvent program. We discuss implications for future Δ14C analysis of AAs purified from DOM by this method.",

            "abstract": "The American Climate Prospectus (ACP), the technical analysis underlying the Risky Business project, quantitatively assessed the climate risks posed to the United States’ economy in a number of economic sectors [1]. The main analysis presents projections of climate impacts with an assumption of “no adaptation”. Yet, historically, when the climate imposed an economic cost upon society, adaptive responses were taken to minimise these costs. These adaptive behaviours, both autonomous and planned, can be expected to occur as climate impacts increase in the future.\nTo understand the extent to which adaptation might decrease some of the worst impacts of climate change, we empirically estimate adaptive responses. We do this in three sectors considered in the analysis - crop yield, crime, and mortality – and estimate adaptive capacity in two steps. First, looking at changes in climate impacts through time, we identify a historical rate of adaptation. Second, spatial differences in climate impacts are then used to stratify regions into more adapted or less adapted based on climate averages. As these averages change across counties in the US, we allow each to become more adapted at the rate identified in step one. We are then able to estimate the residual damages, assuming that only the historical adaptive behaviours have taken place (fig 1).\nImportantly, we are unable to estimate any costs associated with these adaptations, nor are we able to estimate more novel (for example, new technological discoveries) or more disruptive (for example, migration) adaptive behaviours.\nHowever, an important insight is that historical adaptive behaviours may not be capable of reducing the worst impacts of climate change. The persistence of impacts in even the most exposed areas indicates that there are non-trivial costs associated with adaptation that will need to be met from other sources or through novel behavioural changes.\n",

            "abstract": "The highly populated coastal floodplains of the Bengal Delta have a long history of water-related natural calamities such as droughts, floods, and cyclones. Population centers along the floodplain corridors of the GBM (Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna) river system remain vulnerable to such natural hazards and waterborne epidemic outbreaks due to increasing intensity and changing frequency of extreme events over many areas in the delta region. Such changes in hydrologic extremes and resulting environmental conditions would likely lengthen the transmission seasons of prevalent waterborne diseases and alter their geographic range as well as seasonality. In addition, the combination of changing upstream precipitation and temperature, and coastal sea-level rise are exposing a vast area in Southwestern Bangladesh to increased diarrheal disease outbreaks due to higher salinity and water scarcity in the dry season as well as coastal flooding and water resources contamination in the wet season. It is thus essential to establish sustainable safe water access practices in these regions for the rural communities of low-income people.\nThe impact of climate change in the recent past on the people of coastal rural areas of Bangladesh has been severe, and the water sector is one of its biggest victims. Previously, pond and groundwater sources were considered dependable, but salinity intrusion in both water resources have left the vulnerable people with only a few scarce ponds and forced them to depend more on rainwater than before. The poorest group is suffering the most for this crisis even though paying more of the percentage of their income especially in the dry season (December-March). As rainwater is their most preferred and dependable option during this part of the year, outbreaks of waterborne diseases can be minimized by installing rainwater harvesting systems with effective disinfection system at both household and community levels. In this study, we explore the technical feasibility and optimum scales and designs of rainwater-harvesting schemes in areas under changing precipitation patterns and coastal sea-level rise. We present preliminary results based on changing rainfall patterns, water budget analysis, and rainwater harvesting potential.",

            "abstract": "The large amount of carbon stored as biomass in the Amazon Basin makes this area a critically important component of the global carbon cycle. Its importance is compounded by the vulnerability of these carbon stocks to drought, fire and other disturbances. It is not well known how current and future climate changes will impact Amazon carbon stores and fluxes, however, and field-level observations are difficult to scale up due to forest heterogeneity and the immense size of the Basin. Recent efforts to systematically and regularly sample atmospheric CO2 profiles by light aircraft have resulted in an unprecedented view of the integrated signal of net CO2 fluxes in the Amazon. In particular, measurements made over the period of 2010-2013 offer insights into Amazon forest carbon cycling in both dry and wet years. These observations have shown, for example, that during the 2010 drought, the Amazon was less of a sink for atmospheric CO2 than during 2011 (a wetter year). In order to investigate the geographic and temporal patterns of changing sink strengths in response to drought stress, we have developed a regional inversion for fluxes of CO2 in the Amazon Basin for 2010-2013 using these same data. Measurements of CO in the same air samples allow us to perform a second inversion to optimize estimates of biomass burning fluxes. As part of the inversion framework, we have developed novel approaches for prior estimation of and optimization of boundary or background conditions. We use two Lagrangian Transport Models (FLEXPART/GFS and HYSPLIT/GDAS) to estimate the potential influence of convection parameterization on the inversion results. We will show the results of these inversions as well as comparison of our results with satellite observations of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (a proxy for gross primary productivity and water stress) to investigate hot-spots of drought impact on Amazon net CO2 fluxes for 2010-2013.",

            "abstract": "The Beartooth Mountains in Montana and Wyoming, USA, form an extensive exposure of Archean rocks of the Wyoming Craton and are dominantly comprised of a ~2.8 Ga granitoid batholith known as the Long Lake Magmatic Complex (LLMC). Contained within the LLMC are numerous m- to km-scale enclaves of metasedimentary granulites. P-T pseudosection modeling indicates that these granulites reached peak pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions of 800 °C, 7-8 kbar. This has previously been interpreted to result from contact heating with the LLMC. However, substantial field evidence from multiple localities suggests that the texturally dominant phase of HT metamorphism in the metasediments postdates LLMC emplacement. Further, Sm-Nd garnet (grt) dates from the metasediments are in the range ~2.69–2.68 Ga (‘bulk’ dates incorporating crystal cores and rims), ~100 Myrs younger than LLMC emplacement (based on U-Pb zircon ages, 1). Trace element zoning in grt suggests that these dates record the age of granulite facies metamorphism. Euhedral high-Ca overgrowths in Grt from a residual pelite are coincident with a high Eu spike, interpreted to result from plagioclase breakdown during partial melting. These overgrowths are also coincident with high Sm and Nd annuli, and we thus interpret the bulk grt date (2689±4 Ma) to record timing of the late stages of grt growth during migmatisation near peak T. Coupled with major element zoning, retention of Sm and Nd zoning in euhedral grt from the leucosome of another sample suggest that its bulk date (2681±1 Ma) also represents peritectic grt growth rather than subsequent diffusion. Grt from a lithology that did not experience melting records a date of 2686±1 Ma. Together, these ages indicate that granulite facies metamorphism persisted in the area for at least ~3 Myrs (inner bounds of the 2σ dates), ~100 Myrs after batholith emplacement. Limited evidence for this later event in the plutonic rocks is consistent with their experiencing little recrystallization at a peak T of ~ 800 ˚C. HT metamorphism of this age is also recorded in the Teton Range, ~200 km SW of the eastern Beartooths (2), and thus the mechanism for HT metamorphism may have affected a broad region of the Wyoming Craton.\n1 Mueller et al. 2010.

            "abstract": "Existing facies models of submarine lobes suggest a thick, sand-rich proximal and axial part and thin, muddy distal and lateral fringes. This model was developed from observations in many areas where turbidity flows encounter a decrease in slope and collapse, depositing sand proximally and mud distally. This facies model is commonly used to explain stacking patterns encountered in outcrops and wellbores as well as to build reservoir models of lobe deposits.\nA submarine lobe on the modern seafloor of the western Niger Delta slope imaged with three-dimensional seismic data and sampled with 28 piston cores suggests that the traditional lobe facies model is not applicable. Fed by a single channel, the roughly symmetrical (9 km x 8 km) sand body occurs on a low gradient ‘step’ on the slope. The feeder channel ends abruptly at the apex of the lobe as the gradient decreases, and the lobe is not channelized. Seismic amplitudes are high across the lobe, and piston cores validate that these amplitudes correspond to sand. There is no significant change in sand percentage across the lobe, either parallel to or across flow direction. Bed thickness and grain size data do not show a decreasing trend downdip or laterally from the feeder channel. Radiocarbon age dating demonstrates bed-scale compensation across the lobe, with progressively younger turbidite sand beds stepping from north to south during a 2,000 year time interval (15,000-13,000 years before present) before lobe abandonment at 12,000 years before present. This progressive compensation, however, does not result in any facies change or any channelization on the lobe. At the downdip edge of the lobe, steeper gradients led to the development of a knickpoint and associated channel that continues downslope.\nThe even sand distribution, lack of channelization, and downdip knickpoint suggest that the depositing turbidity flows must have been much larger than the accommodation, leading to sand deposition across the entire lobe and significant bypass downslope. The facies patterns seen in this lobe indicates that existing facies models for lobes are not ubiquitously valid and should be applied with caution, particularly in topographically complex settings and areas where flows are suspected to be large relative to the size of the receiving accommodation.",

            "abstract": "Interactions between aqueous solutions and rocks extending from the surface and through the deep mantle control the state and evolution of Earth. The accurate representation of the fluid chemical energy as a function of pressure, temperature and composition over a wide range of conditions is prerequisite in understanding phase equilibria and solubilities in multicomponent systems. End-member thermodynamic properties of water (densities, specific heats, sound speeds, and more) have been extensively explored in a regime below about 100 MPa and an available complex formulation for the Helmholtz free energy (IAPWS-95) accurately represents these data and a smaller number of measurements extending to 1 GPa. However, this parameterization systematically misfits higher pressure data and is not easily adjusted to provide a better description. To address these points, we developed a flexible framework for the acquisition and description of Gibbs’ free energy of water and aqueous solutions. Through use of local basis functions, the thermodynamic state surface can be adjusted to account for improved experimental constraints or for results in new regimes of pressure and temperature. Based on our experimental work on pure water, MgSO4(aq), Na2SO4(aq), and ammonia-water mixtures, new insights are provided on the volumetric behavior of fluids at high pressure. For the ionic solutions, where the partial molar volume at infinite dilution, Vo, is dominated by electrostriction at low pressure, the initial pressure derivative of Vo is large. At high pressure, where Vo is more related to the “size” of the ions, it is only weakly pressure dependent. The non-ideal behavior of these ionic solutions over an extended range of pressures and temperatures is successfully described using a standard three-term parameterization representing solvent (Debye-Hückel), solvent-ion, and ion-ion interactions. The solvent-ion and ion-ion interaction parameters show less dependence on pressure and temperature than Vo or the Debye-Hückel term and non-ideal behavior is generally suppressed at higher pressures.",

The timing of metamorphism during subduction and exhumation in the complex is critical to constraining the age of the India-Asia collision. de Sigoyer et al. (2000) and Leech et al. (2005) reported mean U-Pb ages for thin outer rims of sectioned zircon between 55 ± 6 Ma and 53.3 ± 0.7 Ma, respectively, for the age of peak UHP through retrograde metamorphism, and Leech et al. (2005) used these data to calculate the minimum age for the start of continental subduction at 57 ± 1 Ma. Recently published results for the TMC have reignited debate on the age of metamorphism and thus, the timing of India-Asia collision. We used the same TM38 sample analyzed for the results described in Leech et al. (2005) and performed new SIMS U-Pb depth-profiling analyses to target only the outermost ~1.5 micron rims of zircon. Our results yield a mean age of 44.9 ± 0.7 Ma; adjacent spots for REE analyses yielded positive, enriched HREE profiles with negative Eu anomalies and corresponding Ti-in-zircon temperatures of ~550° to 680° C. Sharp boundaries between zircon domains are clearly resolved with CL and BSE imaging of TM38 zircons, and there is a large age difference between rims and protolith core ages; any mixing during depth-profiling through rims is clear. The positive HREE profiles imply the period of zircon growth in the TMC at c. 45 Ma to be retrograde. We suggest that the 47-43 Ma peak ages and flat heavy REE profiles with no Eu anomaly recently reported by Donaldson et al. (2013) on sectioned zircons, and interpreted as the age of UHP metamorphism of the TMC, may actually represent mixing between zircon rims and cores. The Leech et al. (2005) collision age of 57 ± 1 Ma assumed the TMC represents the leading edge of India. However, numerical modeling of Warren et al. (2008) suggests all exhumed material is derived from the central part of the pro-continental margin 200 km inboard of the ocean-continent transition. Recalculating using the geometric model of Leech et al. (2005) and the 53.3 ± 0.7 Ma age of peak UHP metamorphism yields a revised age of 61.1 ± 1.0 Ma for the entry of northwestern Greater Indian continental crust into the subduction zone beneath the Kohistan-Ladakh arc.",

In many cases, surface efflux is the dominant removal pathway for carbon, however large-scale estimates remain poorly constrained. As part of the ongoing efforts to quantify the carbon sequestration potential of natural ecosystems in the US by the USGS LandCarbon Program, we present the results of a synthesis of available CO2 in streams and rivers, and CO2 and CH4 measurements in lakes across Alaska. For stream carbon, we performed modifications to a synthetic streamline dataset derived from the Elevation Derivatives for National Applications (EDNA) to reflect more recent and accurate climate. Stream and river surface areas only account for 0.54% of the total area of Alaska while preliminary data suggests lakes account for nearly 3.4%. Preliminary analysis suggests 24 Tg-C yr-1 is evaded from fluvial surfaces, with the highest fluxes located in the southeastern region of the state driven by longer periods above freezing, high annual precipitation, and steep topography. We are currently quantifying the uncertainties in these estimates as well as analyzing a new dataset on CO2 and CH4 concentrations in Alaskan lakes.

            "abstract": "The spatial and temporal controls mediating the switch between anaerobic and aerobic respiration within soils located in transitional zones adjacent to ephemeral wetlands remains unclear. As ephemeral wetlands dry down, a soil moisture gradient develops in adjacent transitional zones resulting in changes to the soil environment—moving from anoxic to oxic conditions. Under oxic conditions, aerobic decomposition and CO2 fluxes should dominate, while under anoxic conditions, anaerobic decomposition and CH4 emissions should be more prominent.\nTo investigate the spatial controls and temporal dynamics of anaerobic and aerobic respiration we ran three 20 m transects starting from the late spring peak wetland edge (June 1, 2014 max. lake extent) of Lake Arnold, an ephemeral wetland located at Blandy Experimental Farm in Boyce, Virginia. At 10 m intervals along each transect, high-resolution soil moisture and temperature sensors were installed at three depth levels in the soil (5 cm, 20 cm, and 50 cm). Soil surface CO2 efflux was measured weekly at 5 m intervals using a portable, infra-red gas analyzer and surface chamber (EGM-4 and SRC-1; PP Systems; Amherst, MA). CH4 emissions were sampled weekly using a non-steady state chamber at 10 m intervals along each transect and analyzed in the lab using gas chromatography. Redox potential was measured weekly at two soil depths (5 cm and 20 cm) at 5 m intervals using platinum electrodes and a Ag/Cl reference electrode.\nLake Arnold water levels decreased at a rate of 18.16 mm day-1 during the month of July. Preliminary results show a distinct drop in soil moisture at 5 and 20 cm depths at the 0 and 10 m distances along each transect. At 50 cm, soil moisture shows no distinct trend. Late July measurements of redox potential ranged from -196 mV to 865 mV and was correlated with soil moisture (R2 = 0.52). Rates of soil CO2 efflux were diminished at volumetric water contents (VWC) above 45% (ranging from 2.45 – 7.3 µmol CO2 m-2 sec-1). Below 45% VWC, soil CO2 efflux rates ranged from 4.5 – 9.6 µmol CO2 m-2 sec-1.",

            "abstract": "In CMIP-class GCMs, land tends to \"dry out\" with greenhouse warming outside of the high latitudes, as evaporative demand consistently increases but mean precipitation does not. Soil moisture, relative humidity, and common water-availability indices tend to decline. Yet, paleoclimate evidence is usually interpreted to imply that past greenhouse climates were generally well-watered on land, while glacial periods were generally arid - just the opposite.\nMotivated by this apparent discrepancy, we perform greenhouse warming experiments over a wide range of planetary temperatures with a slab-ocean atmospheric GCM coupled to a simple land-surface water/energy balance model in idealized continental geometry. We assess the results using several nondimensional measures.\nThe mean-state terrestrial aridity strongly depends on the extent of subtropical seaways and on the prescribed ocean heat transport. Unexpectedly, the aridity responses to warming can dramatically differ from the canonical CMIP story. In very wet terrestrial settings, including much of the mid-latitudes and sometimes the tropics as well, precipitation can increase enough to stop evaporative demand from increasing at all. This is a tantalizing analog to the paleo-evidence. However, when the terrestrial tropics are drier, precipitation there declines very strongly with greenhouse warming even as tropical ocean precipitation increases, causing strong aridification. Future work will seek to understand these and other surprising results, and to explain why they do not generally occur in the full GCMs.",

            "abstract": "The role of extreme floods in long-term erosion and landscape evolution is difficult to study because these events occur infrequently on human timescales and cannot often be observed directly. We address this difficulty using the rich sedimentary record of extreme floods preserved within the Siang River valley of the Eastern Himalaya, which hosts slackwater deposits from historical landslide-dam outburst floods and prehistoric glacial lake outburst megafloods sourced upstream of the Tsangpo gorge in Tibet. Previous workers used detrital zircon U-Pb ages of modern river sediments and flood sands to suggest that megafloods more effectively focus erosion in the Tsangpo gorge than modern peak flows and the year 2000 flood; however, this finding is based on only four, undated megaflood deposits, and a thorough investigation of the history, hydraulics, and erosive impact of different magnitude flood events is lacking.\nTo expand this record and better understand the relationship between floods, erosion, and deposition, we combined field observations and dating of flood deposits with sediment provenance constraints and numerical flood modeling. We surveyed the trim line from the 2000 flood and identified two historical and 18 ancient slackwater flood deposits. Radiocarbon dates of megaflood deposits range from 1200-1650 14C yr B.P and correlate with upstream glacial lake terraces in Tibet dated by previous workers. Single-grain infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) dating of feldspar from megaflood deposits produced ages of 10 to 27 ka that correlate to older glacial lake terraces in Tibet. Using reconstructed glacial and landslide-dammed lakes and modern topography, we simulated the 2000 flood and two megaflood events with GeoClaw, an open source program designed to model geophysical flows. Modeled inundation for the 2000 flood is comparable to the observed flood stage, trim line, and distribution of slackwater deposits. Inundation maps from megaflood simulations provide context for interpreting the distribution of dated megaflood deposits, and modeled water velocity and depth are used to map stream power and bed shear stress to predict zones of erosion and deposition to compare with deposit provenance constraints from new detrital zircon U-Pb ages.",

            "abstract": "The Samail Ophiolite, one of the largest and best exposed ophiolite complexes, is a Tethyan ophiolite obducted in the Late Cretaceous onto the formerly passive Arabian platform as Arabia began its most recent >1000 km northward migration towards a Miocene collision with Eurasia. The Oman Mountains, northeastern Arabian Peninsula have yet to collide with Eurasia; present uplift and form of the mountains also date to the Miocene. In addition to the scientific scrutiny of the ophiolite complex, the geologic constraints on the timing and emplacement of the ophiolite are abundant with no consensus on the obduction mechanism or its original tectonic setting. The crustal thickness of the ophiolite is comparable to thicknesses observed for “normal” mid-ocean ridges. Largely on the basis of structural and paleomagnetic arguments, some workers have attributed its origin to Pacific-type fast spreading ridges and complex micro plate geometries. Indeed the lower pillow lava sequences and much of the gabbroic crust have isotope and geochemical signatures consistent with a MORB source. However, because of the geochemistry of the upper pillow lavas, the ophiolite is most often characterized as a supra-subduction zone (SSZ) ophiolite, i.e. it sits in the hanging wall of some large tectonic structure for part of its history. In the absence of a preserved arc, the SSZ designation has little explanatory power only being a declaration of allochthony or about chemical properties of the mantle source. That associated continental shelf and oceanic crustal sections have suffered either clockwise or counterclockwise PT time trajectories requires some type of nascent subduction and hanging wall thrust transport of the young ridge crest. The widespread Late Cretaceous obduction of Tethyan oceanic crust and mantle over thousands of kilometers strike length is a problem for SSZ models (arc, forearc, back arc etc.) because arc initiation results in thick crust on short time scales, none of which is preserved. Similarly, fast spreading models require the subduction of >106 km2 without the initiation and preservation of a magmatic arc. Some Late Cretaceous major plate boundary reorganization that resulted in the current plate motion regime with NNE convergence between Afro-Arabia and Eurasia will be part of any final solution to the Oman problem.",

Here, we report results from a laboratory experiment, field observations, and model simulations that suggest a new explanation for the ecological rarity of C3-C4 intermediate species. In the laboratory experiment, we combined gas exchange and fluorescence to characterize the temperature response of photosynthesis in three closely-related species in the genus Flaveria that are representatives of the C3, C3-C4 intermediate, and C4 photosynthetic pathways. The leaf temperature that maximized the quantum yield for CO2 assimilation (Topt(ΦCO2)) was 24.9 ± 0.7°C in Flaveria robusta (C3), 29.8 ± 1.0°C in F. chloraefolia (C3-C4), and 35.7 ± 0.8°C in F. bidentis (C4), and was linearly related to the temperature sensitivity of the coupling between CO2 assimilation and electron transport (d(ΦCO2/ ΦPSII)/dT)). While F. chloraefolia does not simultaneously occur with F. robusta and F. bidentis in naturally-assembled communities, this C3-C4 intermediate species does occur with other C3 and C4 species. During the growing season in two of these mixed-photosynthetic-type communities, leaf temperatures for F. chloraefolia were similar to the Topt(ΦCO2) determined in the laboratory. A model of maximum potential carbon gain suggests that competitive coexistence of C3, C3-C4 intermediate, and C4 species could be dependent on a temperature regime that highlights the distinct relative advantages of the C3-C4 intermediate pathway.

Placing the occulter on a separate platform offers superior diffraction control but requires an analysis of alignment and separation tolerances that is different from that applied to conventional architectures. New forms of occulter (e.g., an inflatable sphere or ellipsoid) have potential advantages such as low mass and fabrication cost, simple deployment, and less stringent demands on the relative alignment of the platforms. However, the diffraction behavior of occulters that incorporate curved surfaces (Buffington 2000) is less explored than for edge-type occulters. We illustrate the new possibilities by calculating the performance of some candidate systems using an analytic framework adapted from radio wave propagation (Vogler 1985) and alignment tolerances based on a recent concept for a two-platform guidance, navigation, and control system.",

            "abstract": "A strong connection between relativistic radiation belt electron fluxes enhancements and solar wind dynamics has been suggested. By identifying 47 different relativistic electron events during the years 1996 and 2006 using data from GOES 8 and 10 satellites and studying different solar wind parameters, we try to give a better understanding of under what conditions this events will trigger. In order to help distinguish necessary conditions, we also selected 12 dropout events during the same period that did not show flux recovery for a long period. It was found that large solar wind speeds (~450 km/s and up) and low solar wind proton densities (~6 cm-3 or less) are both necessary for relativistic electron events to occur. A drop in Dst index is not strictly necessary, but most events are associated with corotational interaction regions or with coronal mass ejections. However, at least a small amount of southward IMF Bz is necessary. Solar wind ULF power from Alfvenic oscillations seems to have an augmentative role, particularly when southward IMF Bz is low. This can be seen by comparing enhancements to dropout events that occur without enhanced southward Bz of enhanced ULF power, even when solar wind speed and proton density are appropriate for an enhancement to occur.",

These measurements that scan tangents altitudes from 10 km to 65 km have primarily been used to retrieve stratospheric composition including vertical profiles of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphate aerosol and bromine monoxide.\nThe ozone retrieval is done is such a way that it uses the vertical radiance profile at 350 nm as a non-ozone absorbing reference measurement and it is these measurements that have serendipitously indicated the presence of an absorbing aerosol at tropospheric altitudes. At this time there is no indication of the exact composition of this absorber but it has characteristics that are curiously like those of black carbon.

            "abstract": "It is well-recognized that heterogeneous oxidation results in the chemical and physical transformation of organic aerosol during its atmospheric lifetime; however, the importance of this process as a source of volatile oxidized organics and as an aerosol sink is debated with some studies showing a significant loss of mass (and the production of volatile organics) and others indicating that only a minor change occurs on atmospherically relevant time scales. Here, we present results from both laboratory experiments and a simple model showing that the ability for heterogeneous oxidation to act as a sink of (initially) reduced organic aerosol depends on the detailed structure of the particle. For instance, the organic compounds within a well-mixed particle will experience only a few oxidative lifetimes over the particle’s atmospheric lifetime of several days. In the case of reduced organic species (e.g., primary organic aerosol), these early-generation oxidation products will generally be of low enough volatility to remain in the particle phase. As a result, heterogeneous oxidation is an inefficient loss process of organic aerosol, a finding which is consistent with observations from many aerosol flow tube studies. In contrast, an organic coating on a core can undergo numerous oxidative lifetimes in the same timeframe. This can result in dramatic changes to the degree of oxidation state of the organic and even the loss of organic aerosol mass. These results indicate that particle structure and morphology must be considered when assessing the impact of heterogeneous oxidation on organic aerosol chemical composition and lifetime.",

            "abstract": "The American Climate Prospectus (ACP), the analysis underlying the Risky Business project, quantitatively assessed the climate risks posed to the United States’ economy in six sectors - crop yields, energy demand, coastal property, crime, labor productivity, and mortality [1]. The ACP is unique in its characterization of the full probability distribution of economic impacts of climate change throughout the 21st century, making it an extremely useful basis for risk assessments.\nThree key innovations allow for this characterization. First, climate projections from CMIP5 models are scaled to a temperature probability distribution derived from a coarser climate model (MAGICC). This allows a more accurate representation of the whole distribution of future climates (in particular the tails) than a simple ensemble average. These are downscaled both temporally and spatially. Second, a set of local sea level rise and tropical cyclone projections are used in conjunction with the most detailed dataset of coastal property in the US in order to capture the risks of rising seas and storm surge.\nThird, we base many of our sectors on empirically-derived responses to temperature and precipitation. Each of these dose-response functions is resampled many times to populate a statistical distribution. Combining these with uncertainty in emissions scenario, climate model, and weather, we create the full probability distribution of climate impacts from county up to national levels, as well as model the effects upon the economy as a whole.\nResults are presented as likelihood ranges, as well as changes to return intervals of extreme events. The ACP analysis allows us to compare between sectors to understand the magnitude of required policy responses, and also to identify risks through time. Many sectors displaying large impacts at the end of the century, like those of mortality, have smaller changes in the near-term, due to non-linearities in the response functions. Other sectors, like coastal damages, have monotonically increasing costs throughout the 21st century. Taken together, the results from the ACP presents a unique and novel view of the short-, medium-, and long-term economic risks of climate change in the US.\n",

            "abstract": "Transport through the Earth’s plasma sheet and inner magnetosphere is a combination of global-scale convection and mesoscale processes such as flux-tube interchange associated with propagation of bursty bulk flows and dipolarization fronts. It is now clear that mesoscale processes play a significant role in plasma sheet transport on closed magnetic field lines; however, it is not clear if they play a dominant role. In this paper, we will describe initial steps in attempting quantitative modeling of flux-tube interchange processes using a high-resolution version of the Rice Convection Model (RCM) that includes effects of inertial drifts. In our approach, we make three simplifying assumptions: (i) the communication between the equatorial plane and ionosphere occurs either instantaneously or with a given time lag, (ii) the pressure is isotropic and therefore constant along field lines, and (iii) for purposes of calculating the effect of inertia, all of a flux tube's mass is assumed to be concentrated in the equatorial plane. We will present idealized numerical simulations of a depleted flux tube propagation in the magnetosphere and its particle signature as well as auroral consequences. We will also describe the sensitivity of the results to the assumptions made in the inclusion of the inertia effects. Finally, we address the minimum required spatial resolution needed to include the physics of flux-tube interchange processes while describing the global magnetospheric convection on closed field lines.",

Our application research activities specifically contribute to 1) Understanding the natural processes that produce hazards, 2)Developing hazard mitigation technologies, and 3)Recognizing vulnerability of interdependent critical infrastructure. The Natural Disasters Application area selects research projects through a rigorous, impartial peer-review process that address a broad spectrum of disasters which afflict populations within the United States, regionally and globally. Currently there are 19 active projects in the research portfolio which address the detection, characterization, forecasting and response to a broad range of natural disasters including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and ash dispersion, wildfires, hurricanes, floods, tornado damage assessment, oil spills and disaster data mining. The Disasters team works with federal agencies to aid the government in meeting the challenges associated with natural disaster response and to transfer technologies to agencies as they become operational. Internationally, the Disasters Area also supports the Committee on Earth Observations Working Group on Disasters, and the International Charter on Space and Disasters to increase, strengthen, and coordinate contributions of NASA Earth-observing satellites and applications products to disaster risk management.

            "abstract": "Over the past 15 years, Global Positioning System (GPS) has been frequently used as a scientific tool to detect potential earth mass movements and to track creeping landslides. In this study, we investigated four-years of continuous GPS data (September 2006-July 2010) recorded at a landslide site in Alaska. This GPS station (AC55) was installed on an un-identified creeping site by the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) project, which was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation. The landslide moves with a steady horizontal velocity of 5.5 cm/year toward NEE, and had a subsidence rate of 2.6 cm/year. There was a considerable correlation between annual snow loading and melting cycles and seasonal variations of the landslide displacements. The seasonal movements vary year to year with an average peak-to-peak amplitude of 1.5 cm and 1.0 cm in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. This study addresses three challenging issues in applying GPS for landslide monitoring in tectonically active and cold regions. The three challenges include (1) detecting GPS-derived positions that could be contaminated by the snow and ice accumulated on GPS antennas during cold seasons, (2) establishing a precise local reference frame and assessing its accuracy, and (3) excluding local seasonal ground motions from GPS-derived landslide displacements. The methods introduced in this study will be useful for GPS landslide monitoring in other tectonically active and/or cold regions.",

Global ice cover, thick enough to block the transmission of light, would have prohibited the survival of photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms living under the ice cover. Fossil records indicate these organisms persisted during the Snowball Earth glaciations. The persistence of these organisms presents a complication to the Snowball Earth theory. If the Earth’s oceans were unable to survive in planet’s ocean during the Snowball Earth events, then in what environments did these organisms survive?\nPreviously, our research has shown that narrow arms of the ocean, analogous to the modern Red Sea, could have been refugia for photosynthetic eukaryotes during Snowball Earth events. We have demonstrated that for a limited range of climate conditions, ice flow into an arm of the sea is restricted sufficiently to allow for the sea to remain partially free from sea-glacier penetration, a necessary condition for these regions to act as a refugia for photosynthetic eukaryotes during a Snowball Earth event. Presently, we demonstrate that thin-ice zones can form on the leeward sides of obstructions in channels. These thin-ice zones, which we call ice shadows, may have acted as refugia for photosynthetic eukaryotes during Snowball Earth events. We test the ability of ice shadows to form in channels where, in the absence of an obstruction, sea-glacier ice would be thick enough to prohibit the transmission of light. We find that ice shadows can form behind obstructions of various sizes and over a range of climate conditions. This research adds to the range of environments where photosynthetic eukaryotes may have survived during the Snowball Earth events.",

            "abstract": "Estuaries are productive ecosystems that ameliorate nutrient and metal contaminants from surficial water supplies. At the intersection of terrestrial and aquatic environments, estuarine sediments host major microbially-mediated geochemical transformations. These include denitrification (the conversion of nitrate to nitrous oxide and/or dinitrogen) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Denitrification has historically been seen as the predominant nitrate attenuation process and functions as an effective sink for nitrate. DNRA has previously been believed to be a minor nitrate reduction process and transforms nitrate within the ecosystem to ammonium, a more biologically available N species. Recent studies have compared the two processes in coastal environments and determined fluctuating environmental conditions may suppress denitrification, supporting an increased role for DNRA in the N cycle. Nitrate availability and salinity are factors thought to influence the membership of the microbial communities present, and the nitrate reduction process that predominates. The aim of this study is to investigate how nitrate concentration and salinity alter the transcript abundances of N cycling functional gene markers for denitrification (nirK, nirS) and DNRA (nrfA) in estuarine sediments at the mouth of the hypernutrified Old Salinas River, CA. Short-term whole core incubations amended with artificial freshwater/artificial seawater (2 psu, 35 psu) and with varying NO3- concentrations (200mM, 2000mM) were conducted to assess the activity as well as the abundance of the nitrate-reducing microbial populations present. Gene expression of nirK, nirS, and nrfA at the conclusion of the incubations was quantified using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). High abundances of nirK, nirS, and nrfA under particular conditions coupled with the resulting geochemical data ultimately provides insight onto how the aforementioned factors influence N cycling related gene expression and rates of nitrate reduction.",

            "abstract": "Archean cratons are considered stable regions that have basically remained undeformed since the Precambrian, forming the ancient cores of the continents. While this is certainly true with respect to episodes of thoroughgoing ductile deformation, recent research indicates that shields are not nearly as mechanically stable within the field of environmental conditions leading to brittle deformation. Structural and illite K-Ar geochronological studies on fault gouges point to a significant mechanical instability, wherein large volumes of 'stable' rocks can become saturated with fractures and brittle faults soon after exhumation to below 300-350° C. Indeed, old crystalline basements present compelling evidence of long brittle deformation histories, often complex and thus challenging to unfold.\nWe use the Svecofennian Shield (SS) as an example of a supposedly 'stable' craton to show that it is possible to unravel the details of brittle histories spanning more than 1.5 Gyr. New structural and geochronological results from Finland are integrated with a review of existing data from Sweden to explore how the effects of far-field stresses are partitioned within a shield, which was growing progressively saturated with fractures as time passed from its initial consolidation. Comparison of time-constrained paleostress data from different locations of the shield shows a remarkably similar stress evolution through time, despite the different local geological boundary conditions. This suggests that the southern SS has behaved as a mechanically coherent block since the Late Mesoproterozoic, time when it had already reached structural maturity with respect to the saturation of brittle features. Structural reactivation rather than generation of new fractures is the key mechanism that has controlled the mechanical evolution of the shield and that will steer its future brittle evolution. Similar brittle histories within different domains of the shield also imply that far-field stresses can propagate over large distances and lead to similar deformational histories, with the local geology only playing a second-order role on the final brittle strain pattern recorded by the rock.",

Many of these partly oxidized molecules have functional groups (chromophores) that absorb at the ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths available in the troposphere (λ ≳ 290 nm). We used the explicit chemical model GECKO-A (Generator of Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics for Organics in the Atmosphere) to estimate UV absorption cross sections for the gaseous and particulate components of SOA from different precursors (biogenic and anthropogenic) and formed in different environments (low and high NOx, day and night).

            "abstract": "An in-depth analysis and synthesis of published and newly acquired data on the chemical and isotopic composition of forearc fluids, fluid fluxes, and the associated thermal regimes in five well-studied, representative erosional and accretionary subduction zone (SZ) forearcs will be presented. Evidence of large-scale fluid flow, primarily focused along faults, is manifested by widespread seafloor venting, associated biological communities, authigenic carbonate formation, chemical and isotopic anomalies in pore-fluid depth-profiles, and thermal anomalies. The nature of fluid venting seems to differ at the two types of SZs. At both, fluid and gas venting sites are primarily associated with faults. At accretionary SZs, the décollement and underthrust coarser-grained stratigraphic horizons are the main fluid conduits, whereas at non-accreting and erosive margins, the fluids from compaction and dehydration reactions are to a great extent partitioned between the décollement and focused conduits through the prism.\nThe measured fluid output fluxes at seeps are high, ~15-40 times the amount that can be produced through local steady-state compaction, suggesting additional fluid sources or non-steady-state fluid flow must be involved. Recirculation of seawater must be an important component of the overall forearc output fluid flux.\nThe most significant chemical and isotopic characteristics of the expelled fluids relative to seawater are: Cl dilution, sulfate, Ca and Mg depletions, and enrichments in Li, B, Si, Sr, alkalinity, and hydrocarbon concentrations; they often have distinctive δ18O, δD, δ7Li, δ11B, and δ37Cl values, and variable Sr isotope ratios. These characteristics provide key insights on the source of the fluid and the temperature at the source.\nUsing our best fluid output flux estimate and considering an ocean volume of 1340 × 106 km3, the global ocean residence time in SZs is ~100 Myr. This value is five times faster than previous estimates for SZs and is more similar to the estimates of the residence time in the global ridge crest that range from 20-90 Myr. Based on this extrapolated fluid reflux to the global ocean, SZs are an important source and sink for several elements and isotopic ratios, in particular an important sink for seawater sulfate, Ca, Mg, and sulfate, and an important source of B and Li.\n ",

            "abstract": "The Prati-32 injection test offers a particular opportunity to test rock physics theories and tomography results as it occurred in a previously undisturbed portion of The Geysers, California. Within the northwest Geysers, there is a high temperature zone (HTZ) directly below the normal temperature reservoir (NTR) at ∼2.6 km below ground surface. We demonstrate an analysis of micro-earthquake data with rock physics theory to identify fractures, state of fluids, and permeable zones. We obtain earthquake source properties (hypocenters, magnitudes, stress drops, and moment tensors), 3D isotropic velocity (Vp and Vs) and attenuation (Qp and Qs seismic quality factors), derived elastic moduli (Lambda, Bulk and Young's moduli), and Poisson's ratio. After one month of injection changes in these parameters occur right at the point where injection occured, which confirms the accuracy of the tomography. Bulk modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Lambda increased. Vs decreased. Qp and Vp increased slightly and Qs did not change. We interpret this observation to indicate that there is fluid saturation along with fracturing around the well bottom. Fracturing would decrease Vs, while saturation would not affect Vs. Whereas, saturation would increase Vp, even with fracturing. Saturation and fracturing should have competing effect of intrinsic and extrinsic Q. Saturation should increase intrinsic Qp, but not affect extrinsic Qp. We can't explain the unchanged Qs, unless the effect of increasing intrinsic Qs is offset by a decrease in extrinsic Qs. Poisson's ratio, and Lambda increased, which is another indication of saturation. After two months of injection, as compared to one month before injection. Bulk modulus and Vp have returned to values comparable to before injection for the volume around the well bottom. A new anomaly in Vp has moved below the well. Vs continues to be low and Lambda and Poisson's ratio continue to be high compared to before injection. These changes have not moved, but increased in size. We interpret these observations to indicate continued saturation, but with increased fracturing. Only Vp and bulk modulus have changed significantly and this is due to the increased fracturing offsetting the saturation.",

            "abstract": "Late Cretaceous to Oligocene deposits of the foreland basin of the South Central Pyrenees provide a record of the uplift and erosion of the Pyrenean Orogeny and spatial and temporal changes in depositional environments related to the structural evolution of the basin. A significant part of the stratigraphic record is preserved across multiple segments of the depositional profile providing an opportunity for the study of sedimentary systems from source to sink.\nIn this study, U-Pb radioisotope analyses of detrital zircon grains from Eocene sandstones of different ages and sedimentary environments were used to determine sediment source, timing of sediment input, and distribution across the foreland basin fill. The dominate age population is 270-360 Ma and likely reflects Hercynian granitic sources located in the axial zone of the Pyrenees. Most samples have a secondary age population corresponding to the Cadomian Orogeny rocks currently exposed in the eastern Pyrenees. We can identify two statistically significant suites of detrital zircon age populations: one with a mixed range of ages; and one with a dominance of Hercynian ages. The mixed suite is present throughout the stratigraphic sections studied, and is interpreted to represent the mixing of different aged sediment source rocks and the recycling of older sediments that persisted throughout much of the basin fill. The Hercynian-rich samples occur late in the stratigraphic succession, but occur temporally and spatially with the mixed suite. These are interpreted to represent higher influxes of sediment from the erosion of localized plutons in a smaller catchment area.\nDetrital zircon signatures observed in these samples provide an opportunity to link foreland basin sedimentary fill to sources in the hinterland, delineate potential drainage systems, and resolve episodes of uplift and exhumation in the Pyrenees. Sediment signal fingerprinting and propagation is further enhanced using U-Pb age depth-profiling of detrital zircon grains. This approach allowed for resolution of polyphase zircon growth, which can be highly distinctive of potential sediment sources. Integrating these results with the stratigraphic and structural framework of the basin refines our understanding of the controls on sediment delivery and their impact in the stratigraphic record.",

            "abstract": "Water scarcity presents a crucial challenge for water resource managers charged with maintaining hydrologic resources for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use while protecting natural systems. Forest lands are critical to the functioning of the hydrologic cycle in many watersheds, affecting the quantity, quality, and timing of water delivered to surface and groundwater systems. While the hydrologic impacts of forest growth and removal have been shown to be substantial in watersheds around the globe, data and models connecting forest management to water use and regional hydrology are generally lacking. We propose that water-focused forest management has the potential to deliver a “new” source of water to surface and groundwater resources. To test this hypothesis, we developed a statistical model of water yield in southeastern US pine stands as a function of forest stand structure and ecosystem water use. Model results suggest a potential increase in water yield of up to 64% for pine stands managed at lower basal areas relative to those managed according to standard silvicultural practices. At the watershed scale, the magnitude of this potential water yield enhancement is driven by existing land use and forest management; evaluated for a large watershed in NE Florida, this potential increase is in excess of 200 million gallons per day (equivalent to 20% of the anthropogenic water use in the watershed). While useful for exploration, our statistical model also highlighted critical sources of uncertainty, including the effects of climatic variation, between-site variability, water use in young pine stands, and prescribed fire. Thus, in ongoing work we are comparing the effects of specific land management actions (e.g., thinning, clearcutting, and fire) on water yield across a gradient of environmental conditions (soil type, aquifer confinement, and climate) using a novel combination of in-situ soil moisture and groundwater monitoring. These data are being used to derive management-water yield relationships to guide watershed-scale strategies for sustaining regional water resources in the southeastern US, which is facing projections of greater water scarcity driven both by a growing population and a warming climate.",

            "abstract": "Water shortages, and the prospect of such shortages, have been repeatedly faced and addressed as population and economic growth placed increasing demands on available water over the past century. Such challenges have been most common in arid areas, but also have been encountered in some more humid portions of the US during times of drought. The challenges have been met using a wide range of adaptation measures, from large infrastructure projects (e.g., major trans-basin diversions) to alterations in local water prices (e.g., increasing block pricing). The future may bring even greater adaptation challenges as, in addition to continued growth in population, climate change will reduce water supplies in many locations. In this study we report on the relative importance of changes in demand versus changes in supply in causing projected future shortages in basins throughout the contiguous U.S. under different sets of socioeconomic and climatic conditions. We then examine the degree to which projected shortages can be avoided through adaptation. The adaptations examined include reductions in demand of major water use sectors, alterations in water management infrastructure, and inter-basin water transfers.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic data indicate that faults offshore of Southern California accommodate 6-8 mm/yr of dextral Pacific-North American relative plate motion. In the Inner California Borderlands (ICB), modern strike-slip deformation is overprinted on topography formed during plate boundary reorganization 30-15 Ma. Despite its proximity to urban Southern California, the hazard posed by active faults in the ICB remains poorly understood.\nWe acquired a 4000-line-km regional grid of high-resolution, 2D multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection data and multibeam bathymetry to examine the fault architecture and tectonic evolution of the ICB. We interpret the MCS data using a sequence stratigraphic approach to establish a chronostratigraphy and identify discrete episodes of deformation. We present our results in a regional fault model that distinguishes active deformation from older structures.\nSignificant differences exist between our model of ICB deformation and existing models. Mounting evidence suggests a westward temporal migration of slip between faults in the ICB. In the eastern ICB, slip on the Newport-Inglewood/Rose Canyon fault and the neighboring Coronado Bank fault (CBF) diminishes to the north and appears to decrease over time. Undeformed Late Pliocene sediments overlie the northern extent of the CBF and the breakaway zone of the purported Oceanside Blind Thrust. Therefore, CBF slip rate estimates based on linkage with the Palos Verdes fault to the north are unwarranted. Deformation along the San Mateo, San Onofre, and Carlsbad trends is best explained as localized deformation resulting from geometrical complexities in a dextral strike-slip fault system. In the western ICB, the San Diego Trough fault (SDTF) offsets young sediments between the US/Mexico border and the eastern margin of Avalon Knoll, where the fault is spatially coincident with the San Pedro Basin fault (SPBF). Farther west, the San Clemente fault (SCF) has a strong linear bathymetric expression. The length and simplicity of the SDTF and the SCF traces suggest that these faults may accommodate the majority of the contemporary ICB dextral deformation. Kinematic linkage between the SDTF and the SPBF increases the potential rupture length for earthquakes on either fault and may allow events nucleating on the SDTF to propagate much closer to the LA Basin.",

            "abstract": "The River Nile is the main source of fresh water in Egypt. Most of Egypt’s River Nile water (>85%) originates as precipitation over the Ethiopian highlands and is channeled by the Blue Nile. The construction (years: 2011 to 2017) of the Renaissance Dam (reservoir capacity: 70 x 109m3) on the Blue Nile poses an extreme threat to Egypt’s population. If the reservoir was to be filled in 7 years, Egypt will lose (during each of 7 years following dam completion) a minimum of 15 x 109m3 of its annual allocation (55 x 109m3) to reservoir filling (10 x 109m3), evaporation (3.5 x 109m3), and infiltration (1.5 x 109m3). Three solutions are proposed: Solution I takes advantage of the cyclicity of Nile floods and is based on findings from a calibrated (against temporal head data) unconfined 2-dimensional transient groundwater flow model for Lake Nasser and surroundings and a calibrated (against lake levels) surface water model. Models show with time: (1) losses to infiltration will decrease (1975-193: 58.4 109m3; 1993-2001: 43.6 x 109m3) due to silting of Lake bottom and encroachment of excess Lake Nasser water will increase (e.g., 1975-1993: none; 1993-2001: 17 x 109m3). We propose to develop sustainable agricultural in the Western Desert: (1) In high flood years, excess Lake Nasser water (e.g., 1993-2001: 17 x 109m3) is channeled across the plateau bounding (from west) the River Nile valley to artificially recharge the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS) that crops out west of the plateau and, (2) in low flood years, we extract the recharged groundwater. Solution II calls on mining the NSAS at reasonable rates. Using temporal (January 2003 – September 2012) Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data we estimate the annual depletion rates at 2 x 109m3 due to artificial extraction (1.5 x 109m3) and natural discharge (0.5 x 109m3). Assuming current GRACE depletion rates, the recoverable groundwater (5,180 x 109m3) will last for 2500 years; if we were to quadruple the artificial extraction rates (6 x 109m3), the reservoir will last for some 800 years. Solution III calls on the sustainable utilization of the NSAS groundwater in Sinai that receives an estimated minimum annual modern recharge of 13 x 106m3. Currently, these waters are lost as discharge in water bodies and/or diverted across political boundaries by major NE trending fault systems.",

            "abstract": "Drawdown flushing of a reservoir is often part of a reservoir sediment management program. Flushing can deliver higher than normal sediment loads to the river channel located downstream of a reservoir. The flushed sediment may contain a higher proportion of finer sediment than what was delivered to a channel prior to the presence of the reservoir. The extent of long-term impacts caused by the flushed sediment on the channel morphology and habitat will in part depend on the residence time of the sediment within the channel. In this study we used MIKE 21C to model the fate of flushed sediment through a river channel where the bed material consists of an armoring layer of gravels overlying finer sediment. MIKE 21C is a two-dimensional curvilinear morphological model for rivers developed by DHI. Curvilinear means that the model grid may curve to better follow the channel and flow direction, for example in a meandering channel. Multiple bed material layers are included in the model to represent the armoring and underlying layers existing in the bed separately from the overlying flushed sediment. These layers may also mix. The nature of the interactions between these two layers helps regulate transport and deposition of the flushed sediment, thus are critical to assessing the fate of the flushed sediment and associated potential impacts.",

            "abstract": "Determining the nature of the individual constituents of Saturn’s main rings is one of the science goals of the Cassini mission. However, after many studies on Saturn’s main rings, there is still no clear big picture about how the ring individual constituents relate to each other. On the one hand, since the 80's, the modeling of near-infrared spectra has indicated the presence of small, micron-sized constituents, referred to as ‘grains’. On the other hand, Voyager and further missions have probed larger rocks (with a power law size distribution ranging from 0.1 to 10 meters) that have been called ‘particles’. The standard model of Saturn’s main rings constituents is that the ‘grains’ form a regolith covering those ‘particles’. However, this standard model has not been completely validated yet. Specifically, it is put to question by the existence of free grains in the B ring (responsible for the spokes), and indications that the some of biggest grains are larger than the smallest particles (Morishima et al., 2013, Icarus, 221, 888–899). Our recent study (Déau, 2014 Icarus, In press) has hypothesized that grains and particles belong to a single continuous set, characterized by a fractal size distribution. This new hypothesis reconciles de facto the two cited outliers of the standard model with the previous size distributions. The objective of our work is to conduct an in-depth investigation of this new hypothesis. We use N-body simulations using a fractal size distribution and a power law distribution, and we compare the results of these simulations with very specific Cassini observations. We will present the results of these comparisons and show how they affect our understanding of the size distribution of the ring particles.",

            "abstract": "Despite scientific consensus that the climate is changing, local efforts to prepare for and manage climate change risks remain limited. How we can raise concern about climate change risks and enhance local readiness to adapt to climate change’s effects? In this presentation, we will share the lessons learned from the New England Climate Adaptation Project (NECAP), a participatory action research project that tested science-based role-play simulations as a tool for educating the public about climate change risks and simulating collective risk management efforts. NECAP was a 2-year effort involving the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Consensus Building Institute, the National Estuarine Research Reserve System, and four coastal New England municipalities. During 2012-2013, the NECAP team produced downscaled climate change projections, a summary risk assessment, and a stakeholder assessment for each partner community. Working with local partners, we used these assessments to create a tailored, science-based role-play simulation for each site. Through a series of workshops in 2013, NECAP engaged between 115-170 diverse stakeholders and members of the public in each partner municipality in playing the simulation and a follow up conversation about local climate change risks and possible adaptation strategies. Data were collected through before-and-after surveys administered to all workshop participants, follow-up interviews with 25 percent of workshop participants, public opinion polls conducted before and after our intervention, and meetings with public officials. This presentation will report our research findings and explain how science-based role-play simulations can be used to help communicate local climate change risks and enhance local readiness to adapt.",

            "abstract": "Uranium, along with the other long-lived radioactive elements Th and K, are important heat sources in the Earth, contributing as much as 50% of the total heat flux at the surface.[1] However, it is unknown whether these elements are also an important heat source in the core.\nPrevious metal-silicate partitioning experiments of U have noted an increase in partition coefficient (D(U)) with decreasing oxygen fugacity and increasing S content. Regardless, they conclude that the partition coefficients are too low, even under the most extreme conditions, for U to be an important heat source in the Earth’s core. However, all of those experiments were conducted at relatively low pressures (<29 GPa) and moderate temperatures (<2700 K). We present metal-silicate partitioning experiments conducted in the diamond anvil cell at conditions more relevant to a basal magma ocean, 40-55 GPa in pressure and 3700-4900 K in temperature. Under relatively reducing conditions (ΔIW= -1.5 to -2.5, with 15-30 wt% Si in the metal) and with no sulfur present, we measure partition coefficients for U in the range of 0.01-0.1, significantly higher than has been previously reported. From these results, we are unable to rule out the possibility that U is a significant heat source in the core.\n[1] Lay, et al. 2008. Nature Geo. 1, 25-32.\n[2] Bouhifd, et al. 2013.

            "abstract": "Meltwater that forms on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet and falls to the ice sheet bed eventually emerges at the calving front as tan, turbid plumes of water. Adjacent to the ice, these meltwater plumes foster mixing in the fjord moving warm ocean water into contact with the front of the ice sheet where it can undercut the ice front and trigger calving. The dynamics of meltwater plumes is difficult to study due to their proximity to the steep calving fronts and their intermittent nature.\nIn July 2014 the IcePod, the ice-ocean imaging system mounted on a New York Air National Guard LC-130, surveyed the 5 glaciers just north of Jakobshavn Isbrae, each of which had an active meltwater plume. The IcePod system has core instrumentation that can resolve high-resolution surface elevations with a scanning laser and visual cameras, the temperature of the surface with an infrared camera, and the structure of snow and ice with two radar systems. For the study of plume dynamics, the key IcePod observations include: (1) the morphology of the calving front captured with the visual camera and the scanning laser and (2) thermal structure, velocity and turbulence of the plume water resolved with the infrared camera. In the future, an expanded IcePod capability will include an AXCTD launching system to recovery the hydrography of the fjord and the plumes.\nThe IcePod survey directly crossed 3 of the 5 meltwater plumes on two subsequent days. The plumes sampled multiple times were Sermeq Avangnardleq A that drains into the Jakobshavn Isbrae Fjord, Eqip Sermia and Sermia Kangilerngata. While each of the ice feeding these three adjacent fjords has experienced the same surface melting conditions the structure of the meltwater plumes was very different in each fjords. Sermeq Avangnardleq A had a narrow angular shaped plume nestled in an embayment in the calving front, Eqip Sermia had two broad diffuse plumes and Sermia Kangilerngata had a narrow circular plume in an ice choked fjord. We use particle image velocimetry (PIV), a method to measure velocities in fluid, to resolve the varying turbulence in the individual plumes. The variability of these 5 plumes, within the hydrologic framework of their catchments, provides insights into the role of meltwater in fjord circulation, transport, and mixing.",

            "abstract": "Magmatism at magmatic rifted margins is dominated by asthenospheric melts generated during decompression melting from the upwelling asthenosphere. However reported magma compositions are diverse, giving clues about additional processes during rifting and continental rupture. We report here on adakites from the U.S. East Coast that are related to breakup of the North Atlantic. The sampled adakites are bi-modal, and show a clear high-Si and low-Si major and trace element chemistry. During the closure of the proto-Atlantic and its related back-arc basins, the Appalachian lithosphere sampled an ophiolitic mélange within major sutures. Subsequent metamorphic events in the Blue Ridge province of the U.S. East Coast increased the rock density of the ophiolites (eclogite) and partly hydrated these mafic to ultramafic rocks. Such a preconditioned lithosphere will likely develop gravitational instabilities at the asthenosphere-lithosphere boundary during rifting. We use geodynamic models to show when gravitational instabilities form below the East Coast margin, and how they eventually delaminate mantle lithosphere and lower crust material. After foundering, the delaminated lithosphere undergoes metamorphism, heats up, and interacts with fluids and melts in the surrounding convecting mantle. Partial melting of this metamorphic lithology produces high-Si adakitic melts. These melts percolated upwards through the mantle and were partially injected into the Valley and Ridge province. Where melt-to-peridotite (asthenosphere) ratios were small, the melts and fluids leaving the sinking lithospheric block became fixed within the peridotites. Geochemical modeling suggests, that 5 to 10% melting degrees of such a metasomatically overprinted and fertile asthenosphere produced the low-Si adakitic rocks of the Virginia adakites.",

They, along with dust, play an important role in modifying the spectral AAOD and the spectral AOD in the UV region: this property can be used to discriminate BrC aerosols from both weakly absorbing aerosols such as sulfates as well as strongly absorbing aerosols such as black carbon (BC). In this study we use available AERONET inversions (level 1.5) retrieved for the measuring period from 2009 to 2013, for the Arctic region (Eureka, Barrow and Hornsund), Urban/ Industrial regions (Kanpur, Beijing), and the forest regions (Alta Foresta and Mongu), to identify BrC aerosols. Using Dubovik’s inversion algorithm results, we analyzed parameters that were sensitive to BrC presence, notably AAOD, AAODBrC estimated using the approach of Arola et al. [2011], the fine-mode-aerosol absorption derivative (αf, abs) and the fine-mode-aerosol absorption 2nd derivative (αf, abs'), all computed at a near UV wavelength (440 nm). Temporal trends of these parameters were investigated for all test stations and compared to available volume sampling surface data as a means of validating / evaluating the sensitivity of ostensible sunphotometer indicators of BrC aerosols to the presence of BrC as measured using independent indicators.\n",

            "abstract": "While there have been a number of campaigns designed to probe dust-climate interactions over much of the world, relatively little attention has been paid to the Red Sea. Because of the remoteness of the area, satellite retrievals provide a crucial tool for assessing aerosol loading over the Sea. However, agreement between aerosol properties inferred from measurements from different instruments, and even in some cases from the same measurements using different retrieval algorithms can be poor, particularly in the case of mineral dust. Ground based measurements, which can be used to evaluate retrievals, are thus highly desirable. Here we take advantage of ship-based hand-held sun-photometer (microtops) observations gathered within the framework of NASA Aerosol Maritime Network from a series of cruises, which took place across the Red Sea during 2011 and 2013. To our knowledge these data represent the first set of detailed aerosol measurements from the Sea. They thus provide a unique opportunity to assess the performance of satellite retrieval algorithms in this region.\nHere we used the microtops measurements to evaluate the performance of co-located satellite retrievals from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) and the MODerate Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Both algorithms show good agreement with the ship-based measurements and with each other, although it appears that the MODIS cloud detection scheme in particular is rather conservative. The stand alone Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM) driven by reanalysis meteorological fields is used to estimate the cloud-free aerosol direct radiative effect at the surface and TOA along the ship tracks. The TOA effects are compared to co-located measurements from the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instrument. Having evaluated both the quality of the retrievals and the ability of the model to capture the associated radiative effect, we will present a climatology of aerosol loading over the Red Sea using 5 years of SEVIRI data. We use this climatology to simulate the associated cloud-free direct radiative effect due to aerosol in order to quantify the climatological impact of aerosol on the radiative energy budget of the region.",

We present composite UV-IR spectra (0.1-5 microns) of the leading and trailing hemispheres of the icy moons using data from Cassini supplemented with spectra from Hubble Space Telescope (STIS). We use data of Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione and Rhea from the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS), the Imaging Subsystem (ISS) and the Visual-Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) taken during simultaneous measurements, or using similar observational geometries. The well-studied phase curve behaviors of the satellites are utilized to readily combine Earth-based STIS data with the Cassini datasets to create composite spectra.\nFocusing primarily on the UV-visible region so far, we find that the spectra of all satellites are bright and spectrally relatively flat at visible wavelengths longer than 500-600 nm; shortward of 500-600 nm the surfaces become absorbing with wavelength, resulting in reddish spectra. The satellites exhibit flattish-to-bowl-shaped spectra in the ~200-350 nm range and demonstrate the 165 nm water ice absorption edge, in varying strengths. These composite spectra are used to study the system-wide surface compositions of the satellites to understand large-scale exogenic effects (e.g., E-ring grain bombardment and radiolytic processing) at a variety of regolith sensing depths, and in particular to study implications for the presence and distribution of organics, ammonia, and other non-H2O-ice species in the system.",

            "abstract": "Widespread use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate resource production from unconventional reservoirs necessitates the development of a fundamental understanding for this process. Our research focuses on a synthesis of three sets of data to better understand geochemical and mineralogic aspects of the process of hydraulic fracturing, including laboratory experiments, field data, and geochemical modeling. Experiments examine fluid-rock interaction using rock samples from the Niobrara and Frontier Formations, two unconventional reservoirs within the Powder River Basin of NE Wyoming. Experiments react reservoir rocks with a representative hydraulic fracturing fluid for 28 days at 115°C and 350 bars. Fresh water and common chemicals, including HCl and petroleum distillates, used in hydraulic fracturing comprise the experimental fluid. Mineral reaction to the acidic fluid (pH ~2.35) causes immediate buffering, bringing fluid pH to near-neutral conditions after ~6 hours. Al initially spikes in the first 6 hours by ~10X, but returns to lower concentrations within 12 hours. Fe, Ba, Co, Mn, Sb, and Cr follow similar trends. Contemporaneously, Sr, Mo, Li, W, V, and Rb increase dramatically and remain at elevated levels. Changes in trace element concentrations correlate with clay alteration, calcite dissolution, and feldspar dissolution observed within reacted rock samples. Fluid samples are compared to produced-water chemistry from active wells in the field, enhancing our understanding of geochemical reactions occurring at depth. Lastly, produced fluid chemistry from both field samples and experiments are tethered together using preliminary geochemical models. These models predict calcite and feldspar reaction as well as new clay formation. This research ties together a limited population of produced water data with reservoir mineralogy to enhance fundamental understanding of fluid-rock interactions in unconventional reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "We present a paleovegetation and paleofire record from Lago Cipreses (51°S), SW Patagonia, to explore millennial and centennial-scale hydroclimate changes over the last 10,000 years. Local and regional precipitation exhibits a positive correlation with the southern westerly wind (SWW) intensity, supporting rainforests and icefields along the western slopes of the Andes. Recent studies along western Patagonia detected an association between tree-ring-dated paleofires and negative anomalies in precipitation/positive anomalies in temperature associated with positive phases of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Hence, hydrologic inferences based on paleovegetation, past lake-level changes and paleofire-regime shifts from southwestern Patagonia constitute a valuable source of information for reconstructing past variations of the SWW and SAM. The Lago Cipreses record shows dominance of Magellanic forests with varying degrees of openness in response to temperature and precipitation changes. Closed-canopy forests dominated between 10-9.3 and 7.5-6 ka, indicating cool/wet phases, alternating with an open forest interval between 9.3-7.5 ka during the warm/dry Early Holocene, and followed by a highly variable phase over the last 6000 years. Within the latter we detect centennial-scale variations in forest cover, paleofires, and lake-level change we interpret as SAM-like variability.\nBecause precipitation in the study area is positively correlated to the SWW and this relationship extends over a broad swath of the southern mid-latitudes, we can infer the Holocene behavior of the SWW at a zonal scale. We detect a conspicuous warm/dry multi-millennial phase between 9.3-7.5 ka, implying reduced SWW influence at 51°S, followed by stronger SWW influence starting at 7.5 ka and the onset of SAM-like variability at centennial timescales at 6 ka. We note that the onset of SAM-like variability in SW Patagonia was nearly contemporaneous with the onset neoglaciations in Patagonia, the commencement of ENSO-like variability in the tropics and subtropics, and a rising trend in the atmospheric CO2 concentrations, suggesting that stronger and more variable SWW might drive enhanced degassing of the Southern Ocean and influence the intensity of Hadley and Walker circulation over the Pacific Ocean.",

This poster presents a parallel implementation of a quasi 3-dimensional, physics-based, high-resolution, distributed water resources model suitable for simulating large watersheds in a massively parallel computing environment. Developing this model is one of the objectives of the NSF EPSCoR RII Track II CI-WATER project, which is joint between Wyoming and Utah EPSCoR jurisdictions. The model, which we call ADHydro, is aimed at simulating important processes in the Rocky Mountain west, including: rainfall and infiltration, snowfall and snowmelt in complex terrain, vegetation and evapotranspiration, soil heat flux and freezing, overland flow, channel flow, groundwater flow, water management and irrigation. Model forcing is provided by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and ADHydro is coupled with the NOAH-MP land-surface scheme for calculating fluxes between the land and atmosphere. The ADHydro implementation uses the Charm++ parallel run time system. Charm++ is based on location transparent message passing between migrateable C++ objects. Each object represents an entity in the model such as a mesh element. These objects can be migrated between processors or serialized to disk allowing the Charm++ system to automatically provide capabilities such as load balancing and checkpointing. Objects interact with each other by passing messages that the Charm++ system routes to the correct destination object regardless of its current location. This poster discusses the algorithms, communication patterns, and caching strategies used to implement ADHydro with Charm++. The ADHydro model code will be released to the hydrologic community in late 2014.",

            "abstract": "The 5.3μm emission from the vibrational levels of nitric oxide (NO) and the 15μm emission from CO2 are known to be the dominant sources of cooling in the thermosphere above 100 km. The 5.3μm emission is primarily produced by the radiative de-excitation of NO from its first vibrational level, which in turn is mainly populated by the collisions of NO with atomic oxygen. However, the reaction of atomic nitrogen (N(4S) and N(2D)) with O2 yields vibrationally excited NO with v>1, resulting in a radiative cascade which produces more than one 5.3μm photon per vibrationally excited NO molecule. This chemiluminescence is approximately 20% in magnitude of the emission produced by thermal collisions.\nThese additional sources of the 5.3μm emission are introduced into a one dimensional photochemical model and the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) to assess their variability with latitude and solar activity, and to also understand their effect on the thermospheric energy budget. The results from the models are compared with data from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) experiment on-board the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite, which has been making measurements of the infrared radiative response of the mesosphere and thermosphere to solar inputs since 2002.",

            "abstract": "One of the major challenges facing science in general is how foster trust and cooperation between nations that then allows the free and open exchange of data. The rich data coming from many nations conducting Arctic research must be allowed to be brought together to understand and assess the huge changes now underway in the Arctic regions.\nThe NCAR Earth Observing Laboratory has been supporting a variety of international field process studies and WCRP sponsored international projects that require international data collection and exchange in order to be successful. Some of the programs include the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) International Tundra Experiment (ITEX), the Arctic Climate Systems Study (ACSYS), the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO), and the Coordinated Energy and water-cycle Observations Project (CEOP) to name a few. EOL played a major role in the data management of these projects, but the CEOP effort in particular involved coordinating common site documentation and data formatting across a global network (28 sites). All these unique projects occurred over 25 years but had similar challenges in the international collection, archival, and access to the rich datasets that are their legacy.\nThe Belmont Forum offers as its main challenge to deliver knowledge needed for action to avoid or adapt to environmental change. One of their major themes is related to the study of these changes in the Arctic. The development of capable e-infrastructure (technologies and groups supporting international collaborative environments networks and data centers) to allow access to large diverse data collections is key to meeting this challenge.\nThe reality of meeting this challenge, however, is something much more difficult. The authors will provide several specific examples of successes and failures when trying to meet the needs of an international community of researchers specifically related to Belmont Forum Work Package Themes regarding standards of data sharing and open data. This will be done through the framework of the projects noted above in an environment of proprietary data claims, multiple formats and data collection procedures, stockpiling of data, international data restrictions and mistrust of other scientists.",

            "abstract": "A main goal of this study was to improve prediction of sediment and solute transport using soil surface and soil nutrient changes, based on field measurements, within small watersheds receiving conservation measures. Sediment samples and solute concentrations were measured from two streams in the southwestern region of the Colombian Andes. Two modeling approaches for stream discharge and sediment transport predicted were used with one of these being used for nutrient transport prediction. These streams are a part of a recent initiative from a water fund established by Asobolo, Asocaña, and Cenicaña in collaboration with the Natural Capital Project to improve conservation efforts and monitor their effects. On-site soil depth changes, groundwater depth measurements, and soil nutrient concentrations were also monitored to provide more information about changes within this mountainous watershed during one part of the yearly rainy season. This information is being coupled closely with the outlet sediment concentration and solute concentration patterns to discern correlations. Lateral transects in the upper, middle, and lower part of the hillsides in the Aguaclara watershed of the Rio Bolo watershed network showed differences in soil nutrient status and soil surface depth changes. The model based on semi-distributed hydrology was able to reproduce discharge and sediment transport rates as well as the initially used model indicating available options for comparison of conservation changes in the future.",

            "abstract": "Thinning due to ice flow acceleration, or dynamic thinning, caused by abrupt retreat of Greenland’s coastal outlet glaciers earlier in the century continues to propagate inland through diffusion. The rate of diffusion increases as the ice thickens and surface slopes decrease further into the interior, causing the mass loss to be spread over an ever increasing area, and the rate of thinning to decrease. Measurement of dynamic thinning and resulting mass loss with altimetry is thus becoming ever more challenging as the signal decreases relative to other potential sources of surface elevation change, particularly pre-existing dynamic imbalances and variations in surface and firn density, both of which are poorly constrained.\nWe combine observations from field campaigns, multiple air and spaceborne sensors, firn cores and climate model predictions to assess our ability to remotely measure dynamic thinning. Field measurements obtained in the percolation zone above Jakobshavn Isbrae indicate dynamic thinning has propagated nearly 250 km, or twice as far as detected by altimetry. This signal, however, is complicated by other variations that both mask the dynamic thinning signal and create substantial errors in the conversion from surface elevation change to mass change. We find a recent, rapid compaction of the firn layer due to increased melt has caused a surface elevation change of similar magnitude and spatial pattern as dynamic thinning. This compaction has occurred during a longer-term increase in accumulation, causing an inverse relationship between firn layer thickness and mass. We also detect a pre-existing, positive dynamic imbalance (i.e. flux convergence) in the interior of the catchment that offsets, and therefore masks, the inland propagation of thinning. Based on these findings, we discuss the limitations of altimetry for recovering the evolution of dynamic thinning and mass change and make recommendations for future improvements.",

The mechanics of motion and sedimentological processes responsible for this advance of the morainal bank with the calving terminus are not well-defined and based largely on inferences from geophysical analyses of remnant morainal banks on fjord floors. There is a general absence of in situ or direct observation of the submarine margin because it is nearly impossible to access the immediate area of the ice face by boat safely. In order to obtain such data, in June 2014 we tested the ability of a Bluefin 9M AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) to acquire high resolution swath bathymetry and sidescan backscatter across a ~2 km long section of the ice face of Hubbard Glacier (see also Goff et al., this meeting). Additionally onboard oceanographic measurements were taken that can be compared with surface cast CTD profiles obtained during AUV deployment, including locations with subglacial discharges. The AUV test provides details on the geometry of the morainal bank and nature of the fjord wall surfaces. The decimeter-scale imagery of the seabed reveals numerous erosional and depositional bedforms and gravitational features on the morainal bank’s proximal slope. Closer to the ice face, the morainal bank surface appears much coarser, with textural patterns of unknown origin, and gravel lags including boulder fields. Comparing the water depth from the AUV survey with that of NOAA bathymetric data from 2004/2006 shows the morainal bank continued to advance in pace with ice advance into fjord waters over 200m deep, water depths shoaling up to 100m near the present ice margin. The glimpse of the morainal bank afforded by the AUV test clearly demonstrated the value of this technology to ice marginal submarine investigations.",

The need of producing more accurate flow forecasts motivates the researchers to develop advanced innovative methods. In this study, it is proposed to develop a hybrid neural network model to exploit the strengths of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The proposed model has two components: i.) Dual – ANN model developed using river flows; and ii.) Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model trained on meteorological data (Rainfall and Snow on ground). Potential model inputs that best represent the process of river basin were selected in stepwise manner by identifying input-output relationship using a linear approach, Partial Correlation Input Selection (PCIS) combined with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) technique. The presented hybrid model was compared with three conventional methods: i) Feed-forward artificial neural network (FF-ANN) using daily river flows; ii) FF-ANN applied on decomposed river flows (low flow, rising limb and falling limb of hydrograph); and iii) Recursive method for daily river flows with lead-time of 7 days. The applicability of the presented model is illustrated through daily river flow data of Bow River, Canada. Data from 1912 to 1976 were used to train the models while data from 1977 to 2006 were used to validate the models. The results of the study indicate that the proposed model is robust enough to capture the non-linear nature of hydrograph and proves to be highly promising to forecast peak flows (extreme values) well in advance (higher lead time).",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is not only producing food and other products. It is also a major economic sector, representing, especially in developing countries, an important part of GDP; and a major employer, with often more than half of the total workforce in many low income countries. In many of these countries irrigation plays a key role to increase and stabilize income, and it is likely to increase with climate change and increased variability of rain patterns. It is also a crucial mean to increase productivity of small holdings. In many countries, where holdings are small and even in some cases decreasing it is essential to enable farmers to ensure their food security and a decent income. In some countries, including India and many African countries, the workforce is expected to grow, with an important part of it to be employed in agriculture. At the same time many of the regions where agriculture is the most important from an economical and social point of view, are experiencing increasing water scarcity. In many cases, as has been noted for instance for the Mediterranean area, water availability is the main limiting factor to agricultural development. Increasingly agriculture is also in competition for water use with other economic activities.\nThis calls for means to assess and compare agricultural productions systems and irrigation projects not only in terms of physical production of agricultural products but also in terms of income and jobs generated by the activity. In this study, we propose a methodology based on the blue water footprint for assessing and comparing different agricultural productions and farming systems in terms of economic and social outcomes for a given volume of blue water. Examples are drawn from the Campania region of Italy and based on data extracted from the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). This database contains, among other, data on crop production, irrigation management (irrigated surface, length of irrigation season, volumes of water, etc.), as well as on income and labor.",

            "abstract": "The empirical adopted integral equation model (EA-IEM) is implemented as a promising algorithm for liquid water content from the microwave data over a bare soil and sparsely vegetated conditions. The EA-IEM provides simplified mathematical expressions to calculate the soil dielectric constant. The Newton-Rhapson iteration is used to generate the calibrated rms height and calibrated correlation length by using the absolute difference between the calculated liquid water content (LWC) and the measured liquid water content. The absolute difference is less than the threshold value set to 1e-8. The calibrated rms height shows a constant value of 0.02 m while the calibrated correlation length varies for different sample points. A simple exponential regression model is established between the calibrated correlation length values and the backscattering coefficient observations. In addition, the regression model is incorporated into the EA-IEM as a robust way in determining the roughness parameters for retrieval of LWC over a large area. Liquid water content is then calculated directly from radar backscattering coefficient without iteration. Seven strategies were adopted to calibrate and validate the two NCRS-SCAN sites: Nenana and Ward Farm. A comparison between the predicted LWC and the measurements is performed for each strategy, and the root-mean-square (rms) error is found to be 3.60%, suggesting that the strategy one performs well compared to other strategies. All these strategies indicate that the EA-IEM can be used to retrieve soil moisture under the tested range of model parameters: incidence angles between 10o and 60o, surface rms height from 10 to 25 mm, and correlation length from 30 to 100 mm.",

            "abstract": "Geomaterials containing nano-pores (e.g., shales and carbonate rocks) have become increasingly important for emerging problems such as unconventional gas and oil resources, enhanced oil recovery, and geologic storage of CO2. Accurate prediction of coupled geophysical and chemical processes at the pore scale requires realistic representation of pore structure and topology. This is especially true for chalk materials, where pore networks are small and complex, and require characterization at sub-micron scale. In this work, we apply laser scanning confocal microscopy to characterize pore structures and microlithofacies at micron- and greater scales and dual focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) for 3D imaging of nanometer-to-micron scale microcracks and pore distributions. With imaging techniques advanced for nano-pore characterization, a problem of scale with FIB-SEM images is how to take nanometer scale information and apply it to the thin-section or larger scale. In this work, several texture characterization techniques including graph-based spectral segmentation, support vector machine, and principal component analysis are applied for segmentation clusters represented by 1-2 FIB-SEM samples per each cluster. Geometric and topological properties are analyzed and lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) is used to obtain permeability at several different scales. Upscaling of permeability to the Darcy scale (e.g., the thin-section scale) with image dataset will be discussed with emphasis on understanding microfracture-matrix interaction, representative volume for FIB-SEM sampling, and multiphase flow and reactive transport.\nFunding from the DOE Basic Energy Sciences Geosciences Program is gratefully acknowledged.

            "abstract": "Female salmon build nests (“redds”) in streambeds to protect their eggs from predation and damage by bed scour. During spawning, streambed material is mixed, fine sediment is winnowed downstream, and sediment is moved into a tailspill mound resembling the shape of a dune. Redd surfaces are coarser and better sorted than unspawned beds, which is thought to increase redd stability because larger grains are heavier and harder to move and sorting leads to higher friction angles for grain mobility. However, spawning also loosens sediment and creates topography that accelerates flow, both of which may increase particle mobility. We address factors controlling the relative stability of redds and unspawned beds using simulated salmon redds and water worked (“unspawned”) beds composed of mixed-grain surfaces in a laboratory flume. Results show that simulated spawning lowered packing resistance to particle mobility on redds by an average of 32-39% compared to unspawned beds. Reductions in packing were sufficient to counter the higher inherent stability of relatively coarse, well sorted grains on redds, overall reducing critical shear stress by 8-20% relative to unspawned beds. In addition, boundary shear stress was 13-41% higher on redds due to flow convergence over the tailspill structure. Finally, redd instability relative to unspawned beds was observed in visual measurements of grain mobility, where bed-averaged shear stress was 22% lower at incipient motion and 29% lower at the discharge that mobilized all grain sizes on redds. Results of these complementary observations, along with sediment mass transport rates being nearly five times higher on a redd than an unspawned bed, indicate that redds are unstable compared to unspawned beds. Given these findings, further research is needed to investigate linkages between spawning disturbance and streambed mobility that may affect salmon reproduction in streams, and to assess whether a certain level of bed disturbance from spawning is required to restore ecosystem functions in streams with threatened populations of salmon.",

These limitations can be easily overcome through the use of HXR focusing optics coupled with solid state pixelated detectors. We present on recent updates on the FOXSI sounding rocket program. During its first flight FOXSI observed imaged a microflare with simultaneous observations by RHESSI. We present recent imaging analysis of the FOXSI observations and detailed comparison with RHESSI.

The products include atmospheric, ocean, land surface and cryospheric products from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS); atmospheric sounding products from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and the Advance Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS); and ozone products from the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS). These EDRs undergo a rigorous validation process and algorithm updates to achieve a product maturity needed for end user applications. Since the successful launch of Suomi National Polar Partnership (SNPP) satellite in October 2011, significant progresses have been made on calibration and validation of the SNPP data products. By far all products were publicly available and most products were ready for operational evaluation. Most products also are expected to meet requirements and work is underway to reach validated maturity status and fully operational use. Further developments and improvements of the algorithms for J1 have been planned based on the JPSS requirements and lessons learned from SNPP. Sensitivity and impact studies are performed as sensor test data become available. For the majority of data products, no significant changes in sensor input and corresponding sensor degradation are expected. However, the J1 products will undergo the same rigorous calibration and validation process as the S-NPP products once the on-orbit data are available. The schedule for the maturity of the J1 data products however is expected to be accelerated compared to that for S-NPP as lessons learned from the S-NPP mission will be applied to the J1 satellite data. In the presentation, we will provide an overview of the latest SNPP data products’ quality status and the plan forward for JPSS-1 algorithm updates.",

The core function of the toolkit is the spatial and temporal alignment of satellite swath and geostationary data.\nThe design features an abstraction layer that allows for easy inclusion of new datasets in a modular way. Our overarching objective is to create utilities that automate the mundane aspects of satellite data analysis, are extensible and maintainable, and do not place limitations on the analysis itself. IDL has a powerful suite of statistical and visualization tools that can be used in conjunction with SatelliteDL.\nToward this end we have constructed SatelliteDL to include\n(1) HTML and LaTeX API document generation,\n(2) a unit test framework,\n(3) automatic message and error logs,\n(4) HTML and LaTeX plot and table generation, and\n(5) several real world examples with bundled datasets available for download.\nFor ease of use, datasets, variables and optional workflows may be specified in a flexible format configuration file. Configuration statements may specify, for example, a region and date range, and the creation of images, plots and statistical summary tables for a long list of variables.\nSatelliteDL enforces data provenance; all data should be traceable and reproducible. The output NetCDF file metadata holds a complete history of the original datasets and their transformations, and a method exists to reconstruct a configuration file from this information.\nRelease 0.1.0 distributes with ingest methods for GOES, MODIS, VIIRS and CERES radiance data (L1) as well as select 2D atmosphere products (L2) such as aerosol and cloud (MODIS and VIIRS) and radiant flux (CERES).\nFuture releases will provide ingest methods for ocean and land surface products, gridded and time averaged datasets (L3 Daily, Monthly and Yearly), and support for 3D products such as temperature and water vapor profiles.\nEmphasis will be on NPP Sensor, Environmental and Climate Data Records as they become available.\nTo obtain SatelliteDL, please visit the project website at http://www.txcorp.com/SatelliteDL",

The near real-time additional seismic and ground deformation data allow the long-term hazard map switches into a short-term future vent opening one.

Analytical inversion of deformation and seismic data is performed to find the parameters of a magmatic source in an elastic, isotropic and homogeneous half-space and forward model is performed to computed the displacement field over Etna surface.\nWe modelled the final intrusion of the Mount Etna May 2008 eruption that was accompanied by a violent seismic swarm and marked by ground deformation recorded at GPS stations.

The two continuum channels allow for probing the temperature in shallow subsurface over two effective depths on the order of a few millimeters to a few centimeters. The MIRO continuum channels can uniquely measure both dayside and night side temperatures of the comet nucleus. The measurements will be analyzed for both thermal and electrical properties of the near surface layers which in turn can be interpreted in terms of bulk density, particle size, and ice/dust ratio. Early resolved measurements of polar night regions from 100 km range will provide first estimates of the nucleus thermal inertia. Following the polar night scans, extensive measurements obtained from orbits at distances of 100, 30, 20, and 10 km will be used to map the thermal and electrical properties on a global scale.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate rock units are often considered as candidate sites for storage of carbon dioxide (CO2), whether as stand-alone reservoirs or coupled with enhanced oil recovery efforts. In order to accept injected carbon dioxide, carbonate reservoirs must either possess sufficient preexisting connected void space, or react with CO2-acidified fluids to produce more pore space and improve permeability. However, upward migration of CO2 through barrier zones or seal layers must be minimized for effective safe storage. Therefore, prediction of the changes to porosity and permeability in these systems over time is a key component of reservoir management. Towards this goal, we present the results of several experiments on carbonate core samples from the Wellington, Kansas 1-32 well, conducted under reservoir temperature, pressure, and CO2 conditions. These samples were imaged by X-ray computed tomography (XRCT) and analyzed with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy both prior to and after reaction with CO2-enriched brines. The carbonate samples each displayed distinct responses to CO2 exposure in terms of permeability change with time and relative abundance of calcite versus dolomite dissolution. The measured permeability of each sample was also much lower than that estimated by downhole NMR logging, with samples with larger fractured regions possessing higher permeability values. We present also our modeling approach and preliminary simulation results for a specific sample from the targeted injection zone. The heterogeneous composition as well as the presence of large fractured zones within the rock necessitated the use of a nested three-region approach to represent the range of void space observed via tomography. Currently, the physical response to CO2-brine flow (i.e., pressure declines with time) is reproduced well but the extent of chemical reaction is overestimated by the model.",

            "abstract": "The temporal variations of the total or integrated radiance of the K-corona were found to be correlated with solar activity (or sunspot) cycle in some previous studies. In this study, we address the question on how the global electron content of the corona varies with the solar cycle by analyzing STEREO/COR1 pB images over a period from 2007 (near solar minimum of Solar Cycle 23) to 2014 (near solar maximum of Solar Cycle 24). We reconstruct the 3D coronal density by using a spherically symmetric polynomial approximation (SSPA) method on the COR1-A and -B data gathered over half a solar rotation. We find that the total mass of the corona within 1.5-3.7 solar radius reaches a minimum at solar minimum near 2009 and then stays stable until 2010 when the solar activity starts to again increase. The coronal mass is seen to increase by a factor ≈2 from solar minimum to solar maximum while exhibiting strong variations. We explore the cause of this variation by exploring its relationship with the temporal variation of total magnetic flux of the close fields using PFSS extrapolations to SOHO/MDI and SDO/MHI magnetic field data. In addition, for some selected solar rotations we compare the reconstructed 3D density structures with density structures predicted by the Corona Heliosphere (CORHEL) and Magnetohydrodynamics Around the Sphere (MAS) models in the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) to understand the physical mechanism that determines the distribution and evolution of the coronal densities.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric simulations can be used to predict wind energy production at increasingly higher resolutions, which can better capture boundary layer processes and topography. Wind turbine performance depends on several different factors including local topography, weather conditions, and turbine spacing. In this work, we implement and examine the performance of a generalized actuator disk model (GAD) and a generalized actuator line model (GAL) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, a mesoscale atmospheric model. The wind turbine parameterizations are designed for turbulence-resolving simulations, and are used within downscaled large-eddy simulations (LES) forced with mesoscale simulations and WRF’s grid nesting capability. The GAD represents the effects of thrust and torque created by a wind turbine on the atmosphere within a disk representing the rotor swept area. The forces applied by the turbine blades on the atmosphere are parameterized using blade-element theory and the aerodynamic properties of the blades. The GAL tracks the location of the individual turbine blades and applies thrust and tangential forces at the temporal location of each blade instead of distributing the total force of all the blades over the actuator disk like the GAD does. This should in theory increase fidelity but carries higher computational cost (~10 m for GAD vs. ~1 m resolution for GAL). Both GAD and GAL models include real-time yaw and pitch control to respond realistically to changing flow conditions. Comparisons are also made to help determine the importance of turbine blade tilt away from the tower and the inclusion of the tower and turbine hub drag effects. Our implementations are designed to permit simulation of turbine wake effects and turbine/airflow interactions within a realistic atmospheric boundary layer flow field, including resolved turbulence, time-evolving mesoscale forcing, and real topography.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

Working primarily with the Ocean Exploration Trust’s E/V Nautilus and the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer, the ISC facility and staff have supported dozens of research cruises with significant shore-based support, while delivering related educational programming across the globe. Through a partnership with the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), the ISC is broadening its reach and capabilities to serve vessels in the U.S. academic research fleet, managed by UNOLS. The ISC has developed and used a portable shipboard “mobile telepresence unit” (MTU) on several UNOLS ships to support projects led by ocean scientists that employed the telepresence paradigm as part of their research and outreach programs. Utilizing the ISC facilities provides opportunities for effective, successful broader impact activities and shore-based remote science connectivity. With new UNOLS ships coming online, including the R/V Sikuliaq, the R/V Neil Armstrong, and the R/V Sally Ride, in addition to future Regional Class Research Vessels (RCRVs), telepresence capability has become a technical requirement for a variety of reasons. Older vessels are being retrofit with this forward-looking technology, and URI’s research vessel, the R/V Endeavor, has been recently configured with technology to support telepresence operations. This presentation will provide an overview of the future of telepresence technology, its use in ocean science research and education, and advantages for using this capability to support broader impact activities. In addition, ISC successes, challenges, and lessons learned in employing telepresence technologies and methodologies onboard the academic research fleet will be discussed.",

Studying how patterns influence fluxes and state variables across scales is a key goal of the Collaborative Research Centre TR32, which approaches this challenge by monitoring, modelling and data assimilation using the Rur catchment (Germany) as its study area.\nThe evolution of system state variables across scales is monitored using two dual-polarized X-band Doppler radars as well as the atmospheric boundary layer, cloud and precipitation monitoring site JOYCE (Jülich ObservatorY for Cloud Evolution), and measurements from eddy covariance stations, an extensive soil moisture network including cosmic-ray probes. Monitoring is complemented by a suite of geophysical methods such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Spectral Induced Polarization, Electromagnetic Induction, and Ground-Penetrating Radar, as well as a rhizotrone facility set up to monitor root development in conjunction with plant growth.\nThe TR32 employs multi-compartment modelling to upscale the water, CO2 and energy fluxes from the local to the catchment scale. The analysis of the simulations with grids that honor the respective scales reveal the role of patterns on the fluxes and helps to design a general upscaling framework that quantifies information transfer between scales.\nModel development centers around the coupled model platform TerrSysMP, which considers mutual fluxes from the groundwater to the atmosphere by combining the atmospheric model COSMO, the land surface model CLM, and the hydrological model ParFlow in a scale-consistent way using the OASIS coupler. Processes down to the root scale are modelled at high resolution in order to obtain improved parameterizations for TerrSysMP. State variable assimilation and parameter estimation methods are extended to the complete terrestrial system. We will present selected results and challenges for the prediction of states and fluxes of water, CO2 and energy in terrestrial systems across scales.",

            "abstract": "The notion of clouds as buffered or resilient systems implies that generalized feedback processes unaccounted for in climate simulations may lead to an overestimation of the effective radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions, i.e. cloud lifetime effects. In this contribution, we study the importance of microphysical feedback processes in response to anthropogenic aerosols in orographic mixed-phase clouds. Our methods can be extended to other cloud regimes as well as dynamical and thermodynamical feedbacks.\nFor our simulations, we use the regional atmospheric model COSMO-ART-M7 in a 2D setup with an idealized mountain. To capture major processes from aerosol emission to precipitation, the model is coupled to a modal aerosol scheme and includes aerosol activation and heterogeneous freezing as well as two-moment cold and warm cloud microphysics. We perform simulations with aerosol conditions that vary in amount and chemical composition and thus perturb the warm- and ice-phase pathways of precipitation formation and their mixed-phase interactions.\nOur analysis is based on quantifying the interaction strength between aerosol, cloud and precipitation variables by susceptibilities, i.e. relative sensitivities d ln(Y) / d ln(X), where the change in variable Y is a response to a perturbation in variable X. We describe how to decompose susceptibilities into a direct response expected from the parameterization and a contribution from feedbacks. Resilience features similar magnitudes but opposite signs for those contributions, resulting in an overall small susceptibility.\nWe find considerable contributions from feedbacks, which appear more important for warm-phase than for cold-phase processes. We do not observe, however, a trend for resilience in mixed-phase cloud microphysics. Moreover, feedback contributions seem of secondary importance when compared to the strong dependence of susceptibilities on the microphysical state of the cloud.",

            "abstract": "Maturity of kerogen in shale governs the productivity and generation hydrocarbon type. There are generally two accepted methods to measure kerogen maturity; one is the measurement of vitrinite reflectance, %Ro, and another is the measurement of Tmax through pyrolysis. However, each of these techniques has its own limits; vitrinite reflectance measurement cannot be applied to marine shale and pre-Silurian shales, which lack plant materials. Furthermore, %Ro, requires the isolation and identification of vitrinite macerals and statistical measurements of at least 50 macerals. Tmax measurement is questionable for mature and post-mature samples. In addition, there are questions involving the effects of solvents on Tmax determinations. Fourier Transmission Infrared Spectroscopy, FTIR, can be applied for both qualitative and quantitative assessment on organics maturity in shale. The technique does not require separating organic matter or identifying macerals. A CH2/CH3 index, RCH, calculated from FTIR spectra is more objective than other measurements. The index increases with maturity (both natural maturation and synthetic maturation through hydrous and dry pyrolysis). The new maturity index RCH can be calibrated to vitrinite reflectance which allows the definition of the following values for levels of maturity: 1) immature—RCH > 1.6±0.2; 2) oil window-- 1.6±0.2 < RCH > 1.3±0.3; 3) wet gas window--1.3±0.3 < RCH> 1.13±0.05; and 4) dry gas window RCH < 1.13±0.05.",

            "abstract": "The term large low shear velocity province (LLSVP) represents large lowermost mantle regions of reduced shear velocities (Vs) relative to 1D reference models. There are two LLSVPs: one beneath the central Pacific Ocean, and one beneath the southern Atlantic Ocean and Africa. While LLSVP existence has been well known for several decades, more recently evidence from forward modeling has brought to light relatively sharp margins of the LLSVPs, i.e., the transition from low-to-“normal” Vs occurs over a short lateral distance (probably < ~100 km). This finding is further supported by the strongest lateral dVs gradients in tomography coinciding with locations of sharp LLSVP sides in high-resolution studies. Surface hotspot and large igneous province origination locations mostly map above the present day LLSVP edges. Combined with geochemical arguments that a deep mantle long-lived (possibly primordial) reservoir exists, and geodynamics experiments that demonstrate a dense basal reservoir would be swept by convection to reside beneath upwellings and plumes, a strong argument can be made for dense, chemically distinct material explaining LLSVPs. This presentation will present additional seismic information that needs to be considered for a self-consistent geodynamic and mineralogical framework. For example, there does not appear to be consistency between Vp and Vs reductions defining LLSVPs; however, this comparison is complicated by lowermost mantle Vp models exhibiting greater divergence from each other than Vs models. LLSVP forward modeling usually involves a trade-off between dVs within the LLSVP and LLSVP height/shape; thus continued mapping of heterogeneity within LLSVP is critical. ULVZs might relate to LLSVP chemistry, temperature, and evolution, and thus will be discussed. The chemistry that can explain large and old thermochemical piles is as of yet unconstrained; other mineralogical considerations include understanding the possible role of the post-perovskite phase transition within and outside LLSVPs (which may affect Vs differently from Vp), and the evolution of pile chemistry over time, since geodynamics work demonstrates how mantle material (including deeply subducted MORB) can become downward entrained into piles.",

Currently the global mean rate is a little over 3 mm/year, but it is expected to accelerate significantly over this century. This will have a profound impact on coastal populations and infrastructure, including NASA centers and facilities. A detailed study proposed by the University of Colorado’s Center for Astrodynamics Research on the impact of sea level rise on several of NASA’s most vulnerable facilities was recently funded by NASA. Individual surveys at several high-risk NASA centers were conducted and used as case studies for a broader investigation that needs to be done for coastal infrastructure around the country. The first two years of this study included implementing and conducting a terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and GPS survey at Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida, Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia, Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia, and Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California. We are currently using airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data and TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanning) data to construct detailed digital elevation models (DEMs) of the facilities that we have assessed. The TLS data acquired at each center provides a very dense point cloud that is being used to improve the detail and accuracy of the digital elevation models currently available. We are also using GPS data we acquired at each center to assess the rate of vertical land movement at the facilities and to tie the DEM to tide gauges and other reference points. With completed, detailed DEMs of the topography and facilities at each center, a series of simple inundation models will then be applied to each area. We will use satellite altimeter data from TOPEX, Jason-1, and Jason-2 to assess the sea level changes observed near these NASA facilities over the last 20 years along with sea level projections from global climate models (GCMs) and semi-empirical projections to make detailed maps of sea level inundation through and up to the years 2050 and 2100 for varying amounts of sea level rise. We will also work with other selected investigators to assess the effects of tidal variations and storm surge when coupled with changes in mean sea level, as storm surge is likely when initial damage due to sea level rise will occur.",

With seismic sources provided only at one end of the geophone lines, standard refraction profiling methods are unable to resolve the seismic velocity structures unambiguously. In previous work we have shown overall agreement between body-wave refraction modeling and Rg dispersion curves for the least complex of the five lines, Line 2, leading us to offer a simplified1D model for this line. A more detailed inspection of Line 2 supports a 2D re-interpretation of the structure on this line. We observe variation along the length of the line, as evidenced by abrupt and consistent changes in the behavior of surface waves at higher frequencies. We interpret this as a manifestation of significant material or structural heterogeneity in the shallowest strata. This interpretation is consistent with P-wave and Rg attenuation observations. Planned additional sources, both at the distal ends of the profiles and intermittently within their lengths, will provide significant enhancement to our ability to resolve this complicated shallow structure.",

            "abstract": "Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation (ASC) is a nonprofit organization that collects environmental data to catalyze conservation initiatives worldwide.\nAdventure athletes have the skills and motivation to reach the most remote corners of the world. ASC utilizes those skills to provide the scientific community with data while providing the outdoor community with purpose beyond the personal high of reaching a summit or rowing across an ocean.\nWe carefully select projects, choosing partnerships that will maximize the impact of ASC volunteers. Each project must have a clear path to a tangible conservation outcome and demonstrate a clear need for our brand of volunteers. We partner with government agencies, universities, and independant reseachers to kickstart data collection efforts around the world.\nLast year, through a partnership with the Olympic National Forest, 20 volunteers from the Seattle area set up and monitored camera traps in an effort to survey for costal Pacific marten. Our work led to the species’ listing as “critically imperiled” with NatureServe. A partnership with the inaugural Great Pacific Race, engaging trans-Pacific rowing teams, searched for microplastics in the Pacific Ocean as part of our ongoing microplastics campaign. In a multi-year partnership with the American Prairie Reserve (APR), ASC volunteer crews live and work on the Reserve collecting wildlife data year round. The data we obtain directly informs the Reserve's wildlife management decisions. On this project, our crews have safely and effectively navigated temperature extremes from -30 degrees to 100+ degrees while traveling in a remote location.\nWe are currently scouting projects in the Okavango Delta of Botswana and the rainforest of Suriname where we will be able to cover large amounts of area in a short periord of time.\nASC is at the crossroads of the adventure and coservation science communities. Our approach of answering specific questions by using highly skilled and motivate volunteers ensures that we are able to collect quality data, cost effectively, and in a fraction of the traditional timeframe.",

            "abstract": "An ocean seesaw has been proposed to operate between the North Pacific and North Atlantic, such that enhanced deep or intermediate water is formed in the North Pacific during times when deepwater formation is suppressed in the North Atlantic. Data and modeling studies have suggested a North Pacific deep water mass (NPDW) may have developed during Heinrich Stadial 1 (~18 – 15 ka, HS1), a time when the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) was reduced. However, the flux of ice rafted debris (IRD) in sediment cores from the northeast Pacific has been observed to peak from ~18 – 16.5 ka, implying that ice-melt reduced the surface salinity during at least part of the time period implicated for NPDW formation. We developed high resolution records of sea surface temperature based on the alkenone Uk’37 unsaturation index, paired with planktonic foraminiferal oxygen isotopes in marine sediment cores from the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), allowing us to reconstruct changes in the δ18O of seawater (related to surface salinity) throughout the last deglaciation. These records indicate generally higher surface ocean salinities in the GOA during 18 and 16 ka, implying relatively low freshwater inputs to the Alaska Coastal Current at these times. However, superimposed on this trend are brief freshening events and large pulses of IRD occurring between 17.5 - 16.5 ka, which suggests roughly synchronous timing for major ice rafting sourced from both the Cordilleran (Pacific) and Laurentide (Atlantic) ice sheets. Radiocarbon evidence indicates reduced subsurface ventilation of the northeast Pacific during HS1, making a scenario of sustained (millennial-scale) NPDW formation appear unlikely.",

Fine-grained sediments eroded from predominantly thin soils may be transported rapidly by streams (locally called guts) to the sea and cause stress to corals. We have studied erosion and transport processes on St Thomas by three methods: (1) continuous monitoring of suspended matter in one of the island’s few perennial streams, Dorothea Gut, (2) measurement of 137Cs inventories in soil cores taken across the landscape, and (3) evaluation of sediment captured in most of the island’s coastal ponds, through which a significant portion of runoff must pass. We find that, for areas that have not been recently disturbed, watersheds retain fine sediments surprisingly well. On the other hand, small patches of land, like building lots that have been recently disturbed and poorly managed, can produce disproportionate amounts of fine sediment. These results differ somewhat from nearby St John, USVI, where unpaved roads are the major source of eroded sediments.",

An unmanned aerial system (UAS) was equipped with a FLIR A615 thermal camera to acquire canopy temperature imagery. Images were mosaicked and processed to show spatial temperature difference of entire field. A weather station was installed in a full irrigation plot to collect meteorological parameters. The sensitivity of canopy to air temperature difference and crop water stress index were investigated on detecting cop water stress levels. The results showed that low irrigation level treatment plots resulted in higher canopy temperatures compared to the high irrigation level treatment plots. Canopy temperatures also showed differences in water stress in different sugarcane varieties. The study demonstrated the feasibility of UAS-based thermal method to quantify plant water status of sugar canes used for biofuel crops.",

            "abstract": "Air pollution data are routinely collected at high time resolution at many sites in the United States, but such data are often assessed singularly or in small jurisdictional groups rather than on a large-scale, regional basis. Examining air pollution data, such as for ambient ozone, in a regional context may be advantageous given that air pollution is influenced by a combination of micro, local, and regional sources.\nNon-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms have been widely used by the environmental research community to identify factors governing pollutant concentrations. NMF can also be useful for identifying and interpreting outlier data, particularly for large data sets.\nWe applied NMF algorithms to ozone data collected at over 100 monitoring sites in the Mid‑Atlantic states during the summer of 2013 to examine their utility for identifying outlier data and outlier monitoring sites in the ozone monitoring network. We compared results from five different NMF algorithms with various strengths (such as being robust to missing data or outliers) to assess differences in their ability to identify outliers and to determine underlying factors influencing ambient ozone concentrations. In the future, these NMF methods can be applied to any large data matrix, such as those from networks of small, low-cost air pollution sensors and large-scale environmental monitoring networks.",

            "abstract": "The Eagle Ford Group was deposited at the south and east side of the Western Interior Seaway (WIS). These sediments contain evidence of anoxia and shallow-water deposition (between storm-wave and fair weather wave-base) in the proximal deposits at Lozier Canyon and Antonio Creek (LC/AC).\nShallow-water (above storm wave-base) depositional conditions are mostly based on the suite of primary sedimentary structures that includes: hummocky cross-stratification (HCS), swaley cross-stratification (SCS), symmetric ripples, gutter casts and shell lags. These occur in outcrop and support the interpretation that LC/AC is the most proximal location relative to other study locations. At Hot Springs in Brewster County, Texas, sedimentary structures are limited to shell lags, a few symmetric ripples and low-angle laminations. This is consistent with the distal expression of storm deposits. The primary sedimentary structures from the core from the subsurface in McMullen County, south Texas, are limited to those of low-energy currents, scouring, and reworking, which could indicate it is in the distally steepened portion of the carbonate ramp on which Eagle Ford Groups are deposited.\nPelagic foraminifera are the most microfossil and benthic foraminifera only occur in the Upper Eagle Formation at LC/AC. Molybdenum was also used as a proxy for occurrence and persistence of a sulfer-reducing zone. The geochemical data from the subsurface core suggests persistence of anoxia throughout its depositional history. At LC/AC, molybdenum is elevated (up to 5-6 times average shale value) and bioturbation in these zones is limited to the surfaces of symmetric ripples, suggesting that oxygenation events were brief and occurred only immediately after storm events. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the HCS, SCS, and symmetric ripples were caused by storms and temporarily mixed the ocean in a normally stratified water column. At LC/AC, the water column became persistently oxic from the latest Cenomanian through the end of the Turonian, suggesting either a relative drop in sea level or a deepening of the pycnocline.",

            "abstract": "The first successful attempt to instrument an Ocean Drilling Program borehole for formation pressure and temperature monitoring and fluid sampling was accomplished in 1991 in Hole 857D, and the system there has been in nearly continuous operation since that time. This hole and others that followed have provided many new insights into ocean crustal and subduction zone hydrogeology and geodynamics, while at the same time being the “proving ground” for a number of technological advances in ocean borehole monitoring, including 1) the CORK scheme itself for sealing holes for hydrologic recovery to natural-state conditions after drilling; 2) the use of absolute pressure sensors for monitoring both relative formation pressures and changes in seafloor depth; 3) multi-level completions for pressure monitoring that leave cased borehole interiors open for other instrumentation; 4) the development of ultra-high-precision, low-power digital recording systems for examining the effects on the formation of seismic and microseismic loading; and 5) the proof-of-concept of an optical communications system that eliminates dependence on submersibles or ROVs for data download operations (see Tivey et al., this session). Relatively low-sample-rate data spanning the first part of the more than two decades of operations have shown how large anomalous pressures generated thermally and by deformation can be; how seafloor tidal loading influences formation pressure and can drive an “a.c.” component of flow; and how seismogenic and slow strain can be observed by way of formation-fluid pressure transients. More recent instrumentation has allowed much higher fidelity observations (1 Hz sampling at a resolution of 10-8 of full-scale), and thus is permitting complementary studies of hydrologic, oceanographic, seismic, and microseismic phenomena. Plans for the future include connections to shore via observatory cable systems, such as those of NEPTUNE Canada and DONET, for unlimited power supply and real-time data acquisition (the first having been connected in 2009), and incorporation of quartz sensors, under development at Paroscientific Inc. and Quartz Seismic Sensors Inc., that are coupled to acceleration for monitoring tilt and ground motion.",

Investment in STEM education experiences for high school students has been emphasized by California State University Bakersfield as a means to improving these metrics with programs such as the Research Experience Vitalizing Science-University Program (REVS-UP). Now in its seventh year, the REVS-UP (funded by Chevron) forms teams of high school students, a high school teacher, a CSUB graduate student, and a CSUB professor to work for four weeks on a research project. For the past two summers student-teacher teams investigated the diagenesis and mineralogy of the Temblor Formation sandstones in the subsurface of the San Joaquin basin oil fields that are potential CO2 sequestration sites. With a graduate student leading the teams in sample preparation and analysis by scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDS) and cathode luminescence system (SEM-CL) data was gathered on diagenetic processes, detrital framework grains, and authigenic cements. Typically students are introduced to the project in a series of brief seminars by faculty and are then introduced to the techniques and samples. During the second week the students are usually capable of preparing samples and collecting data independently. The final week is focused on developing student-authored research posters which are independently presented by the students on the final day. This gives high school students the opportunity to learn advanced geologic topics and analytical techniques that they would otherwise not be exposed to as well as to gain research and presentation skills. These types of projects are equally important for the graduate students involved as it allows them the opportunity to effectively communicate geologic topics to students lacking significant geologic background.",

            "abstract": "Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is the largest natural source of chlorine in the stratosphere, and its relative importance in stratospheric ozone chemistry is expected to increase in the coming years as anthropogenic sources of chlorine decline following strict emissions controls. Biomass burning is the second largest source of CH3Cl (the first being biogenic production by vegetation), and measurements from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) suggest that the seasonal and interannual variability of CH3Cl in the upper troposphere / lower stratosphere (UTLS) largely reflect variability in biomass burning and vertical transport from source regions by convective activity. We compare the spatial and temporal variability of UTLS CH3Cl in simulations from the Whole Atmosphere Chemistry Climate Model (WACCM) nudged to the Modern Era Retrospective Reanalysis (MERRA) wind fields to the MLS measurements for 2005-2012. Using sensitivity simulations in which we perturb emissions from various CH3Cl sources and source regions, we examine what the MLS measurements of CH3Cl and other trace gases such as CO can tell us about the sources and transport of pollution to the radiatively critical UTLS region.",

            "abstract": "Earth, Venus, Mars and some of the largest asteroids have massive silicate mantles surrounding iron cores, and chondritic compositions. Against this backdrop are anomalies like the iron planet Mercury, and the Moon with almost no core, and metallic asteroids like Psyche. The Moon can be explained by giant impact, but for Mercury a giant impact (Benz et al., Icarus 1988) is problematic. Mercury must retain substantial volatiles after its obliteration (e.g. Peplowski et al., Science 2011), and must somehow avoid accreting its ejected silicates (Gladman and Coffey, MAPS 2009).\nSPH simulations have shown (Asphaug and Reufer, Nature Geosciences 2014; Sarid et al., LPSC 2014) that a differentiated chondritic proto-Mercury about 3 times its present mass can be stripped of its mantle in one energetic hit and run collision with a larger planet (proto-Venus or proto-Earth). To preserve Mercury's volatiles we also consider the scenario of lower energy hit and runs, in succession. We show that if 20 Mars-like planets accreted stochastically to form Venus and the Earth, then the statistics of attrition is likely to lead to one planet (Mercury) expressing repeated mantle stripping, and another planet (Mars) relatively undisturbed.\nFor iron asteroids the \"missing mantle paradox\" likewise looms prominent. Where does it go, and how do we strip away so much mantle rock (in some cases down to a bare iron core; Yang et al., Nature 2007, Moskovitz et al., EPSL 2011) while leaving asteroids like Vesta presumably intact? According to the hit and run hypothesis, the sink for all this missing silicate is the larger accreted bodies at the top of the feeding chain, as they win the pairwise dynamical competition for stripped materials. This exotic origin of relics is only relevant to those few pairwise encounters that do not accrete both bodies. So the small survivors are lucky, and how they are lucky -- their attrition bias -- is manifested as compositional diversity and a preponderance of iron relics.",

            "abstract": "Watershed planners and managers need reliable tools that can capture the spatial and temporal complexity of agricultural landscapes, and water quality models are increasingly relied upon to represent P loss from agricultural watersheds. While a significant amount of modeling work has attempted to incorporate factors controlling P loss (e.g. representing solubility, manure types, timing and application type), these models still typically require significant calibration and are thus difficult to apply meaningfully in areas without copious data with which to calibrate. This is partially because these models were never really intended as field scale tools, while we are trying to use them to define different hydrologic pathways, area weighted potential energy (slopes and saturated conductivities), and the resulting lag time of P in different transport states. The movement of water within the landscape as surface (or near-surface) storm runoff and interflow is driven by gravity, topography, contributing area and soil and landuse characteristics, which play roles in concentrating water flows. Soil surveys have played a key role in the development of pedology and spatially derived pedon soil maps have become valuable datasets for natural resource management. Unfortunately, the soil surveys, commonly available at ~1:20,000 scale, are not designed to provide the high-resolution models of the soil continuum required in field scale environmental modeling applications and site specific crop and water quality management. The goal of this project is to test a methodology designed initially for representing saturation excess hydrology in the SWAT model to incorporate topographic attributes, and resulting spatially explicit soil morphology, that are missing from standard SWAT model initializations.",

Numerical models of trans-ionospheric propagation of such waves remain unvalidated, and early models may have overestimated the absorption, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the global impact of VLF waves in the loss of radiation belt electrons. In an attempt to remedy the problem of a lack of accurate trans-ionospheric propagation models, we have used a full electromagnetic wave method (FWM) numerical code to simulate the propagation of lightning-generated whistlers into the magnetosphere and compared the results with whistlers observed on the DEMETER satellite and paired with lightning stroke data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). We have identified over 20,000 whistlers occuring in 14 different passes of DEMETER over the central United States during the summer of 2009, and 14,000 of those occured within the 2000 km x 2000 km simulation grid we used. As shown in the attached figure, which shows a histogram of the ratio of the simulated whistler energy to the measured whistler energy for the 14,000 whistlers we compared, the simulation tends to slightly underestimate the total whistler energy injected by about 5 dB. However, the simulation underestimates the DEMETER measurements more as one gets further from the source lightning stroke, so since the signal to noise ratio of more distant whistlers will be smaller, possibly additive noise in the DEMETER measurements (which of course is not accounted for in the model) may explain some of the observed discrepancy.",

            "abstract": "Moist tropical forests have the highest soil respiration rates (Rs) of any terrestrial ecosystem and account for approximately one third of the world’s soil carbon (C) pool. Small increases in the magnitude of Rs in these ecosystems can result in high rates of soil C loss, with significant consequences for global climate change. Identifying the climatic controls of Rs in moist subtropical forests will improve our ability to predict how this large C flux will respond to climate change. Our objectives were (1) to determine whether Rs varies on diel timescales, (2) whether diel Rs patterns vary seasonally, and (3) identify biophysical drivers of this temporal variation. We measured hourly Rs in a secondary, moist subtropical forest in Puerto Rico for a 3-year period using an automated soil respiration system (LI-COR 8100/8150 with six chambers). Concomitant with Rs we measured hourly variation in several climatic drivers (air/soil temperature, soil moisture, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation). Soil respiration showed significant diel variation, with the magnitude, amplitude, and shape of these curves varying throughout the year. Overall, diel Rs peaked in the late afternoon and reached a minimum in the early morning. Diel amplitudes ranged from 1 to 7 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1, with larger amplitudes occurring in warmer months that also have higher rates of Rs. In warmer months Rs exhibited a strong bimodal pattern, and a narrower diel range with a single peak in cooler and drier months. Diel Rs was positively correlated with soil temperature, but this relationship was non-linear during the day and linear at night (i.e., hysteresis). The bimodal pattern of Rs may be due to a mid-day depression of photosynthesis when humidity is low and air temperature is high, thereby reducing transport of photosynthate to the roots and decreasing rhizospheric respiration. The hysteresis between Rs and temperature suggests multiple controls on Rs on diel time-scales. Research that partitions Rs into its components could provide insight into their respective sensitivities to different climatic drivers, improving our capacity to understand the effects of climate change on the tropical forest C cycle.",

            "abstract": "Despite concerted effort in recent years to understand the changing budget of atmospheric methane (CH4) there remains considerable uncertainty on the trends and magnitudes of individual methane sources over decadal scales. Using new measurements of atmospheric methane isotopes from an archive of air sampled at Cape Meares Oregon (45°N, 124°W) combined with existing data we performed a time-dependent retrieval of methane fluxes spanning nearly twenty-five years. The inversion was able to reproduce CH4 and δ13C-CH4 successfully at nearly every site. δD-CH4 data was well-simulated by δ13C-CH4 optimized emissions up until year 2000, after which the simulated δD significantly exceeded measured data. The inversion estimates a ~30 Tg CH4 increase in fugitive fossil fuel emissions since 1985 with the highest growth rate occuring after year 2000. This result is consistent with some bottom-up estimates but is not consistent with recent estimates based on atmospheric ethane and other inverse studies. The model also estimates an overall decrease in biomass burning emissions since 1985 with most of the decrease attributed to C3 vegetation. These results are robust to over 40 sensitivity tests where changes to model parameters and input data were made. If the inversion is forced using a fugitive fossil fuel scenario consistent with recent ethane measurements, emissions from waste sources (e.g. landfills) greatly exceed estimates from bottom-up inventories suggesting this scenario is not consistent with the isotope record.",

            "abstract": "A majority of microorganisms in dark, nutrient-poor, subsurface habitats live in biofilms attached to mineral surfaces. As a result, microorganisms have likely adapted and evolved to take advantage of specific minerals that support a variety of biogeochemical processes. Using biofilm reactors inoculated with a diverse microbial biomat from a sulfidic cave, we found that specific microorganisms colonize specific minerals according to their metabolic/nutritional requirements as well as their environmental tolerances in order to increase survival in unfavorable environments.\nIn a neutral pH, carbon (C) and phosphate (P)-limited (unfavorable) reactor, highly-buffering carbonates were colonized by nearly identical communities of neutrophilic sulfur-oxidizing (acid-generating) bacteria (SOB), which intensely corroded the carbonates. Non-buffering quartz was colonized by acid-generating acidophiles, while feldspars (containing potentially toxic aluminum) were colonized largely by aluminotolerant microbes. The SOB Thiothrix unzii demonstrated a clear affinity for basalt, and it is commonly found on basaltic rocks in mid-ocean ridge environments.\nIn an identical reactor amended with acetate, heterotrophic sulfur-reducing bacteria (SRB) dominated on most surfaces. The metabolism of the SRB causes an increase in both alkalinity and pH, nearly eliminating the need for buffering minerals and resulting in carbonate precipitation. However, SRB were not dominant on quartz, which was again colonized by acidophiles and acid-tolerant microorganisms or basalt which hosted a complex consortium similar to those found on natural basalt outcrops. These organisms have been shown to weather basalts to access mineral nutrients, especially when provided a carbon source.\nIn both the C&P-limited and acetate-amended reactors significantly greater biomass accumulated on minerals with high P content. When abundant P was added and the pH was buffered to 8.3, mineral selectivity was eliminated and every surface accumulated similar total biomass and nearly identical communities (primarily SOB and alkalitrophs). These experiments suggest that in unfavorable environments microbial survival, growth, and community structure is closely linked to mineral chemistry and reactions at the microbe/mineral interface.",

The future geomorphic evolution of these marshes remains in question as rates of relative sea-level rise increase. Our objective is to understand the mechanisms that lead to the evolution of these channel networks through field observations and modeling. We model the geomorphological evolution of tidal creeks by viewing the wetland as a permeable medium. The porosity of the medium affects its hydraulic conductivity, which in turn is altered by erosion. Our multiphase model spontaneously generates channelization and branching networks through flow and erosion. In our field studies, we find that crabs play an active role in grazing vegetation and in the bioturbation of sediments. These effects are incorporated in our model based on field and laboratory observations of crab behavior and its effects on the marsh. We find the erosional patterns and channelization are significantly altered by the faunal feedback. Crabs enhance the growth of channels, inducing the headward erosion of creeks where flow-induced stresses are weakest. They are instrumental in generating high rates of creek extension, which channelize the marsh more effectively in response to sea-level rise. This indicates that the evolution of coastal wetlands is responding to interactions between physics and ecology and highlights the importance of the faunal contribution to these feedbacks.",

Photochemical hazes are abundant in reducing atmospheres, such as the N2/CH4 atmosphere of Titan, but are unlikely to form in oxidizing atmospheres, such as the N2/O2 atmosphere of present day Earth. However, information about haze formation in mildly oxidizing atmospheres is lacking. Understanding haze formation in mildly oxidizing atmospheres is necessary for models that wish to investigate the atmosphere of the Early Earth as O2 first appeared and then increased in abundance.\nPrevious studies of the atmosphere of the Early Earth have focused on haze formation in N2/CO2/CH4 atmospheres. In this work, we experimentally investigate the effect of the addition of O2 on the formation and composition of aerosols. Using a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) (see e.g. [1]) we have obtained in situ composition measurements of aerosol particles produced in N2/CO2/CH4/O2 gas mixtures subjected to FUV radiation (deuterium lamp, 115-400 nm) for a range of initial CO2/CH4/O2 mixing ratios. In particular, we studied the effect of O2 ranging from 2 ppm to 2%. The particles were also investigated using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), which measures particle size, number density and mass loading. A comparison of the composition of the aerosols will be presented. The effect of variation of O2 mixing ratio on aerosol production, size, and composition will also be discussed.\n[1] Trainer, M.G., et al. (2012) Astrobiology, 12, 315-326. ",

            "abstract": "Occurring as accessory minerals in most rocks and forming large deposits of considerable economical importance, iron oxides have a major petrological importance. Their role as oxygen buffers, in differentiation processes and as magnetic phases summarize the critical importance of iron oxides in most petrological contexts, independently of their abundance.\nThe discovery of a new compound in the Fe-O system, Fe4O5[1], reshaped our assumptions on the behavior of iron oxides in the Earth’s deep interior, where phases of FeO and Fe3O4 were considered the sole plausible players. Further studies found that Fe4O5 is stable in a wide compositional range[2] and can accept a wide extent of isomorphic substitutions[3].\nWe used laser heating synthesis in diamond anvil cell and microdiffraction mapping with high brilliance synchrotron x-ray[4] to explore the complexity of the Fe-O system at high pressure and temperature. We found coexistence of two to three oxides in most of the samples we investigated. By means of a careful exploration of diffraction effects in the reciprocal space, we singled-out the diffraction peaks of a few grains in multiphase diffraction patterns. These allowed a reliable characterization of yet a new iron oxide, Fe5O6. This compound, synthesized between 10 and 20 GPa, is also orthorhombic and can be described with the same building blocks of the other known orthorhombic iron oxides. A comparison of compressibility and lattice parameters of the latest iron oxides will be presented.\n[1] Lavina, B. et al. Discovery of the recoverable high-pressure iron oxide Fe4O5.

            "abstract": "We have proposed a 3U cubesat, to carry a low-frequency radio receiver into low-Earth orbit to study solar radio bursts induced by solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections. Because of the reflective properties of the Earth’s ionosphere, observations of radio waves around and below 10 MHz must be made from space. The measurements will allow continuous tracking of radio bursts and associated CMEs through the inner heliosphere. These observations are important since such events are the main cause for space weather disturbances. Data products from the mission will primarily be spectra and waveforms of solar radio type II and III bursts, and the direction to the radio source as it propagates through the inner heliosphere. These data products will be available to the community through an automated pipeline nominally within a few hours of downlink. Additional science data products will be sizes of radio sources obtained via lunar occultations, and local ionospheric plasma density and electron temperature. As a first cubesat with a scientific radio instrument at these frequencies, this project is also intended as a path-finder: the instrument and sub-systems can immediately be duplicated in other cubesats, with the goal of providing the first radio interferometric measurements below the ionospheric cutoff.",

            "abstract": "Transition from the Archean, largely anoxic atmosphere and ocean to the Proterozoic oxidizing surface conditions has been inferred in Zimbabwe from the geochemical and geological evidence as early as 1927. Subsequent studies provided additional support for this interpretation, bracketed the transition between 2.45 and 2.32 Ga, and suggested temporal and cause-and-effect relationship with a series of the early Paleoproterozoic ice ages (including 4 discrete events). Recently recognized transient oxidation events of the Archean add texture to this pattern, but do not change it.\nThe rise of atmospheric oxygen requires a misbalance between oxygen sinks and sources and most attention was focused on sinks. In contrast, change in oxygen supply related to low organic productivity in Archean oceans with limited nutrient contents are considered here. Although carbon isotope values of carbonates and organic carbon indicate substantial relative burial rate of organic carbon during the Archean, most of the earlier buried organic matter at that time was recycled to sediments during continental weathering, implying very low productivity and burial of ‘new’ organic carbon. Low contents of redox-sensitive elements, such as Mo, Cu, Zn, and V, in Archean seawater could have kept organic productivity and oxygen production at low levels. The GOE was immediately preceded by deposition of giant iron formations, accounting for more than 70% of world iron resources, and worldwide emplacement of a number of LIPs between 2.5 and 2.45 Ga, indicating enhanced delivery of nutrients and redox-sensitive elements to the oceans via submarine hydrothermal processes and continental weathering under CO2- and SO2-rich atmosphere and associated terrestrial acidic runoff. This enhanced emplacement of LIPs has been linked with the growth of continental crust, emergence of the first supercontinent, and mantle overturn at the Archean-Proterozoic boundary. The GOE could have thus been triggered by enhanced nutrient supply to the oceans lifting the limit on biological productivity during a period with intensive mantle plume activity when the first supercontinent was assembled, emphasizing an underappreciated role of endogenic processes as a driver of redox fluctuations in the atmosphere-ocean system.",

            "abstract": "Earlier this year SEI, in conjunction with the Environmental Secretary of Quito, concluded a vulnerability analysis for the Metropolitan District of Quito (DMQ). The study analyzed future anthropogenic and natural hazards, and how these threats may be potentially exacerbated by a changing climate over the next 40 years. The focus of this abstract is specifically on the vulnerability of the agricultural sector.\nOverall, there is a lack of consensus amongst the results of long-term trends of precipitation in the Quito region. However, there is much more confidence in the trends of mean air temperature increase, and therefore this analysis focused specifically upon the effects of increasing temperatures upon Quito’s agricultural sector.  \nEffects of a roughly 2°C increase in mean air temperature by 2050 (corresponding to a relative CO2 concentration pathway within the GCMs of 8.5) was evaluated with respect to its potential effects upon the length of growing season for principal crops, and which of these crops are most vulnerable to the increased heat stress. Also studied was the potential expansion of agriculture into higher elevation areas, namely the sensitive ‘paramo’ alpine ecosystem, due to increasing arability of these areas as temperatures rise.  The extent of cultivation of ‘paramos' areas was estimated in order to assess the likely diminutive effects upon local hydrology and ecosystem well-being.\nOur results show that in fact it is expected that the increase in temperature would have a positive effect on the development of some crops, though the growing seasons would likely be shortened, which may be problematic given soil and rainfall constraints.\nRegarding expansion of agriculture into the ‘paramo’ highlands, results showed that each 200m zone above 3400masl would experience a marked increase in agricultural land conversion, ranging from 15 – 55km2, depending upon the zone. The lowest zones are expectedly the most vulnerable as they already exist at the interface of the current agricultural frontier.  The need for additional adaptation, conservation, and land management planning initiatives in the region are echoed by these results, as well as need for further scrutiny of these issues under additional scenarios and sectoral lenses in order to best inform smart policy making in the DMQ.",

            "abstract": "A new frontier in consideration of socio-economic benefit is valuing information as an asset, often referred to as Infonomics. Conventional financial practice does not easily provide a mechanism for valuing information and yet clearly for many of the largest corporations, such as Google and Facebook, it is their principal asset. This is exacerbated for public sector organizations, as those that information-centric rather than information-enabled are relatively few – statistics, archiving and mapping agencies are perhaps the only examples – so it’s not at the top of the agenda for Government.\nHowever, it is a hugely important issue when valuing Geospatial data and information. Geospatial data allows public institutions to operate, and facilitates the provision of essential services for emergency response and national defense. In this respect, geospatial data is strongly analogous to other types of public infrastructure, such as utilities and roads.\nThe use of Geospatial data is widespread from companies in the transportation or construction sectors to individual planning for daily events. The categorization of geospatial data as infrastructure is critical to decisions related to investment in its management, maintenance and upgrade over time. Geospatial data depreciates in the same way that physical infrastructure depreciates. It needs to be maintained otherwise its functionality and value in use declines. We have coined the term geo-infonomics to encapsulate the concept. This presentation will develop the arguments around its importance and current avenues of research.",

Expedition planning included input from the ocean science and management community, and was executed with more than 70 scientists and students from 14 U.S. states participating from shore in real time.\nTraining the next generation permeated operations: a mapping internship program trained undergraduate and graduate students; an ROV mentorship program trained young engineers to design, build and operate the system; and undergraduate through doctoral students around the country collaborated with expedition scientists via telepresence.\nOnline coverage of the expedition included background materials, daily updates, and mission logs that received more than 100,000 visits by the public. Live video feeds of operations received more than 700,000 views online. Additionally, professional development workshops hosted in multiple locations throughout the spring introduced educators to the Okeanos Explorer Educational Materials Collection and the live expedition, and taught them how to use the website and education resources in their classrooms.\nSocial media furthered the reach of the expedition to new audiences, garnered thousands of new followers and provided another medium for real-time interactions with the general public. Outreach continued through live interactions with museums and aquariums, Exploration Command Center tours, outreach conducted by partners, and media coverage in more than 190 outlets in the U.S. and Europe. Ship tours were conducted when the ship came in to port to engage local scientists, ocean managers, and educators. After the expedition, data and products were archived and quickly shared with ocean managers and scientists working in the region, providing a baseline of publicly available data and stimulating follow-on exploration, research and management activities within a few months of expedition completion.",

            "abstract": "Downdip and along-strike variations in the seismic behavior of subduction zone megathrust faults are thought to be strongly controlled by changes in the material properties along the plate boundary. Roughness and hydration of the incoming plate, fluid pressure and lithology in the subducting sediment channel are likely to control the distribution of shallower rupture. Here, we focus on the subduction zone offshore of the Alaska Peninsula. In 2011, the ALEUT program acquired deep penetration multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection and ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) data across the apparently freely sliding Shumagin Gap, the locked Semidi segment that last ruptured in 1938 M8.2 earthquake, and the locked western Kodiak asperity, which ruptured in the 1964 M9.2 earthquake.\nSeismic reflection data from the ALEUT cruise reveal significant variability in the thickness of sediment on the incoming plate and entering the trench, and the roughness and degree of hydration of the incoming plate. Oceanic crust entering the trench in the Shumagin gap is rugged with extensive faults and only a thin layer of sediment (<0.5 km thick). Farther east in the Semidi segment, the subducting plate has a smoother surface with thicker sediments (~1 km thick) and less faulting/hydration. To better constrain the properties of the accretionary prism and shallow part of the plate boundary, we are undertaking travel time tomography using reflection/refraction phases in OBS and MCS data, and constraints on the interface geometry from MCS images to estimate the detailed shallow velocity structure, with particular focus on properties within the shallow subduction channel. We observe refractions and reflections in OBS data from the shallow part of the subduction zone in both the Shumagin Gap and Semidi segment, including reflections off the top and base of what appears to be a layer of subducting sediment, which can be used for this work. We plan to present initial models of the shallow part of the subduction zone from both segments and discuss comparisons between the two.",

            "abstract": "The Lodo Formation (central CA), records the carbon isotope excursion (CIE) associated with the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) in a continental margin setting, where increased sedimentation rates - attributed to an enhanced hydrological cycle - provide a means for significant carbon drawdown after the peak of this hyperthermal event (John et al. 2008). This study investigates variations in grain size associated with the recovery from peak CIE values to better constrain the potential mechanism of the apparent increase in sedimentation rates, which can shed light on climate dynamics and feedbacks associated with other warming events.\nWe collected bulk samples at ~10 cm increments over a stratigraphic interval that encompasses the previously documented CIE onset, peak, and recovery phases. We used a laser diffraction particle size analyzer on disaggregated samples to permit detection of variation within clay and silt sediment size fractions (2-63 microns) in addition to sand-size grains. Results show that, while the onset and peak CIE is associated with abundant clays, the recovery interval preserves a marked shift in median grain size to coarse silt and very fine sand. Ongoing work indicates that the grain size increase is not associated with an increase in foraminiferal abundance.\nEnhanced terrigenous sediment delivery during the CIE recovery could explain both the increase in grain size (this study) and sedimentation rates (previous work). This increased sediment supply could be attributed to (1) increased seasonality and storm intensity during the hyperthermal, (2) marine regression (i.e. basinward shift in shoreline) associated with decreasing rates of sea level rise during sea level highstand, or some combination of these factors. Future work to document compositional and preservational changes in sediments and foraminifera over this time interval will aid in teasing apart the relative influence of potential drivers of change associated with this event.",

            "abstract": "We report high-resolution pollen and charcoal records from lake sediments obtained from Lago Mellizas and Lago Churrasco to reconstruct the history of vegetation, fire and past variations of the southern westerly winds (SWW) over the last 2000 years. Both sites are located near to the climate-modulated forest-steppe ecotone in central west Patagonia. In this region the SWW are the only source of precipitation and is ideal for reconstructing past changes in atmospheric circulation. This is facilitated by the marked west-east precipitation gradient across the Patagonian Andes that induces a zonation of the regional vegetation which can be used for inferring past changes in precipitation regimes based on fossil pollen records. Furthermore, the Chilean-European colonization process in central west Patagonia started early in the 20th century, allowing characterization of natural vegetation and climate variability in the absence of human disturbance until the end of the 19th century. The pollen records shows dominance of Nothofagus deciduous forests with minor fluctuations and low herb and aquatics abundances, which suggest humid climate conditions. We detect a major change in the pollen stratigraphy at 200 cal yr BP, when started a sustained decreasing trend in Nothofagus, along with increases of Poaceae and aquatics plants (Cyperaceae, Myriophyllum). We interpret these changes as a forest opening and centripetal expansion of littoral environments toward the lake center driven by lake-level lowering in response to lowered precipitation brought by the SWW. Pinus, Rumex, Plantago, which indicate human perturbation, increase in 1900 AD. Macroscopic charcoal increases at 1750, 1400, 850-700, 500, and 200 cal yr BP, suggesting local fires, followed by sharp increases during the last 100 years. We interpret the pre-20th century charcoal peaks as dry intervals with lowered SWW influence.\nAcknowledgement: Fondecyt 1121141, Fondap 15110009, and ICM grants P02-51 and NC120066.",

            "abstract": "Landscape resilience refers to the ability of systems to adapt to and recover from disturbance. In pastoral landscapes, degradation can be measured in terms of increased desertification and/or shrub encroachment. In many countries across Central Asia, the use and resilience of pastoral systems has changed markedly over the past 25 years, influenced by centralized Soviet governance, private property rights and recently, communal resource governance. In Kyrgyzstan, recent governance reforms were in response to the increasing degradation of pastures attributed to livestock overgrazing. Our goal is to examine and map the landscape-level factors that influence overgrazing throughout successive governance periods.\nHere, we map and examine some of the spatial factors influencing landscape resilience in agro-pastoral systems in the Kyrgyzstan Republic where pastures occupy >50% of the country’s area. We ask three questions: 1) which mechanisms of pasture degradation (desertification vs. shrub encroachment), are detectable using remote sensing vegetation indices?; 2) Are these degraded pastures associated with landscape features that influence herder mobility and accessibility (e.g., terrain, distance to other pastures)?; and 3) Have these patterns changed through successive governance periods? Using a chronosequence of Landsat imagery (1999-2014), NDVI and other VIs were used to identify trends in pasture condition during the growing season. Least-cost path distances as well as graph theoretic indices were derived from topographic factors to assess landscape connectivity (from villages to pastures and among pastures). Fieldwork was used to assess the feasibility and accuracy of this approach using the most recent imagery. Previous research concluded that low herder mobility hindered pasture use, thus we expect the distance from pasture to village to be an important predictor of pasture condition. This research will quantify the magnitude of pastoral degradation and test assumptions regarding sustainable pastoral management. As grazing is the most extensive land use on Earth, understanding the broad-scale factors that influence the resilience of pastoral systems is an important issue globally.",

            "abstract": "To explore scenarios involving condensation in Pluto's atmosphere, a 1-D microphysics model based on the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA) has been developed. CARMA has been used successfully many times to explore the vertical distribution, size, shape, and composition of particles in Titan's atmosphere, and in particular, to predict the appearance of methane condensate layers which were observed at the Huygens' landing site. Physical processes in CARMA include nucleation, condensation, evaporation, sedimentation, and coagulation. In Pluto's atmosphere, most of the condensation would require the presence of a troposphere with at least a few kilometers vertical extent. However, if photochemical production proceeds similarly to the case of Titan's atmosphere, there are possibilities for condensation at higher altitudes as well. A number of sensitivity tests will be presented, including variations in the abundance, size, and shape of haze particles; evaluating the onset of homogeneous methane nucleation; exploring the size distribution of the resulting methane ice particles; and the effects of condensation of other photochemically produced trace species as well.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies indicate that equatorial zonal winds in the Indian Ocean largely influence the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) transport, and thus they could impact the upper ocean variability in the Indonesian Seas. Since strong equatorial zonal winds in the Indian Ocean are often observed during MJO events, they could generate significant upper ocean variability through oceanic processes. This study investigates upper ocean variability in the Indonesian Seas caused by the MJO-induced equatorial zonal winds using the global eddy-resolving ocean general circulation model (HYCOM).\nDuring the intensive observation period of DYNAMO field campaign (fall/winter 2011), three active episodes of large-scale convection associated with the MJO passed eastward across the tropical Indian Ocean. Surface westerly winds near the equator were particularly strong during the events in late November and late December, exceeding 10 m/s. These westerlies generate strong eastward jets on the equator, and downwelling near the eastern boundary.These equatorial jets are realistically simulated by HYCOM. The analysis of the model output demonstrates that anomalous positive SSH at the eastern boundary propagates along the coast of Sumatra and Java as coastal Kelvin waves, which largely reduces the ITF transport at Makassar Strait during January-February. The impact of ITF variability on upper ocean temperature and salinity in the Indonesian Seas is further discussed based on the analysis of HYCOM output.",

            "abstract": "Late summer and early fall arctic sea ice extent has declined dramatically, especially since 2007. We here identify atmospheric circulation and surface features across the northern hemisphere mid and high latitudes associated with this period since 2007 of rapid fall sea ice decline. At monthly to seasonal timescales, we report large anomalies in the zonal wind and geopotential height fields. At submonthly scales, we demonstrate how changes in the frequency of blocking events and associated prolonged temperature anomalies over populous mid-latitude regions have changed as well in conjunction with fall Arctic sea ice decline since 2007. This suggests that sea ice anomaly data can inform mid and high latitude climate prediction on interannual to decadal timescales.\nWe also analyze historical and RCP simulations from the latest CMIP5 models, and find that over 98 percent of all six year simulation intervals show a decline (or increase) of September ice extent trends that is smaller than what has been observed between 2007 and 2012. We close by briefly speaking to the question of whether the combination of 1) a new Arctic sea ice state in late summer/early fall and 2) mid-latitude teleconnections may be introducing new sources of predictability to mid-latitude weather and climate on interannual to decadal timescales.",

Jinchuan ultramafic intrusion hosts the third largest magmatic Cu-Ni deposit in the world. There are mainly four orebodies, namely, orebody-58, orebody-24, orebody-1, and orebody-2, respectively from west to east in the deposit. The primary characteristics of Jinchuan Cu-Ni sulfide deposit are the following： (1) There is an obvious boundary between orebodys and country rocks, usually orebodys intruded into country rocks. (2) “sulfide melts” migrate and settle in the later stage of magma evolution. (3) Fluid Minerals Assemblages are found in the sulfide ores, there is Phl+Cc+Pn+Ccp+Po in orebody-2; Phl+Dol+AP+Pn+Ccp+Po in orebody-24; Q+Mag+AP+Pn+Ccp+Po in orebody-58. (4) Massive sulfides mainly occur in orebody-2, and its PGE content is very rare. Pt-Pd enrichment zones mainly occur in orebody-1; orebody-24 and orebody-58. Ir vs. Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd show positive relationship in orebody-2, but Ir vs. Ru, Rh show positive relationship, Ir vs. Pt, Pd exhibit negative relationship in orebody-1, orebody-24 and orebody-58. The modeling of Ir-Pd shows that the massive sulfide in orebody-2 maybe the origin of MSS. Pt-Pd enrichment zones in orebody-1 orebody-24 and orebody-58 are the relic liquid of monosulfide solid solution segregation; (5) Cu/Ni value is 1.24 in orebody-58, 1.56 in orebody-24, 1.83 in orebody-1, and 2.06 in orebody-2.\nThese features imply that (1) “ore magma” or “melt-fluid bearing metal” formed in the staging chamber in depth; (2) “ore magma” might contain a lot of fluids; (3) “melt-fluid bearing metal” flow moves as a whole; (4) The moving direction of melt-fluid bearing metal flow is form west to east.

            "abstract": "Geophysics has become a common tool in the last two decades to supplement the lack of groundwater (GW) data for GW models calibration. One of the common applications is investigating the solute transport processes such as seawater intrusion, which, under certain geological conditions, is a good target for electromagnetic methods. Combining these two different sources of data, however, is still subject of ongoing investigation. One of the caveats is the different scales of geophysical and GW models, as well as the empirical petrophysical relationships that relate geophysical and groundwater states. Solving the parameter estimation problem in this field adds even more complexity, and careful analysis of the potential and the limitations of such an inverse problem should therefore precede the collection of field data.\nWe developed a 3D groundwater model for variable density flow in Matlab based on discretized flow and solute mass balance equations. In conjunction with the GW model, a geophysical model was developed for 3D electromagnetic modeling and inversion in the time domain. Having both models in the same environment makes the implementation of coupling easier. In our inverse problem, we assume we can collect data for both geophysical and groundwater processes and that we have some information about groundwater model parameters. The unknown parameter can be initial or current solute content depending on the available data.\nIn the joint inversion framework the data misfit error was minimized for both models at the same time. To achieve this we derived the sensitivities of collected data w.r.t to the solute content (and soil bulk conductivity) based on discretized system of equations. This helps to reduce the computational burden of the problem but also gives insights about experiment setup. The objective function then consists of data misfit and regularization terms but also coupling term that relates groundwater and geophysical states. The coupling term can be represented by Archie's law, if known, or just by some similarity measure (e.g. cross gradient field product). Due to the synthetic character of our example we can compare the results with other coupled inversion frameworks and also just separate inversion by either groundwater or geophysical model.",

            "abstract": "Land use activities, through the provision of natural resources, are essential to human existence. In many regions land use change is degrading biodiversity and threatening the sustainability of ecosystem services upon which communities and livelihoods depend. Spatially explicit land use change models are widely used to understand and quantify key processes that affect land use change and make predictions about past and future change. These models typically include a module to estimate the suitability of different locations to particular land use types based on biophysical and socioeconomic predictor variables and a module to allocate change spatially. They are commonly implemented in languages such as C/C++ and Fortran and made available as standalone applications or through proprietary GIS. In many cases the models are released under closed source licences, limiting the reproducibility of scientific results and making model comparison difficult. This work presents a new R package providing methods and classes to support land use change modelling and model development and comparison within the open source R statistical computing environment. The package makes use of existing R implementations of methods such as random forests and recursive partitioning and regression trees to estimate location suitability, as well as providing methods for statistical model building and evaluation. Currently two spatial allocation methods are provided: the first based on the widely used and tested CLUE-S algorithm and the second a novel stochastic procedure developed for large scale applications. Some common tools for evaluating allocation results are implemented. It is hoped that the package will provide a framework for the development of new routines that can be incorporated into future releases of the code.",

We use time-lapse seismic data for joint inversion to reduce inversion artifacts outside target monitoring regions. Two walkaway vertical seismic profiling (VSP) datasets were acquired at the SACROC enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) field in Texas in 2008 and 2009 for monitoring CO2 injection and migration. We apply our new double-difference waveform inversion method to the SACROC time-lapse VSP datasets.

            "abstract": "High-sinuosity submarine fan channels on the Amazon Fan were first observed using long-range (GLORIA) side-scan sonar in 1982 and mapped in greater detail using multibeam sonar in 1984. These data have provided important insights into the nature and evolution of submarine channel systems. Subsequent studies on the Amazon Fan have focused on avulsion patterns, sedimentation patterns, fan growth and the climate record contained in fan sediments, and there has been relatively little additional work on the details of sinuous channel morphology. Channels on the Amazon Fan have been imaged by multibeam sonar on several occasions since 1984 during focused studies, regional mapping and ship transit. These multibeam data are being compiled and studied to better characterize these iconic channels. One observation of particular interest is that, on the Amazon Fan, channel-wall slumps appear to be more common than previously thought. Drilling of a cut-off meander during ODP Leg 155 on the Amazon Fan showed the presence of slumped material deeper in the channel suggesting that failure of the channel wall was in part responsible for the abandonment and filling of that meander loop. The failure also apparently created a sandy debris flow with clasts of fine-grained levee material transported in a sandy matrix. This sandy debris flow may have been able to flow along the channel and deposit at the seaward end where similar sediments can be found. Disturbed zones now visible on the inner walls of channels at several other places along the channels suggest that these kinds of inner-wall slumps may play important roles in channel evolution and fan growth. Channel-blocking slumps can isolate channel loops which can then fill with sandy sediments, and avulsions are likely if this kind of slump fills the channel. The failure of channel walls can also lead to new channel segments that tend to straighten the channel. Dramatic changes to the shape of the channel can likely lead to large and sudden changes in the planform shape of meanders farther down the channel. Thus while similarities in sinuosity patterns suggest that both submarine channels and river channels are being altered by repetitive flow events, channel-wall slumping in submarine channels may affect submarine channel evolution to a greater extent than similar events in rivers.",

            "abstract": "Assessment of the tempo of past methane discharges from sub-surface reservoirs, and their relationship to external forcings such as ice-sheet collapse, is in part hindered by the lack of robust age constraints. Methane-derived authigenic carbonate (MDAC) crusts exhibiting characteristic 13C-depleted isotopic signatures were collected from several seepage sites on the Norwegian continental shelf, including sites in the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea and a combined petrological, stable isotope and geochronology study has been carried out. MDAC samples exhibited a range of mineralogical compositions and contexts, from carbonate-cemented silt, sand, and gravel, to cavities lined with relatively pure (>90%) late-stage aragonitic infills. The U-Th dating results constrain the main episode of carbonate crust formation in the Barents and Norwegian seas during the time interval between 14 and 5 ka. Based on analyses of matrix-forming CaCO3 and multiple generations of cavity fills individual, up to 15 cm thick crusts may represent at least 3.3 kyr of growth. Cavity fills representing focussed fluid flow post-date the main interval of crust formation by ca. 2 kyr and sub-sampling of these layered cavity fills revealed resolvable growth histories, on the order of 1 kyr. The dating of the main phases of MDAC formation suggest that the methane seepage along the northern Norwegian margin was coincident with the collapse of the Scandinavian ice sheet and deglaciation of the area. The precipitation of studied North Sea carbonate crusts occurred more recently, from 6 to 1 ka, suggesting that their formation is unrelated to the glacial history of the area and gas hydrate stability. These data, combined with published data from other MDAC sites (e.g., Gulf of Mexico, Hydrate Ridge, Sea of Japan) demonstrate the utility of constraining the temporal evolution of hydrate and/or hydrocarbon system related fluid flow from the subsurface to the ocean/atmosphere, and assessing variation within and between different basins and areas (e.g., glaciated vs. non-glaciated terranes).",

            "abstract": "The presence of liquid petroleum hydrocarbons at the sea water surface is an important source of marine pollution. An oil spill in sea-water will most likely occur due to an involuntary accident from tankers, offshore platforms, etc. However, a large amount of oil is also deliberately spilled in sea-water during the clean-out process of tank vessels (e.g. for the Mediterranean Sea, 490,000 tons/yr). Moreover, the pollution caused by an oil spill does not only affect the aquatic environment but also is of concern for the atmospheric environment. A portion of the oil matter present at the sea-water surface is transported into the atmosphere viaevaporation and adsorption at the surface of sea spray particles. Few studies are related to the presence of oil matter in airborne particles resulting from their adsorption on sea salt aerosols.\nWe observed that the non-volatile oil matter was adsorbed at the surface of sea-salt crystals (av. size of 1.1 µm). Due to their small size, these particles can have a significant residence time in the atmosphere. The hydrocarbon matter adsorbed at the surface of these particles can also be transformed by catalyzers present in the atmosphere (i.e. UV, OH, O3, ...). In this work, we focused on the photo-oxidation rates of the C16 to C30alkanes present in these particles.\nWe utilized a bubble column reactor, which produced an abundance of small sized bubbles. These bubbles generated droplets upon bursting at the air-salt water interface. These droplets were then further dried up and lifted to the top of the column where they were collected as particles. These particles were incubated in a controlled reactor in either dark conditions or under UV-visible light. The difference of alkane content analyzed by GC-MS between the particles exposed to UV or the particles not exposed to UV indicated that up to 20% in mass was lost after 20 min of light exposure. The degradation kinetics varied for each range of alkanes (C16-20, C21-25, C26-30) from 20 to 60 µg L-1 min-1. To observe the effect on air composition when samples are exposed to solar light, experiments were conducted under controlled atmospheric conditions: oxygen free or with O3 gas. The results showed the importance of the photo-transformation processes of oil in airborne particles and its relation to the gaseous nature of the ambient atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown variations in the low latitude ionosphere that are linked to Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) events. Although previous studies have provided important information on the ionospheric response to SSW events, they have been fairly localized. Therefore, broader observational capabilities and data are required that can unambiguously reveal the instantaneous global response of the ionosphere to SSW events. In this paper, we present results from ASTRA’s Ionospheric Data Assimilation Four-Dimensional (IDA4D) algorithm to describe a global view of the ionospheric variability during SSW events in 2009 and 2013. In both years, the response is characterized by above normal TECs during the day-time and below average TECs during the night-time. In this study, we also show that even though the 2009 SSW was stronger than the 2013 SSW, the ionospheric response in 2009 was significantly weaker than that in 2013.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate records from fossil corals provide valuable benchmarks for climate model simulations of tropical climate variability. Unfortunately, the number of such reconstructions is limited by the rarity of the relatively large fossil coral heads that are targeted for paleoclimate studies. Abundant, albeit shorter (5-10yrs-long) fossil coral sequences could be used to generate a more robust, quasi-continuous reconstruction of tropical climate with built-in uncertainty estimates, but the large number of radiometric dates required is costly. A new rapid-screen 14C dating method, with a nominal precision of ±1.8% (1σ) for young carbonates (Bush et al., 2013), is roughly 10 times faster than high-precision U/Th dating, making it well-suited to screening a large number of corals. In this study, we compare rapid-screen 14C dates to both high-precision 14C dates and U/Th dates from well-characterized mid- to late-Holocene fossil corals collected from Christmas and Fanning Islands (2-4°N, 157-160°W) (Cobb et al., 2013). Our results show that most rapid-screen 14C dates agree with high-precision 14C dates (N=3) and U/Th dates (N=42), within combined uncertainties. However, two samples that contain 15 and 23% calcite (as determined by XRD) are associated with large discrepancies in calibrated 14C vs published U/Th ages (5065-5579 yBP (2σ) versus 6350 ±13 yBP (2σ) and 4868-5424 yBP (2σ) vs 6598 ±13 yBP (2σ)), respectively (Cobb et al., 2013). The 14C-U/Th mismatches, as well as poor reproducibility of replicate U/Th dates from these samples, are consistent with diagenetic alteration indicated by the presence of calcite. Mass balance calculations indicate that the dating discrepancies can be explained by a combination of 14C addition and U removal, both of which can occur through calcite recrystallization during freshwater diagenesis. Results illustrate that the rapid-screen 14C dating method is well-suited to surveying a large number (~100’s) of fossil coral samples, provided that samples are pre-screened for calcite. Beyond that, concordance between paired 14C and U/Th dates provides valuable confirmation of closed-system behavior and chronological accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Open questions exist regarding chemical transport by convection and the sensitivity of Lightning Nitrogen Oxide (LNOx) production to flash type (IC vs. CG), channel height, and channel length. To help answer these and other questions, the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field project was conducted during the spring of 2012. On 29 May 2012, observations of an Oklahoma supercell were collected by two mobile SMART-R radars, the mobile NOXP radar, multiple NEXRAD radars, the Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array (LMA), and the NSF/NCAR HIAPER and NASA DC-8 aircraft. In this study, data from the mobile and NEXRAD radars are assimilated into the NSSL COMMAS model using the Ensemble Kalman Filter, beginning shortly after initiation of convection and ending when the aircraft made their final measurements of the storm's outflow. The model analyses produce a realistic representation of the kinematic character of the storm throughout this time period. COMMAS includes the NSSL multimoment microphysics, explicit cloud electrification, and a branched lightning discharge scheme, which is used to produce LNOx within the model via a method dependent upon air pressure and lightning channel length. Model results will be presented and compared to radar, lightning, and aircraft observations. Of particular importance, the vertical distribution of lightning, channel length of lightning, and LNOx production and transport in the model will be analyzed and compared to LMA observations and anvil-level outflow observations from the aircraft. In addition, to examine entrainment and detrainment of air by the storm and to provide a check on LNOx production and transport, trajectory analyses will be presented and the transport of inert trace gases such as carbon monoxide in the model will be analyzed and compared to aircraft measurements.",

The Orca Basin, a 2400 meter deep bathymetric depression on the continental slope of the north-central Gulf of Mexico, is an ideal environment to examine how redox-dependent biochemical processes control the input and cycling of bacterial and archaea-derived lipid compounds from formation in near-surface water, through secondary recycling processes operating at the redox-transition in the water column, to sedimentary diagenetic processes operating in oxic to anoxic zones within the basin. The lowermost 180 meters of the Orca Basin is characterized by an anoxic, hypersaline brine that is separated from the overlying oxic seawater by a well-defined redox sequence associated with a systematic increasing in salinity from 35 – 250‰. While surface water conditions are viewed as normal marine with a seasonally productive water column, the sub-oxic to anoxic transition zones within the deep-water column and the sediment spans over 200 m allowing the unique opportunity for discrete sampling of resident organisms and lipids.\nHere we present 16s rRNA sequence data of Bacteria and Archaea collected parallel to GDGT lipid profiles and in situ environmental measurements from the sediment and overlying water column in the intermediate zone of the basin, where movements of chemical transition zones are preserved. We evaluated GDGTs and corresponding taxa across the surface water, chlorophyll maximum, thermocline, and the deep redox boundary, including oxygenation, denitrification, manganese, iron and sulfate reduction zones, to determine if GDGTs are being produced under these conditions and how surface-derived GDGT lipids and the TEX86 signal may be altered. The results have implications for the application of the TEX86 paleotemperature proxy.",

            "abstract": "Comets have three known reservoirs: the roughly spherical Oort Cloud (for long-period comets), the flattened Kuiper Belt (for ecliptic comets), and, surprisingly, the asteroid belt (for main-belt comets). Comets in the Oort Cloud are thought to have formed in the region of the giant planets and then placed in quasi-stable orbits at distances of thousands or tens of thousands of AU through the gravitational effects of the planets and the Galaxy. Originally the planets were thought to have formed in place. However, Fernández and Ip (1984) proposed that Jupiter would have migrated slightly inward, while Saturn and (especially) Uranus and Neptune would have migrated outward as they interacted with a massive disk of planetesimals. Malhotra (1993) showed that Pluto's orbit in the 3:2 resonance with Neptune was a natural outcome if Neptune captured Pluto into resonance while it migrated outward. Building on this work, Tsiganis et al. (2005) proposed the \"Nice\" model, in which the giant planets formed closer together than they are now, and, perhaps many hundreds of Myr later, underwent a dynamical instability that led to a flood of comets and asteroids throughout the Solar System (Gomes et al. 2005). In this scenario, it is somewhat a matter of luck whether an icy planetesimal ends up in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud (Brasser and Morbidelli 2013), as a Trojan asteroid (Morbidelli et al. 2005, Nesvorný and Vokrouhlický 2009, Nesvorný et al. 2013), or as a distant \"irregular\" satellite of a giant planet (Nesvorný et al. 2007). Comets could even have been captured into the asteroid belt (Levison et al. 2009). The remarkable finding of two \"inner Oort cloud\" bodies, Sedna and 2012 VP113 (Brown et al. 2004, Sheppard and Trujillo 2014), suggests that the Sun formed in a denser environment, i.e., in a star cluster (Brasser et al. 2006, Kaib and Quinn 2008, Brasser et al. 2012).\nMy talk will focus on how, in spite of this unexpected complexity, we can attempt to surmise the histories of comets from clues such as the size distributions of their nuclei (Lamy et al. 2004, Fraser et al. 2014) and current ideas about rapid formation of planetesimals through \"pebble accretion\" (Johansen et al. 2012). I will also discuss new insights from Rosetta's recent arrival at ecliptic comet 67P and the close approach of long-period comet C/2013 A1 to Mars in October.",

In the presence of a guide magnetic field to magnetize the electrons, large scale current layers form extending to the system size [1]. In geometries with low upstream electron pressure the heating of the electrons becomes significant and relevant to observations in the magnetotail [2]. Utilizing the Madison Plasma Dynamo Experiment (MPDX) facility at UW-Madison a new reconnection experiment is now being implemented to address the role of electron pressure anisotropy in reconnection. This requires an experiment that accesses plasmas with much lower collisionality and lower plasma beta than are available in present experiments. The new experiment will be a major addition to the MPDX facility, including an insert with internal coils to drive reconnection. The insert is designed to supplement the\nongoing dynamo experiments and to permit flexible reconfiguration of the magnetic geometry for a range of reconnection studies.\n[1] Le A et el., PRL 110, 135004 (2013).\n[2] Egedal J et al., Nature Physics, 8, 321 (2012).",

Since their discovery over two hundred papers discussing their properties, causes and physics have been published. However, their fundamental nature and the physics of their interactions with other solar phenomena are still not understood. To further the understanding of EUV waves, and their relation to other solar phenomena, we are developing AWARE - the Automated Wave Analysis and REduction algorithm for the detection of EUV waves over the full Sun. AWARE is a Python-based, open-source algorithm that utilizes the SunPy data analysis package and general purpose signal processing libraries. The core detection algorithm is based on a novel image processing approach to isolating the bright wavefront of the EUV as it propagates across the confounding background emission of the complex structured solar corona. The location, speed and acceleration of the wavefront as a function of direction from the source events are calculated. We describe the core image processing steps of the AWARE algorithm, and demonstrate its application to observational data from SDO/AIA and STEREO/EUVI.",

            "abstract": "Everglades National Park (ENP) represents one of the largest wetlands in the United States, where carbon cycling and primary productivity are closely linked to hydroperiod. Only recently has an integrative assessment of the CO2balance been undertaken in ENP. Previous periphyton and marcrophyte clipping experiments suggest that aquatic primary productivity (APP) is generally low in the Everglades freshwater marsh ecosystems. However, few studies have quantified aquatic metabolism in ENP, which may have significant influence on the entire ecosystem carbon dynamics.\nEddy covariance towers were installed at a long- and short-hydroperiod marsh (Shark River Slough, SRS and Taylor Slough; TS, respectively) within ENP and have been running since 2008 . Net ecosystem exchange of CO2, H2O, and energy between the ecosystem and the atmosphere were measured along with meteorological data. To address how interannual and habitat variations in APP influences overall CO2 flux dynamics, we installed a D-Opto dissolved oxygen sensor (Zebra-Tech LTD) at each site in March of 2011, which allowed us to collect percent dissolved oxygen (DO%), dissolved oxygen concentration (DO ppm), and water temperature (oC) data at half hourly intervals from March of 2011 until present.\nWe calculated gross and net aquatic primary productivity (ANPP), and night time aquatic respiration (AR), and compare interannual and inter site variation in APP between SRS and TS from October 2011 through December 2013. Our results reveal that across all three years (2011 – 2013) ANPP and AR were significantly higher at TS. ANPP was 15%, 16%, and 20% higher, and AR was 96%, 55%, and 7% higher at TS than at SRS. These results indicate that APP is contributing to the ecosystem carbon dynamics and differs with hydroperiod. Along with meteorological and data collected at the flux towers, we were also able to relate APP to changes in water level, photosynthetically active radiation and water temperature.\nThis is the first long term continuous study on water column carbon dynamics in ENP. Currently the Everglades is undergoing hydrological restoration, and further studies will help elucidate how interactions between aquatic abiotic conditions contribute to variations in between site APP, and how APP affects ecosystem level carbon flux dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Recurring slope lineae (RSL) are very exciting features that exhibit evidence for water flow on the Martian surface. The number of RSL sites has risen to ~100 since their first detection in 2011. Those sites extend over a large portion of the Valles Marineris margin and nearby smaller canyons, but no source for this flowing water has been identified. Two possible sources exist for water near the Martian equator: the atmospheric and the subsurface. At low latitudes, atmospheric water vapor abundance is extremely low, and condensation of water from the air is unlikely. Furthermore, subsurface water ice is unlikely to remain stable in the long term, but scenarios for retaining ice on shorter timescales have not been fully tested.\nThe Shallow Radar (SHARAD) instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has successfully probed the subsurface of Mars to locate dielectric interfaces that delineate volcanic boundaries, layers within the polar ice caps, and ice-rock boundaries. Using the same technique of searching for dielectric contrasts at lower latitudes, we have found several detections at the highest elevations of the Tharsis Plateau, near the cliffs that form Valles Marineris at depths ranging from 30 to 80 m, depending on the dielectric properties of the overlying material. These reflectors are located near the canyon rim and slope towards the canyon, potentially crossing geologic boundaries mapped from surface data.\nBecause of the proximity of the reflectors to RSL and the geometry of the reflections, we hypothesize that SHARAD may be detecting an ice or water reservoir that can act as a source for flowing water on the surface. We test this hypothesis by employing a one-dimensional thermal model to estimate the stability of ground ice over a wide range of durations at this latitude, including recent epochs of high obliquity, when ice would be more stable at low latitudes and for longer periods.",

            "abstract": "Global demand for renewable energy is accelerating land conversion from common row crops such as maize and soybean to cellulosic biofuel crops such as miscanthus and switchgrass. This land conversion is expected to alter ecohydrology via changes in evapotranspiration (ET). However, the direction in which evapotranspiration will shift, either partitioning more moisture through soil evaporation (E) or through plant transpiration (T) is uncertain.\nTo investigate how land conversion from maize to miscanthus affects ET partitioning we measured the isotopic composition of water vapor via continuous air sampling. We obtained continuous diurnal measurements of δ2H and δ18O for miscanthus and maize on multiple days over the course of the growing season. Water vapor isotopes drawn from two heights were measured at 2 Hz using a cavity ringdown spectrometer and partitioned into components of E and T using a simple mixing equation. A second approach to partitioning was accomplished by subtracting transpiration measurements, obtained through sap flow sensors, from total ET, measured via eddy covariance. Preliminary results reveal that both methods compare favorably and that transpiration dominates variations in ET in miscanthus fields more so than in fields of maize.",

            "abstract": "Mountain gap winds (MGW) are a low-level jet feature that results from the interaction between the large-scale flow and mountain gaps. The focus of this study is the MGW events that occur over the Gulf of Tehuantepec, originating from the Chivela Pass in the Sierra Madre mountain range. MGW at this location can attain speeds in excess of 25 meters per second and can extend for a long distance over the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The high winds and seas associated with an MGW event pose a hazard to both aviation and shipping industries within the area. In this context, it is important to understand processes that modulate the intensity of the jet, its diurnal variation, and the ability of numerical models to forecast these events. We utilized nested grid configuration of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model over the Chivela Pass region to simulate the evolution of twelve different gap wind events. The case days considered includes gale, storm, and hurricane force events. Output from the 1km spacing inner most grid is compared against Cross-Calibrated, Multi-Platform (CCMP) ocean surface wind product. These events are also analyzed to determine processes that are most responsible for variability in jet intensity within and between the different event categories. Numerical simulations show distinct differences in the vertical structure of the jet as a function of the force categories. Distribution of pressure gradient in the vicinity of the Chivela Pass also shows substantial difference depending upon the force category. Intensity of the jet is also modulated by other factors including stability aloft and boundary layer evolution at the entrance and exit regions of the jet. The relationship of these factors to synoptic precursor patterns and the processes through which these factors impact the intensity of the jet will be discussed in context of conceptual models of mountain gap winds.",

The recent discovery of an extensive liquid water reservoir within the Greenland ice sheet firn further complicates the relationship of melt to SLR, since the aquifer system may be either buffering or accelerating SLR. However, even the most fundamental questions about the firn aquifer remain unanswered.\nA suite of remote sensing data sets coupled with in situ measurements and modeling are used to further constrain the spatial and temporal extent of the Greenland firn aquifer. NASA’s Operation IceBridge Accumulation Radar from 2011-2014 are used to map the extent over a majority of the suspected areas. Repeated flight lines are used for multi-temporal analysis which generally indicates stable water depths, however, some changes in extent are detected. We have also tested a variety of ground based radar frequencies for detection of the top and bottom interfaces of the aquifer. Mapping of the retention of liquid water in the firn from space is demonstrated using an active microwave satellite scatterometer (ASCAT). This data set provides near daily observations of the aquifer recharge and freeze process at and below the surface over an integrated penetration depth. One full year of bore hole temperature measurements reveal progression of the aquifer recharge and refreezing from the surface. This provides insight into the thermodynamics and for comparison with satellite data to constrain the ASCAT observable depth of liquid water.",

            "abstract": "Continents grow as crustal terranes of various ages and origins accreted together. Suture zones mark the boundaries of these terranes and provide a discrete marker to investigate the process of continental growth. Investigating continental structure, we can identify whether properties such as crustal thickness or seismic wavespeed changes across suture zones. Further comparison between the locations of sutures and the distribution of tectonic events provides insight into the degree that sutures serve to localize regions of tectonism. In this study we investigate the mid continent of North America, where crust of the Mazatzal and Granite Rhyolite terranes accreted together to make up the Proterozoic basement. Using seismic data from the EarthScope Transportable Array and OIINK FlexArray, we inspect receiver functions and Rayleigh wave phase velocities to investigate lithospheric structures. Through this analysis, we identify a zone where the crust thickens from an average near 40 km, to more than 50 km in an area that encompasses the Illinois-Missouri border and lies along the suture zone between these two Proterozoic terranes. However, the wavespeeds of the crust do not appear to vary between the terranes or in the zone of crustal thickening. The boundary between the Ozark Plateau and Illinois Basin is located within the area of thickened crust and may indicate a potential role played by the suture zone in the formation of these two epiorogenic features. The dense mafic intrusions that were added to the crust during extension of the failed Reelfoot Rift, and now exhibit high seismic wavespeeds, may have provided the additional load that allowed the Illinois Basin to exploit the already weakened suture zone and subside. Diffuse seismicity in the St. Genevieve Fault Zone, which is located to the north of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, lies near the western edge of the area of thickened crust and suggests that ancient suture zones influence modern deformation within continental interiors.",

            "abstract": "With changing socio-economic environments and population growth, it is estimated that agricultural production levels need to double by 2050. One way to achieve this may be through agricultural expansion into drier regions, which cover about 41% of earth’s land area. Currently, about 70% of freshwater withdrawals are used for irrigation, which in turn produces about 40% of global food. However, little is known about the global area under irrigated agriculture in these water-stressed, arid regions which host about 2 billion people. Here we estimate the global area under irrigation in the arid and hyperarid regions. To this end, we analyse the temporal signature of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that was derived from the ~500m BRDF-adjusted reflectance data provided by the MODIS sensor since February 2000. This method does not rely on any external data sources and it allows to explore the temporal evolution of irrigation practices. Additionally, compared to other irrigation maps, our dataset can be quickly updated annually to provide the latest estimations. Initial results show that by using a combination of simple metrics quantifying each pixel’s phenology we are able to clearly identify irrigated areas in these dry regions. Our results will be compared to existing global irrigation datasets as well as global land cover maps.",

Perchlorate has also been shown to be formed under current Mars conditions via the oxidation of mineral chlorides, further supporting the theory that perchlorate is present globally on Mars [3]. The discovery of perchlorate on Mars has raised important questions about the effects of perchlorate on the survival and detection of organic molecules.\nAlthough it has been shown that pyrolysis in the presence of perchlorate results in the alteration or destruction of organic molecules [4], few studies have been conducted on the potential effects of perchlorate on organic molecules under martian surface conditions. Although perchlorate is typically inert under Mars-typical temperatures [5], perchlorate does absorb high energy UV radiation, and has been shown to decompose to form reactive oxychlorine species such as chlorite (ClO2-) when exposed to martian conditions including UV or ionizing radiation [6,7]. Here we investigate the effects of perchlorate on the organic molecules tryptophan, benzoic acid and mellitic acid in order to determine how perchlorate may alter these compounds under Mars conditions. Experiments are performed in a Mars Simulation Chamber (MSC) capable of reproducing the temperature, pressure, atmospheric composition and UV flux found on Mars. Soil simulants are prepared consisting of SiO2 and each organic, as well as varying concentrations of perchlorate salts, and exposed in the MSC. Subsequent to exposure in the MSC samples are leached and the leachate analyzed by HPLC and LC-MS to determine the degree of degradation of the original organic and the identity of any potential decomposition products formed by oxidation or chlorination.\n",

We use the Empirical Orthogonal Function-Principal Component (EOF-PC) and Nonlinear Mode Decomposition (NMD) methods to analyze gridded monthly precipitation observation data in western US from 1971 to 2013.To differentiate trends, noises and physically-meaningful periodic patterns from the time series, we choose the wavelet-based NMD method. The results of our analysis show the leading EOFs and PC time series are capable of reconstructing the dynamic field of regional precipitation in high accuracy. The NMD method detects several amplitude-modulated periodic curves with complex waveforms. We found the first PC’s varying amplitude is correlated to Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (R=0.41), and the fourth PC's varying amplitude is correlated to Nino3.4 index (R=0.57). These results suggest that the complex spatiotemporal variability of precipitation can be quantified with the dominant spatial patterns, periodicities, trends, and noises. And the EOF-NMD method can be used as a data-mining tool to investigate physically-meaningful information and teleconnections from a dataset of a dynamic field. ",

            "abstract": "Predictions of mass transfer across fracture boundaries and fluid flow in fracture networks provide fundamental inputs into risk and life cycle assessments of geologic energy technologies including oil and gas extraction, geothermal energy systems and geologic CO2 storage. However, major knowledge gaps exist due to the lack of experimental observations of how reactive fluids alter the pore structures and accessible surface area within fracture boundaries that control the mass transfer of organics, metals and salts, and influence fluid flow within the fracture. To investigate the fracture and rock matrix properties governing fracture boundary alteration, we developed a new flow-through cell that enables time-dependent 2D x-ray imaging of mineral dissolution and/or precipitation at a fracture surface. The parallel plate design provides an idealized fracture geometry to investigate the relationship between flow rate, reaction rate, and mineral spatial heterogeneity and variation. In the flow-cell, a carbonate-rich sample of Eagle Ford shale was reacted with acidified brine. The extent and rate of mineral dissolution were correlated with calcite abundance relative to less soluble silicate minerals. Three-dimensional x-ray tomography of the reacted fracture wall shows how calcite dissolution left behind a porous network of silicate minerals. And while this silicate network essentially preserved the location of the initial fracture wall, the pore network structures within the fracture boundary were dramatically altered, such that the accessible surface area of matrix components increased significantly. In a second set of experiments with a limestone specimen, however, the extent of dissolution and retreat of the fracture wall was not strictly correlated with the occurrence of calcite. Instead, the pattern and extent of dissolution suggested secondary causes such as calcite morphology, the presence of argillaceous minerals and other diagenetic features. Our experiments show that while calcite dissolution is the primary geochemical driver of fracture wall alterations, hydrodynamic properties and matrix accessibility within fracture boundaries evolve based on a complex relationship between mineral spatial heterogeneity and variation, fluid chemistry and flow rate.

In the atmosphere, changes in relative humidity (RH) and temperature cause phase transitions in the atmospheric particulate. Efflorescence, the process of salt crystal nucleation from an aqueous electrolyte solution upon decreasing RH, often occurs at a lower RH than the reverse process of deliquescence. It has been shown that the efflorescence RH can occur at a higher RH in the presence of a heterogeneous surface immersed in a liquid particle. Here we present a new laboratory technique using optically levitated particles to study heterogeneous efflorescence initiated by contact with an external particle. In this work, collisions between aqueous microdroplets and heterogeneous nuclei are monitored in situ using scattered laser light to quantify the number of collisions and to detect phase transitions. We find that when contact initiates the phase transition, efflorescence occurs at a higher RH than when the same heterogeneous nucleus is immersed in the particle. The results of these experiments will be discussed in the context of understanding contact nucleation on a mechanistic level and predicting the relative importance of contact efflorescence in the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Surface ozone (O3) concentrations were measured in and around the Lake Tahoe Basin using both active monitors (12 sites in 2010) and passive samplers (31 sites 2002; 34 sites in 2010). The 2010 data from active monitors indicate average summertime diurnal maxima of approximately 50-55 ppb. Minimal site-to-site variability is observed within the Basin during the well-mixed hours of 10:00 to 17:00 PST, but large differences between different sites are observed in the late evening and pre-dawn hours. The observed trends correlate most strongly with elevation, topography, and surface vegetation. High elevation sites with steeply sloped topography and drier ground cover experience elevated O3 concentrations throughout the night because they maintain good access to downward mixing of ozone-rich air from aloft with minimal losses due to dry deposition. Low elevation sites with flat topography and wetter surface vegetation experience low O3 concentrations in the pre-dawn hours because of greatly reduced downward mixing coupled with enhanced O3 removal via efficient dry deposition. Very high average O3 concentrations (overall seasonal average = 64 ppb) were measured with passive samplers in the middle of the Lake in 2010. This latter finding may reflect high emissions of O3 precursors from vehicular traffic around the Lake, emissions from motorboats, and/or elevated rates of photochemical processes due to high solar radiation and stagnant air masses over the Lake. Tahoe Basin sites with good nocturnal exposure to ozone-rich air from aloft experience average O3 concentrations that are frequently higher than concurrent averages from the polluted upwind comparison sites of Sacramento, Folsom, and Placerville.",

The bow shock wave has been studied for more than four decades but existing models are still often inaccurate.\nPrevious studies established that bow shock shape and position are primarily controlled by solar wind pressure, upstream Mach numbers, interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld orientation and magnetopause shape and position.\nWe have collected a total of 28,287 bow shock crossings identiﬁed in observations from the Cluster 1-4, Geotail, IMP-8, Interball-1, MAGION-4, THEMIS A-E and WIND spacecraft and use this database to predict bow shock position as a function of solar wind parameters.\nThe database of bow shock crossings is fitted using a method similar to Peredo et al. [1995] which presumes a general 3D second-order bow shock shape parameterized by the upstream dynamic pressure and Alfven Mach number values. The use of a prescribed shock shape results in a model that provides accurate predictions for Alfven Mach numbers as low as 2 and can be used with confidence up to 40 Re along the magnetotail. For comparison, we apply the same method to create additional global 3D bow shock models parameterized by various parameters such as interplanetary magnetic field magnitude, solar wind proton density, bulk speed, etc. The best model is sought that would be most accurate for a wide range of upstream conditions.",

            "abstract": "Inspired by the current drought and concerns about maintaining water storage capacity, California State Senate this year passed SB1259, directing the Department of Water Resources to assess the state’s reservoirs for sedimentation problems. The need to actively manage sediment in reservoirs is increasingly recognized, as valuable reservoir storage capacity is lost and downstream reaches suffer from sediment starvation, manifesting problems such as channel incision, accelerated erosion of deltas, and loss of gravels important for habitat. With increased dam construction globally, these impacts will be widespread. Despite the opportunities to pass sediment through or around reservoirs (to preserve reservoir capacity and to minimize downstream impacts), these sustainable approaches to managing sediment are not applied in many situations where they would be effective. From a workshop involving international and Chinese experts and review of recent literature, collective global experience in managing reservoir sediments and mitigating downstream sediment starvation suggest that sediment management can be classified as catchment management (to reduce sediment inflow), sediment removal, and sediment routing through or around the reservoir. Sediment routing has the virtues of maintaining sediment flows to downstream reaches, as well as preserving reservoir capacity. Where geometry is favorable, sediment can often be bypassed around the reservoir (avoiding reservoir sedimentation and supplying sediment to downstream reaches) or sluiced through large-capacity outlets after flowing rapidly through the reservoir to avoid sedimentation. In narrow reservoirs with steep longitudinal gradients, sediments accumulated in the reservoir can often be re-suspended and flushed through when the reservoir is drawn down. Turbidity currents can often be ‘vented’ through the dam, with the advantage that the reservoir need not be drawn down to pass sediment. In planning dams, the expert group recommended that these sediment management approaches be utilized where possible to sustain reservoir capacity and minimize environmental impacts of dams.",

            "abstract": "There has been ample experimental evidence that soil erosion does not necessarily occur at the same rate, given the same amount of rainfall or runoff. Such a non-unique phenomenon has been often referred to in literature as due to ‘natural variability’. Our recent study hypothesized that uncertainties in the distribution and properties of a sediment layer can be a potential clue to one of the reasons of the non-unique sediment yield. Specifically, numerical experimentation with a sophisticated two-dimensional model showed that a deposited layer plays two conflicting roles: it can both increase and decrease soil erosion, given the same magnitude of runoff. The difference in erodibilities of the \"original, intact soil layer\" and the \"deposited, loose soil layer\" and the composition of soil particles in the underlying layers give rise to the non-uniqueness of the amount of eroded materials. In continuing efforts, we attempt to investigate this phenomenon using a comprehensive the Universal Soil Loss Erosion (USLE) database, that contains data on paired hillslopes that show a high degree of non-uniqueness in the response, even though the hillslopes exhibit the same topography, soil type, rainfall and meteorological forcings, and landuse. An underlying hypothesis of this study is that uncertainties in the distribution of soil substrate prior to a rainfall event lead to low predictability skill, i.e., a stochastically-varying outcome. A large number of simulation cases demonstrating the proposed hypothesis are conducted using a coupled numerical model, tRIBS-VEGGIE-FEaST (Triangulated irregular network - based Real time Integrated Basin Simulator- VEGetation Generator for Interactive Evolution -Flow Erosion and Sediment Transport).",

            "abstract": "Solar eruptions are driven by energy and helicity transported through the photosphere and into the corona. However, the mechanism by which energy and helicity emerge from the solar interior to form the observed coronal structures is poorly understood. SDO/HMI data are the first space-based full-disk vector field observations of the Sun with a near 100% duty cycle and, therefore, represent an unprecedented opportunity to quantify the energy end helicity fluxes through the photosphere. However, because of the SDO satellite’s highly inclined geostationary orbit, the relative velocity of the instrument varies by ±3~km/s which introduces major orbital artifacts. We have developed a procedure for mitigating these artifacts and have applied this analysis to AR11084 to produce a cleaned data set. Our analysis procedure is described, in detail, and the results for AR11084 presented. We have also recast the Berger and Field (1984) helicity transport equation in manifestly gauge invariant form and derived the terms quantifying the injection of helicity into the corona by the emergence of closed field, versus helicity injection by the stressing of pre-emerged flux. The plasma velocity fields in the photosphere, necessary for computing energy and helicity fluxes are determined using an upgraded version of DAVE4VM that incorporates the spherical geometry of the solar images. We find that the bulk of the helicity into the corona is injected by twisting motions, and we discuss the implications of our results for understanding solar activity and especially for data-driven modeling of solar eruptions.\nThis work was supported, in part, by NASA",

            "abstract": "Fractured shale formations that have been drained of hydrocarbons could serve as attractive sites for geologic sequestration of CO2. Shales preferentially sorb CO2 enabling greater storage potential than would be expected based only on the pores vacated during CH4 production. Sequestration in shales could have a variety of other benefits because the intrinsically low permeability of the rock could help mitigate leakage risks and infrastructure resources could be leveraged to minimize costs. Here a modeling framework developed by the authors to estimate the sequestration capacity of fractured shale formations based on CH4 production rates was applied to the Utica Shale. The model is based on a unipore transport model, which assumes that diffusion of gases into and out of the kerogen matrix will control gas transport. The results from the Utica formation were compared to estimates for sequestration in the Marcellus shale to understand how the petrophysical characteristics of these two formations impact estimated sequestration capacity. A detailed sensitivity analysis was carried out to link modeling assumptions and key parameters with known physicochemical characteristics of these two shale formations. Modeling parameters were derived from published production data obtained from the state of Ohio.\nThe model was found to be most sensitive to the equilibrium sorption parameters of CH4 and CO2, for which there is good literature data available. Published values for CO2 sorption varied considerably based on the composition of the shale. Improved experimental data is needed to provide the most accurate estimates of storage in different formations. Differences were observed in gas diffusivity estimates for the Marcellus and Utica shale that could be understood in terms of the petrophysical characteristics of the two formations. We also found important effects tied to the effective diffusion length out of an average pore in the kerogen. These results allow us to understand how this modeling framework, which captures the underlying physical transport processes, is computationally efficient and it can be run using readily available data sources, will compare to more complex models of sequestration in shales.",

            "abstract": "Riparian areas are dynamic, transitional ecotones between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems with well-defined vegetation and soil characteristics. Riparian areas offers wildlife habitat and stream water quality, offers bank stability and protects against erosions, provides aesthetics and recreational value, and other numerous valuable ecosystem functions. Quantifying and delineating riparian areas is an essential step in riparian monitoring, riparian management/planning and policy decisions, and in preserving its valuable ecological functions. Previous approaches to riparian areas mapping have primarily utilized fixed width buffers. However, these methodologies only take the watercourse into consideration and ignore critical geomorphology, associated vegetation and soil characteristics. Other approaches utilize remote sensing technologies such as aerial photos interpretation or satellite imagery riparian vegetation classification. Such techniques requires expert knowledge, high spatial resolution data, and expensive when mapping riparian areas on a landscape scale. The goal of this study is to develop a cost effective robust workflow to consistently map the geographic extent and composition of riparian areas within the Hiawatha National Forest boundary utilizing the Riparian Buffer Delineation Model (RBDM) v3.0 and open source geospatial data. This approach recognizes the dynamic and transitional natures of riparian areas by accounting for hydrologic, geomorphic and vegetation data as inputs into the delineation process and the results would suggests incorporating functional variable width riparian mapping within watershed management planning to improve protection and restoration of valuable riparian functionality and biodiversity.",

            "abstract": "Run-of-river (RoR) hydropower has emerged as an important alternative to large reservoir-based dams in the renewable energy portfolios of China, India, Canada, and other areas around the globe. RoR projects generate electricity by diverting a portion of the channel discharge through a large pipe for several kilometers downhill where it is used to drive turbines before being returned to the channel. Individual RoR projects are thought to be less disruptive to local ecosystems than large hydropower because they involve minimal water storage, more closely match the natural hydrograph downstream of the project, and are capable of bypassing trapped sediment. However, there is concern that temporary sediment supply disruption may degrade the productivity of salmon spawning habitat downstream of the dam by causing changes in the grain size distribution of bed surface sediment. We hypothesize that salmon populations will be most susceptible to disruptions in sediment supply in channels where; 1) sediment supply is high relative to transport capacity prior to RoR development, and 2) project design creates substantial sediment storage volume. Determining the geomorphic effect of RoR development on aquatic habitat requires many years of field data collection, and even then it can be difficult to link geomorphic change to RoR development alone. As an alternative, we used a one-dimensional morphodynamic model to test our hypothesis across a range of pre-development sediment supply conditions and sediment storage volumes. Our results confirm that coarsening of the median surface grain-size is greatest in cases where pre-development sediment supply was highest and sediment storage volumes were large enough to disrupt supply over the course of the annual hydrograph or longer. In cases where the pre-development sediment supply is low, coarsening of the median surface grain-size is less than 2 mm over a multiple-year disruption period. When sediment supply is restored, our results show that the time required for a channel to re-establish its pre-development median surface grain-size is inversely correlated to the pre-development sediment supply conditions. These results demonstrate that morphodynamic models can be a valuable tool in assessing the risk to aquatic habitat from RoR development.",

Previous research has suggested that shifts in land use and agricultural practices have modified the fire regime of Cote d’Ivoire over the past 30 years. Specifically, increasing pastoralism in north-central Cote d’Ivoire has been shown to coincide with a shift in fire seasonality toward fires earlier in the dry season. We investigated decadal trends in monthly fire occurrence across Cote d’Ivoire to determine whether similar processes of shifting fire seasonality are at play at the national scale. We assessed fire occurrence using remotely sensed Landsat imagery covering the entire extent of Cote d’Ivoire across a 30-year period from 1984 to 2014. The fine resolution of Landsat imagery makes possible the detection of small fires that commonly occur in heavily managed West African savannas. We investigated trends in the timing of both active fires and burned areas. Active fires were detected using shortwave infrared emissions of fire, and burned areas were identified based on spectral and temporal patterns distinctive to burn scars. The timing of fire occurrence influences fire intensity, and shifting fire seasonality has implications for land cover and terrestrial carbon budgets. Our findings point to temporal-spatial shifts in fire regimes over the past three decades and advance understanding of the contribution of West Africa’s savannas to global greenhouse gas emissions.",

Here we report on an airborne transient electromagnetic survey in Antarctica, which for the first time produced extensive imagery of subsurface resistivity in Taylor Valley, an ice-free margin of the Ross Sea. Wide zones of low subsurface resistivity were detected that are inconsistent with the typical high resistivity of glacier ice or dry permafrost. These results are interpreted as an indication that water, with sufficiently high solute content to remain unfrozen well below 0°C, temperatures considered within the range suitable for microbial life. The inferred subsurface brines are widespread and form two isolated groundwater systems: a near shore system, which extends from the ocean 18 km inland; and a sub-/proglacial system, which emanates from beneath Taylor Glacier into Lake Bonney and is associated with the discharge from Blood Falls. The brine networks in Taylor Valley challenge the notion that groundwater is negligible in regions of continuous permafrost, and signify the potential for a deep biosphere that is hydrologically and geochemically connected to the marine system and subglacial environments.",

            "abstract": "Providing proper citation and attribution for published data, derived data products, and the software tools used to generate them, has always been an important aspect of scientific research. However, It is often the case that this type of detailed citation and attribution is lacking. This is in part because it often requires manual markup since dynamic generation of this type of provenance information is not typically done by the tools used to access, manipulate, transform, and visualize data. In addition, the tools themselves lack the information needed to be properly cited themselves.\nThe OPeNDAP Hyrax Software Framework is a tool that provides access to and the ability to constrain, manipulate, and transform, different types of data from different data formats, into a common format, the DAP (Data Access Protocol), in order to derive new data products. A user, or another software client, specifies an HTTP URL in order to access a particular piece of data, and appropriately transform it to suit a specific purpose of use. The resulting data products, however, do not contain any information about what data was used to create it, or the software process used to generate it, let alone information that would allow the proper citing and attribution to down stream researchers and tool developers.\nWe will present our approach to provenance capture in Hyrax including a mechanism that can be used to report back to the hosting site any derived products, such as publications and reports, using the W3C PROV recommendation pingback service. We will demonstrate our utilization of Semantic Web and Web standards, the development of an information model that extends the PROV model for provenance capture, and the development of the pingback service. We will present our findings, as well as our practices for providing provenance information, visualization of the provenance information, and the development of pingback services, to better enable scientists and tool developers to be recognized and properly cited for their contributions.",

            "abstract": "In 2013, the ROV Doc Ricketts onboard R/V Western Flyer explored ~4 km of an elongate pillow ridge up to ~300 m high along the eastern edge of the north rift zone of Axial Seamount. The steep-sided volcanic ridge is constructed of large pillow lavas up to 2-3 m in diameter and smaller elongated pillow tubes. Of the 27 samples collected during dive D526, all but one are andesites making it one of the largest confirmed high-silica exposures along a mid-ocean ridge (MOR). Based on radiocarbon ages of sediment on top of flows, the mounds are at least ~1390 years old. This minimum age is much younger than the 56 Ka age calculated based on distance from the rift axis, indicating eruption off-axis through older, colder crust and supporting the hypothesis and model calculations that extensive fractional crystallization (>85%) caused the high silica content.\nThe andesitic lavas are primarily glassy, highly vesicular, crusty, and sparsely phyric with small (~1 mm) plagioclase crystals and olivine, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxide microphenocrysts. Microprobe analyses of glasses are similar to wax-core samples previously collected from this area but are more compositionally variable. Excluding one basalt (7.7 wt% MgO) sampled between mounds, the lavas are basaltic andesites and andesites (53-59 wt% SiO2) with <3 wt% MgO and 12.8-15.7 wt% FeO concentrations. Incompatible trace element abundances are ~4-6 times more enriched than in Axial Seamount T-MORB. Primitive mantle-normalized patterns are similar to those of high-silica lavas from other MORs (southern Juan de Fuca Ridge, 9N East Pacific Rise) with significant positive U anomalies, large negative Sr anomalies, small negative Eu anomalies, and slight positive Zr-Hf anomalies. The andesites are more enriched in light rare earth elements than basalts from Axial Seamount ((La/Yb)N 1.35-1.4 vs. 0.7-1.27) and N-MORB from the southern Juan de Fuca Ridge. The andesites also have high Cl (~0.3-0.6 wt%) and H2O (~1.60-1.71 wt%) contents; common features of other high-silica MOR suites and indicative that some assimilation of altered crust was involved in their petrogenesis.",

Numerous techniques have been developed to quantify the relationship between these fields in both the spatial and spectral domains, to constrain geophysical parameters of interest. Simons and Olhede (2013) describe a new technique based on maximum-likelihood estimation of lithospheric parameters including flexural rigidity, subsurface-surface loading ratio, and the correlation of these loads. We report on the first applications of this technique to planetary bodies including Venus, Mars, and the Earth. We compare results using the maximum-likelihood technique to previous studies using admittance and coherence-based techniques. \nWhile various methods of evaluating the relationship of gravity and topography fields have distinct advantages, we demonstrate the specific benefits of the Simons and Olhede technique, which yields unbiased, minimum variance estimates of parameters, together with their covariance. Given the unavoidable problems of incompletely sensed gravity fields, spectral artifacts of data interpolation, downward continuation, and spatial localization, we prescribe a recipe for application of this method to real-world data sets. In the specific case of Venus, we discuss the results of global mapped inversion of an isotropic Matérn covariance model of its topography. We interpret and identify, via statistical testing, regions that require abandoning the null-hypothesis of isotropic Gaussianity, an assumption of the maximum-likelihood technique.",

            "abstract": "Hot spots and hot moments are usually studied at small scales. These small patches or periods of abnormally high biogeochemical activity have been linked to the interface between the terrestrial and aquatic environments and to the benthic ecotone in streams. Here, we revisit the concepts of hot spots and moments in river networks. We specifically consider cases of carbon and nitrogen cycling and explore the interaction between spatial and temporal signals to identify “hot spoments” in the network. We present field data showing that biogeochemical and hydrological processes alternatively control dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes. Field experiments and numerical simulations show that both headwater streams and rivers can be efficient at removing nutrients and carbon from the flowing water, but typically under contrasting climatic forcing. We also present new analytical models leveraging graph theory that describe how different parts of the network are biogeochemically active at different times. Taken together, our results suggest that hot-moments depend on space and hot-spots on time, and vice versa. In other words, unusually high biogeochemical activity may be found in different places at different times along river networks. Our simulations suggest that hot “spoments” impact large scale (spatial and temporal) budgets of carbon and nitrogen export from watersheds.",

In a hyper-arid Southwestern US basin, where new energy projects are being developed, groundwater is the only available water for such cooling needs. The hydrologic impacts of groundwater withdrawal remain unclear, as recharge to the aquifer and exchange with the Colorado River are poorly quantified. The basin is also a data-scarce region, with few available groundwater parameter measurements for most of the basin. Characterized by a thick alluvium layer and deep aquifer, the basin also has a long response time to forcings. We employ both an integrated, physically-based surface-subsurface processes model (PAWS+CLM) and the MODFLOW+PEST package. The integrated model PAWS+CLM is used to estimate recharge while MODFLOW+PEST is used to estimate the groundwater conductivity fields. Calibration of the two models are iterated to obtain the best estimates of parameter values. We have identified the main area of recharge by forcing the model with both station-based measurements and NLDAS. The Colorado River is losing water in this reach. Using the combined, coupled model, we estimate the influence of cooling methods on the water table and its effect on the land-river exchange.",

During Year 1, an Assembly of seven stakeholder groups representing the broad EarthCube community developed a draft Governance Framework. Finalized at the June 2014 EarthCube All Hands Meeting, this framework will be tested during the demonstration phase in Year 2, beginning October 2014.\nA brief overview of the framework: Community-elected members of the EarthCube Leadership Council will be responsible for managing strategic direction and identifying the scope of EarthCube. Three Standing Committees will also be established to oversee the development of technology and architecture, to coordinate among new and existing data facilities, and to represent the academic geosciences community in driving development of EarthCube cyberinfrastructure. An Engagement Team and a Liaison Team will support communication and partnerships with internal and external stakeholders, and a central Office will serve a logistical support function to the governance as a whole. Finally, ad hoc Working Groups and Special Interest Groups will take on other issues related to EarthCube’s goals.\nThe Year 2 demonstration phase will test the effectiveness of the proposed framework and allow for elements to be changed to better meet community needs. It will begin by populating committees and teams, and finalizing leadership and decision-making processes to move forward on community-selected priorities including identifying science drivers, coordinating emerging technical elements, and coming to convergence on system architecture. A January mid-year review will assemble these groups to analyze the effectiveness of the framework and make adjustments as necessary. If successful, this framework will move EarthCube forward as a collaborative platform and potentially act as a model for future NSF investments in geoscience cyberinfrastructure.",

            "abstract": "Geoscientists know a lot about fracturing, for example, we clearly understand fracture mechanics, and there are multiple complex models for simulating fluid flow through fracture networks. However, there is currently no reliable way to accurately predict the location or characteristics of natural fractures in the subsurface. For that matter, it is unclear how important natural fractures really are for controlling fluid flow in the subsurface. In some settings, fractures are conduits for fluid flow (e.g., oil migration through open fractures), while in other settings, fractures may not significantly impact fluid flow (e.g., closed or mineralized fractures).\nHere, we present a study that improves our ability to predict subsurface natural fracture characteristics by determining how tectonic history, stratigraphy, present day depth, and large scale geologic structures control fracture formation in the Marcellus shale. We conducted detailed fracture and stratigraphic analysis on seven cores from the Marcellus shale and one from Pennsylvanian-Upper Devonian formations in the northern Appalachian Basin. Fracture filling minerals were sampled and analyzed in two ways: fluid inclusion geothermometry was conducted to determine vein formation conditions, and trace metals were mapped using Laser Ablation ICP-MS. We found that tectonic history controls fracture orientation, stratigraphy determines the length and intensity of fracturing, and large-scale geologic structures overprint regional fracture trends. Moreover, past predictive efforts in the Appalachian Plateau were proven to have incorrectly identified which fracture sets are present both at depth and near the surface.\nThese findings take us one step closer to developing a predictive model for subsurface fracture occurrence, with potentially large applications for assessing fracture related fluid flow in a variety of geologic settings.",

            "abstract": "Space-based measurements of high-spectral resolution infrared (IR) radiances of the earth began in Sept. 2002 with the NASA EOS-AQUA AIRS instrument. The CrIS instrument on NASA's Suomi-NPP platform supplements this record in the 1:30 polar orbit, starting in 2012, and may continue for 15 years under the NOAA/NASA JPSS Program. The first of three IASI hyperspectral sounders on EUMETSAT's METOP platforms (9:30 orbit) started operation in July 2007, followed by the 2nd IASI on METOP-2 in early 2013. Development of a follow-on instrument (IASI-NG) for post METOP-3 is well underway.\nThese instruments are sensitive to the atmospheric temperature and humidity profile, surface temperature and emissivity, and minor gases (CO2, O3, CO, CH4, N2O, CFCs, HNO3, etc.) They also have high sensitivity to clouds, especially long-wave cloud radiative forcing. The National Research Council has recommended the development of a hyperspectral IR radiance climate data set as a climate benchmark. We present here evidence that supports the use of the existing hyperspectral sounders for generation of these ESDRs and eventually CDRs. The large spatial and temporal overlap between these sensors has provided a rich data-set for inter-calibration studies that are used to characterize the accuracy of a combined ESDR radiance product.\nWe will discuss the stability of each instrument, and inter-calibration differences (with error estimates). In addition, we have developed robust, non-statistical approaches for converting the AIRS spectral radiances into equivalent CrIS radiances, a key step in development of a long-term consistent radiance record. Finally, several examples of robust decadal changes in the earth's atmosphere using AIRS will be discussed and compared to ERA and MERRA re-analysis products (temperature, water vapor, cloud forcing). Finally, we will review the challenges involved in creating an ESDR from 3 different instruments and institutions/countries.",

            "abstract": "Remarkably, drilling in Landsvirkjun Co.’s geothermal field in Krafla Caldera, Iceland has encountered rhyolite magma or hypersolidus rhyolite at 2.1–2.5 km depth in 3 wells distributed over 3.5 km2, including Iceland Deep Drilling Program’s IDDP-1 (Mortensen, 2012). Krafla’s most recent rifting and eruption (basalt) episode was 1975-1984; deformation since that time has been simple decay. Apparently rhyolite magma was either emplaced during that episode without itself erupting or quietly evolved in situ within 2-3 decades. Analysis of drill cuttings containing quenched melt from IDDP-1 yielded unprecedented petrologic data (Zierenberg et al, 2012). But interpreting active processes of heat and mass transfer requires knowing spatial variations in physical and chemical characteristics at the margin of the magma body, and that requires retrieving core - a not-inconceivable task. Core quenched in situ in melt up to 1150oC was recovered from Kilauea Iki lava lake, Hawaii by the Magma Energy Project >30 years ago. The site from which IDDP-1 was drilled, and perhaps IDDP-1 itself, may be available to attempt the first-ever coring of rhyolite magma, now proposed as the Krafla Magma Drilling Project (KMDP). KMDP would also include geophysical and geochemical experiments to measure the response of the magma/hydrothermal system to fluid injection and flow tests. Fundamental results will reveal the behavior of magma in the upper crust and coupling between magma and the hydrothermal system. Extreme, sustained thermal power output during flow tests of IDDP-1 suggests operation of a Kilauea-Iki-like freeze-fracture-flow boundary propagating into the magma and mining its latent heat of crystallization (Carrigan et al, EGU, 2014). Such an ultra-hot Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) might be developable beneath this and other magma-heated conventional hydrothermal systems. Additionally, intra-caldera intrusions like Krafla’s are believed to produce the unrest that is so troubling in populated calderas (e.g., Campi Flegrei, Italy). Experiments with the live system will aid in hazard assessment and eruption forecasting for this most difficult of volcano hazard problems. We will report on an International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) workshop held to assess feasibility and to develop a plan for KMDP.",

            "abstract": "Peatlands are known to release significant amounts of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. However, uncertainties still remain regarding the spatio-temporal distribution and triggering mechanisms of gas releasing events from peat soils. Furthermore, most research regarding peatland gas dynamics has historically been focused on high latitude peatlands, while recent works have suggested gas production rates from low-latitude peat soils may be higher than those from colder climates. Varying temporal and spatial scales have also shown marked differences in flux rates, thus questioning the appropriate scale for gas flux quantification. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a geophysical tool that has successfully been used in the past to non-invasively investigate the release of biogenic gasses from northern peat soils, and has only recently been used in the subtropical Florida Everglades. This study is based on an array of measurements at four field sites, spanning two different peat types (Loxahatchee and Everglades peats) of the Florida Everglades over a period of two years. At each site, gas contents within the soil are monitored using the GPR method, which is supported by direct gas flux measurements using flux chambers and time-lapse photography, and surface deformation is monitored using differential leveling. Resulting data highlight the variability of gas dynamics based on spatial, temporal, and soil compositional differences.",

            "abstract": "A review of modern-day island arcs, the locations of boninite eruptions, the conditions necessary for hot upper plate spreading, potential regions of shallow SSZ flux melting, and formation of high-temperature metamorphic soles along the subduction channels indicates that many future, recent and ancient large slab ophiolite obduction events can be related to triple junctions that link SSZ spreading centers with trenches. These subduction systems leading to large slab ophiolite obduction events typically face stable continental margins. Boninitic melt generation requires hydrous melting of refractory mantle peridotite under an extremely high-temperature and low-pressure condition. This condition is generally explained by the addition of slab-derived fluids into a hot young oceanic mantle asthenosphere and lithosphere, which previously likely experienced melt extraction. Metamorphic conditions associated with metamorphic soles formation likewise require a hot upper plate lithosphere that, based on sole protolith, geochronologic and thermochronologic data, rapidly heats and then refrigerates and decompresses MORB-OIB type subcreted lithosphere. Numerous examples of present-day and recent SSZ spreading centers that link with two trenches or a trench and transform are considered ideal sites for ophiolite and boninite generation. The SZZ fore-arc spreading centers that link to the trench lines and triple junctions at the front of the arc may also continue towards the arc and back arc, creating no distinction between fore-arc and back-arc spreading episodes or to the transform-linked spreading centers from fore-arc to back arc. These SSZ spreading centers, which may be transiently produced during arc evolution over short or protracted time periods, act to open gaps in the arc massif and lengthen the trench, fore-arc and the arc crustal massif. They lead to an evolving arc magmatic front that begins in the infant fore-arc where ophiolite generation occurs at, near or in the trench, followed then by migration to sites distal from the trench line where a new arc massif is established on newly created oceanic lithosphere. Modern and ancient analogues of these setting are reviewed.",

            "abstract": "Cometary and asteroidal impacts at Mercury and the Moon likely supply some fraction of these bodies' near-surface reservoirs of water ice. At Mercury, MESSENGER spacecraft observations of permanently shadowed regions revealed bright and dark deposits, interpreted as comet- or asteroid-derived water and organics [1]. At the Moon, excavation of a permanently shadowed crater by the LCROSS mission confirmed the presence of substantial (~5 wt%) near-surface water [2]. Geophysical models of water delivery set limits on the relative roles of larger episodic events and ongoing micrometeorite impacts, assisting in both the interpretation of available data and the refinement of future geophysical strategies to characterize near-surface volatiles.\nDetermining to what extent comets and asteroids have contributed to the near-surface water detected at each body depends upon both the impact flux and the efficiency of impact delivery. Here we present new insights on delivery efficiency from simulations of impacts using the CTH shock physics code. Integrating these results with current estimates for the impact fluxes at the Moon and Mercury provides a more complete understanding of exogenous water sources. While prior analytical and numerical work has treated aspects of this problem, the effects of parameters such as impact angle and porosity have not yet been characterized in detail. We find that, while the inclusion of target porosity increases water retention, impactor porosity reduces delivery efficiency.\nFully 3-D simulations document decreased delivery efficiency with increasing impact angle obliquity. In addition, post-impact evolution of projectile material differs fundamentally between icy, cometary impactors and silicate, asteroidal impactors. Our calculations implement a variety of material types, probing the dependence of impact delivery on the projectile’s equation of state. The combined effects of impact angle, velocity, material models, and impactor flux demonstrate key differences in volatile delivery mechanisms at Mercury and the Moon.\n[1] Neumann et al., 2013.

            "abstract": "Cloud contamination is one of the larger sources of uncertainty in passive aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrievals, due to inherent limitations in separating cloud from aerosol using passive observations. This paper describes efforts to quantify the fraction of aerosol direct radiative forcing attributable to optically-thin cirrus cloud contamination. The study will focus on the MODIS C6 (Collection 6) AOT retrievals using collocated MODIS-CALIOP observations. CALIOP provides the ability to detect optically-thin cirrus and quantify corresponding cloud optical thickness. Using the combined observations we compute the TOA radiative flux for both the total AOT measured by MODIS and the cirrus corrected AOT derived, by subtracting the CALIOP cirrus optical thickness from the cloud contaminated MODIS FOV. We find that based on CALIOP FOV, the MODIS (C5) AOT retrieval filtered using both the MODIS QA (Quality Assurance) and zero AACF (Aerosol Algorithm Cloud Fraction), has cloud contamination of 22.08% over land and 18.01% for ocean cases. The average filtered AOT and contaminated COT are 0.160 (0.161) and 0.056 (0.026) over land (ocean). The cloud contamination increases if only the MODIS QA is used. We will update the data with MODIS C6 AOT. We also find that the amount of cloud contamination has a strong regional dependence. South East Asia, Central Africa, Amazon Basin and North Pacific Ocean are the most cloud-contaminated regions for MODIS aerosol retrieval. The analysis will be presented for four years of observations (2010- 2013).",

            "abstract": "Teaching natural science in a technologically advancing world requires that our methods reach beyond the traditional computer interface. Innovative 3D visualization techniques and real-time augmented user interfaces enable students to create realistic environments to understand the world around them. Here, we present a series of laboratory activities that utilize an Augmented Reality Sandbox to teach basic concepts of hydrology, geology, and geography to undergraduates at Harvard University and the University of Redlands.\nThe Augmented Reality (AR) Sandbox utilizes a real sandbox that is overlain by a digital projection of topography and a color elevation map. A Microsoft Kinect 3D camera feeds altimetry data into a software program that maps this information onto the sand surface using a digital projector. Students can then manipulate the sand and observe as the Sandbox augments their manipulations with projections of contour lines, an elevation color map, and a simulation of water. The idea for the AR Sandbox was conceived at MIT by the Tangible Media Group in 2002 and the simulation software used here was written and developed by Dr. Oliver Kreylos of the University of California – Davis as part of the NSF funded LakeViz3D project. Between 2013 and 2014, we installed AR Sandboxes at Harvard and the University of Redlands, respectively, and developed laboratory exercises to teach flooding hazard, erosion and watershed development in undergraduate earth and environmental science courses.\nIn 2013, we introduced a series of AR Sandbox laboratories in Introductory Geology, Hydrology, and Natural Disasters courses. We found laboratories that utilized the AR Sandbox at both universities allowed students to become quickly immersed in the learning process, enabling a more intuitive understanding of the processes that govern the natural world. The physical interface of the AR Sandbox reduces barriers to learning, can be used to rapidly illustrate basic concepts of geology, geography and hydrology, and enabled our undergraduate students to understand topography intuitively. We therefore find the AR Sandbox to be a novel teaching tool and an effective demonstration of the capabilities of 3D visualization and real-time augmented user interfaces that enable students to better understand environmental processes.",

            "abstract": "In late 2007, the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard the A-train changed its nadir-viewing angle. The original viewing angle of 0.3° (changed to 3° in 2007) allowed the polarization capabilities of the Lidar to determine the orientation of ice crystals. This is because viewing ice clouds at a nadir angle closer to 0° will yield specular reflection due to horizontally oriented ice. Similarly to how a vertical mirror will reflect a laser that is pointed vertically, oriented ice crystals return a strong integrated attenuated backscatter while also returning low depolarization values. This results in a distinguished depolarization and attenuated backscatter signature for horizontally oriented ice crystals as opposed to ice crystals that have no pattern in orientation (i.e. randomly oriented ice). In a preliminary search, it is found that up to 20% of warm (250 – 270 K) mid-latitude middle level clouds contain horizontally oriented ice. By taking advantage of the nearly synchronous orbits of the A-train constellation, an opportune dataset from 2006 and 2007 is compiled. This dataset includes collocated products from the CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR), CALIOP, and the Aqua Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The Lidar capabilities of CALIOP in conjunction with the microwave sensitivity to precipitation provided by the CloudSat CPR give a unique point of view to explore the connection between these two physical phenomena. Similarly, the spatial imaging from MODIS yields insights into the phase of cloud layer tops and particles’ effective radii. MODIS aerosol optical depths may also shed light upon the cloud ice nucleation mechanisms that also may play a large role in the precipitation process. Preliminary results suggest that not all marine regions have the same occurrences of HOIC; the Northern Hemisphere demonstrates a strong seasonal dependence with a maximum in the winter months while the Southern Hemisphere is mostly seasonally independent. Using collocated CloudSat retrievals of precipitation we find a strong correlation between the occurrences of HOIC and precipitation which will be explored in the presentation.",

Such gases include nitric acid, ammonia, organic acids, sulfur dioxide, and highly soluble organic compounds such as methanol and acetone. The deposition of highly soluble gases is controlled by turbulent and diffusive transport on the air side of the air/sea interface. In this study, air/sea fluxes of the soluble gas sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), sensible and latent heat, and momentum were measured using eddy covariance. This was a pilot study carried out in April 2014 on Scripps pier in La Jolla, California, that was designed to assess the potential for measuring SO2 fluxes over the ocean. SO2 was detected using chemical ion mass spectrometry in negative ion mode with a sensitivity of roughly 100 Hz/ppt. The ionization scheme involved addition of ozone to a dried air stream and subsequent conversion of SO2 to the SO5 - ion. The results demonstrate the feasibility of seagoing SO2 flux measurements. Such measurements can be used to constrain the depositional velocities of soluble gases and test models for air-side resistance to air/sea gas transfer.",

            "abstract": "The importance of floodplains as links between watersheds and rivers highlights the need to understand water and carbon fluxes within floodplain profiles, from their surface soil, through the vadose zone and underlying groundwater. Here, we present results of field and laboratory measurements conducted to quantify fluxes at a remediated uranium/vanadium mill tailings site on a floodplain at Rifle, Colorado. This semi-arid site has a vegetated, locally derived fill soil that replaced the original milling-contaminated soil to a depth of about 1.5 m. The fill soil overlies about 4.5 m of native sandy and cobbly alluvium containing the shallow aquifer. The aquifer generally drains into the Colorado River and is underlain by low permeability Wasatch Formation shale. Within this system, key issues being investigated include water and carbon fluxes between the vadose zone and aquifer, and CO2 fluxes through the vadose zone soil out to the atmosphere. Magnitudes of these fluxes are typically low, thus challenging to measure, yet increasingly important to quantify given the expansion of arid and semi-arid regions under changing climate.\nThe results of field investigations demonstrated that the annual water table rise and fall are driven by snowmelt runoff into the Colorado River in late spring to early summer. Tensiometer data indicate that net recharge from the deeper part of the vadose zone into groundwater occurs later in summer, after water table decline. The effectiveness of summer evapotranspiration in limiting groundwater recharge is reflected in water potentials decreasing to as low as -3 MPa within the upper 1.5 m of the vadose zone. Examination of the historical precipitation record further indicates that net recharge only occurs in years with above-average precipitation during winter and spring. These short intervals of net recharge also facilitate C transport into groundwater because of higher organic C concentrations in the vadose zone. Fluxes of CO2 measured at the soil surface are consistent with estimates based on season- and temperature-dependent diffusion and respiration within the vadose zone. Thus, fairly predictable seasonal variations in water table elevation, evapotranspiration, and temperature can help constrain estimates of water and carbon fluxes.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of surface morphology on Titan, Triton, and other worlds is strongly influenced by the interplay of various fluid dynamical processes. Specifically, overturning instabilities can easily arise due to the special circumstances of landform evolution that probably occurred on these worlds. On Titan, large impacts that formed basins like Menrva crater (and possibly Hotei Regio) would have generated impact-melt ice lakes unstably arranged over less dense ice. Cantaloupe terrains, for example as seen on Triton, may be the result of condensation of volatiles (methane, nitrogen) leading to unstably stratified layers of different compositions and densities. In each of these cases, Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities leading to large scale diapirism may be at play. In addition to the dynamics of these instabilities, other physical effects (e.g. heat diffusion, freezing/melting, porosity, temperature dependent viscosity) likely play an important role in the evolution of these features.\nIn this ongoing study, we examine the properties of unstably stratified fluids in which the lower less-dense ice has a temperature dependent viscosity. Surprisingly, we find that there exists an optimal disturbance length scale corresponding to the fastest growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. For unstably stratified layers of water (low viscosity heavy liquid lying above an ice whose viscosity increases with depth) the fastest growing mode corresponds to 40-60 km scales with overturn times of approximately 100 days. We present a detailed numerical stability analysis in a corresponding Boussinessq model (in the creeping flow limit) incorporating thermal conduction and latent heat release and we examine the stability properties surveying a variety of parameters. We have also developed a two-dimensional numerical code (a hybrid spectral/compact-differencing scheme) to model the evolution of such systems for which we shall present preliminary numerical results depicting the outcome of some controlled initial configurations.",

            "abstract": "Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are recognized as a major contributor of both methane and ammonia to the atmosphere. Ammonia is released by volatilization of urea and nitrogen containing wastes from the feedlot surface and waste management systems, while methane is produced from enteric fermentation and primarily exhaled into the atmosphere. Our objective was to survey plumes downwind of open lot feedyards near Greeley, Colorado and surrounding areas, to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of agricultural emissions in this area. Research was conducted during the month-long NASA DISCOVER-AQ campaign in July-August 2014, with over 4000 km of on-road measurements. Methane and ammonia concentrations were measured using open-path laser spectroscopy, along with water vapor, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide on a roof-mounted, mobile platform. The open-path design enables high resolution measurements of ammonia with minimized sampling issues. Concurrent measurements during the campaign by other groups on stationary and aircraft platforms help characterize the meteorological conditions and atmospheric chemistry. We present measurements from 65 of the 67 registered CAFOs in Weld County, which contain up to 660,000 cattle-equivalent animals units. The ammonia to methane enhancement ratio, ΔNH3:ΔCH4, was positively skewed with a median of 0.14 ± 0.04 ppmv/ppmv, consistent with our previous measurements during DISCOVER-AQ California. Due to the much greater variability of ammonia compared to methane, the emissions ratio is used to provide an estimate of feedyard ammonia emissions, with results divided for cattle, dairy, and sheep. Using the most recent emissions estimates of methane, we calculated a total of ≈28.8 TgNH3/yr released globally from feedlots alone, nearly as large as the IPCC’s estimate of 30.4 Tg/yr from all agriculture sources. This discrepancy suggests feedyard ammonia is underrepresented in current inventories and models, and its environmental effects on air quality and nitrogen deposition are not fully accounted for.",

To better elucidate these relationships, analyses were conducted on sediments collected during Integrated Ocean Drilling Project (IODP) Expedition 344. A primary goal of the CRISP (Costa Rica Seismogenesis Project) expedition is to explore diagenetic processes, e.g. fluid flow; relating to the complex sedimentary and tectonic environments along the Costa Rica margin.\nSamples collected from sites U1381C, U1413B, and U1414A record non-steady state conditions in both the solid phase and the pore water profiles, although it is most pronounced in the latter. The penetration depth of pore water sulfate at these sites varies strongly with depth between 100, 15 and several hundreds of meters, respectively. The corresponding hydrogen sulfide concentrations are >400 µM at Holes U1381C, and U1413B while they are <4 µM at Hole U1414A. The measured concentrations of iron sulfides in the sediments indicate that pyrite is the main sulfur-bearing mineral, with concentrations of 2-3 wt. % at sites U1413B and U1414A.\nRecorded in the sulfur isotope signal is the likely origin of the heterogeneity between sites. At Site U1414, the 34S isotopically enriched sulfate (δ34S>+60 ‰) is reflected in the δ34S profile of the in situ iron sulfides. We interpret these data as being indicative of fluid flow, potentially along fracture zones, seeps and/or pockmark features seen elsewhere in this region.",

            "abstract": "Mafic and ultramafic enclaves from the 2008 eruption of Kasatochi volcano, central Aleutians, provide insight into the sub-arc structure in this section of the subduction zone. Textural, mineralogical, and chemical similarities between these enclaves and those from neighboring Adak Island volcanoes suggest that sub-arc conditions are similar enough to form the same igneous \"strata\" in this part of the arc.\nKasatochi gabbroic enclaves are undeformed cumulates of 0.1–11 cm euhedral plagioclase and pargasitic hornblende crystals, with minor clinopyroxene and magnetite and cryptocrystalline interstitial glass. Adak gabbro inclusions also contain plagioclase, pargasitic hornblende, clinopyroxene, and magnetite. Gabbroic enclaves from both volcanic islands typically have elongate and aligned minerals, in contrast with the granular textures of the ultramafic suite. Kasatochi ultramafic samples include wehrlite, clinopyroxenite, and olivine clinopyroxenite with Fo83–84 olivine, Mg- and Ca- rich clinopyroxene, and spinel, and pargasitic hornblende present only as a secondary, interstitial phase. Similarly, wehrlite and clinopyroxenite samples from Adak also contain forsteritic olivine, clinopyroxene, spinel, and interstitial pargasitic hornblende. The presence of hornblende and the lack of deformation textures in the cumulate gabbros from both islands suggest that these rocks were stored under similar pressure, temperature, and host-magma conditions prior to eruption.\nKasatochi gabbro enclaves are compositionally related to their host basaltic andesite, as suggested by fractionation trends. There is no apparent chemical relationship between the ultramafic enclaves and the 2008 basaltic andesite, nor are these samples ever found within their host rock. Based on compositional similarities to ultramafic xenoliths from Adak Island, the Kasatochi ultramafic suite could have formed by the fractionation of spinel-lherzolite in the upper mantle. Whole-rock REE analyses show moderate depletions in Nb and Ta, slight depletions Th, Sr, and Sm, and slight enrichments in Ba, Pb, and Pr.\nAlthough more work is needed to further clarify their relations, similarities between Kasatochi and Adak volcanic enclaves suggest that new crust is forming under similar conditions below both islands.",

            "abstract": "A regional high-Arctic cloud event observed in March, 2011 at the PEARL Observatory, near the Eureka Weather Station (80°N, 86°W), was investigated with a view to better understanding cloud formation mechanisms during the Polar night. We analysed the temporal cloud evolution with a suite of nighttime, ground-based remote sensing (RS) instruments, supplemented by radiosonde profiles and surface weather measurements. The RS suite included Raman lidar, cloud radar, a star-photometer and microwave-radiometers. In order to estimate the spatial extent and vertical variability of the cloud mass, we employed satellite-based lidar (CALIPSO) and radar (CloudSat) profiles in the regional neighbourhood of Eureka (at a latitude of 80°N, Eureka benefits from a high frequency of CALIPSO and CloudSat overpasses). The ground-based and satellite-based observations provide quantitative measurements of extensive (bulk) properties (cloud and aerosol optical depths), and intensive (per particle properties) such as aerosol and cloud particle size as well as shape, density and aggregation phase of the cloud particulates. All observations were then compared with the upper atmosphere NCEP/NCAR reanalyses in order to understand better the synoptic context of the cloud mass dynamics as a function of key meteorological parameters such as upper air temperature and water vapor circulation. Preliminary results indicated the presence of a particular type of thin ice cloud (TIC-2) associated with a deep and stable atmospheric low. A classification into small and large ice crystal size (< 40 µm and > 40 µm, respectively), identifies the clouds as TIC-1 or TIC-2. This classification is hypothesized to be associated with the nature of the aerosols (non-anthropogenic versus anthropogenic) serving as ice nuclei in their formation. Such a distinction has important implications on the initiation of precipitation, removal rate of the cloud particles and, in consequence, the radiative forcing properties on a regional basis.",

            "abstract": "Old-growth tropical forests are responsible for a potentially large portion of the terrestrial carbon sink, although the underlying control mechanisms of that sink, has large uncertainties. The quantification of the tropical forest carbon sink is a grand challenge of measurement scale. Therefore, there is a strong emphasis on incorporating improved vegetation structure and compositional representativeness in land-surface modeling. Vegetation demography, plant competition, mechanistic mortality, disturbance cycling, and plant functional traits strongly control carbon dynamics and energy budgets of the Earth’s surface. Size and age structured scaling processes have not been represented in the widely used Community Land Model (CLM) until the recent inclusion of the Ecosystem Demography (ED) model into CLM 4.5, i.e., CLM-ED. The goal of this study was to compare how CLM-ED captured tropical carbon cycling dynamics compared to CLM and 16 years of field measurements from a central Amazonian forest. We evaluated critical carbon flux processes (Mg C ha-1 yr-1) such as net ecosystem exchange (NEE), net primary production (NPP), and autotrophic respiration (AR), and additional representations of growth and maintenance in CLM and CLM-ED. For a central Amazonian forest CLM estimated GPP from 2000-2012, with transient CO2 concentrations, to be 31.5 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 and was similar to field measurements, while initial evaluation of the newly developed CLM-ED estimated GPP to be substantially higher. The introduction of the size and age structure of ED to the CLM framework enables a finer granularity of state information in the canopy and new ways to represent canopy physics. Therefore alternative physics processes were compared, including those that are highly resolved at the cohort scale (i.e. plant groups) to those at the highly parameterized community scale (i.e. the plant canopy as a whole). CLM serves as the land-model component for nearly 40% of the Earth System Models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The incorporation of vegetation size and age structure into CLM-ED aims to improve the representation of ecosystem processes that govern structure, flux of carbon, and potential biomass accumulation.",

            "abstract": "Urban land area and the proportion of humanity living in cities is growing, leading to increased urban air pollution, temperature, and stormwater runoff. These changes can exacerbate respiratory and heat-related illnesses and affect ecosystem functioning. Urban trees can help mitigate these threats by removing air pollutants, mitigating urban heat island effects, and infiltrating and filtering stormwater. The urban environment is highly heterogeneous, and there is no tool to determine optimal locations to plant or protect trees. Using spatially explicit land cover, weather, and demographic data within biophysical ecosystem service models, this research expands upon the iTree urban forest tools to produce a new decision support tool (iTree-DST) that will explore the development and impacts of optimal tree planting. It will also heighten awareness of environmental justice by incorporating the Atkinson Index to quantify disparities in health risks and ecosystem services across vulnerable and susceptible populations.\nThe study area is Baltimore City, a location whose urban forest and environmental justice concerns have been studied extensively. The iTree-DST is run at the US Census block group level and utilizes a local gradient approach to calculate the change in ecosystem services with changing tree cover across the study area. Empirical fits provide ecosystem service gradients for possible tree cover scenarios, greatly increasing the speed and efficiency of the optimization procedure. Initial results include an evaluation of the performance of the gradient method, optimal planting schemes for individual ecosystem services, and an analysis of tradeoffs and synergies between competing objectives.",

            "abstract": "Since 1998 the IRIS Undergraduate Internship Program has provided research experiences for up to 15 students each summer. Through this 9 to 11 week internship program, students take part in an intensive week-long preparatory course, and work with leaders in seismological research, in both lab-base and field-based settings, to produce research products worthy of presentation and recognition at large professional conferences. The IRIS internship program employs a distributed REU model that has been demonstrated to bond students into a cohort, and maintain group cohesion despite students conducting their research at geographically distributed sites. Over the past 16 years the program has encountered numerous anticipated and unanticipated challenges. The primary challenges have involved exploring how to modify the REU-system to produce outcomes that are better aligned with our programmatic goals. For example, some questions we have attempted to address include: How can the success of an REU site be measured? How do you find, interest, and recruit under-represented minorities into a geophysics program? Can the program increase the probability of interns receiving some minimal level of mentoring across the program?\n While it is likely that no single answer to these questions exists, we have developed and piloted a number of strategies. These approaches have been developed through a process of identifying relevant research results from other REUs and combing this information with data from our own programmatic evaluations. This data informs the development of specific changes within our program which are then measured as a feedback. We will present our current strategies to address each questions along with measures of their effectiveness.\n In addition to broad scale systematic issues, we have also placed significant effort into responding to smaller, process challenges that all REU sites face. These range from simple logistical issues (e.g. liability), to educational issues (e.g. what “assignments” are meaningful but not so overwhelming as to take away from research time), to longer term issues such as building an effective alumni network, tracking participants, and maintaining funding. While each REU is unique, we will share our approaches to dealing with these issues, as such topics may be of use to other REUs.",

These sequences include pillow lava, sheet flow, hyaloclastite, hyaloclastic breccia, and interbeds of chert and pelagic limestone with Late Cretaceous micro fauna. The Khoy, north Fariman, and Sabzevar massifs also include Late Cretaceous-Early Paleocene supra-ophiolitic volcanic and volcano-sedimentary rocks that formed in a trough near the extrusive sequence. The Khoy pillow lava displays T-MORB characteristics but no chemical contribution from the components released from the subducted slab. On the other hand, the diabase dikes that cut the Khoy extrusive sequence show signatures of subduction zone magmatism and contribution from the melt released through the partial melting of the subducted slab. While lava in the Harsin (Kermanshah) extrusive sequence in west Iran displays E-MORB and P-MORB characteristics, the pillows in the Fannuj, north Fariman, Dehshir, and Sabzevar extrusive sequences indicate the contribution of both fluids and melt from the subducted slab. The Nosratabad and south Fariman ophiolites also show evidence for either melt or fluids, respectively. Partial melting of the subducted slab sedimentary cover may have formed the acidic pillow lava and sheet flow in the Fannuj and Nosratabad extrusive sequence, respectively. Some pillows in the Nosratabad, Sabzevar, north Fariman, and to a lesser extent, Dehshir extrusive sequence display the OIB geochemical characteristics. Mantle plumes or asthenospheric flow that probably moved up through weak zones of the subducted slab may have affected the partial melting of the mantle wedge above the slab. The combined OIB and supra-subduction characteristics suggest the role of the roll-back of the subducted slab in the magmatism of the northeast Iranian ophiolites. The clear MORB-like geochemical characteristics in the extrusive sequence of the ophiolites in northwest and west Iran, and supra-subduction zone characteristics in the extrusive sequence of the ophiolites in southeast and east Iran, west of the Lut Block, and northeast Iran may represent a major Late Cretaceous transition from the MORB to a supra-subduction zone setting.",

            "abstract": "The vertical structure of marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds plays an important role in satellite retrievals of cloud microphysical properties such as droplet size (re) , liquid water path (LWP), and droplet number concentration (CDNC). Passive optical retrievals of LWP such as those performed by MODIS rely on cloud vertical structure assumptions to relate cloud optical thickness (τ) and re retrievals to a corresponding LWP. Typically these passive remote sensing techniques assume that clouds are vertically homogenous [Platnick et al., 2003]. However, it has been suggested that an adiabatic cloud model could potentially introduce more realistic assumptions for some MBL cloud regimes [Wood and Hartmann, 2005; Bennartz, 2007]. In reality, cloud vertical structure is often more complicated than either of these assumptions because structure can be altered by both precipitation and mixing processes. This work examines the impact of varied and realistic cloud vertical structures on retrievals requiring fixed homogeneous or adiabatic structure assumptions. To address this we use the DHARMA cloud large-eddy simulation (LES) model [Ackerman et al. 2004] and a MODIS-like satellite retrieval simulator [Zhang et al. 2012]. The LES and retrieval simulator allow for the direct comparison of retrievals to the in-situ microphysical structure of the LES cloud field. Physical properties from the LES cloud field such as the degree of adiabaticity and droplet growth lapse rate are examined and linked to the impact of retrieval biases. The retrieval comparison led to the development of a predictive theoretical framework for determining which of the LES pixels satisfied either homogeneous or adiabatic vertical structure assumptions. The theoretical model was also utilized to extend a single-layer adiabatic cloud model to an arbitrary two-layer model capable of characterizing the impact of entrainment features on cloud retrievals performed on the LES. Our results overwhelmingly demonstrate that the impact of realistic cloud vertical structure on retrievals is more complicated than either of the vertical structure assumptions currently being implemented by the remote sensing community.",

            "abstract": "Detection of in situ biosignatures on terrestrial and planetary missions is becoming increasingly more important. Missions that target the Earth’s deep biosphere, Mars, moons of Jupiter (including Europa), moons of Saturn (Titan and Enceladus), and small bodies such as asteroids or comets require methods that enable detection of materials for both in-situ analysis that preserve context and as a means to select high priority sample for return to Earth.\nIn situ instrumentation for biosignature detection spans a wide range of analytical and spectroscopic methods that capitalize on amino acid distribution, chirality, lipid composition, isotopic fractionation, or textures that persist in the environment. Many of the existing analytical instruments are bulk analysis methods and while highly sensitive, these require sample acquisition and sample processing. However, by combining with triaging spectroscopic methods, biosignatures can be targeted on a surface and preserve spatial context (including mineralogy, textures, and organic distribution). To provide spatially correlated chemical analysis at multiple spatial scales (meters to microns) we have employed a dual spectroscopic approach that capitalizes on high sensitivity deep UV native fluorescence detection and high specificity deep UV Raman analysis.. Recently selected as a payload on the Mars 2020 mission, SHERLOC incorporates these optical methods for potential biosignatures detection on Mars. We present data from both Earth analogs that operate as our only examples known biosignatures and meteorite samples that provide an example of abiotic organic formation, and demonstrate how provenance effects the spatial distribution and composition of organics.",

            "abstract": "Management of water resources has increasingly become aware of the importance of considering groundwater and surface water as an interconnected, single resource. Surface water is commonly hydraulically connected to groundwater, but the interactions are difficult to observe and measure. Such a conjunctive approach has often been left out of water-management considerations because of a lack of understanding of the processes occurring. The goal of this research is to increase the better understanding of the interaction between the surface water and groundwater using the study case of the Treasure Valley Aquifer and the Boise River in Idaho, framed on water sustainability. Water-budgets for the Treasure Valley for the calendar years 1996 and 2000 suggest that the Boise River lost to the shallow aquifer almost 20 Hm3 and 95 Hm3, respectively, along the Lucky Peak to Capitol Bridge reach. Groundwater discharge occurred into the Boise River, along the Capitol Bridge to Parma reach, at about 645 Hm3 and 653 Hm3for the calendar years 1996 and 2000, respectively (USBR). These figures highlight the importance of better understanding of the water flow because of disparity, which would impact groundwater management practices. There is a need of better understanding of the groundwater-surface water interface for predicting responses to natural and human-induced stresses. A groundwater flow model was developed to compute the rates and directions of groundwater movement through aquifer and confining units in the subsurface. The model also provides a representation of the interaction that occurs between the Boise River and the shallow aquifer in the Treasure Valley. Work in progress on the general flow pattern allows assessing of the connectivity between shallow aquifer and river for helping understanding the impacts of groundwater extraction. Quantifying the interaction between the two freshwater sources would be beneficial in proper water management decisions in order to optimize water resource. Future research will include analysis of different land use scenarios to assess the impact of water use on aquifer's water quantity, availability and sustainability. Assessing those impacts will help answer important questions about the aquifer sustainability during times of climate warming and variability.",

            "abstract": "Surface waters are used for recreation, food supply, habitat, drinking water supply, and a variety of other ecological services that can be interrupted by water contamination. The stochastic nature of environmental systems makes the evaluation of reliability of these services necessary; however this is a major challenge due to system complexity and tool availability. We address this issue through adoption of fault-tree risk diagrams that have been used in Civil Engineering to conceptualize, analyze, and visualize complex and interconnected system behavior. A fault tree risk diagram is able to represent the connective geometry of the system, and to identify its possible failure modes. Environmental systems, like their engineered counterparts, are complex, interconnected, and have multiple system failure modes which include unsafe levels of contaminants in surface water. We have developed a Monte-Carlo procedure to obtain a fault tree risk diagram of the stream river network, and to perform system reliability evaluation. This study aims to allow for a more holistic watershed management by incorporating risk concepts with the geometric connectivity of a stream network. It aims to answer questions like “what are the areas in a watershed that increase the likelihood of overall water contamination?”, “what is the spatial and temporal distribution of probability of exceeding contaminant standards in the entire watershed?”, “which combination of individual sources will increase this probability?”, and “which areas of the watershed would be most sensitive to implementation of management measures”.",

The number of feedback loops involved in aerosol processes lead to nonlinear behavior at the systems level, making confident modeling and prediction difficult. It is therefore important to ground-truth and supplement modeling efforts with rigorous empirical measurements. To this end, the Alaska Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration (ACUASI) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks has developed a new cascade DRUM-style impactor to be mounted aboard a variety of unmanned aircraft and work in tandem with an optical particle counter for the routine collection of atmospheric aerosols. These UAS-based aerosol samplers will be employed for measurement campaigns in traditionally hazardous conditions such as volcanic plumes and over forest fires. Here we report on the development and laboratory calibration of the new instrument, the integration with UAS, and the vertical profiling campaigns being undertaken.",

These fluctuations exhibit longer wavelengths, k2ρeρi~1, and stronger magnetic fluctuations than typical lower-hybrid drift instabilities(LHDIs), and several theoretical efforts have been undertaken to explain these mode properties. These works have used fluid theory or the local approximation to handle the electron response, and results have suggested the observed fluctuations may result from an electromagnetic beam mode, or lower order LHDIs. We have adopted a gyrokinetic-electron, unmagnetized kinetic-ion model to study these electromagnetic instabilities in an ion-scale Harris current sheet with a guide field. Our results include instabilities which are destabilized by finite parallel wavevector, and the electron grad-B drift, which resemble the observed fluctuations. Our three dimensional local and eigenmode stability analyses indicate that these modes belong to a group of instabilities which is distinct from the LHDI branch. Both numerical and analytical results will be presented and compared with those of direct simulations.",

            "abstract": "Tidal influence extends ~800 kilometers upstream of the Amazon River mouth, producing semidiurnal oscillations in water elevation and slowing or reversing the flow of the world’s largest river. This tidally influenced reach, known as the tidal river, is flanked by an expansive intertidal floodplain, and includes confluences with two large tributaries, the Xingu and Tapajós. The relative magnitude of the seasonal and tidal signals changes along the length of the tidal river, yielding diverse floodplain environments that span a range of seasonal and tidal influence. Near the upstream limit of tides, natural levees isolate the river from the floodplain during low to moderate flows, while in the lower tidal river, natural levees are absent and river-floodplain exchange is dominated by the tides rather than seasonal variation in river stage. This difference between fluvial and tidal systems strongly affects the nature of sediment exchange between the channel and floodplain, including frequency, duration, and depth of inundation. Here we present data on the impact of this fluvial-tidal continuum on sedimentary processes in the floodplain and resultant depositional signatures. Changes in levee prominence, grain size, and sediment accumulation combine to produce the distinct morphologies of floodplain lakes, intertidal backswamps, and intertidal flats. In addition to sediment accumulation on the periodically exposed floodplain, Amazon River sediment accumulates within the drowned tributary confluences of the Xingu and Tapajós Rivers. Here seasonal and tidal changes in water temperature, discharge, and suspended-sediment concentration drive barotropic and baroclinic flows that transport Amazon River sediment into tributary basins. These findings help to constrain the fate of sediment within the ungauged Amazon tidal river, and will help in understanding the response of the lower Amazon River to changes in accommodation space associated with rising sea level, and changes in sediment load due to deforestation and damming.",

The objective of RAVAN is to demonstrate that a compact spaceborne radiometer that is absolutely accurate to NIST-traceable standards can be built for low cost. The key technologies that enable a radiometer with all these attributes are: a vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) absorber and a gallium fixed-point blackbody as a built-in calibration source. VACNTs are exceedingly black and spectrally flat, making them ideal radiometer absorbers. We present results from the fabrication and calibration of the RAVAN radiometer and plans for CubeSat hosting and launch.

            "abstract": "Large declines in Arctic sea ice volume and summer sea ice extent are generally anticipated for the coming decades, based upon their trajectory in available observations and from a wide variety of greenhouse gas-forced model projections. Substantial uncertainty remains, however, regarding the magnitude of twenty-first century Arctic sea ice loss. Two studies are presented that document and explore the existence of an atmospheric teleconnection between the tropical Pacific and the Arctic on time scales ranging from the interannual to the multi-decadal.\nIn the first study, twenty-first-century summer Arctic sea ice loss and its relationship to the large-scale atmospheric circulation is investigated in a 39-member Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3) ensemble for the period 2000–2061. Each member is subject to an identical greenhouse gas emissions scenario and differs only in the atmospheric model component’s initial condition. A surprisingly large factor of three range in the multi-decadal trends of Arctic sea ice loss is projected, which can only be attributed to internal variability. Higher rates of summer Arctic sea ice loss in CCSM3 are associated with enhanced transpolar drift and Fram Strait ice export driven by surface wind and sea level pressure patterns. Outside the Arctic, the internal variability in sea ice loss is associated with an atmospheric Rossby wave train concentrated over the Pacific sector. The structure of the atmospheric teleconnection pattern in CCSM3 suggests that the tropical Pacific modulates Arctic sea ice loss via the aforementioned Rossby wave train. The second study generally corroborates results in the first by documenting qualitatively similar relationships in a newer model version and across a Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) ensemble. Hints of a similar tropical Pacific-Arctic sea ice variability relationship are also present in various reanalyses at the interannual time scale.",

We compare the diagonal and off-diagonal terms of the tensor at different scales to reveal the different effects of sampling causing the projection of the anisotropic spectrum into the spacecraft observation frame.

Indeed, there is information that is otherwise masked by seasonal and annual mean averages, and this information will likely have implications for evaluating impacts and for developing adaptation strategies. We analyse 16 models from the CMIP5 Historical and RCP8.5 archives and evaluate monthly mean changes in the context of expected changes in the annual cycle of global climate system. It will be argued that improved understanding of seasonal transitions has potential to increase confidence in projections, and to provide additional information of use to the impacts and decision-maker communities.",

            "abstract": "A decline in enrollment in STEM fields at the university level has prompted extensive research on alternative ways of teaching and learning science. Inquiry-based learning as well as the related “flipped” or “active” lectures, and similar teaching methods and philosophies have been proposed as more effective ways to disseminate knowledge in science classes than the traditional lecture. We will provide a synopsis of our experiences in implementing some of these practices into our Introductory Oceanography, Global Climate Change, and Ocean Atmosphere Dynamics undergraduate courses at the University of Pennsylvania, with both smaller and larger enrollments. By implementing tools such as at-home modules; computer labs; incorporation of current research; pre- and post-lecture quizzes; reflective, qualitative writing assignments; peer review; and a variety of in-class learning strategies, we aim to increase the science literacy of the student population and help students gain a more comprehensive knowledge of the topic, enhance their critical thinking skills, and correct misconceptions. While implementing these teaching techniques with college students is not without complications, we argue that a blended class that flexibly and creatively accounts for class size and science level improves the learning experience and the acquired knowledge. We will present examples of student assignments and activities as well as describe the lessons we have learned, and propose ideas for moving forward to best utilize innovative teaching tools in order to increase science literacy in oceanography and other climate-related courses.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimates of solute loads from small, urban watersheds are important, as these watersheds contribute large amounts of many pollutants relative to their size. However, many traditional regression methods for load estimation based on observed relationships with discharge, time, and season are known to be poorly suited to such watersheds. Using data from a tributary of a water-supply reservoir in central Massachusetts, we show that selection of appropriate hydrologic predictor variables can improve model fit and reduce load estimate uncertainties in urban watersheds. We found that the largest improvements were made by including 1-day change in stream discharge as a predictor variable and by using an exponential smoothing function to capture impacts of antecedent flow conditions. These variables better encapsulate storm conditions in flashy streams than discharge alone. Further, they are simple functions of discharge, facilitating their application to any stream for which a continuous record of discharge exists. In the case of nitrate-N and total organic carbon, model uncertainty was further reduced by introducing flexibility through the use of nonparametric smoothing of certain predictor variables. The results of this study demonstrate the need for careful selection of model structure when estimating solute loads in small, urban watersheds, as well as the potential for improved estimate accuracy through appropriate selection of model forms.",

            "abstract": "Syntheses of paleoclimate data in North America are essential for understanding long-term spatiotemporal variability in climate and for properly assessing risk on decadal and longer timescales. Existing reconstructions of the past 2,000 years rely almost exclusively on tree-ring records, which can underestimate low-frequency variability and rarely extend beyond the last millennium. Meanwhile, many records from the full spectrum of paleoclimate archives are available and hold the potential of enhancing our understanding of past climate across North America over the past 2000 years. The second phase of the Past Global Changes (PAGES) North America 2k project began in 2014, with a primary goal of assembling these disparate paleoclimate records into a unified database. This effort is currently supported by the USGS Powell Center together with PAGES. Its success requires grassroots support from the community of researchers developing and interpreting paleoclimatic evidence relevant to the past 2000 years. Most likely, fewer than half of the published records appropriate for this database are publicly archived, and far fewer include the data needed to quantify geochronologic uncertainty, or to concisely describe how best to interpret the data in context of a large-scale paleoclimatic synthesis. The current version of the database includes records that (1) have been published in a peer-reviewed journal (including evidence of the record’s relationship to climate), (2) cover a substantial portion of the past 2000 yr (>300 yr for annual records, >500 yr for lower frequency records) at relatively high resolution (<50 yr/observation), and (3) have reasonably small and quantifiable age uncertainty. Presently, the database includes records from boreholes, ice cores, lake and marine sediments, speleothems, and tree rings. This poster presentation will display the site locations and basic metadata of the records currently in the database. We invite anyone with interest in participating in the project to visit the poster or contact the author to help identify and assimilate relevant records that have not yet been included. The goal is to develop a comprehensive and open-access resource that will serve the diverse community interested in the climate of the Common Era in North America.",

            "abstract": "The fracture and failure of the outer planet satellites' icy shells are not only an observable record of stress and activity throughout their evolution, they are also key mechanisms in the interaction of surface and subsurface material and thus crucial aspects of the study of crustal overturn and ice shell habitability. Recent work suggests that Europa’s chaos terrain formation may include a collapse phase, with the eventual appearance of the chaos terrain determined in part by fracture density in the ice. Similarly, Enceladus' subdued south polar terrain is now known to exist above a trapped south polar sea. With this in mind, the work to be presented combines fractal analysis and a novel fragmentation physics model to characterize the transition from fractured ice to fragmented/collapsed ice and thus, implications for crustal overturn in Europa’s ice shell using terrestrial glaciological studies to develop and test plausible processes. While intuition may suggest that ice \"explosions\" and simple elastic crack propagation are different, a fast-propagating fracture or other abrupt shift to the status quo (e.g., thinned shell) of the system is in effect very similar, as damage radiates through the system. In studying the size distribution of fragments in Europa’s chaos regions, it is possible to back out physical properties of the ice, e.g., material strength, cohesion properties and most importantly, energy necessary to create such a fragmentation event. Fragmentation theory describes the breakage of a body into several pieces. When integrated, our models of crack propagation and fragmentation account for the three modes of fracturing: initiation, propagation, and interaction, and allows for characterization of the energy necessary for fragmented topography (e.g., chaos) to form within an ice shell to better understand the implications for surface overturn. We have modeled fracture formation and coalescence into fragments that results in a similar distribution to that of the fragments in Europa’s chaos regions. We have also recreated the observed “sunken” topography in Europa’s chaos regions over water pockets within the shell and, in a similar but altered setting, the depression at South Pole of Enceladus. We present comparisons of styles of failure to the activity and geology of these icy worlds.",

            "abstract": "While the full interpretation of climate signals in lake systems requires an understanding of lake-specific physical forcing and response mechanisms, we propose that insight into the response of a lake at a specific latitude to climate change can be acquired by comparing the present conditions of a morphologically and dynamically similar lake at lower latitude. The latitude-for-time shift comes from swapping current latitudinal gradients of air temperature with predicted air temperature trends due to climate change. Of interest is the potential transition of a lake from one mictic state to another, with consequences to the resupply of nutrients to the euphotic zone, and to the phenology of spring and fall phytoplankton blooms. Here we compare the annual thermal histories in seven deep, intermontane lakes in western Canada along a north-south transect from 49o to 61o N, and use predicted trends in air temperature to estimate commensurate changes in duration of summer stratification period. While the actual response of lakes to climate change is likely to be much more complex, this simple model offers support that field observations in large lakes spanning the full range of present day climatic conditions offers a valuable tool for assessing the response of lake dynamics to climate warming.",

            "abstract": "Recent field studies on major sources of the important greenhouse gas methane (CH4) indicate significant underestimation of methane release from fossil fuel industrial (FFI) and animal husbandry sources, among others. In addition, uncertainties still exist with respect to carbon dioxide (CO2) measurements, especially source fingerprinting. CO2 isotopic analysis provides a valuable in situ measurement approach to fingerprint CH4 and CO2as associated with combustion sources, leakage from geologic reservoirs, or biogenic sources. As a result, these measurements can characterize strong combustion source plumes, such as power plant emissions, and discriminate these emissions from other sources.\nAs part of the COMEX (CO2 and MEthane eXperiment) campaign, a novel CO2 isotopic analyzer was installed and collected data aboard the CIRPAS Twin Otter aircraft. Developing methods to derive CH4 and CO2 budgets from remote sensing data is the goal of the summer 2014 COMEX campaign, which combines hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and non-imaging spectroscopy (NIS) with in situ airborne and surface data. COMEX leverages the synergy between high spatial resolution HSI and moderate spatial resolution NIS.\nThe carbon dioxide isotope analyzer developed by Los Gatos Research (LGR) uses LGR’s patented Off-Axis ICOS (Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy) technology and incorporates proprietary internal thermal control for high sensitivity and optimal instrument stability. This analyzer measures CO2 concentration as well as δ13C, δ18O, and δ17O from CO2 at natural abundance (100-3000 ppm). The laboratory accuracy is ±1.2 ppm (1σ) in CO2 from 370-1000 ppm, with a long-term (1000 s) precision of ±0.012 ppm. The long-term precision for both δ13C and δ18O is 0.04 ‰, and for δ17O is 0.06 ‰. The analyzer was field-tested as part of the COWGAS campaign, a pre-cursor campaign to COMEX in March 2014, where it successfully discriminated plumes related to combustion processes associated with dairy activities (tractor exhaust) from plumes and sources in air enriched in methane and ammonia from bovine activities including waste maintenance.\nMethodology, laboratory data, field data from COWGAS, and field data from the COMEX campaign acquired by LGR’s carbon isotope analyzer as well as other COMEX analyzers are presented.",

The Mn spectroscopic signature decreases with the depth of laser ablation, implying that this dark layer would be mostly related to airfall deposition of elements from Martian atmospheric dust.\nThe discovery of rock varnish on Mars has important implications.\nFirst, desert varnish films may catalyze physico-chemical processes, inducing breakdown of certain chemical compounds under strong radiation conditions at the surface of Martian rocks. Mn has catalytic properties for various chemical reactions, while MnO features photocatalyst effects under UV radiation.\nSecond, the water affinity of different metal oxide mixtures in desert varnish may explain water signatures detected by spectroscopy on various regions on Mars.\nLast but not least, the ability of certain anaerobic microbes on Earth to respire on oxidized Manganese, brings into discussion new arguments for the potential habitable conditions on Mars.\nThis study evaluates possible chemical reactions facilitated by the photocatalyst properties of the thin oxide films on the desert varnish rocks, under specific conditions identified on the surface of Mars by Curiosity and other missions. Effects of seasonal variations on surface radiation levels, as well as the variation of CO2concentration in the Martian atmosphere, are discussed.\nVarnished rocks from high insolation dry areas on Earth, such as the Mojave Desert, are taken in consideration as analogs that help reproduce the photocatalysis processes on the surface of Mars.",

            "abstract": "Ocean carbon uptake reduces the accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere and thus damps anthropogenic climate change. Ocean carbon uptake is driven by the air-sea difference in pCO2. Carbon uptake by the ocean increases pCO2SW; the rate of increase determines the evolution of the ocean sink and is modulated by ocean circulation and biogeochemistry. Many recent observational studies have used in situ data to infer changes in the ocean carbon sink; however, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the spatial and temporal structure of the long-term response to rising atmospheric CO2 and patterns associated with changes in physical climate, making detection of trends a challenge. We use results from the CESM Large Ensemble experiment to quantify the timescales and magnitude of internal variability in pCO2SW in comparison to the forced trend. Over most of the ocean and for most timescales, the forced pCO2SW trend is weaker than the trend in atmospheric pCO2 (indicating a strengthening sink), particularly in regions of upwelling or deep vertical mixing. On 10-year timeframes, the amplitude of the internal response is comparable to 10-30% of the forced response in the subtropics and 60-100% in the Equatorial Pacific and high-latitudes. This equates to deviations from the forced response of generally < 0.4 ppmv/yr in the subtropics but up to 2 ppmv/yr in the Equatorial Pacific and high-latitudes. On 20-year timeframes, the internal variability diminishes substantially to <10% of the forced response in the subtropics and <20% in the Equatorial Pacific and high-latitudes. This transition from a 10 to 20 year timeframe increases the signal-to-noise ratio in the Equatorial Pacific and high-latitudes from 1 to >5. On 30-year timeframes, the internal variability is <10% of the forced response globally with signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 10.",

            "abstract": "“Walkabout the Galaxy” is a weekly podcast we have been publishing since May 2014 discussing astronomical news that is in the popular media at the time of recording. Episodes are 25-30 minutes in length and are informal in style: we emphasize one or two basic points while engaging in a free-form discussion of the topic with frequent tangential asides. The target audience is the interested layperson rather than a student, professional, or amateur of astronomy. The informal style is deliberately chosen to keep the podcast from sounding like a classroom lesson and to improve the reach of the podcast to a broader public. Guests have included both experts and laypeople. The number of episode downloads varies by nearly a factor of two from episode to episode (~450 to 750). We will present statistics on downloads and subscriptions, and correlations with episode length, subject matter, and style of episode title. The style of the content cannot influence download statistics, however, and it is not possible to track actual listenership data once the episodes are downloaded. We will discuss lessons learned in creating and producing an educational podcast as well as listener feedback.",

            "abstract": "Fire severity can be defined using satellite imagery to ratio mid (~2.2 um) to near (~0.8 um) infrared reflectance values. We examined how lithology and topography affected burn severity, and how post-fire soils data could be used to ground-truth burn severity at two sites in southwestern Montana. A burned area reflectance classification (BARC), lithology, and terrain attributes were used to predict burn severity for the Millie Fire, which was triggered two years ago by lightning and burned ~4,000 ha. Burn severity showed a strong dependence on lithology: the ratio of areas with high burn severity vs. low or moderate burn severities was 2.9 for gneiss (vs. 0.3 for volcanics). The high-severity burn area for the gneiss was larger than the volcanics, despite the latter lithology covering ~270% greater area (~2,600 ha). Aspect and elevation also influenced burn severity with lower severity at higher elevations (2,600-3,000 m) and higher severity at lower elevations (1,800-2,400 m). Southern and western aspects burned more severely than northern and eastern aspects. To clarify whether post-fire soil geochemical changes might predict ground-based estimates of fire severity, a lab experiment was carried out . We expected residual enrichment of trace metal concentrations, as soil organic matter (SOM) was combusted, which we quantified as loss on ignition (LOI). To test this approach, burned and unburned soils were sampled from the ~6000 ha Beartrap 2 fire, which also burned two years. We simulated differing fire severities on unburned soil using a muffle furnace factorially (duration [5, 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes] x temperature [50, 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500ºC]). Consistent with expectations, unburned samples had a lower mean (±1SD) concentrations for 23 of 30 elements than field-burned samples. For example, barium concentrations ([Ba]) in unburned samples were (708±37μg/g), 16% lower than field-burned [Ba] (841±7 μg/g). Simulated burning yielded smaller [Ba] (732±9 μg/g). Of the 30 trace metals examined, barium explained the greatest fraction of variance in post-burn LOI (R2 =0.79); gallium explained slightly less variance (R2=0.67). Our results document the promise of post-burn soil geochemistry to indicate soil burn severity, which could complement vegetation-based and remotely sensed indices.",

            "abstract": "Past pluvials in the western United States provide valuable context for understanding regional hydroclimate variability. Here we report evidence of conditions substantially wetter than today from fluvial tufa deposits located near Zaca Lake, Santa Barbara County, California that have been dated by radiocarbon (14C) and Infra-Red Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL). Two successions of tufa deposition occur within a small catchment that drains Miocene Monterey Formation bedrock: 1) a fluvial deposit (0−0.5 m thick, 200 m in extent) that formed along a narrow valley below a modern spring, and 2) a perched deposit about 10 m higher (2 m thick, 15 m in extent). IRSL and radiocarbon dating of the perched carbonates suggests at least two episodes of carbonate growth: one at 19.4 ± 2.4 (1σ) through 17.8 ± 2.8 (1σ) ka and another at 11.9 ± 1.5 (1σ) ka verified with a charcoal 14C age of 10.95 ± 0.12 (2σ) cal ka BP. The relationship between the perched and fluvial spring deposits is inferred to represent a drop in the water table of more than 10 m associated with a transition from a wet climate in the late glacial to a dry Holocene today.\nThe wet period indicated by tufa growth between 19.4 and 17.8 ka is relatively consistent with other California climate records both north and south of Zaca Lake. However, tufa growth ca. 12 to 11 ka demonstrates wet conditions occurred as far south as Zaca Lake during the Younger Dryas event, in contrast to climate records farther south in Lake Elsinore indicating persistently dry conditions through this interval. A small shift north in the average position of the winter season storm track could explain wet winters at Zaca while at the same time generating dry winters at Lake Elsinore, 275 km southwest of Zaca. If true, these data indicate that rather small latitudinal shifts in the average winter season storm track can produce large changes in regional hydroclimate.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon river basin is vulnerable to severe seasonal droughts that cause significant ecological and economic impacts, as happened in 2005 and 2010. Although drought analysis tools have been largely developed and applied in arid and semi-arid environments, challenges remain in characterizing droughts and related hydrologic mechanisms in tropical regions with large storage capacity and densely forested, such as in the Amazon. In this study, we analyze the hydrologic behavior of the unsaturated zone of typical Amazon watersheds during droughts using a coupled soil-vegetation model. That model uses a one-dimensional, multiple wetting front representation of a 12 meters-deep unsaturated zone, and was calibrated with existing field data such as soil moisture and evaporation from flux towers. That model was forced with rainfall and potential evaporation synthetic time series generated with a stochastic model developed to represent different climate patterns. Such stochastic simulation of the soil-vegetation system produces the probability distributions of water balance components and allows for the analysis of the sensitivity of the hydrologic fluxes to varying rainfall properties. The results show a contrasting behavior of hydrologic components: as rainfall is reduced, interception decreases but transpiration increases due to less cloudiness. The increase in transpiration seems to be supported by larger changes in soil water storages. Moreover, periods of reduced rainfall are also followed by enhanced deep percolation underneath the deep root zones. Thus, dry periods are associated with higher rates of soil water loss to transpiration and deep percolation. Those results advance the existing knowledge of the response of tropical, forested environments to droughts and can potentially contribute to better prediction of impacts of hydrologic droughts in the Amazon.",

            "abstract": "Debris flows are a major process responsible for transferring sediment from high mountain locations to more downstream fluvial reaches. This sediment transfer begins on mountain hillslopes where various mass wasting processes move sediment from hillslopes to uppermost reaches of the channel system (these reaches are herein referred to as gullies and only experience water flow during high intensity precipitation events). Sediment recharge into gullies, which has received minimal attention in the scientific literature, refers to the transfer of sediment and other debris from surrounding hillslopes into gullies (Jakob and Oden, 2005). Debris flow occurrence and debris flow volumes depend on some precipitation threshold as well as volumes of material contained in the particular gully. For example, if one debris flow has removed all of the accumulated material from the gully, then any subsequent debris flow will be smaller if enough time has not yet passed for notable sediment recharge.\nHerein, we utilize the numerical model of landscape development, LandMod (Martin, 1998; Dadson and Church, 2005; Martin, 2007), to explore connections between hillslope processes, gully recharge rates, and transfer of sediment to downstream channel reaches in the Haida Gwaii, British Columbia. Hillslope processes in the model include shallow landsliding, bedrock failures and weathering. The updated debris flow algorithm is based on extensive field data available for debris flows in Haida Gwaii (e.g., Rood, 1984; Oden, 1994; Jakob and Oden, 2005), as well as theoretical considerations based on debris flow studies. The most significant model extension is the calculation of gully recharge rates; for each gully, the total accumulated sediment in gullies at each time step is determined using a power-law relation for area-normalized recharge rate versus elapsed time since the last debris flow. Thus, when the stochastic driver for debris flow occurrence triggers an event, the amount of stored material is known and can be transferred and deposited along the channel system. Results show that the size distribution of debris flows and sediment transfers from gullies to downstream reaches are modified by the inclusion of a module that accounts for sediment recharge when compared to model runs that do not consider gully recharge.

            "abstract": "The Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has revealed elevated mountains and hummocky terrains, which have been interpreted to be related to tectonic processes. The geomorphic evidence strongly suggests contractional strain has formed most of the mountains on Titan. Analysis of SAR images and SARTopo profiles reveals mountain belts with linear-to-arcuate morphology and relatively gentle slopes (< 2o). These observations suggest that Titan’s mountains are likely folds and thrusts related to small amounts of deformation.\nIf the mountains on Titan are contractional in origin, another problem arises: relatively large stresses are required to cause contractional deformation, and sources of such stresses are difficult to obtain for most icy satellites. We estimate Titan’s lithospheric strength as a function of depth in the brittle and ductile regime based on Byerlee’s law and flow law. Our calculation shows that a stress of less than 8-10 MPa is required to cause contractional strain on Titan. Since liquid hydrocarbons have been identified on Titan’s surface and may flow in the subsurface, by modifying the Mohr-Coulomb law of frictional shear strength, we show that fluid pressures associated with liquid hydrocarbons in the subsurface significantly reduce frictional resistance to sliding and enables contractional structures to form without requiring large stresses. On Titan, fluid pressures weaken the upper crust and make contraction easier.\nTitan’s volatile endowment (methane and ammonia) and consequently thick atmosphere has sustained the stability of surface and subsurface hydrocarbon liquids, weakening the upper crust. Other icy satellites, such as Europa, Callisto and Ganymede, lack significant proportions of these volatiles, and hence lack atmospheres and hydrospheres with ground-liquids. Consequently, they have very different tectonic systems than Titan and they lack extensive contractional tectonic features. Thus, the volatile component obtained during accretion directly affects the style of tectonics on icy satellites, just as it does on Earth.",

Complexity of this surface exists at multiple spatial scales, which complicates the understanding of these processes. NCAR/EOL currently provides a facility to the research community to make direct eddy-covariance flux observations to quantify surface-atmosphere interactions. However, just as model resolution has continued to increase, there is a need to increase the spatial density of flux measurements to capture the wide variety of scales that contribute to exchange processes close to the surface.\nNCAR/EOL now has developed the CentNet facility, that is envisioned to have on the order of 100 surface flux stations deployable for periods of months to years. Each station would measure standard meteorological variables, all components of the surface energy balance (including turbulence fluxes and radiation), atmospheric composition, and other quantities to characterize the surface. Thus, CentNet can support observational research in the biogeosciences, hydrology, urban meteorology, basic meteorology, and turbulence.\nCentNet has been designed to be adaptable to a wide variety of research problems while keeping operations manageable. Tower infrastructure has been designed to be lightweight, easily deployed, and with a minimal set-up footprint. CentNet uses sensor networks to increase spatial sampling at each station. The data system saves every sample on site to retain flexibility in data analysis.\nWe welcome guidance on development and funding priorities as we build CentNet.",

However, high-order accurate methods can introduce physically incorrect overshoot and undershoot of the computed solution at steep gradients. Values of the temperature that are physically too large or too small in turn can lead to significant inaccuracies in other quantities, such as the viscosity, which is exponentially proportional to temperature.\nWe have developed a numerical method for approximating solutions to the Rayleigh-Benard equations (i.e., the incompressible Stokes equations, an advection-diffusion equation for the temperature, and a Boussinesq approximation for the density) in which solutions to the advection-diffusion equation are approximated with a monotone finite difference method. This monotone finite difference method is based on a second-order accurate finite difference method for approximating solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, originally developed by Bell, Colella, and Glaz, with appropriate modifications to ensure stability of a solution due to Minion. We present examples demonstrating that our new method preserves the monotonicity of the temperature field in problems for which widely used mantle convection codes do not.\nThe long-term goal of this project is to implement monotonicity preserving numerical methods in modern codes for modeling convection in the Earth's mantle.",

            "abstract": "Feedbacks between terrestrial water storage (TWS) and the atmosphere can impact climatic extremes such as droughts and heat waves. High evaporative demand (high temperature and/or low humidity) removes more water by evapotranspiration, leading to lower TWS. At the same time, low TWS availability limits evapotranspiration, which increases evaporative demand by reducing the ratio of latent to sensible heat fluxes from the land surface. Studies using coupled land-atmosphere models have explored the strength of these relationships, and have been validated using local observational data, but global-scale observational studies are limited by data availability. We quantified these relationships globally using TWS data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), surface air temperature and relative humidity from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and precipitation from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). Our approach demonstrated a strong relationship between antecedent TWS and subsequent evaporative demand in certain key regions of the globe. These regions are consistent with the “hot spots” of land-atmosphere coupling found in modeling studies, and represent semi-arid transitional areas where TWS strongly limits evapotranspiration. We also found a strong relationship between antecedent evaporative demand and subsequent TWS throughout most of the global land surface. These observational relationships provide a benchmark for comparison with climate model simulations. We found good agreement between the satellite-derived relationships and the equivalent relationships calculated with output from the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4.5.",

            "abstract": "A 56-member ensemble of ocean reanalyses is used to explore strong El Niño and La Niña events in two 5-year periods, 1916 to 1920 and 1996 to 2000, that have markedly different quantities of observations. To generate the 56 forcing fields, we produced a 56 member atmospheric reanalysis (20CR system) prescribing as boundary conditions 8 different sea surface temperature (SST) estimates from an ocean reanalysis system, the SODA with sparse input (SODA.si1), resulting in 8 sets of 7 ensemble members each. These reanalyses are part of an overall effort to run ocean and atmosphere reanalyses iteratively in an effort to improve historical reanalyses in periods of sparse observations.\nThe reanalyses are used to explore ENSO diversity in the tropical Pacific Ocean and its global effects. Early results from the two periods show that the representation of the same ENSO event varies widely in strength, duration, and location among the 56 ensemble members indicating that the atmospheric forcing makes a significant difference in how SODAsi resolves the event. For example, the warming during the 1918/1919 event in some members is far in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean while in other members the major warming is in the western and central Pacific. During the better-observed 1990s, the ensemble variance is smaller, but members still show substantial differences in the magnitude of events. Additionally, similarities among the results of each atmospheric reanalysis set generated with the same SODAsi.1 SST suggest that the state estimates are strongly dependent upon the SST boundary condition. These reanalyses are used to understand the effects of both high and low frequency atmospheric dynamics on ENSO strength and position, as well as explore the state of the ocean leading up to the strongest La Nina event on record (1916-1917). The results add to what is previously known about ENSO in order to improve ENSO predictability, as well as highlight the importance of data assimilation.",

            "abstract": "The remaining vernal pools flanking California’s Central Valley may be protected from development, but they are not pristine environments. At UC Merced’s Vernal Pools and Grassland Reserve, dairy cattle grazing is a fact of life, needed to keep non-native grasses from encroaching on and dominating these low lying, ephemeral pools. In addition to grazing, atmospheric deposition of nitrogen from adjacent agricultural farms and dairies has affected the biogeochemical cycling here, in particular because the area has never been ploughed and is essentially a terminal, interior catchment with almost no outputs. For the past two years, the region has been subjected to extreme drought resulting in altered patterns in vernal pool development and nutrient exchange. We are using stable nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen isotopes in organic and inorganic reservoirs to understand which of the three stressors (e.g. N loading, grazing, or drought) affects the ecosystem functioning the most. Simple measurements of residual dry matter (the rancher’s standard) coupled with soil analyses and plant distribution, isotopic composition, and productivity will be presented at a landscape scale. Atmospheric deposition, as rain in winter and early spring and as dust in summer and fall, delivers substantial ammonium and nitrate to the Reserve and could be traced back to nearby hotspots, as well as from major storm systems. Concentrations and compositions of N in precipitation were highly variable depending on when the last storm event had occurred. Ammonia/ammonium in rainwater ranged from δ15N= -24 to +7‰, probably explaining the large range in the δ15N of plant tissues collected in winter/spring (-4.3 to +10.9‰,) and that of extractable ammonium from surface soils (δ15N = -7 to +13‰). Interior grassland and vernal pool ecosystems, with substantial inputs and little to no outputs, host biogeochemical processes that amplify heterogeneity on relative small scales.",

            "abstract": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a complex substrate; the soil matrix has a wide array of chemical inputs, leading to a heterogeneous mixture of carbon compounds. In volcanic soils on Kohala Mountain, Hawaii Island, old organic carbon (OC) (>10,000 years) is associated with short-range order (SRO) minerals with large, reactive surface areas (Torn et al., 1997). Large variations in precipitation generate significant changes in soil pH, secondary minerals and soil redox state. A study to measure the age distribution in a given sample of SOC by the ramped pyrolysis-AMS technique was carried out at Woods Hole NOSAMS facility. Five soil samples, from three sites (precipitation = 2.4m/year, 2.3m/year, 1.78m/year, respectively) on a 350 ka volcanic (Pololu) substrate were analyzed. Samples were freeze-dried, homogenized, and combusted under a programed temperature pyrolysis regime from 25 to 900°C; evolved CO2 was collected in fractions for 14C analysis. The abundance of SRO minerals is characterized through sequential extractions and total elemental analysis. Results include: 1.) The Pu’u Eke profile (2.4m/year), older carbon (bulk radiocarbon age: 2530 years) is deeper (63-74cm) in the soil profile, but it is thermally less stable (thermograph Tmax: 314°C) than the younger carbon, which was in the associated with the 25-36cm sample (radiocarbon age: 1030yr) and Tmax: 324°C. The top horizon of the profile (13-21cm) had a modern radiocarbon age, but a Tmax: 396°C. 2.) The high precipitation site has significantly younger OC (2698 yr) than the drier site (7585 yr). This is coincident with changing redox conditions and loss of nano-crystalline iron oxide minerals (ferrihydrite) from the wet site. 3.) In a given sample, the age distribution is fairly uniform. The initial results support the hypothesis that nano-crystalline ferrihydrite acts to stabilize OC, as older carbon is found in the dryer, ferrihydrite rich sites, while at the wet, Fe-poor site 14C ages were substantially younger. Despite its younger radiocarbon age, the high precipitation site has substantially greater SOC (27.7%) compared to the drier sites with only 5.68% SOC, implying much faster turnover times at the Fe-poor site. This suggests that soil mineralogy, especially the presence of ferrihydrite, has a significant control on the turnover time of OC.",

Each institution operates and maintain their seismic network, sharing their data in an virtual private network. These networks have seismic stations transmitting in real time (or near real time) raw data to their respective data centers, where the seismogram files are then shared with other institutions. Currently RSBR has 57 broadband stations, some of them operating since 1994, transmitting data through mobile phone data networks or satellite links. Station management, data acquisition and storage and earthquake data processing at the Seismological Observatory of the University of Brasilia is automatically performed by SeisComP3 (SC3). However, the SC3 data processing is limited to event detection, location and magnitude. An automatic crustal modeling system was designed process raw seismograms and generate 1D S-velocity profiles. This system automatically calculates receiver function (RF) traces, Vp/Vs ratio (h-k stack) and surface waves dispersion (SWD) curves. These traces and curves are then used to calibrate the lithosphere seismic velocity models using a joint inversion scheme The results can be reviewed by an analyst, change processing parameters and selecting/neglecting RF traces and SWD curves used in lithosphere model calibration. The results to be obtained from this system will be used to generate and update a quasi-3D crustal model of Brazil's territory.",

            "abstract": "MBL cloud top height (Ztop) is a reflection of the balance between several large-scale terms, including subsidence, which in isolation tends to suppress Ztop, and entrainment, which deepens Ztop, and is inversely proportional to stability. With the use of gridded daily MODIS L3 cloud data and state-of-the-art reanalysis data from ERA-Interim, we extend beyond the traditional constraints of defining stability/dynamic variables with one or two fixed levels by instead computing vertical correlations relative to Ztop. Along a southeast (SE) Pacific cross section centered at 20˚S from the coast to 140˚W, ϴ negatively correlates with Ztop not only just above cloud top, but throughout the lower free troposphere. Below cloud top, ϴ correlations with Ztopare fairly weak.\nMore confounding relationships are found between profiles of pressure vertical velocity (ω) and both Ztop and MBL cloud fraction (CF); especially over the stratocumulus (Sc) and transitional regions, stronger ω (either near Ztop or aloft) is associated with deeper MBL clouds, anomalously low ϴ near and above Ztop, and slightly reduced CF. Over the trade cumulus region, enhanced subsidence is associated with an anomalously cold MBL, increased stability, and suppressed Ztop.\nFor further elucidation, we visit the concept of a baroclinic atmosphere, in which the trough/ridge axes and ϴ anomalies tilt with height, albeit in opposite ways. Along our cross section, in the case of an anomalous surface high to the east of an upper-level high, an eastward tilt with height of ϴ is documented, especially over the transitional and Sc cloud regimes. Anomalous ridging aloft is strongly correlated with suppressed Ztop.\nOver the transitional and Sc regimes (east of ~105˚W), maximum ω anomalies are located directly between the upper-level anomalous ridge and trough axes. The coldest ϴ anomalies near and above Ztop are located just east of the maximum subsidence, corresponding to reduced stability, deeper Ztop, and a slight reduction of CF. Thus, the baroclinic structure between 100˚W and 70˚W can help explain the unexpected positive correlations between ω and Ztop. The relationships described between ω and Ztop may have implications for diagnosing low cloud feedbacks in other subtropical Sc areas as well, especially where baroclinicity is important.",

            "abstract": "Changes in the frequency of extreme floods have been observed and anticipated in many hydrologic settings in response to numerous drivers of environmental change, including climate, land cover, and infrastructure. To help decision-makers design flood control infrastructure in settings with non-stationary hydrologic regimes, a parsimonious approach for detecting and modeling trends in extreme floods is needed. An approach using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression can accommodate nonstationarity in both the mean and variance of flood series while simultaneously offering a means of (i) analytically evaluating type I and type II trend detection errors, (ii) analytically generating expressions of uncertainty, such as confidence and prediction intervals, (iii) providing updated estimates of the frequency of floods exceeding the flood of record, (iv) accommodating a wide range of non-linear functions through ladder of powers transformations, and (v) communicating hydrologic changes in a single graphical image. Previous research has shown that the two-parameter lognormal distribution can adequately model the annual maximum flood distribution of both stationary and non-stationary hydrologic regimes in many regions of the United States. A simple logarithmic transformation of annual maximum flood series makes an OLS regression modeling approach especially suitable for creating a non-stationary flood frequency distribution with parameters that are conditional upon time or a physically meaningful covariate. While the heteroscedasticity of some OLS models may be viewed as an impediment, it also presents an opportunity for characterizing both the conditional mean and variance of annual maximum floods. Through a case study of an urbanizing watershed, we demonstrate that accounting for trends in both the mean and variance can yield substantially different estimates of time-dependent extreme flood quantiles than only considering trends in the mean. When applied to risk-based optimization, including trends in the variance strongly influences the flood magnitude for which flood control infrastructure should be designed over a given planning horizon. This approach can easily be extended to multivariate regression equations that take physically meaningful covariates into account.",

To this, 65 broadband, 65 strong-motion and 130 real-time dual-frequency GPS devices are being installed to complement the observational system. Additionally, 297 accelerometers distributed throughout the country will be connected to the main acquisition, processing and distribution system, which is also being upgraded by incorporating hardware virtualization capabilities. It is expected that most of the installation of the remote sensors is completed by the end of 2015.\nThe GPS instruments will be deployed mainly along the coast every 40 or 50 km. Because a robust real-time communication is mandatory from each remote site, the preferred solution is radio link to concentration nodes where the signals (NMEA, including RTX, as well as other protocols such a BINEX, RCTM) can be uploaded to microwaves links or Vsat. Thirty one GPS stations have been deployed in the country, we expect to complete 30more installations this year.\nAs a result of a trial experiment with RTX capabilities (clock and satellite corrections distributed via satellite) coastal horizontal displacements of up to 30 cm were observed in real time for the largest aftershock (Mw=7.7) of the April 1, Mw=8.2 earthquake in northern Chile. These signals are the example of an extraordinary tool to characterize the earthquake source within few minutes of its occurrence.",

            "abstract": "As nitrate levels in lotic systems have increased, nutrient reduction strategies have become the centerpiece of water quality standards to protect and restore stream ecosystems. While reducing anthropogenic nitrate (NO3) loads has many positive effects, we lack a fundamental understanding of how lotic systems respond to changing concentrations and no methods exist to characterize nutrient uptake behavior below ambient levels. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether nutrient reductions will meet management goals. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a chamber-based method which allows characterization of NO3 utilization along the two major uptake pathways at reduced NO3 levels. The chamber blocks flow by insertion into upper sediments but allows light in and sediment-water-air interactions to occur. At Gum Slough Springs, Florida, high-resolution in-situ sensors measured water quality while NO3 reduced from ambient levels (1.40 mg N/L) to below regulatory thresholds (ca. 0.20 mg N/L) within one week. Daytime NO3 uptake, resulting from both plant uptake and denitrification, was consistently greater than nighttime uptake, which is denitrification alone. Using this method, we compared NO3 uptake rates (UNO3) and gross primary production (GPP) across three vegetative regimes (i.e. submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), SAV with epiphytic algae, and algae alone) and related GPP estimates from the chamber to reach scale. Results showed that UNO3 and GPP were greatest in SAV, GPP was negatively correlated to [NO3] in algae, denitrification rates did not vary by vegetation type, and chamber GPP (e.g. 6-8 g O2/m2/day in SAV) was comparable to reach-scale estimates (6-12 g O2/m2/day). Our results suggest UNO3 and GPP differ by vegetation regimes, GPP scales from chamber to reach level, algal presence potentially reduces GPP, and a lack of nutrient limitation even at low [NO3]. Current work includes replicating measurements across systems as well as refining the decoupling of NO3 removal pathways using the N2:Ar approach for denitrification. Overall, this method shows promise as a tool for in-situ ecosystem-scale assessments of nutrient retention below ambient concentrations, and thus may enable future investigations focused on predicting how rivers will respond to enrichment and restoration.",

            "abstract": "Our understanding of Northern Hemisphere South American summer monsoon (SASM) dynamics during the Holocene has been limited by the small number of terrestrial paleoclimate records from this region. In order to increase our knowledge of SASM variability and to better inform our predictions of its response to ongoing rapid climate change, we require high-resolution paleoclimate records from the Northern Hemisphere Andes. To this end, we present sub-decadally resolved sedimentological and geochemical data from Laguna de Ubaque that spans the last 5000 years. Located in the Eastern Cordillera of the Colombian Andes, Laguna de Ubaque (2070 m asl) is a small, east facing moraine-dammed lake in the upper part of the Rio Meta watershed near Bogotá containing finely laminated clastic sediments. Dry bulk density, %organic matter, %carbonate and magnetic susceptibility (MS) results from Ubaque suggest a period of intense precipitation between 3500 and 2000 years BP interrupted by a 300 yr dry interval centered at 2700 years BP. Following this event, generally drier conditions characterize the last 2000 years. Although considerably lower amplitude than the middle Holocene pluvial events, variability in the sedimentological data support climatic responses during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 900 to 1200 CE) and Little Ice Age (LIA; 1450 to 1900 CE) that are consistent with other records of local Andean conditions. In particular, reduced MS during the MCA suggests a reduction in terrestrial material being washed into the lake as a result of generally drier conditions. The LIA on the other hand shows a two phase structure with increased MS between 1450 and 1600 CE, suggesting wetter conditions during the onset of the LIA, and reduced MS between 1600 and 1900 CE, suggesting a return to drier conditions during the latter part of the LIA. These LIA trends are similar to the Quelccaya accumulation record, possibly supporting an in-phase relationship between the South American Hemispheres. By comparing our precipitation proxies with other terrestrial records, as well as Pacific sea surface temperatures (SST) and global climate reconstructions, we will examine the relationship between Northern and Southern Hemisphere Andean climate responses to assess the validity of existing theories on the modes of climate change in the region.",

Others are so worried that climate change will destroy Earth’s environment and any prospects for their descendants that they are either frantic to find solutions, or too discouraged to act. To attempt to reach these disparate audiences with critical scientific information from reports such as the IPCC and NCA, the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research and the United Nations Foundation initiated the Scientist Citizen Initiative, and launched Climate Voices – Science Speakers Network (climatevoices.org) in April of this year.\nThis presentation will address the trials and errors of establishing such a network, engaging scientists across the country, and creating public demand for such a resource. The major focus will be lessons still being learned about reaching diverse local audiences; gauging and implementing the varied approach necessary to engage such audiences; and enabling scientists to initiate public conversations involving fellow citizens in discussion of climate change observations, impacts, and solutions. How can partners be identified and involved that deliver mixed audiences ranging from the Six Americas’ “alarmed and concerned” to the “doubtful and dismissive?” [Yale Project on Climate Communication] How can synthesis report results be made compelling and relevant to such audiences? How can such an effort be implemented across the entire country? How can its accomplishments and failures be assessed and evaluated? This presentation will provide answers in progress to these questions.",

            "abstract": "During the past six years we have carried out volcanologic fieldwork either in active geothermal fields in Mexico (Los Azufres, Tres Vírgenes, and Cerro Prieto) or in potential sites in which some geothermal exploration studied had been done by the National Power Company (CFE). These studies have been very successful in reassessing the location of the geothermal reservoirs within the volcanic successions through detailed mapping of the volcanic units using high resolution topography and satellite imagery to produce 3-D imagery in conjunction with field work to produce preliminary geologic maps. Detailed stratigraphy of volcanic units, assisted with 40Ar/39Ar and radiocarbon geochronology have redefined the evolution of some of these complexes. For example, our studies at Los Azufres geothermal field located in the State of Michoacán indicate that the volcanic complex of the same name sits upon a structural high transected by E-W faults related to the youngest structures of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The volcanic complex has been emplaced during the past ~1.5 Ma. During this time, magmas evolved from basaltic to rhyolitic in composition with the emplacement of circa 100 vents. Several landforms have undergone intense hydrothermal alteration and, in some cases, generated debris avalanches. The revised stratigraphy based on drill holes and new dates of cores suggested that the geothermal reservoir is hosted in Miocene rocks bracketed between the Miocene Sierra de Mil Cumbres volcanics (17-22 Ma) and the products of the volcanic field itself. Similar studies will be carried out at four other Pleistocene calderas (Acoculco, La Primavera, Aguajito and Reforma) attempting to refine their volcanic stratigraphy, evolution, and the location of the geothermal system, and those results will help in the design of exploration strategies for geothermal sources.",

            "abstract": "A combination of satellite observations (principally GPCP) and ECMWF reanalyses were used to examine the major diagonal convergence zones in the Southern Hemisphere. Time-lag height anomalies composited on high rainfall events in sub-tropical and mid-latitude sections of the climatological zones showed nearly equivalent barotropic wave packets propagating into the regions from higher latitudes, in a manner easily interpretable in terms of the structure of low-pass-filtered pv gradients. To examine the moisture field with which the wave vertical motion field interacted in producing precipitation, animations were first constructed from daily fields of PV on the 330-theta surface superposed on total column water (TCW). The animations showed frequent events of anticyclonic breaking of mid-latitude Rossby waves, coincidental with the development of streamers of total column water (TCW) drawn out of the tropics, into the subtropics and mid-latitudes just downstream of parallel PV streamers in the breaking waves. Vertical cross sections through selected streamers showed locally high levels of moisture extending through most of the troposphere, with dynamically consistent vertical motion fields. Although major streamer events with NW-SE tilt could be seen in the animations, TCW streamers were in fact seen with many orientations and in many locations around the hemisphere. An objective method was developed to classify TCW streamers by their horizontal tilt. When applied to observations from the 20 year period 1991-2012, the method showed that TCW streamers with NW-SE tilt preferentially occurred in the three climatological diagonal convergence zones regions during austral summer, but only in the SPCZ and SACZ regions during austral winter.",

The program sought to increase interest in interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, math and related careers. Lassen Volcanic National Park (LVNP), Red Bluff High School and the Ames Team of the NASA Astrobiology Institute led the program. LVNP was selected because it shares aspects of volcanism with Mars and it hosts thermal springs with microbial mat communities. Students documented volcanic deposits, springs and microbial mats. They analyzed waters and sampled rocks, water and microorganisms. They cultured microorganisms and studied chemical reactions between rocks and simulated spring waters. Each student prepared a report to present data and discuss relationships between volcanic rocks and gases, spring waters and microbial mats. At a “graduation” event the students presented their findings to the Red Bluff community. They visited Ames Research Center to tour the facilities and learn about science and technology careers. To evaluate program impact, surveys were given to students after lectures, labs, fieldwork and discussions with Ames scientists. Students’ work was scored using rubrics (labs, progress reports, final report, presentation). Students took pre/post tests on core astrobiology concepts. Parents, teachers, rangers, Ames staff and students completed end-of-year surveys on program impact. Several outcomes were documented. Students had a unique and highly valued learning experience with NASA scientists. They understood what scientists do through authentic scientific work, and what scientists are like as individuals. Students became knowledgeable about astrobiology and how it can be pursued in the lab and in the field. The students’ interest increased markedly in astrobiology, interdisciplinary studies and science generally.",

            "abstract": "Public interest in volcanic eruptions and societal relevance of volcanic hazards provide an excellent basis for successful earth science outreach. During a museum-based earth science outreach event free and open to the public, we used two new interactive experiments to illustrate the relationship between gas content, magma viscosity, and eruption style. Learning objectives for visitors are to understand: how gas drives volcanic eruptions, the differences between effusive and explosive eruption styles, viscosity’s control on gas pressure within a magma reservoir, and the role of gas pressure on eruption style. Visitors apply the scientific method by asking research questions and testing hypotheses by conducting the experiments. The demonstrations are framed with real life examples of volcanic eruptions (e.g., Mt. St. Helens eruption in 1980), providing context for the scientific concepts.\nThe first activity demonstrates the concept of fluid viscosity and how gas interacts with fluids of different viscosities. Visitors blow bubbles into water and corn syrup. The corn syrup is so viscous that bubbles are trapped, showing how a more viscous material builds up higher gas pressure. Visitors are asked which kind of magma (high or low viscosity) will produce an explosive eruption.\nTo demonstrate an explosive eruption, visitors add an Alka-Seltzer tablet to water in a snap-top film canister. The reaction rapidly produces carbon dioxide gas, increasing pressure in the canister until the lid pops off and the canister launches a few meters into the air (tinyurl.com/nzsgfoe). Increasing gas pressure in the canister is analogous to gas pressure building within a magma reservoir beneath a volcano. The lid represents high-viscosity magma that prevents degassing, causing gas pressure to reach explosive levels. This interactive activity is combined with a display of an effusive eruption: add vinegar to baking soda in a model volcano to produce a quick-flowing eruption.\nThese demonstrations were implemented in March 2014 at “Can You Dig It?”, a popular annual collaborative outreach event hosted by the Florida Museum of Natural History and the University of Florida Department of Geological Sciences (>1,500 visitors). These experiments were also used to illustrate volcanic processes at the VGP Exploration Station, AGU 2013.",

This method relies on photosynthesis and respiration having distinct isotopic signatures, which they generally do because the photosynthetic signature varies hourly (e.g. with light availability), whereas the respiratory signature is governed mostly by soil substrate composition and so varies only daily or weekly. Since 2011, we have been measuring the isotopic composition of NEE in a temperate deciduous forest by eddy covariance, using a quantum cascade laser spectrometer. Previously presented isotopic partitioning of the 2011 growing season indicated that ecosystem photosynthesis became more efficient through the summer (with respect to light and water use) and that during the hot, dry period in July, daytime ecosystem respiration was more strongly limited by soil moisture than was nighttime respiration, leading standard non-isotopic partitioning to substantially overestimate daytime ecosystem respiration and hence photosynthesis. Here we extend our analysis to span the three-year period from 2011 through 2013, taking advantage of large inter-annual differences in the seasonal pattern of soil moisture at the forest to test the prediction that standard partitioning exaggerates daytime ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis under drought conditions, and to further explore the mechanisms behind the apparent increase in photosynthetic efficiency through the summer.",

            "abstract": "The initiation of moist convection, the timing when the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) first crosses the lifting condensation level (LCL), is often treated as one of the important indicators of further development of deep convection and widely used to analyze the land-atmosphere interaction in different conceptual frameworks. Besides the timing of moist convection, the convective available potential energy (CAPE), another important indicator representing the positive buoyancy of an air parcel, displays a unique set of dynamics during the development of moist convection and is worth further attention and study for the development of simplified models of moist convection. Here, we couple a simple mixed layer model with a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum model to investigate the evolution of various convective indicators such as ABL, LCL, level of free convection (LFC), level of neutral buoyancy (LNB), and CAPE. Our preliminary results indicate that the crossing of ABL/LCL can have asynchronous behavior. For example, atmosphere with earlier ABL/LCL crossing does not necessary has higher CAPE. One typical example is found in the dry soil advantage regime, where dryer soil favors earlier ABL/LCL crossing but induces lower CAPE due the dry-air entrainment from quick ABL growth that consequently quenches the buoyancy of convection.

            "abstract": "Observations of two or more wind components that resolve turbulent perturbations over large areas remain a challenge in the atmospheric boundary layer community. One successful approach to multi-component flow measurement in the engineering community is particle image velocimetry (PIV). This presentation will report on recent progress in the development and validation of two motion estimation algorithms that can be applied to aerosol backscatter imagery to provide two-component horizontal wind fields. The algorithms being developed and tested are a traditional cross-correlation method (i.e., Schols & Eloranta, JGR, 1992) and a new wavelet-based optical flow method (Dérian et al., NMTMA, 2013). These algorithms have been applied to imagery from the Raman-shifted Eye-safe Aerosol Lidar (REAL) collected in Dixon, California, in 2007 (as part of CHATS) and in Chico, California in 2013. The resulting 2-component winds were compared against the same from sonic anemometers and a Doppler lidar. Our results include new insights on the performance of the cross-correaltion algorithm and new experiences with wavelet-based optical flow. Animations of turbulent flow in the atmospheric surface layer over approximately 10-square km areas with 15 s frame update rates will be presented. (Vectors may be spaced as closely as every 10 m, but the spatial resolution is larger and dynamic and related to the availability of small scale aerosol features in the imagery.) In addition to flow visualizations, time-series and space-series comparisons of the wind components with those from sonic anemometer and Doppler lidar data will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of nitrate concentrations and δ15N and δ18O values in 450 surface-water samples from the Upper Illinois River Basin (UIRB) were combined with SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) modeling to study the influence of land use on nitrate sources, mixing, and transformation within the watershed. The samples were collected from the Illinois River and its tributaries, including effluent from Chicago’s largest wastewater treatment plant (WTP), October 2004 through October 2008. The isotopic and concentration measurements indicated that WTP effluent and agricultural drainage waters were the two principal nitrate endmembers within the UIRB. Isotopic compositions indicated the source of nitrate during the annual spring flushing event was mostly derived from agriculture. An apparent denitrification trend was identified from spring through fall in tributaries draining agricultural subbasins and those having mixed urban-agricultural land use. Mass balance indicated that the fraction of nitrate from the WTP effluent was as low as 5 % or less during the spring flush (March-May) and much larger during late summer and fall.\nA SWAT model was constructed to evaluate effects of land use, fertilizer applications, and WTP point source discharge by coupling hydrologic processes with nutrient cycling and plant growth. The UIRB SWAT model was calibrated and validated with flow and nitrate measurements: the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) ranged from 0.60 to 0.83 and the determination coefficient (R2) ranged from 0.59 to 0.87. To explore the influence of fertilizer input on basin nitrate transport, the calibrated model was used to evaluate impacts of spring and fall fertilizer applications on stream nitrate loads. Simulations with a -50% change in the total fertilizer application rate (kg N/ha) resulted in as much as -42% change in basin nitrate export (kg N/month), while causing only -9% or less change in corn yield (kg N/ha). Decreased fertilizer application also led to reductions of annual basin N percolation rate below the root zone (kg N/ha) and nitrate loading to surface runoff (kg N/ha), causing changes as much as -32.2% and -15.6% respectively.\nCombined modeling and isotopic studies can be useful for understanding nutrient mixing and transformation processes and for optimizing nutrient export reduction strategies.",

Sulfur and BC mass concentration ranged 0.99 - 7.39 µg/m3 and 0.70 - 3.09 µg/m3, respectively, while the PM2.5 mass concentration ranged 23 - 186 µg/m3. Maximum BC contribution to PM2.5 was 5.6%. Atmospheric PM2.5 concentrations were well above the 24 h WHO guideline of 20 µg/m3. Air Quality Index (AQI) indicates that there were 8% days of moderate air quality, 28% days of unhealthy air quality for sensitive groups, 55% days of unhealthy air quality, and 9% days of very unhealthy air quality during the study period. Sulfate SO42- dominated the identifiable components. The major contributors to PM2.5 were soil and crustal material; vehicle emissions (black carbon factor); and fuel oil combustion in industries (sulfur factor), according to the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). This study highlights the importance of focusing control strategies not only on reducing PM concentration, but also on the reduction of toxic components of the PM, to most effectively protect human health and the environment.",

            "abstract": "Landslides are a global natural hazard, resulting in severe economic, environmental and social impacts every year. Often, landslides occur in areas of repeated slope instability, but despite these trends, significant residential developments and critical infrastructure are built in the shadow of past landslide deposits and marginally stable slopes. These hazards, despite their sometimes enormous scale and regional propensity, however, are difficult to detect on the ground, often due to vegetative cover. However, new developments in remote sensing technology, specifically Light Detection and Ranging mapping (LiDAR) are providing a new means of viewing our landscape. Airborne LiDAR, combined with a level of post-processing, enable the creation of spatial data representative of the earth beneath the vegetation, highlighting the scars of unstable slopes of the past. This tool presents a revolutionary technique to mapping landslide deposits and their associated regions of risk; yet, their inventorying is often done manually, an approach that can be tedious, time-consuming and subjective. However, the associated LiDAR bare earth data present the opportunity to use this remote sensing technology and typical landslide geometry to create an automated algorithm that can detect and inventory deposits on a landscape scale. This algorithm, called the Contour Connection Method (CCM), functions by first detecting steep gradients, often associated with the headscarp of a failed hillslope, and initiating a search, highlighting deposits downslope of the failure. Based on input of search gradients, CCM can assist in highlighting regions identified as landslides consistently on a landscape scale, capable of mapping more than 14,000 hectares rapidly (<30 minutes). CCM has shown preliminary agreement with manual landslide inventorying in Oregon’s Coast Range, realizing almost 90% agreement with inventorying performed by a trained geologist. The global threat of landslides necessitates new and effective tools for inventorying regions of risk to protect people, infrastructure and the environment from landslide hazards. Use of the CCM algorithm combined with judgment and rapidly developing remote sensing technology may help better define these regions of risk.",

            "abstract": "Yellowstone hosts a voluminous magmatic system that produced three silicic caldera-forming eruptions over the past 2.1 My. Following the most recent of these (the Lava Creek Tuff at 639 ka), the magma system at Yellowstone underwent two episodes of intracaldera eruptions, the latest of which produced the Central Plateau Member (CPM) rhyolites. The CPM rhyolites erupted intermittently from ca. 170 ka to ca. 70 ka and can be viewed as snapshots of the magma system through time, which provides a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of an evolving caldera system. To constrain the nature and timescales of magmatic processes at Yellowstone we examine four CPM rhyolites that erupted from ca. 116 ka to ca. 74 ka and present a comprehensive data set that integrates (1) 238U-230Th ages, trace-elements, and Hf isotope compositions of the surfaces and interiors of single zircons, (2) bulk 238U-230Th ages and in situ Ba and Pb isotope compositions of sanidines, (3) sanidine 40Ar-39Ar ages, and (4) trace-element and isotopic compositions of the CPM glasses. Zircon 238U-230Th ages and Hf isotope data demonstrate that isotopically juvenile magmas, derived from Yellowstone basalts, were added to the Yellowstone magma reservoir over time and were fundamental to its post-caldera isotopic evolution. We use zircon Hf isotope data along with new Hf isotope data (and existing O isotope data) for the Yellowstone basalts (whole-rocks), older Yellowstone rhyolites (glasses), and local crustal sources to quantify the role of isotopically juvenile magma in the evolution of the magmatic system. Additionally, linking age, trace-element, and isotopic data from zircon and sanidine demonstrates that eruptible CPM rhyolites were generated by extracting melt and antecrystic zircon from a long-lived (>200 ky) crystal mush, while sanidine remained trapped in the crystal network. The extracted melts amalgamated and then crystallized new sanidines and rims on the antecrystic zircons that were in equilibrium with their host melt. In this model, the ages of the zircon surfaces and sanidines constrain the residence times of the eruptible magma bodies to < 9 ky. This study highlights how detailed investigations linking the age and composition of minerals hosted in rhyolites can provide information on the dynamics of magmatic processes at a variety of scales.",

            "abstract": "An investigation is underway to determine elemental compounds of African Soils. Soil samples were taken from four territories in the Sahel and Saharan region of Africa and analyzed using Computer Controlled Scanning Electron Microscopy (CCSEM). Optimized secondary electron detectors (SED) and back-scattered electron detectors (BSED) with adjustable quadrants was used with a light element Peltier-cooled energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer. A variable pressure system was used for the analysis of insulating materials, which eliminated the need for special specimen coating to dissipate charge and remove artifacts. Data from these samples are being used to address two primary questions: (1) Can CCSEM technology accurately describe elemental compounds derived from soil samples, and (2) is there a correlation between particle chemistry and size? The creation of a 29-point elemental classification system was used to separate and analyze each of the data points. Findings show large amounts of Fe, Si, and Al-rich minerals in all samples, but vary in percentages by amounts large enough to distinguish between sample regions. Other elemental constituents within the samples include varying amounts of Na, S, Ti, Ca, and K. An initial run of samples show a similarity in chemical composition, leading to the hypothesis that Aeolian processes are contributing to the mineral content of surface dusts, but are still distinguishable from region to region. Further research on the effects of these wind driven dusts is needed to assess the potential problematic deposited in the Atlantic Ocean, which can cause overpressures within the sediments on slopes.",

Among the most important characteristics that distinguish fallers from risers are: large angles of propagation and usually lower maximum amplitudes. These characteristics make fallers more difficult to simulate numerically than risers. Recently, we have developed a new model that successfully accounts for fallers. The model proposes that fallers start as a marginally unstable mode, which requires a balance between growth and damping, attributable to the Landau damping of oblique waves in this collisionless environment. The extension of the theory to risers will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Recent work suggests that summer rainfall in the Indian and East Asian monsoons results from different mechanisms. The onset of intense convection in India is mediated by Hadley Cell transitions, whereas frontal rainfall in China (most notably during Meiyu season in June) arises from forced meridional convergence and zonal heat transport in the wake of the Tibetan Plateau. However, the leading mode of July-August interannual rainfall variability for All-Asia (defined as the region within 68E-140E and 5N-45N) demonstrates a statistically significant coupling between monthly anomalies in India and China. In particular, positive anomalies along the Himalayan Foothills are associated with positive anomalies along the Yangtze River, and also with negative anomalies over central India and northern and southern China. The entire pattern reverses in dry years over the Himalayan Foothills. This coupling is not significantly correlated with ENSO, the leading mode of global interannual variability. We propose that a channel of moisture transport links the Bay of Bengal to the Yangtze River valley across the high terrain of the Yunnan Plateau, on the southeast edge of the Tibetan Plateau. This channel only activates in July, when the maximum of moist static energy (MSE) shifts to land, and weakens in September with the cooling of Bay of Bengal SST. Our mechanism is substantiated by analysis of output from the LMDZ5 model, which includes a high-resolution nested grid nudged to reanalysis, improving the simulation of the Indian Monsoon and performance near high topography. Potential changes in moisture transport across the Yunnan Plateau under 21st century warming conditions may lead to modified interannual variability of Asian rainfall.",

            "abstract": "Constructive epistemic modeling is the idea that our understanding of a natural system through a scientific model is a mental construct that continually develops through learning about and from the model. Using the hierarchical Bayesian model averaging (HBMA) method [1], this study shows that segregating different uncertain model components through a BMA tree of posterior model probabilities, model prediction, within-model variance, between-model variance and total model variance serves as a learning tool [2]. First, the BMA tree of posterior model probabilities permits the comparative evaluation of the candidate propositions of each uncertain model component. Second, systemic model dissection is imperative for understanding the individual contribution of each uncertain model component to the model prediction and variance. Third, the hierarchical representation of the between-model variance facilitates the prioritization of the contribution of each uncertain model component to the overall model uncertainty. We illustrate these concepts using the groundwater modeling of a siliciclastic aquifer-fault system. The sources of uncertainty considered are from geological architecture, formation dip, boundary conditions and model parameters. The study shows that the HBMA analysis helps in advancing knowledge about the model rather than forcing the model to fit a particularly understanding or merely averaging several candidate models.\n[1] Tsai, F.

            "abstract": "The influence of catchment structure on hydrologic processes controlling the transit time distribution (TTD) of water and solutes through watersheds is still not well understood. However, recent advances in time-variable transit time theory offer a new framework that decomposes controls on a catchment’s TTD into a part that is dependent on the time variability of flow and water balance partitioning, and a part that depends on the way water of different ages is sampled by the streamflow. Age-sampling is characterized using a probability density function over the storage ranked by age, herein referred to as an Ω function. The form of the Ω function at the catchment scale is hypothesized to be controlled by hydrological processes operating at that scale and by the integration of processes from smaller-scale units as dictated by the catchment’s structure.\nHere stable water isotope samples and water parameters including conductivity and fDOM are measured at six sampling locations within a 383 ha watershed of the Piedmont Physiographic Province (the outlet, two forested watersheds, one suburban watershed, and two springs). Analysis of the hydrology and the Ω function estimated at each spatial scale is used to understand the controls of variability in hydrologic inputs and outputs, the partitioning of outputs, and the heterogeneity of flow pathways. These three sources of variability are then examined within the context of measured water chemistry parameters to further elucidate hydrologic processes across scales.\nIsotope data has been collected from each site at a range of sampling intervals from minutes during a storm event to weekly over a period of months to parameterize Ω functions over a range of time scales. Precipitation and stream samples from the 383 ha and two forested watersheds have been collected weekly since January 2014, while weekly sampling began at the other three sites in August 2014. Twelve-hourly isotope samples have been collected at each sampling location for several one-week periods along with hourly and event data. Initial results reveal clear differences in the processes controlling the forested and suburban watersheds and suggest different transport dynamics operate under high and low catchment wetness conditions.",

            "abstract": "Is liquid water flowing near the surface of Mars today? If recurring slope lineae (RSL) on Mars are effectively ephemeral trickles of water, consistent with observational evidence, where is this water coming from, what is its volume, what is its salinity, is it flowing on the surface or just beneath, and when does it flow during the course of the day? Without an in situ or hovering platform or new orbital instruments, these questions cannot be answered directly, but quantification of RSL behavior seen by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter coupled with physical modeling can be leveraged to infer answers. As a first step, we are mapping all 100+ lineae in Tivat crater (45.93° S, 9.53° E, in Noachis Terra) across 14 images spanning three active seasons (Mars Years 29-31) at the ~25 cm pixel scale of the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE). We are simultaneously quantifying these RSL and their evolution using a suite of measurements including length, area, sinuosity, concavity index, etc. By tracking each linea across each season, we are capturing the “life cycle” of each flow rather than merely the general evolution of the population, as has been the focus of previous studies. It is this life cycle, and its variability, that physical models must reproduce. Because so little is known about RSL, we are careful in our analyses to manage the bias caused by assuming a specific mechanism. For example, observed gaps in dark lineae could be interpreted as either separating distinct, aligned surface flows or merely reflecting a patchy expression of a single continuous subsurface flow, so we allow for both interpretations.\nPreliminary results at Tivat suggest that RSL decelerate over the course of each season, and that the concavity of crater slopes is only a secondary factor in this deceleration. RSL also do not always appear to flow strictly down-gradient, but may be controlled by topography below the resolution of HiRISE terrain models. There may also be a change in the rate of downslope propagation across the season, which would have implications for the source of the water and/or the nature of the coupling of RSL activity to temperature. We will extend our study to other key sites.",

Summer 2014 saw a flurry of activities with airborne hyperspectral data acquisition by NASA's G-LiHT and CARVE teams, USGS spectroscopy group (with HyMap sensors) and private companies. These missions will provide valuable baseline data for research in Alaska, but may not be able to allow for multiple intra-annual or inter-annual observations.

Here we present coupled tectonic-surface processes modeling of extensional basin formation. The main aim is to find out how erosion and deposition affect the deformation in extensional systems. We test sensitivity of the rift mode to the combined effects of crustal rheology and varying surface process efficiency. The results show that both erosion of rift flank areas and basin deposition enhance localization of crustal deformation. Frictional-plastic shear zones accumulate more deformation during a longer period of time, and time of lithospheric rupture is delayed when fluvial erosion, transport and deposition are efficient. We show that removal of mass from rift flanks and sedimentary loading in the basin area are the main cause of the feedbacks providing a first order control on the style of extensional basin formation.",

Similar to seismic hazard zonation, these products for land-use and development decision-making are typically based on a probabilistic analysis, and require information on the frequency of occurrence through a probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis (PTHA). In Phase 1 of CGS’s work, the California PTHA Work Group was established to evaluate the results of PTHA demonstration projects in Crescent City and Huntington Beach. The results of this Phase 1 review of the two independent analyses indicate PTHA’s can be developed with recommended improvements in source characterization, PTHA methods, and numerical model use. An immediate significant improvement is to align the characterization of the Cascadia Subduction Zone PTHA with the seismic characterization of the National Seismic Hazard Map Program of the USGS. In addition to applying PTHA to land-use planning and the two demonstration projects, CGS and the CA-PTHA Work Group identified other potential applications for various PTHA risk levels (ARP = Average Return Period), including flood insurance (100 and 500 year ARP), building codes (2,500 year ARP), and emergency response planning (1000 year ARP or larger). CGS is working with URS Corp., the California Office of Emergency Services, and FEMA on a Phase 2 plan to produce a single set of reliable and consistent PTHA maps for multiple risk levels and work with various end-users to determine how to use the maps. The California PTHA and the results of the Work Group review are also proposed to be used by the U.S. National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program to develop guidelines for production in other coastal states.",

CRMs are computationally demanding, placing practical constraints on their use in these applications, especially for long, climate-relevant simulations.\nIn many situations, the horizontal-mean atmospheric structure evolves slowly compared to the turnover time of the most energetic turbulent eddies. We use this time scale separation to accelerate the time-integration of a CRM, the System for Atmospheric Modelling. Our approach uses a large time step to evolve the horizontally averaged state variables, followed by a short time step to calculate the turbulent fluctuations about the mean state. Using this approach, we are able to accelerate the model evolution by a factor of 8 or more in idealized stratocumulus, shallow and deep cumulus convection without substantial loss of accuracy in simulating mean cloud statistics and their sensitivity to climate change perturbations. We show how to adapt the approach to challenges arising from rapidly falling precipitation and from advecting scalars with a variety of lifetimes.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing is a fast and safe method to obtain gas abundances in volcanic plumes, in particular when the access to the vent is difficult or during volcanic crisis. In recent years, a ground-based infrared camera (NicAir) has been developed by Nicarnica Aviation, which quantifies SO2 and ash on volcanic plumes, based on the infrared radiance at specific wavelengths through the application of filters.\nNicAir cameras have been acquired by the Geological Survey of Chile in order to study degassing of active volcanoes. This contribution focuses on series of measurements done in December 2013 in volcanoes of northern Chile, in particular Láscar, Irruputuncu and Ollagüe, which are characterized by persistent quiescent degassing. During fieldwork, plumes from all three volcanoes showed regular behavior and the atmospheric conditions were very favorable (cloud-free and dry air).\nFour, two and one sets of measurements, up to 100 images each, were taken for Láscar, Irruputuncu and Ollagüe volcano, respectively. Matlab software was used for image visualizing and processing of the raw data. For instance, data visualization is performed through Matlab IPT functions imshow() and imcontrast(), and one algorithm was created for extracting necessary metadata. Image processing considers radiation at 8.6 and 10 µm wavelengths, due to differential SO2 and water vapor absorption. Calibration was performed in the laboratory through a detector correlation between digital numbers (raw data in image pixel values) and spectral radiance, and also in the field considering the camera self-emissions of infrared radiation.\nA gradient between the plume core and plume rim is expected, due to quick reaction of sulphur dioxide with water vapor, therefore a flux underestimate is also expected. Results will be compared with other SO2 remote sensing instruments such as DOAS and UV-camera.\nThe implementation of this novel technique in Chilean volcanoes will be a major advance in our understanding of volcanic emissions and is also a strong complement for gas monitoring in active volcanoes such as Láscar, Villarrica, Lastarria, Cordón Caulle, among others and in rough volcanic terrains, due to its portability, easy operation, fast data acquisition and data processing.",

            "abstract": "Environmental sensor networks have been deployed in a variety of contexts to monitor plant, air, water and soil properties. To date, there have been relatively few such networks deployed to monitor dynamic soil properties in cropped fields. Here we report on experience with a distributed soil sensor network that has been deployed for seven years in a research farm with ongoing agronomic field operations. The Washington State University R. J. Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF), Pullman, WA, USA has recently been designated a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Long-Term Agro-Ecosystem Research (LTAR) site. In 2007, 12 geo-referenced locations at CAF were instrumented, then in 2009 this network was expended to 42 locations distributed across the 37-ha farm. At each of this locations, Decagon 5TE probes (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) were installed at five depths (30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 cm), with temperature and volumetric soil moisture content recorded hourly. Initially, data loggers were wirelessly connected to a data station that could be accessed through a cell connection, but due to the logistics of agronomic field operations, we later buried the dataloggers at each site and now periodically download data via local radio transmission. In this presentation, we share our experience with the installation, maintenance, calibration and data processing associated with an agronomic soil monitoring network. We also present highlights of data derived from this network, including seasonal fluctuations of soil temperature and volumetric water content at each depth, and how these measurements are influenced by crop type, soil properties, landscape position, and precipitation events.",

            "abstract": "Based upon the high pressure melting temperatures in the Fe-FeS system, an iron “snow” process has been suggested to occur in Mercury’s core. However, recent results from the MESSENGER mission indicate very reducing conditions in Mercury, under which a substantial amount of silicon should also dissolve into the core. The presence of Si can significantly modify the chemical and physical properties of Mercury’s core (e.g., phase relations, crystallization, density). Moreover, up to 4 wt% C could have been incorporated into the core during the planet formation. In order to test the iron snow hypothesis in a system that is likely to be closer to the actual core composition, we performed in situ high-pressure, high-temperature experiments in the Fe-FeS-Fe2Si-Fe3C system using a multi-anvil press on a synchrotron (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne). To observe low degree eutectic melting, we separated the samples in two parts: (1) an iron rod presaturated with Si and C and (2) a mixture of FeS, Fe2Si and Fe3C. Eutectic melting temperature and phase relations were determined at various pressures between 4.5 and 15.5 GPa using energy dispersive X-ray diffraction and imaging. Temperature was quenched soon after melting in order to preserve the eutectic melt composition. The X-ray images, diffraction spectra and back-scattered electron images of the recovered samples show that eutectic melting occurs in the range of 800 - 900°C in all our experiments. These temperatures are close to the eutectic temperatures in the Fe-FeS-Fe3C system, indicating that Si does not change the eutectic temperatures significantly. Melting therefore occurs at much lower temperature than suggested for the Fe-S-Si system at similar pressures. This difference may be explained by the presence of C and by the higher silicon content in our starting composition. Our experimental setup may also be more suitable for detecting the low degrees of melting in metallic systems. Such low eutectic melting temperatures imply that the iron “snow” process may still be valid even if silicon and carbon are present in Mercury’s core.",

They are the Hawaiian style Kīlauea Iki eruption, 1959, and the subplinian Keanakāko‘i eruption, 1650 CE. We have modeled combined magma ascent in the volcanic conduit and exsolution of H2O and CO2 from the erupting magma. To better assess the relative roles of conduit processes and magma chamber, we also coupled conduit flow and magma chamber through mass balance and pressure. We predict magma discharge rates, superficial gas velocities, H2O and CO2 concentrations of the melt, magma chamber pressure, surface deformation, and height of the volcanic jet. Models are in part constrained by H2O and CO2 measured in olivine-hosted melt inclusions and by decompression rates recorded in melt embayment diffusion profiles. We present a parametric analysis, indicating that the pressure within the chamber that fed the subplinian Keanakāko‘i eruption was significantly higher than lithostatic pressure. In contrast, chamber pressure for the Hawaiian Kīlauea Iki eruption was close to lithostatic. In both cases the superficial gas velocity, which affects the geometrical distribution of gas-liquid mixtures during upward flow in conduits, may have exceeded values at which bubble coalescence did not affect the flow.",

            "abstract": "Over the last half century, the green revolution has transformed India from a famine-prone, drought-susceptible country, into the world’s third largest grain producer and one of the most intensely irrigated regions on the planet. This is in no small part due to the country's vast water resources along with an increase in tubewells and more advanced abstraction methods. While agricultural intensification has had undeniable benefits, it has, and continues to have a significant impact on water resources. Unless solutions which take into consideration the ever evolving socio-economic, hydrological and climatic conditions are found, India's agricultural future looks bleak.\nThis research examines the irrigation behaviour of farmers, using data collected during field work in the State of Uttar Pradesh within the Ganges Basin of North India. Significant differences in farmer behaviour and irrigation practices are highlighted, not only between State districts but between individual farmers. This includes the volume of irrigation water applied and the price paid, as well as differences in the yields of crops produced. Analyses of results suggest that this is due to a number of factors, particularly the source of irrigation water. Study areas which had access to cheaper, but crucially less reliable, canal water were found to invest in more efficient water saving technologies in order to reduce the overall cost of irrigation during periods where less expensive canal water is not available. As a result, overall water use and irrigation cost is lower and yields are higher despite very similar climatic conditions. While cheap canal water is not an option for all farmers, the results show that the introduction of more efficient water saving technologies, despite the significant capital expenditure is a viable option for many farmers and costs can be recovered in a relatively short space of time. In addition, the reduction of declining water levels mean that water is abstracted from a shallower depths, resulting in an extra cost saving.\nThe impacts and practicalities of introducing more water efficient technologies are discussed and their potential impact on water resources and farmer livelihoods, pointing the way to a realistic and more sustainable balance between agriculture and sustainable water resources in the future.

            "abstract": "Efforts to advance current satellite aerosol retrieval capabilities have mostly focused on polarimetric techniques. While there has been much interest in recent decades in the use of the oxygen A-band for retrievals of cloud height or surface pressure, these techniques are mostly based on A-band measurements with relatively low spectral resolution. We report here on a new aerosol retrieval technique based on high-resolution A-band spectra. Our goal is the development of a technique to retrieve aerosol absorption, one of the critical parameters affecting the global radiation budget and one which is currently poorly constrained by satellite measurements. Our approach relies on two key factors: 1) the use of high spectral resolution measurements which resolve the A-band line structure, and 2) the use of co-located lidar profile measurements to constrain the vertical distribution of scatterers.\nThe OCO-2 satellite, launched in July this year and now flying in formation with the CALIPSO satellite, carries an oxygen A-band spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 21,000:1. This is sufficient to resolve the A-band line structure, which contains information on atmospheric photon path lengths. Combining channels with oxygen absorption ranging from weak to strong allows the separation of atmospheric and surface scattering. An optimal estimation algorithm for simultaneous retrieval of aerosol optical depth, aerosol absorption, and surface albedo has been developed. Lidar profile data is used for scene identification and to provide constraints on the vertical distribution of scatterers. As calibrated OCO-2 data is not expected until the end of this year, the algorithm has been developed and tested using simulated OCO-2 spectra. The simulations show that AOD and surface albedo can be retrieved with high accuracy. Retrievals of aerosol single scatter albedo are encouraging, showing good performance when AOD is larger than about 0.15. Retrieval performance improves as the albedo of the underlying surface increases. Thus, the technique shows great promise for retrieving the absorption optical depth of aerosols located above clouds. This presentation will discuss the basis of the approach and results of the A-band/lidar retrievals based on simulated data.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol-cloud interactions constitute the highest uncertainties in forcing estimation. Especially uncertainties due to mixed clouds (MPCs) have a large impact on the radiative balance and precipitation prediction. Due to Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen-process (WBF) which describes glaciation of MPCs due to the lower saturation over ice than over water, MPCs are mostly expected as short lived clouds. In contrast to the theory of the WBF, in-situ measurements have shown that MPCs can persist over longer time. But only a small number of measurements of MPCs is available. In addition modeling studies about MPCs are difficult as their processes of the three-phase-system are on the micro scale and therefore not resolved in models. \nWe present measurements obtained at the high-altitude research station Jungfraujoch (JFJ, 3580 m asl) in the Swiss Alps partly taken during the CLoud-Aerosol Interaction Experiments (CLACE). During the winter season, the JFJ has a high frequency of super-cooled clouds and is considered representative for being in the free troposphere. In-situ measurements of the microstructure of MPCs have been obtained with the digital imager HOLIMO, that delivers phase-resolved size distributions, concentrations, and water contents. The data set of MPCs at JFJ shows that for northerly wind cases partially-glaciated MPCs are more frequently observed than for southerly wind cases. The higher frequency of these intermediate states of MPCs suggests either higher updraft velocities, and therefore higher water-vapor supersaturations, or the absence of sufficiently high IN concentrations to quickly glaciate the MPC. \nBecause of the limitation of in-situ information, i.e. point measurements and missing measurements of vertical velocities at JFJ, the mechanism of the long persistence of MPCs cannot be fully understood. Therefore, in addition to measurements we will investigate the JFJ region with a model study with the non-hydrostatic model COSMO-ART-M7. Combination of km-scale simulation with measurements allows to systematically study the effect of vertical velocity and temperatures on MPCs at JFJ, the synoptic conditions, origins of air masses, aerosol and IN concentrations. Comparison between in-situ measurements will also help to improve parametrization of microphysical processes in the model. ",

We used ground based thermal infrared (TIR) imaging combined with Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry to produce high-resolution (cm scale) DEMs over which images of ground temperature and radiant hydrothermal heat flux were draped. We apply this methodology to two hydrothermal areas (Mammoth Mountain and South Side fumaroles) on Mammoth Mountain, CA, allowing us to image the detailed topography, map the thermal features at each area and assess the spatial relationships between the two efficiently and at high resolution. Mammoth Mountain is a lava-dome complex located on the southwestern rim of Long Valley caldera, CA. Unrest at Mammoth Mountain is currently manifested by seismic swarms, ground deformation, elevated 3He/4He ratios in gases at the Mammoth Mountain fumarole, and large changes in diffuse magmatic CO2 emissions from the five tree kill areas on the volcano flanks.\nWe augment the extensive dataset collected at this site over the previous decades by quantifying ground temperatures and hydrothermal heat fluxes at the Mammoth Mountain and South Side fumarole sites. This was accomplished using a hand-held FLIR T650sc camera that simultaneously acquires visible and TIR images of the study site. Daytime and nighttime co-located visible and TIR images were acquired over each study area, and image processing was used to orthorectify and mosaic visible and TIR images, calculate radiant hydrothermal heat fluxes, construct 3D imagery of ground surface, overlay maps of ground temperatures and heat fluxes, and establish spatial relationships between topography and heat flow.",

            "abstract": "A one-dimensional variational retrieval system has been developed, capable of producing temperature and water vapor profiles in clear, cloudy and precipitating conditions. The algorithm, known as the Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MiRS), is currently running operationally at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS), and is applied to a variety of data from the AMSU-A/MHS sensors on board the NOAA-18, NOAA-19, and MetOp-A/B polar satellite platforms, as well as SSMI/S on board both DMSP F-16 and F18, and from the NPP ATMS sensor. MiRS inverts microwave brightness temperatures into atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles, along with hydrometeors and surface parameters, simultaneously. This atmosphere/surface coupled inversion allows for more accurate retrievals in the lower tropospheric layers by accounting for the surface emissivity impact on the measurements. It also allows the inversion of the soundings in all-weather conditions thanks to the incorporation of the hydrometeors parameters in the inverted state vector as well as to the inclusion of the emissivity in the same state vector, which is accounted for dynamically for the highly variable surface conditions found under precipitating atmospheres. The inversion is constrained in precipitating conditions by the inclusion of covariances for hydrometeors, to take advantage of the natural correlations that exist between temperature and water vapor with liquid and ice cloud along with rain water. In this study, we present a full assessment of temperature and water vapor retrieval performances in all-weather conditions and over all surface types (ocean, sea-ice, land, and snow) using matchups with radiosonde as well as Numerical Weather Prediction and other satellite retrieval algorithms as references. An emphasis is placed on retrievals in cloudy and precipitating atmospheres, including extreme weather events, to assess the quality of soundings in these conditions. We will also assess the potential added value of considering the coupled inversion approach.",

This agrees with the results of a recent study of magnetopause exhausts, and suggests that similar core electron heating can occur in both symmetric (solar wind) and asymmetric (magnetopause) exhausts.",

            "abstract": "Fluid-pressure assisted fracturing can produce mesh and other large, interconnected and complex networks consisting of both extension and shear fractures in various metamorphic, magmatic and tectonic systems. Presently, rock failure criteria for tensile and low-mean compressive stress conditions is poorly defined, although there is accumulating evidence that the transition from extension to shear fracture with increasing mean stress is continuous. We report on the results of experiments designed to document failure criteria, fracture mode, and localization phenomena for several rock types (sandstone, limestone, chalk and marble). Experiments were conducted in triaxial extension using a necked (dogbone) geometry to achieve mixed tension and compression stress states with local component-strain measurements in the failure region.\nThe failure envelope for all rock types is similar, but are poorly described using Griffith or modified Griffith (Coulomb or other) failure criteria. Notably, the mode of fracture changes systematically from pure extension to shear with increase in compressive mean stress and display a continuous change in fracture orientation with respect to principal stress axes. Differential stress and inelastic strain show a systematic increase with increasing mean stress, whereas the axial stress decreases before increasing with increasing mean stress. The stress and strain data are used to analyze elastic and plastic strains leading to failure and compare the experimental results to predictions for localization using constitutive models incorporating on bifurcation theory. Although models are able to describe the stability behavior and onset of localization qualitatively, the models are unable to predict fracture type or orientation. Constitutive models using single or multiple yield surfaces are unable to predict the experimental results, reflecting the difficulty in capturing the changing micromechanisms from extension to shear failure.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Deopartment of Energy’s National Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.\nSAND2014-16578A",

            "abstract": "Huge online databases can be 'mined' to reveal previously hidden trends and relationships in society. One could argue that sedimentary geology has entered a similar era of 'Big Data', as modern provenance studies routinely apply multiple proxies to dozens of samples. Just like the Internet, sedimentary geology now requires specialised statistical tools to interpret such large datasets. These can be organised on three levels of progressively higher order:\nA single sample: The most effective way to reveal the provenance information contained in a representative sample of detrital zircon U-Pb ages are probability density estimators such as histograms and kernel density estimates. The widely popular 'probability density plots' implemented in IsoPlot and AgeDisplay compound analytical uncertainty with geological scatter and are therefore invalid.\nSeveral samples: Multi-panel diagrams comprising many detrital age distributions or compositional pie charts quickly become unwieldy and uninterpretable. For example, if there are N samples in a study, then the number of pairwise comparisons between samples increases quadratically as N(N-1)/2. This is simply too much information for the human eye to process. To solve this problem, it is necessary to (a) express the 'distance' between two samples as a simple scalar and (b) combine all N(N-1)/2 such values in a single two-dimensional 'map', grouping similar and pulling apart dissimilar samples. This can be easily achieved using simple statistics-based dissimilarity measures and a standard statistical method called Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).\nSeveral methods: Suppose that we use four provenance proxies: bulk petrography, chemistry, heavy minerals and detrital geochronology. This will result in four MDS maps, each of which likely show slightly different trends and patterns. To deal with such cases, it may be useful to use a related technique called 'three way multidimensional scaling'. This results in two graphical outputs: an MDS map, and a map with 'weights' showing to what extent the different provenance proxies influence the horizontal and vertical axis of the MDS map. Thus, detrital data can not only inform the user about the provenance of sediments, but also about the causal relationships between the mineralogy, geochronology and chemistry.",

            "abstract": "The ocean compositions of icy Galilean satellites Europa and Ganymede are highly uncertain. Spectral observations of the satellites' surfaces provide clues for the interior composition. Putative sulfate hydration features in Galileo near-infrared reflectance spectra suggest fractionation of Na and Mg sulfates from a subsurface reservoir (McCord et al. 1998, Sci. 278, 271; McCord et al. 1998, Sci. 280, 1242; Dalton et al. 2005, Icarus, 177, 472). Recent spatially resolved spectral mapping of Europa hints at possible partitioning of near-surface brines in Europa's low-lying planes (Shirley et al. 2010; Icarus, 210, 358; Dalton et al. 2012; J. Geophys. Res. 117, E03003). Surface materials can be modified by the delivery of material from impacts and Io's active volcanoes as well as intense irradiation from Jupiter's magnetic field interaction with the jovian magnetosphere. These factors, combined with observations of high Cl/K ratios in Europa's exosphere, have led other investigators to suggest that Europa's ocean is dominated by dissolved chloride rather than sulfate (Brown and Hand 2013; Astr. J. 145, 110). There is still much uncertainty regarding how well the surface composition approximates the interior ocean composition. Exogenic materials, seafloor hydrothermal processes, and fractional crystallization during ice formation will determine the abundances of species in the ocean and by extension those present on Europa's surface.\nWe develop a bottom-up model for oceans on Europa and Ganymede, assuming initial compositions of chondritic and cometary materials including an Fe core for Europa and an Fe-FeS eutectic core for Ganymede. We calculate an ocean composition by employing a Bulk Silicate Earth approach, also used by Zolotov and Shock (2001; J. Geophys. Res. 106, 32815) at Europa, which assess element partitioning between the rocky mantle, Fe-rich core, and water ocean. Partitioning factors are based on terrestrial estimates for Earth. The resulting ocean composition is used to assess solid precipitation into the ocean and ice shell using FREZCHEM modeling software (Marion et al. 2010; Icarus, 207, 675). These results are then compared with measured compositions of brines on Europa's surface. We develop the model in a way that permits ready application to other icy satellites, such as Titan or Enceladus.",

            "abstract": "Hydration of neutral and ionic species on solid interfaces plays an important role in a wide range of natural and engineered processes within energy systems as well as biological and environmental systems. Various chemical reactions are significantly enhanced, both in the rate and the extent of the reaction, because of water molecules present or absent at the interface. A novel technology for carbon dioxide capture, driven by the free energy difference between more or less hydrated states of an anionic exchange resin is studied for a new approach to absorb CO2 from ambient air. For these materials the affinity to CO2 is dramatically lowered as the availability of water is increased. This makes it possible to absorb CO2 from air in a dry environment and release it at two orders of magnitude larger partial pressures in a wet environment. While the absorption process and the thermodynamic properties of air capture via ion exchange resins have been demonstrated, the underlying physical mechanisms remain to be understood. In order to rationally design better sorbent materials, the present work elucidates through molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical modeling the energy changes in the carbonate, bicarbonate and hydroxide ions that are induced by hydration, and how these changes affect sorbent properties.\nA methodology is developed to determine the free energy change during carbonate ion hydrolysis changes with different numbers of water molecules present. This makes it possible to calculate the equilibrium in the reaction\nCO3--∙nH2O ↔ HCO3- ∙ m1H2O + OH- ∙ m2H2O + (n – 1 – m1 – m2)H2O\nMolecular dynamics models are used to calculate free energies of hydration for the CO32- ion, the HCO3- ion, and the OH- ion as function of the amount of water that is present. A quantum mechanical model is employed to study the equilibrium of the reaction\nNa2CO3 + H2O ↔ NaHCO3 + NaOH\nin a vacuum and at room temperature. The computational analysis of the free energy of hydration reveals that in an ionic exchange resin the equilibrium between carbonate, bicarbonate and hydroxide favors a combination of bicarbonate and hydroxide over the formation of carbonate ions. In the case of low water content, the presence of a large number of hydroxide ions increases the affinity of the resin to CO2.",

            "abstract": "The stable nitrogen (N) isotopic (δ15N) signature of marine sedimentary N (δ15Nbulk) is commonly applied as a proxy for the δ15N of sinking particulate organic matter (δ15NPOMsink), and by extension the δ15N of marine primary production. Although a general correspondence between the δ15Nbulk and δ15NPOMsink exists in shallow water, diagenesis or mixtures of N sources can affect this relationship. For instance, diagenesis δ15Nbulk enrichment as a function of water depth (Robinson et al., 2012), and terrestrial N sources can constitute a large portion of total sedimentary N near continental margins (Schubert & Calvert, 2001). Compound-specific amino acid analysis (δ15NAA) represents a new approach to address these issues. Proteins and peptides comprise the majority of N-containing molecules in living organisms; hence δ15NAA may be a direct proxy for organic N-δ15N (δ15NON). However, the relationship between δ15NAA data and major sedimentary N fractions has not been evaluated.\nWe analyzed δ15NAA and the δ15N composition of major operationally defined N fractions and their relative contribution to total N from marine POM and shallow sediments collected in Santa Barbara Basin (SBB). Fractions analyzed include bulk, acid-soluble (AS), acid-insoluble (AI), and total hydrolysable amino acid (THAA). Average sedimentary δ15NTHAA and δ15NAS are enriched relative to δ15Nbulk by 2.9‰ and 1.0‰, respectively and δ15NAI is depleted relative to δ15Nbulk by ~1.5‰. The δ15NAS and δ15NTHAA are closest to subsurface nitrate δ15N (~8‰) in SBB, consistent with a primary N source, while depleted δ15NAI values are consistent with a dominant terrestrial N source. Together, these findings help to characterize the mixture of ON compounds, including hydrolysable AA, found in fresh biomass and suggest that δ15NTHAA represents a valuable new molecular level proxy for sedimentary proteinaceous material, but requires calibration to reconstruct δ15N of source N.",

The properties of these events are tabulated in a recent publication in Solar Physics (Richardson, et al., 2014). One of the goals of the Stereo Mission is to better understand the propagation of SEPs. The properties of events observed by multiple spacecraft on average are well-organized by the distance of the footpoints of the nominal Parker Spiral magnetic field lines passing the observing spacecraft from the parent active regions. However, some events deviate significantly from this pattern. For example, in events observed by three spacecraft, the spacecraft with the best nominal connection does not necessarily observe the highest intensity or earliest particle arrival time. We will search for such events and try to relate their behavior to non-nominal magnetic field patterns. We will look, for example, for the effects of the interplanetary current sheet, the influence of magnetic clouds which are thought to contain large magnetic loops with both ends connected to the sun (a large departure from the Parker spiral), and also whether particle propagation can be disrupted by the presence of interplanetary shocks.\n",

            "abstract": "We present in situ and remotely sensed evidence for the following working hypothesis: Heterogeneous nucleation dominates during deep continental convection until ice nuclei in the updraft cannot prevent supersaturation from increasing. As it increases, homogeneous nucleation eventually occurs near cloud top (T < -60°C), with much faster ice crystal production rates. This is not the case in maritime anvil cirrus, where updrafts associated with deep convection are slower, promoting heterogeneous nucleation. We hypothesize that differences in updraft velocities and their effect on supersaturation might create a difference in the N/IWC ratios.\nBased on In situ measurements of the ice particle size distribution (PSD) from two aircraft field campaigns (SPARTICUS & TC4) and MODIS satellite retrievals of the temperature dependence of the 12/11 μm effective absorption optical depth ratio or βeff, ice crystal nucleation rates appear to be anomalously high near the tops of continental thunderstorms relative to maritime thunderstorms. The ice crystal nucleation rate, having units of g-1 s-1, is more related to the ratio of ice particle number concentration/ice water content (or N/IWC, with units of g-1) than to N. A surprisingly tight relationship was discovered between βeff and N/IWC, allowing N/IWC to be estimated from satellite retrievals of βeff. These retrievals verified that deep convection during TC4 over water did not produce the much higher N/IWC ratios observed during SPARTICUS in continental anvil cirrus.\nThe imaging infrared radiometer (IIR) aboard CALIPSO has channels at 8, 10 and 12 μm and provides a data record of βeff dating back to 2006, as well as vertical profiles of IWC, extinction, depolarization and 1064/532 nm backscatter ratio from the CALIOP lidar. We will compare the MODIS-derived βeff and N/IWC relationship with that derived using the IIR data. We will also investigate the relationship between N/IWC, βeff and the vertically-resolved lidar parameters to determine if nucleation type produces a measurable change in the vertical distribution of cloud ice. It appears promising that these relationships may be used to determine when and where homo- and heterogeneous nucleation dominate ice production in cirrus clouds as a function of season and latitude.",

The onset of instability is generally attributed to an inflection point in the mean velocity profile, as stated by Rayleigh's theorem for inviscid flows. Additionally, turbulent flows over porous media exhibit dynamic similarity across systems and scales, as evidenced by recent finding of empirical universal scaling laws correlating relevant length and velocity scales. In this work, we analytically derive a universal scaling law for the turbulence intensity, which is in agreement with experimental findings. Also, through an instability analysis, we identify key parameters that render the flow through the permeable layer unstable and show that no strict causality exists between inflection points in the mean velocity profile and flow instability. Instead, we show that a complex interplay between instability, inflection points and flow self-similarity exists.",

            "abstract": "Tree cover affects terrestrial energy and water exchanges, photosynthesis and transpiration, net primary production, and carbon and nutrient fluxes. Accurate and long-term continuous observation of tree cover change is critical for the study of the gradual ecosystem change. Tree cover is most commonly inferred from categorical maps which may inadequately represent within-class heterogeneity for many analyses. Alternatively, Vegetation Continuous Fields data measures fractions or proportions of pixel area. Recent development in remote sensing data processing and cross sensor calibration techniques enabled the continuous, long-term observations such as Land Long-Term Data Records. Such data products and their surface reflectance data have enhanced the possibilities for long term Vegetation Continuous Fields data, thus enabling the estimation of long term trend of fractional forest cover change. In this presentation, we will summarize the progress in algorithm development including automation of training selection for deciduous and evergreen forest, the preliminary results, and its future applications to relate trends in fractional forest cover change and environmental change.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty about the effects of \"diagenetic noise\" on primary δ13Ccarb signals has been a principal obstacle in interpreting whole-rock δ13Ccarb stratigraphy. We have evaluated the fidelity of the whole-rock δ13Ccarb signal through a high-resolution sampling of correlative marine Paleozoic sections in North America and Europe across facies transitions spanning pure limestone to calcareous black shale and sandstone. Sections altered by metosomatic (diagenetic and hydrothermal) processes were specifically targeted for comparison with pristine unaltered sections. Precise stratigraphic correlations were confirmed using bentonite fingerprinting/dating, Sr-isotope stratigraphy, and whole-rock XRF chemistry.\nOur results demonstrate that whole-rock δ13Ccarb is an extraordinarily robust signal of global marine δ13C compositions. Correlative sections show strikingly similar δ13Ccarb values and patterns regardless of location, facies and rock type. Closely spaced successions of pristine limestone show highly reproducible δ13Ccarb profiles. Remarkably, δ13Ccarb trends cut across zones of alteration with no offset, and sections completely replaced by diagenetic/hydrothermal dolomite produce the same δ13Ccarb profiles as their unaltered counterparts.\nOur study confirms that whole-rock δ13Ccarb is an unprecedented chronostratigraphic tool. Our high-resolution approach identified abrupt offsets in δ13Ccarb profiles that correspond with unconformity horizons (supported by sedimentologic features) that can be correlated throughout different basins around the globe. A systematic covariation between shallowing-deepening trends and δ13Ccarb demonstrates its primary origin. The fidelity of the high-resolution record provides previously unattainable fine-scale temporal correlation - a resolution that, ultimately, will be required to fully understand the processes that fractionate the global carbon reservoir and have led to its overarching control on Earths evolution.",

So as one of hypotheses, the promotion of creation of cloud condensation nuclei by cosmic rays can be considered.\nIn this study, we have carried out verification experiment of this hypothesis using an atmospheric reaction chamber at room temperature focusing on the kind of ionizing radiation. We introduced pure air, a trace of water vapor, ozone and sulfur dioxide gas in a chamber with a volume of 75[L]. The sulfur dioxide reacts chemically in the chamber to form sulfate aerosol. After introducing the mixed gas into the chamber, it was irradiated with ultraviolet light, which simulate solar ultraviolet radiation and with anthropogenic ionizing radiation for cosmic rays, particles and new particle formation due to ion-induced nucleation was observed by measuring and recording the densities of ions and aerosol particles, the particle size distribution, the concentrations of ozone and sulfur dioxide, the temperature and the relative humidity.\n Here, the experimental results of aerosol nucleation rate for different types of radiation are reported. In this experiment, we conducted experiments of irradiation with heavy ions and β-rays. For ionizing radiation Sr-90 β-rays with an average energy of about 1[MeV] and a heavy ion beam from a particle accelerator facility of HIMAC at NIRS (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba, National Institute of Radiological Sciences) were used.\n The utilized heavy ion was 14N ions of 180[MeV/n] with intensities from 200[particles/spill] to 10000[particles/spill]. In this experimental run the chamber was irradiated for 10 hours and, the relationship between aerosol particle density for the particle size of > of 2.5[nm] and the generated ion density was verified. In the middle, the chamber was irradiated with β-rays for comparison. Increases in the ion density with the increase of the beam intensity were confirmed. Also, a rise in the aerosol particle density due to the ion density increase was confirmed. From this result, the ion-induced nucleation due to heavy ion irradiation could be verified.\n From the results of this study, ion-induced nucleation due to β-rays and heavy ion irradiation was confirmed.",

Oceans & Climate is an interdisciplinary science and policy semester in which students also explore public policy perspectives to learn how scientific knowledge is used in making climate-related policy. Working first at SEA’s shore campus, students collaborate with SEA faculty and other researchers in the local Woods Hole scientific community to design and develop an original research project to be completed at sea. Students then participate as full, working members of the scientific team and sailing crew aboard the 134-foot brigantine SSV Robert C. Seamans; they conduct extensive oceanographic sampling, manage shipboard operations, and complete and present the independent research project they designed onshore. Oceans & Climate SEA Semester Cruise S-250 sailed from San Diego to Tahiti on a 7-week, >4000nm voyage last fall (November-December 2013). This remote open-ocean cruise track traversed subtropical and equatorial regions of the Pacific particularly well suited for a diverse range of climate-focused studies. Furthermore, as SEA has regularly collected scientific data along similar Pacific cruise tracks for more than a decade, students often undertake projects that require time-series analyses. 18 undergraduates from 15 different colleges and universities participated in the S-250 program. Two examples of the many projects completed by S-250 students include a study of the possible relationship between tropical cyclone intensification, driven by warm sea surface temperatures, and the presence of barrier layers; and a study of nutrient cycling in the eastern Pacific, focusing on primary nitrite maximum changes in various oceanographic regions with differing levels of stratification and accompanying localization of microbial communities. These studies, as well as additional scientific and policy projects conducted by other Oceans & Climate students, will be highlighted in this poster presentation.",

All Level-1b and Level-2+ products created by ABI will be geometrically interpolated to a Fixed Grid; a set of static pixel locations centered on the sub-satellite point. The Fixed Grid represents a new standard in products created by the GOES series of satellites and will aid users by providing continuity in the locations of geographic features throughout mission life. However, detector-level anomalies will be impacted by the resampling process in a variety of ways. Depending on the nature of the anomaly, the proximity of the detector sample to the pixel centers, and the underlying scene phenomenology, the resampling process has the potential to both amplify and mitigate system anomalies. This work will introduce the resampling process and the Fixed Grid, as well as present a case study characterizing the radiometric impacts of detector anomalies to L1b products.",

In recent years, the members of the National Association of Geoscience Teachers (NAGT) have created two divisions to support the geoscience education needs of specific subpopulations of the geoscience community: the 2YC division, focusing on community college issues, and TED, focusing on teacher education. This year marks the first year of a new division within the National Association of Geoscience Teachers (NAGT) focused on geoscience education research. The Geoscience Education Research division (GER) is committed to the promotion of high quality, scholarly research in geoscience education that improves teaching and learning in K-12, higher education, and informal learning environments. High quality DBER in geoscience requires the ability to connect current theories of teaching and learning with deep content-specific conceptual understanding. A community of practice like NAGT GER, has the potential to improve the quality of scholarly efforts in geoscience education by providing a forum for improving the collective knowledge and expertise of the geoscience education research community. Current division initiatives and efforts will be highlighted and time for dialogue on future directions will be included.",

            "abstract": "Changes in the redox state of iron (Fe) can be coupled to the biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen, and phosphorus. The importance of Fe in catalyzing redox-driven biogeochemical cycling has been underappreciated in terrestrial ecosystems because they are not typically thought of as anaerobic environments. However, upland soils can experience anaerobic conditions following rainfall events or in microsites of high biological oxygen consumption. Measurements of Fe reduction rates in soils are difficult to compare among studies from different ecosystems, so we used the same assay to quantify potential Fe reduction in soils from upland environments (annual grassland, drained peatland pasture, and a rainforest) that varied in poorly crystalline Fe and total C. We slurried the soils and incubated them in a glovebox with a dinitrogen headspace. To evaluate the role of C availability in potential Fe reduction, we added sodium acetate daily at rates up to 0.6 mg C/g soil/d. We measured methane (CH4) production, acid- extractable Fe(II), citrate-ascorbate extractable Fe oxides, and pH over 5 days to determine the timing and magnitude of Fe reduction.\nIn relatively dry soils (< 20 % gravimetric soil moisture), Fe reduction began after one day of anaerobic incubation as slurries, but all of the soils demonstrated high Fe reduction potential. On day 3, Fe reduction rates for the 0.05 mg C/g soil/d treatment were 1535 ± 51 μg Fe(III) g-1 d-1 in the annual grassland soil, 1205 ± 42 μg Fe(III) g-1 d-1 in the drained peatland soil, and 826 ± 54 μg Fe(III) g-1 d-1 in the rainforest soil. This contrasts with the trend in poorly crystalline Fe oxide pools across the sites: 3.87 ± 0.06 μg Fe(III) g-1 in the annual grassland, 7.49 μg Fe(III) g-1 in the drained peatland, and 20.84 ± 0.19 μg Fe(III) g-1 in the rainforest soil. Across all sites, small C additions (< 0.05 mg C/g soil/day) increased Fe reduction rates while larger C additions decreased Fe reduction. Iron reduction rates typically decreased by day 5, associated with an increase in CH4 concentrations suggesting that potentially reducible Fe was depleted. Our results suggest that upland soils have the potential to exhibit high short-term rates of Fe reduction that may play a role in driving C oxidation and other soil biogeochemical cycles during periods of anaerobiosis.",

            "abstract": "This study presents a modeling approach for investigating coupled thermal-hydrological-mechanical (THM) behavior, including fracture development, within geomaterials and structures. In the model, the coupling procedure consists of an effective linkage between two codes: TOUGH2, a simulator of subsurface multiphase flow and mass transport based on the finite volume approach; and an implementation of the rigid-body-spring network (RBSN) method, a discrete (lattice) modeling approach to represent geomechanical behavior. One main advantage of linking these two codes is that they share the same geometrical mesh structure based on the Voronoi discretization, so that a straightforward representation of discrete fracture networks (DFN) is available for fluid flow processes. The capabilities of the TOUGH-RBSN model are demonstrated through simulations of hydraulic fracturing, where fluid pressure-induced fracturing and damage-assisted flow are well represented.\nThe TOUGH-RBSN modeling methodology has been extended to enable treatment of geomaterials exhibiting anisotropic characteristics. In the RBSN approach, elastic spring coefficients and strength parameters are systematically formulated based on the principal bedding direction, which facilitate a straightforward representation of anisotropy. Uniaxial compression tests are simulated for a transversely isotropic material to validate the new modeling scheme. The model is also used to simulate excavation fracture damage for the HG-A microtunnel in the Opalinus Clay rock, located at the Mont Terri underground research laboratory (URL) near Saint-Ursanne, Switzerland. The Opalinus Clay has transversely isotropic material properties caused by natural features such as bedding, foliation, and flow structures. Preferential fracturing and tunnel breakouts were observed following excavation, which are believed to be strongly influenced by the mechanical anisotropy of the rock material. The simulation results are qualitatively representative of the nonuniform fracture patterns observed in the HG-A microtunnel.",

            "abstract": "Assessing the historical contribution of glacier ice volume loss to stream flow based on reconstructed volume changes through Little Ice Age (LIA) can be directly related to the understanding of glacier-hydrology in the current epoch of rapid glacier ice loss that has disquieting implications for water resources in the Cordillera Blanca of the Peruvian Andes. However, the accurate prediction of the future glacial meltwater availability for the increasing regional Andean society needs more extensive quantitative estimation from long-term glacial meltwater of reconstructed glacial volume.\nModeling LIA paleoglaciers using a cellular automata glacier flow model in different catchments of the Cordillera Blanca allows us to reconstruct glacier volume and its change from likely combinations of climatic control variables and time.\nWe compute the rate and magnitude of glacier volume changes for Yanamarey and Queshque glaciers between the LIA and modern defined by 2011 Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model Version 2 (GDEM V2) from the Cordillera Blanca.\nAlso, we employ a recently demonstrated hydrological stream model (Baraer et al., 2012) for integrating the reconstructed glacier volume and its change to calculate glacier contribution to meltwater runoff as a function of glacier loss rate in the Yanamarey and the Queshque catchments, and reconstruct long-term glacier significance to stream flow.",

            "abstract": "Remotely triggered seismicity that takes place at distances greater than 1–2 fault lengths appears to be a frequent phenomenon after large earthquakes, including examples in Costa Rica after the large (Mw > 7.0) inter-plate earthquakes in 1941, 1950, 1983, 1990, and 1991. On September 5, 2012, an inter-plate 7.6-Mw earthquake struck the Nicoya Peninsula, triggering upper-plate seismicity in the interior of Costa Rica. In this study, we analyze the largest earthquakes and earthquake swarms that took place during the first nine months after the Nicoya earthquake. These swarms occurred at distances of 150 to 450 km from the Nicoya source region in different tectonic settings: the Calero Island near the Costa Rica-Nicaragua border in the backarc Caribbean region, the Sixaola region near the Costa Rica-Panama border in the backarc Caribbean region, the Cartago area in the central part of Costa Rica near the active volcanic arc, and the San Vito area in the Costa Rica-Panama border region, at the southern flank of the Talamanca Cordillera in an inactive portion of the magmatic arc. The Calero swarm with 70 2.0-to-4.2 Mw earthquakes took place from September 22 to October 9, 2012. The earthquake pattern suggests a smaller-scale fault as a possible source, which is located along the inland projection of the Hess Escarpment. The Cartago swarm with 284 1.8-to-4.1 Mw earthquakes occurred from September 5 to October 31, 2012. The focal mechanism solutions suggest that strike-slip faulting predominates in this region, consistent with neotectonic observations. The San Vito earthquake swarm with 30 2.3-to-4.5 Mw earthquakes occurred between October 14, 2012 and January 28, 2013. These earthquakes occurred in the vicinity of north-south striking faults, which are located along the inland projection of the Panama Fracture Zone. The largest earthquake (5.6 Mw) occurred on the Sixaola region on 27 of May, 2013. The focal mechanism solution suggests a thrust fault that correlates with the North Panama Deformed Belt. Documenting remotely triggered earthquakes may greatly improve seismic hazards assessment by illuminating active structures within the interior of Costa Rica.",

            "abstract": "In many Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events, the particle energy spectra show clear roll-over or double power law features. These features can be described by a break energy, which has a charge-to-mass (Q/A) dependence that varies from event to event (Cohen et al. 2003, 2005, Mewaldt et al. 2005). Here Q is the charge state and A is the relative atomic mass of energetic particles. A (Q/A)^2 dependence of the break energy emerges naturally from a numerical model (Li et al. 2005) of particle acceleration at a parallel CME-driven shock. Shallower dependence, e.g., (Q/A)^(2/9) has also been suggested by Li et al. (2009) for a quasi-perpendicular shock. Li et al. (2009) also discussed the most general case of an oblique shock, in which the (Q/A) dependence of the break energy is between the parallel and the perpendicular cases. The combination of STEREO A&B and ACE give us the opportunity to examine the same SEP event from different vantage points in which the shock obliquities may differ. We compare the time intensity profile and spectra of different species such as H, He4, C, O and Fe in selected SEP events (Richardson et al. 2014) that were observed by SIT and LET onboard STEREO A&B and ULEIS and SIS onboard ACE. Q/A scalings which reveal the information concerning shock geometry at different spacecraft are obtained.",

The main shock Mw 5.0 of this sequence occurred at 2.8 km below the surface and satisfied criteria for GT1 qualification. High amplitude near-field ground motions and rapid attenuation with distance were investigated for the Mogul main shock and principal fore- and aftershocks. Seismic moment, stress drop, and corner frequency for the ML > 3.0 Mogul earthquakes were estimated using 1) Spectral fitting and 2) Lg coda ratios. The source time function and the stress drop of the main shock were also probed using Empirical Green’s Functions. The stress drop estimates ranged from 3 to 14 MPa. Investigations of the effect of source depth on P and S spectra and spectral ratios, signal complexity, and mb-Ms discrimination are also discussed in comparison to deeper earthquake sequences and explosions within 100 km of Mogul, and in comparison to sets of earthquakes and nuclear explosions which occurred on or near the Nevada Test Site. According to preliminary results, the Mogul main shock classifies as an earthquake, however, discrimination becomes difficult for a foreshock and an aftershock with ML>3.9.",

With a Lagrangian tracking algorithm, the study yields detailed storm evolution and spatial distributions based on global, high-resolution (30-min, 4-km), satellite datasets. Statistical analysis and scaling studies are performed on the extensive storm database, and have produced new insight into the global storm system, such as (1) the spatial and temporal characteristics of global trajectories, (2) scaling properties, (3) the climatology and variability, and (4) life cycle evolution of storms. Our results documented the scaling of various storm properties, the seasonal storm climatology, variability, and the regional preferences for formation and dissipation. Additionally, we found that El Nino and La Nina impact storm tracks and properties. By continuously following storms, we examined their development over time. This is relevant to the measurement community because past studies have linked uncertainties in precipitation measurements to life cycle stage and overpass gaps. These results can be used to develop a baseline climatological state, improve retrieval algorithms, and examine extreme events.",

To evaluate the expression of the MBT signal in the climate system, we analyze 15 sea-surface temperature, 18 benthic ∂13C, and 8 dust records using principal component and spectral analyses and variance estimation methods. Our results identify a significant difference in the variance of the first principal components of the SST and dust across the MBT with a punctuation of the 100-kyr frequency centered around ~400 ka. The first principal component of SST is strongly correlated with the atmospheric CO2 record from EPICA Dome C (r2 = 0.80). The first principal component of dust is inversely correlated with CO2 (r2 = -0.73) and the first principal component of SST (r2 = -0.69). The ∂13C records of each major ocean basin were analyzed separately, with the Atlantic and Pacific records both exhibiting a decrease in variance across the MBT boundary. The first principal component of the ∂13C record from the Atlantic shows a large excursion during MIS 13 (500-530 ka), and could suggest a change in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation at this time. High correlation (r2 = 0.92) between the first principal component of the Pacific and the second principal component of the Atlantic suggests a reservoir signal that also records high values during MIS 13.",

            "abstract": "Studies of long-term, regional variations of growth and properties of sea ice are best served by a combination of field measurements and model simulations. We explore the utility of the Community Ice Code (CICE) model, designed for fully coupled global climate models. CICE was run in standalone mode, with an integrated module that includes ice salinity as a prognostic variable (Turner et al., doi:10.1002/jgrc.20171).\nWe examine performance of the CICE salinity module by hindcasting interannual variability in the seasonal cycle of first-year ice salinity and temperature. Landfast ice, monitored at Barrow, Alaska since 1999 (SIZONet.org), provides a suitable test case and reference. The model is forced with 6-hr weather data from the National Climate Data Center, except for precipitation and humidity provided by the NCEP reanalysis model. Simulations were run for the period 1948-2013, with a focus on 1999 to 2013 when observation data are available.\nBased on validation with measured ice and snow thicknesses, a non-zero ocean-to-ice heat flux has to be specified to reproduce the full seasonal cycle. The model captures the broad seasonal trends of key ice properties and thickness, especially during the growth season. During melt, significant deviations between observations and model output for ice temperature and salinity are observed, in particular near the ice surface where meltwater flushing is only partially captured by the CICE mushy-layer salinity module. With the exception of two years, the model captures interannual variability of ice thickness and bulk ice salinity well.\nFurther work is required to improve the accuracy of the full seasonal range of modeled salinity variations, especially during the melt season when processes at the ice interface are not well reproduced by the model. However, in conjunction with local validation data, CICE may serve as a tool to assess regional variations in key ice properties on interannual to decadal time scales.",

            "abstract": "With the increasing availability of variable rate technology for applying fertilizers and other agrichemicals in dryland agricultural production systems there is a growing need to better capture and understand the processes driving field scale variability in crop yield and soil water. This need for a better understanding of field scale variability has led to the recent designation of the R. J. Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF) (Pullman, WA, USA) as a United States Department of Agriculture Long-Term Agro-Ecosystem Research (LTAR) site. Field scale variability at the CAF is closely monitored using extensive environmental sensor networks and intensive hand sampling. As investigating land-soil-water dynamics at CAF is essential for improving precision agriculture, transferring this knowledge across the regional-scale climosequence is challenging. In this study we describe the hydropedologic functioning of the CAF in relation to five extensively instrumented field sites located within 50 km in the same climatic region. The formation of restrictive argillic soil horizons in the wetter, cooler eastern edge of the region results in the development of extensive perched water tables, surface saturation, and surface runoff, whereas excess water is not an issue in the warmer, drier, western edge of the region. Similarly, crop and tillage management varies across the region as well. We discuss the implications of these regional differences on field scale management decisions and demonstrate how we are using proximal soil sensing and remote sensing imagery to better understand and capture field scale variability at a particular field site.",

            "abstract": "In late July of 2014 over 900 autonomous short period seismometers were deployed within 12 km of the summit crater at Mount St Helens. In concert with the larger iMUSH experiment, these data constitute the largest seismic interrogation of an active volcano ever conducted. The array was deployed along the road and trail system of the national volcanic monument and adjacent regions with an average station spacing of 250 meters and included several station clusters with increased sampling density. The 10 Hz phones recorded the vertical component wavefield continuously at 250 Hz sampling rate over a period of approximately two weeks. During the recording time, the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network detected ~65 earthquakes within the array footprint ranging in magnitude from -0.9 to 1.1, the majority of which were located beneath the crater at less than 10 km depth. In addition to the natural seismicity, 23 explosion sources from the iMUSH active source experiment were recorded, several of which exceeded magnitude 2.\nPreliminary results for this project will include an expanded event catalog as the array should significantly reduce the detection threshold. The sheer number of instruments allows for stacking of station clusters producing high signal-to-noise beam traces which can be used for event triggering and for creating waveform templates to measure relative travel-times across the array via cross-correlation. The ability of the array to estimate focal mechanisms from event radiation patterns and delineate complex path effects will also be investigated.\nThe density and azimuthal coverage provide by this array offers an excellent opportunity to investigate short-wavelength variations of the seismic wavefield in a complex geologic environment. Previous seismic tomography results suggest the presence of a shallow magma chamber at 1-3 km depth near the region of shallow seismicity as evidenced by a P wave low-velocity anomaly of at least -5.5% [Waite and Moran, 2009]. The proximity of the array as well as the event distribution make it possible to investigate wavefield distortion and scattering due to the potential magma chamber, including s-wave blockage as has been observed in other systems.",

However, to date, our understanding of broad-scale (e.g. global) patterns of OM composition and soil minerals at depth has been limited. Here, I examine global scale patterns of C and N with depth up to 100 cm using prior published studies and a global-scale pedon C and N content data set made available through the International Soil Carbon Network (ISCN). Questions addressed include: (1) How do C and N soil profile depth trends vary by soil type and biogeoclimatically, and (2) What might this tell us about underlying mechanisms controlling C and N abundance and OM composition in soil ? I draw heavily on prior studies in evaluating the current state of knowledge and uncertainty in terms of these trends. Underlying possible mechanisms of declining C to N ratio are evaluated based on a range of soil litter, laboratory incubation and mineral sorption experiments. The extent to which microorganisms may influence soil C and N depth patterns is further evaluated. The study is part of broader effort through the North American Carbon Program to better understand global-scale mechanisms for soil carbon accumulation and stabilization in the subsoil.",

            "abstract": "We studied extension of a lithospheric wedge as an approximation to an orogenic belt or a continental margin. We ran a series of numerical models to quantify the effects of the strength of the lower crust and a mid-crustal shear zone (MCSZ) on the extension processes. When the MCSZ is present, we found that the regional lower crustal flow plays a critical role in controlling the modes of extension. The compensation is long-wavelength when the lower crust flows from the highest to the lowest elevation in order to compensate upper crustal thinning. In response to this motion, the mantle flows towards the highest elevation in order to balance for the lower crust leaving the area under the highest topography. For weak (wet quartz regime with partial melting) or intermediate (wet quartz regime), or strong (dry quartz regime) lower crust, we recognized three predominantly decoupled modes of extension characterized by 1) significant lower crustal exhumation exemplified as a large massif, 2) formation of core complexes and detachment faults, and 3) distributive domino faulting, respectively. Without the MCSZ, however, the lower crustal flow is essentially subdued with predominantly coupled extension. For weak or intermediate, or strong lower crust, we recognized three coupled modes characterized by 1) localized generally symmetric crustal exhumation, 2) distributed grabens and narrow rifts, and 3) wide continental margins, respectively. The MCSZ controls the degree of decoupling of the lower crustal flow such that a frictionally stronger MCSZ does not change the behaviors of the models but results in a more distributed extension. Due to the long-wavelength compensation, subhorizontal Moho is achieved where intensive extension occurred for all the decoupled models with a MCSZ. Natural counterparts for each mode may be easily identified, for instance, in the Basin and Range or the Aegean.",

            "abstract": "Particulate matter (PM) scatters and absorbs solar radiation and thereby affects visibility, the Earth’s radiation balance, and properties and lifetimes of clouds. Understanding the radiative forcing (RF) of PM is essential to reducing the uncertainty in total anthropogenic and natural RF. Many instruments that measure light absorption coefficients (βabs [λ], Mm-1) of PM have used light at near-infrared (NIR; e.g., 880 nm) or red (e.g., 633 nm) wavelengths. Measuring βabs over a wider wavelength range, especially including the ultraviolet (UV) and visible, allows for contributions from black carbon (BC), brown carbon (BrC), and mineral dust (MD) to be differentiated. This will help to determine PM RF and its emission sources. In this study, source and ambient samples collected on Teflon-membrane and quartz-fiber filters are used to characterize and develop a multi-wavelength (250 – 1000 nm) filter-based measurement method of PM light absorption. A commercially available UV-visible spectrometer coupled with an integrating sphere is used for quantifying diffuse reflectance and transmittance of filter samples, from which βabs and absorption Ǻngström exponents (AAE) of the PM deposits are determined. The filter-based light absorption measurements of laboratory generated soot and biomass burning aerosol are compared to 3-wavelength photoacoustic absorption measurements to evaluate filter media and loading effects. Calibration factors are developed to account for differences between filter types (Teflon-membrane vs. quartz-fiber), and between filters and in situ photoacoustic absorption values. Application of multi-spectral absorption measurements to existing archived filters, including specific source samples (e.g. diesel and gasoline engines, biomass burning, dust), will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "During October 2012, 51 geophones and 6 broadband seismometers were deployed in an ~50x50m region surrounding a periodically erupting columnar geyser in the El Tatio Geyser Field, Chile. The dense array served as the seismic framework for a collaborative project to study the mechanics of complex hydrothermal systems. Contemporaneously, complementary geophysical measurements (including down-hole temperature and pressure, discharge rates, thermal imaging, water chemistry, and video) were also collected.\nLocated on the western flanks of the Andes Mountains at an elevation of 4200m, El Tatio is the third largest geyser field in the world. Its non-pristine condition makes it an ideal location to perform minutely invasive geophysical studies. The El Jefe Geyser was chosen for its easily accessible conduit and extremely periodic eruption cycle (~120s). During approximately 2 weeks of continuous recording, we recorded ~2500 nighttime eruptions which lack cultural noise from tourism. With ample data, we aim to study how the source varies spatially and temporally during each phase of the geyser’s eruption cycle. We are developing a new back-projection processing technique to improve source imaging for diffuse signals. Our method was previously applied to the Sierra Negra Volcano system, which also exhibits repeating harmonic and diffuse seismic sources. We back-project correlated seismic signals from the receivers back to their sources, assuming linear source to receiver paths and a known velocity model (obtained from ambient noise tomography). We apply polarization filters to isolate individual and concurrent geyser energy associated with P and S phases. We generate 4D, time-lapsed images of the geyser source field that illustrate how the source distribution changes through the eruption cycle. We compare images for pre-eruption, co-eruption, post-eruption and quiescent periods. We use our images to assess eruption mechanics in the system (i.e. top-down vs. bottom-up) and determine variations in source depth and distribution in the conduit and larger geyser field over many eruption cycles.",

RACE will measure 2 channels of the 183 GHz water vapor line, and will be used to validate new low noise amplifier (LNA) technology and a novel amplifier based internal calibration subsystem. The 3U spacecraft is provided by the University of Texas at Austin’s Satellite Design Laboratory. RACE will advance the technology readiness level (TRL) of the 183 GHz receiver subsystem from TRL 4 to TRL 6 and a CubeSat 183 GHz radiometer system from TRL 4 to TRL 7. Measurements at 183 GHz are used to retrieve integrated products and vertical profiles of water vapor. Current full scale satellite missions that can utilize the technology include AMSU, ATMS, SSMIS and Megha-Tropiques.\nThe LNAs are designed at JPL, based on a 35 nm indium phosphide (InP) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMT) technology developed by Northrop Grumman. The resulting single chip LNAs require only 25 mW of power. Current pre-launch instrument performance specifications include an RF gain of over 30 dB and a room noise figure of < 9.5 dB. The noise figure is dominated by the insertion loss of the Dicke switch which at these frequencies are > 5dB. If a coupler based calibration system is shown to be sufficient, future receiver systems will have noise figures < 4 dB. The gain and noise figure variation over temperature is approximately 0.55 dB/K. The NEDT of the system is < 1K, and on orbit performance is expected to improve due to the thermal environment. The current system is configured for direct detection to reduce power consumption by eliminating the need for a local oscillator.\nA 2012 NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI) selection, RACE is manifested for launch on the Orbital 3 (Orb-3) mission scheduled for October 2014. RACE will be deployed from the International Space Station (ISS) by NanoRacks.",

Some groups even adjust the bias and slope of each line in a survey to minimize the crossover mismatch. Is the expectation that airborne gravity measurements are path independent, leading to a zero crossover mismatch, correct? If the measurements are filtered along the track, the answer is no, we should not expect the same reading at the same location measured from different directions. This presentation will demonstrate the effects of along-track filtering, interpolation and altitude correction that cause a mismatch unrelated to measurement error. A method for computing the expected crossover mismatch will be presented. A comparison of evaluation methods for several GRAV-D airborne gravity surveys will illustrate the magnitude, contributing factors and systematic nature of the differences between these methods.",

            "abstract": "Fractures control the flow of fluids in rocks with important implications for groundwater resources, contaminant transport, geothermal resources, sequestration of carbon dioxide, and the development of unconventional hydrocarbon resources. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) can be used to image fractured rock and monitor the flow of fluids in the subsurface. Conventional GPR imaging uses single-polarization, co-polarized signals. Changes in reflected signal amplitude result from changes in fracture aperture and changes in fluid electrical properties introduced by tracers or contaminants. Recent research has also shown changes in radar reflected signal phase resulting from changes in fluid electrical conductivity. However, the radar response is dependent on the polarization of EM waves. This study investigates the use of cross-polarized GPR signals for imaging flow channeling at a discrete horizontal fracture. Numerical modeling demonstrated that cross-polarized GPR data are able to image fracture channels when the axis of the channel is oriented obliquely to the EM wavefield orientation. Summation of the cross-polarized and co-polarized components results in an accurate representation of the total scattered energy from the channel. Multipolarization, time-lapse 3D GPR field data were used investigate GPR imaging of flow channeling in a discrete subhorizontal fracture. The GPR surveys were conducted during background fresh fracture water conditions and during six varying orientation dipole flow saline tracer tests. The cross-polarized data revealed flow channeling which is in agreement with the co-polarized GPR data and with independent hydraulic tests. In addition, the cross-polarized components showed changes in flow channeling as a result of changing dipole flow orientation and position. This study demonstrates that cross-polarized GPR signals can be used to enhance imaging of flow in fractured rock.",

Planetary cores may contain a wide range of non-metallic light elements, including H, N, S, P, Si, and C. Under highly reducing conditions, such as those that are thought to have pertained during the formation of Mercury’s core, Si and C, in addition to sulfur, may be particularly important constituents. Each of these elements may strongly effect and have a different impact on the partitioning behavior of trace elements but their combined effects on trace element partitioning have not been quantified. We investigated the partitioning behavior of more than 25 siderophile trace elements within the Fe-S-C-Si system with varying concentrations of C, S, and Si. The experiments were performed under pressures varying from 1 atm to 2 GPa and temperatures ranging from 1200˚C to 1450˚C. All experiments produced immiscible liquids, one enriched in Si and C, and the other predominantly FeS. We found some highly siderophile elements including Os, Ru, Ir, and Re are much more enriched in Fe-Si-C phase than in Fe-S phase, whereas other trace elements like V, Co, Ag, Hf, and Pb are enriched in S-rich phase. However, not all the trace elements enriched in Fe-Si-C phase are repelled by sulfur. Elements like Re and Ru could have different partitioning trends if sulfur concentration in S-rich phase rises. The partitioning behavior of these trace elements could enhance our understanding of the differentiation of Mercury’s core under oxygen-poor conditions.",

Examining an even older magnetic field, however, must rely on igneous components (e.g. zircons hosting magnetic inclusions) now found in younger sedimentary rocks. Here we focus on methods developed to address the challenges posed by the paleointensity measurement of crystals having weak natural remanent magnetizations (NRMs). We use a small bore (6.3 mm) 2G SQUID magnetometer that currently has the highest 3-component moment resolution for measurements, and CO2 laser heating for demagnetization. Use of this 3-component system allows for the direct measurement of full vector natural remanent magnetizations and avoids the non-uniqueness inherent in scanning magnetometer approaches. To reduce sample blank size, we use 0.5 mm fused quartz sample holders. We find that some Archean to Hadean zircons of the Jack Hills (Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia) have NRMs of ca. 1-3 x 10-9 emu, within the resolution of the ultra-high moment resolution SQUID magnetometer. Thermal demagnetization data indicate most the magnetization unblocks between 550 and 580 °C, consistent with a magnetite carrier. Magnetic force microscopy suggests the presence of sub-micron single domain-like magnetic inclusions in the zircon. Thellier-Coe paleointensity data suggest the presence of a magnetic field at 3.55 Ga. We will discuss measurements and criteria to evaluate the presence/absence of an even older Paleoarchean and Hadean magnetic field, and opportunities provided by further increases in moment resolution provided by a new spin exchange relaxation-free magnetometer.",

            "abstract": "The M7.8 low-angle thrust earthquake off the west coast of southern Haida Gwaii on October 28, 2012, provided Canadian scientists the opportunity to study a local large thrust earthquake and has provided important information towards an improved understanding of geohazards in coastal British Columbia. Most large events along the Pacific-North America boundary in this region have involved strike-slip motion, such as the 1949 M8.1 earthquake on the Queen Charlotte Fault. In contrast along the southern portion of Haida Gwaii, the young (~8 Ma) Pacific plate crust also underthrusts North America and has been viewed as a small-scale analogy of the Cascadia Subduction Zone.\nInitial seismic-based rupture models for this event were improved through inclusion of GPS observed coseismic displacements, which are as large as 115 cm of horizontal motion (SSW) and 30 cm of subsidence. Additional campaign-style GPS surveys have since been repeated by the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) at seven vertical reference benchmarks throughout Haida Gwaii, significantly improving the coverage of coseismic displacement observations in the region. These added offsets were typically calculated by differencing a single occupation before and after the earthquake and preliminary displacement estimates are consistent with previous GPS observations from the Geological Survey of Canada. Addition of the CHS coseismic offset estimates may allow direct inversion of the GPS data to derive a purely GPS-based rupture model.\nTo date, cumulative postseismic displacements at six sites indicate up to 6 cm of motion, varying in azimuth between SSW and SE. Preliminary postseismic timeseries curve fitting to date has utilized a double exponential function characteristic of mantle relaxation. The current postseismic trends also suggest afterslip on the deeper plate interface beneath central Haida Gwaii along with possible induced aseismic slip on a deeper segment of the Queen Charlotte Fault located offshore of southern Moresby Island. A physical explanation involving afterslip will entail the use of logarithmic functions for curve-fitting and will allow quantitative assessment of the relative importance of the two processes.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of the whole-ocean d13C change between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the modern-day are converging to values of about 0.4 per mil, and are of great use in partitioning land versus ocean contributions to the deglacial carbon cycle. To determine which specific oceanic processes are at play, however, knowledge of the spatial pattern of LGM-to-modern d13C and d18O change is critical. Spatial maps have mostly focused on Atlantic d13C, with less progress for d18O and the Pacific and Indian sectors, due to the concentration of sediment-core observations in the Atlantic and the difficulty in making meaningful maps from sparse data. Here, we demonstrate that a state estimation (or data assimilation) method based on recently compiled data and a simple kinematic ocean model simultaneously produces reasonable results for: 1) global maps of d13C and d18O, 2) uncertainty in the estimated properties, and 3) oceanic water-mass geometry. The observations include benthic d13C and d18O data from 493 marine sediment cores that were collected from the scientific literature and NOAA, PANGEA, and Delphi databases. The kinematic model permits each data point to have influence both up- and downstream along a water-mass pathway, typically allowing a larger geographical range than a statistical interpolation method. No assumption regarding the state of the circulation is necessary, and the modern-day circulation need not be assumed to be representative of the LGM. With this method, meridional (or other) sections can be compared between ocean basins. Furthermore, the internally-consistent d18O and d13C maps are used to determine the LGM-to-modern spatial changes that are robust given the uncertainty and sparsity of data. Rather than simply focus on property maps, we suggest that the link between observations and circulation changes (as reflected by the paths that water travels), points the way toward dynamical processes that must be explained. A particular application of our result is the geographic constraint of possible unobserved reservoirs of d13C or radiocarbon and calculation of their potential impact on the global chain of events during the deglaciation.",

            "abstract": "The problem of massive fluid injection into a pre-existing fracture has many applications in petroleum industry including underground liquid waste disposal and waterflooding to increase recovery from a hydrocarbon reservoir. Understanding the conditions leading to the re-activation of pre-existing fractures and ensuing propagation is critical for a successful injection project design, and it may also help to mitigate potential environmental hazards, such as contamination of underground aquifers and induced seismicity.\nThe problem of injection of a low viscosity fluid into a permeable formation can be distinguished from conventional hydraulic fracture by the mechanism of fluid leak-off. In conventional fracturing, high viscosity and cake building properties of injected fluid limit leak-off to a 1-D boundary layer incasing the crack. In the case of injection of low viscosity fluid into a fracture, leak-off and related pore fluid diffusion will take place over wider range of scales, from 1-D to 2 or 3-D.\nWe consider a pre-existing stationary propped hydraulic fracture with constrained height into which a fluid is injected under constant flow rate. Although the net effective stress on the crack is initially compressive, the proppant keeps the crack open. It is worthwhile to note that during injection and related pressurization of a propped crack, the fracture breakdown is to be achieved prior to the fracture re-opening. Therefore, the effect of the change of the propped fracture storage on the pressurization dynamics can be neglected.\nThe objective of this work is to study the transient pressurization and the onset of the propagation for a propped fracture. To the end, we formulate and solve a general problem of injection into a fracture accounting for viscous dissipation (i.e. non-uniform pressure distribution). We quantify how the fracture breakdown condition depends upon the rock and fluid properties, the in-situ stress and the fluid injection rate. We also establish a criterion when the assumption of negligible viscous dissipation is justified. The obtained solution is also transportable to the production well test analysis of a fractured well (Cinco et al., SPE 1978).",

            "abstract": "Glacier retreat and climate change influences runoff patterns and water resources on a regional scale, and sea-level on a global scale. To assess hydrological changes in glacial systems that include debris-covered and lake-calving glaciers, we couple a energy balance/ice flow model to a semi-distributed hydrological model TopNet. To assess the overall ice volume loss since the late 1800s, and estimate future glacier volume loss given various climate change scenarios, we generate an equilibrium state at the late 1800s position by imposing a cooling of 0.8 K from the 1980-2010 mean temperature. A 'dynamic calibration', is carried out where the temperature forcing is progressively warmed from late-1800s to present-day values. During the 100 years between the '1990s' (1980-2000) and the '2090s' (2080-2100) warming in the central Southern Alps, based on the A1B, A2 and A1FI emissions scenarios and a downscaled 12-model GCM ensemble average, is estimated to be between 2.0 and 2.8 K, with a concurrent increase in precipitation of 10-15%. In the central part of the Southern Alps, ice volume decreased from 54 km3 in the late 1800s to 38 km3 by 1980. Projected warming and precipitation increases result in a modelled ice volume of between 11 km3 (A1FI) and 15 km3 (A1B) by 2100, a loss of 60-71%. Loss of 24% of year 2000 glacier volume is already comitted under present-day climate, largely due to the imbalance of slow-response glaciers and lake-calving dynamics. The combination of debris-covered glacier tongues which persist under a warming climate for decades, and a projected increase in precipitation, means there is an increase in mean annual river flow of 12-15% in the Hooker catchment by the 2040s and 25-34% by the 2090s, and a large increase in winter flows. High rainfall rates mean that overall glacier volume loss does not make a large relative contribution to river flow, except during phases of rapid calving retreat.",

Metadata brokering, linked data, and other mechanisms allow users to discover scientific data of interes across growing volumes of heterogeneous content. Matching this complex content with existing discovery technologies, people looking for scientific data are presented with an ever-growing array of features to sort, filter, subset, and scan through search returns to help them find what they are looking for. This paper examines the applicability of available technologies in connecting searchers with the data of interest. What metrics can be used to track success given shifting baselines of content and technology? How well do existing technologies map to steps in user search patterns?\nTaking a user-driven development approach, the team behind the Arctic Data Explorer interdisciplinary data discovery application invested heavily in usability testing and user search behavior analysis. Building on earlier library community search behavior work, models were developed to better define the diverse set of thought processes and steps users took to find data of interest, here called 'search pathways'. This research builds a deeper understanding of the user community that seeks to reuse scientific data. This approach ensures that development decisions are driven by clearly articulated user needs instead of ad hoc technology trends. Initial results from this research will be presented along with lessons learned for other discovery platform development and future directions for informatics research into search pathways.",

            "abstract": "One of the objectives of ESA’s CryoSat Plus for Ocean (CP4O) project is to demonstrate the excellent retrieval of Level 2 ocean geophysical parameters from CryoSat-2. Within CP4O we have carried out a comparison of sea surface height from CryoSat-2, reprocessed by ESRIN, against tide gauges from the UK Tide Gauge Network. This work has the specific objective to assess the performance in the coastal zone, and complements validation work over the open ocean (both for height and significant wave height) done elsewhere.\nWe took updated corrections from the state-of-the-art RADS archive, computed the TWLE (total water level envelope, i.e. the sea level inclusive of ocean tides and atmospheric pressure and wind effect, a desirable quantity for validation), and then subset all segments of each pass within 50 km from a tide gauge, interpolating the tide gauge height (effectively a TWLE) on the time of the altimeter overpass to create match-up pairs.\nWe first present the results of our attempt to correlate TWLE data over these multiple segments with the measurements from each nearby tide gauge, taking into account the distance of the altimetric measurements from the coastline. Results are dominated by large offsets, variable from match-up to match-up. Screening the data further based on the retracking misfit does not remove this bias, whose causes and possible impact are discussed.\nWe then present an independent verification of the noise level in 20-Hz Cryosat-2 TWLEs and its variation as a function of distance from coast. The noise level is estimated by computing the absolute value of difference between consecutive TWLE values, as done in Passaro et al., Rem. Sens. Env, 2014. Remarkably, the median of that difference remains at ~5 cm up to 5Km from the coast, suggesting a noise level of that order for the 20-Hz data, which would correspond to ~1.1 cm for the 1-Hz data. At 3 km the median abs(diff) is ~7.3 cm.\nFinally we repeated the same analysis for only those points with retracking misfit below a threshold of 3. The median stays virtually flat at ~5cm all the way to the coast but obviously the fraction of points passing the misfit condition decreases quickly (it is about 60% at 5 km from the coast, and less than 25% at 3 km).\nThese results demonstrate clearly that Cryosat-2 maintains an excellent performance of measurement well into in the coastal zone.",

Previous studies show that the initial development of the storm could not be simulated accurately enough to represent the intensity and the evolution of the storm over the Gulf of Mexico region.\nThe aim of this study is to identify the effects of the air-sea fluxes, the sea surface temperature (SST) and the model resolution on determining the intensity and the track of the storm more accurately. To this end, the outputs from two-way coupled model runs were examined to analyze the storm characteristics. Model configurations have been set within a coupled system framework that includes the atmospheric model Weather Research & Forecasting Model (WRF) and the ocean model Regional Ocean Model (ROMS). Three WRF domains assigned 15 km, 5 km and ~1.6 km resolutions, respectively and an 8 km resolution ROMS domain were used in the coupled system. The initial and boundary conditions for WRF were extracted from the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) products and the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) generated SSTs while, the conditions for ROMS were extracted from HYCOM. Comparisons were performed against NOAA buoys and GridSAT brightness temperatures. Minimum mean sea level pressure (MSLP), maximum wind speed and storm locations were examined. Time series for MSLP and wind speed were used to illustrate how air-sea interaction and resolution changes storm intensity along the track. The results showing the RMS differences on the storm location and intensity of the storm are also presented.",

            "abstract": "The grasslands of the U.S. Great Plains vary greatly year-to-year in aboveground productivity due in large part to rainfall patterns. The timing and magnitude of productivity is further influenced by the composition of plants that are C3 (cool season) or C4 (warm season) photosynthetic types. This region is forecasted to undergo seasonal shifts in precipitation, with large rain events separated by longer dry intervals, and much uncertainty remains about the impact that this will have on carbon cycling in these grasslands. Furthermore, past observations may be inadequate for estimating how arid and semi-arid grasslands will respond to more extreme precipitation patterns. Our study at Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) contrasts above and belowground fluxes of water and CO2 between a C3 dominated, reclaimed grassland and a nearby C4 dominated, native tallgrass prairie. Each grassland is instrumented with an eddy covariance tower, soil moisture and temperature arrays, and soil gas wells measuring soil CO2 concentrations at 5, 10, and 15 cm depths. Leaf area index (LAI) and biomass were obtained through destructive sampling about every 2 weeks throughout the growing season. Measurements of water and carbon cycling include the growing seasons for 2011-2014, with special focus on the late growing season and highly saturated conditions following the extreme precipitation events of September 2013. Cumulative rainfall measurements at the study sites for the period September 9-15, 2013 were approximately 200mm, and soil moisture increased from 15% to over 50% (completely saturated) during the same period. Preliminary results in the C3 dominated grassland during this event showed a rapid increase in the CO2 concentration gradient, with the soil CO2 concentration at the 15cm depth increasing from 1339 ppm to 4246 ppm in less than 1 hour. Yet increasing soil water content caused a decrease in diffusion of CO2, with efflux going from 0.1 mgC/m2/hr to zero during the same period. LAI and biomass along with NEE measurements indicate that aboveground productivity increased in the C3 dominated grassland in October 2013, while the C4 dominated tallgrass prairie did not increase production at this time.",

Even in the non-flaring corona, high-sensitivity HXR measurements may be able to detect the presence of electron acceleration. The High Energy Replicated Optics to Explore the Sun (HEROES) balloon mission added the capability of solar observations to an existing astrophysics balloon payload, HERO, which used grazing-incidence optics for direct HXR imaging. HEROES measures HXR emission from ~20 to ~75 keV with an angular resolution of 33” HPD. HEROES launched on 2013 September 21 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, and had a successful one-day flight. We present the detailed analysis of the 7-hour observation of AR 11850, which sets new upper limits on the HXR emission from a quiescent active region, with corresponding constraints on the numbers of tens of keV energetic electrons present. Using the imaging capability of HEROES, HXR upper limits are also obtained for the quiet Sun surrounding the active region. We also discuss what can be achieved with new and improved HXR instrumentation on balloons.",

            "abstract": "As with many western US watersheds, the Nooksack River Basin faces strong pressures associated with climate variability and change, rapid population growth, and deep-rooted water law. This transboundary basin includes contributing areas in British Columbia, Canada, and has a long history of joint data collection, model development, and facilitated communication between governmental (federal, tribal, state, local), environmental, timber, agricultural, and recreational user groups. However, each entity in the watershed responds to unique data coordination, information sharing, and adaptive management regimes and thresholds, further increasing the complexity of watershed management. Over the past four years, participatory methods were used to compile and review scientific data and models, including fish habitat (endangered salmonid species), channel hydraulics, climate data, agricultural, municipal and industrial water use, and integrated watershed scale distributed hydrologic models from over 15 years of projects (from jointly funded to independent shared work by individual companies, agencies, and universities). A specific outcome of the work includes participatory design of a collective problem statement used for guidance on future investment of shared resources and development of a data-generation process where modeling results are communicated in a three-tiers for 1) public/decision-making, 2) technical, and 3) research audiences. We establish features for successful participation using tools that are iteratively developed, tested for usability through incremental knowledge building, and designed to provide rigor in modeling. A general outcome of the work is ongoing support by tribal, state, and local governments, as well as the agricultural community, to continue the generation of shared watershed data using models in a dynamic legal and regulatory setting, where two federally recognized tribes have requested federal court resolution of federal treaty rights. Our participatory modeling process aims to integrate disciplines and watershed processes over time and space, while building capacity for more holistic watershed-scale thinking, or community knowledge, by research, governmental and public interests.",

These implications are all potentially large, diverse, and persistent. During recent years, for example, more than half of the Amazon experienced droughts that were severe enough to cause increased tree mortality, reduced tree growth, and widespread forest fires, committing to the atmosphere between 1-2% of the carbon stocks of Amazon forests. As climate and land use change, Amazon droughts may become even more frequent and severe. However, most of the existing ecosystem models used to predict potential forest trajectories in Amazonia only accounts for the effects of climate forcing, although the interaction between fires and droughts is perhaps a more direct mechanism of abrupt forest degradation, especially for the southeastern Amazon. Thus, projections of future vegetation responses to climate change in Amazonia require more than simulation of global climate forcing alone and should also consider interactions of droughts, forest fires, and land-use change.",

            "abstract": "New, higher values of core thermal conductivity, together with the reliance of any early geodynamo on thermal convection, represent a paradox (Olson, 2013). These factors suggest either early Earth lacked an internally-generated magnetic field or novel mechanisms for driving an early dynamo. The oldest record of past field strength from in situ igneous rocks comes from 3.4 to 3.45 Ga dacites of the Barberton and Nondweni Greenstone belts of South Africa. These analyses, based on single silicate crystals containing magnetic inclusions with ideal recording characteristics, indicate a field strength within 50 to 70% of the present-day field (Tarduno et al., 2010). Much older igneous rocks are generally not viable as paleomagnetic recorders because of their high metamorphic state (amphibolite grade or higher). Here we discuss extending Earth's magnetic field history further back in time using Archean and Hadean zircons hosting magnetic inclusions that are now found in younger sedimentary units of low metamorphic grade. Thellier-Coe paleointensity data passing reliability checks from zircons of the Jack Hills belt (Western Australia) suggest the presence of a magnetic field at 3.55 Ga, thereby extending the core paradox by 100 million years. We will discuss our continuing efforts to test for the presence/absence of a dynamo field between 3.55 Ga and 4.2 Ga.",

            "abstract": "The current rapid reduction of sea ice in the Arctic has motivated numerous studies to look at how sea ice declines during times of climate warming and its impact on marine ecosystems. Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 is the last interglacial prior to the Holocene and has been characterized as having higher summer air temperatures and higher sea level compared to today. However, there is a scarcity of data for sea ice extent during MIS 5. This presents an opportunity to reconstruct sea ice during a previous warming that may be used as an analogue for future change. We aim to provide insight into how sea ice changed throughout MIS 5 and how this change impacted primary productivity at the Umnak Plateau in the southeastern Bering Sea. This region is not currently covered by sea ice at all; however, low-resolution work reveals that sea ice did reach the study area during glacial intervals.\nThis study uses high-resolution (500 year) bulk geochemistry, diatom taxonomy, and grain size analysis of marine sediments from the Umnak Plateau as proxies for primary production and sea ice conditions during MIS 5. Nitrogen isotopic measurements of marine sediments are a valuable recorder of nitrate utilization by primary producers. Diatom taxonomy gives corresponding ecological affinities, which are relatable to sea ice coverage, productivity, and sea surface temperatures. Grain size analyses from previous studies have shown clay- and silt-sized biogenic content with well-preserved diatom valves to be associated with interglacials and larger silt to sand-size siliclastic particles with fragmented diatom valves to be associated with glacials. In this study, the silt fraction appears to be constant while the clay fraction follows the oxygen isotope record from Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005, increasing during glacial intervals and stadials. This apparent contradiction with earlier work warrants further investigation.",

            "abstract": "Eutrophication due to runoff of N and P occurs in many impoundments in agricultural areas around the world with deleterious impacts on fisheries, drinking water, and recreational resources. Coursey Pond, a hypereutrophic, shallow, Coastal Plain mill pond located on the Murderkill River in central Delaware has seasonal algal blooms between May and October. High frequency automated water quality, meteorlogical, and flow observations initiated in June 2014 as part of the NEWRNet project provide insights into the relationships between hydrologic events, changes in water quality, and primary productivity.\nDuring blooms the pond becomes stratified, allowing for dissolved oxygen (DO) levels at the surface to exceed 150% saturation, while DO within 2 m of the surface to falls below 50% saturation. During fair weather turbidity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) also gradually rise. Turbidity, DOC, and DO quickly decrease in response to storms and increased flow, indicating that storms are important regulators of water column stratification. Decreases in primary productivity due to decreased sunlight, dilution by addition of rain and runoff, and mixing in response to storm winds and flows abruptly end blooms, although they often return within a few days of storm events. Analysis of hourly meterological data will help determine the importance of solar insolation, winds, and rainfall intensity to the timing, rate, and magnitude of these water quality changes.\nGroundwater is the primary source of water to the streams that feed the pond and delivers nitrogen as nitrate. Historical grab sample nitrate concentration data from summer months (<1 mg/L) in comparison to winter months (4-8 mg/L) indicate that primary productivity consumes nearly all available nitrate during algal blooms, and perhaps improving water quality in downstream areas. There is no clear relationship between storms, flow and nitrate in the short period of high frequency observations, when nitrate concentrations rarely exceed 1 mg/L. In contrast, a negative correlation between flow and nitrate is typically observed in Coastal Plain streams where groundwater is the dominant source of both water of nitrate. It is expected that the negative correlation between nitrate and flow will re-establish when phytoplankton growth decreases in the fall.",

            "abstract": "Most lightning flashes are comprised of strokes that have a channel to ground in which current flows on the order of one millisecond. While current is flowing in the channel, the channel produces optical emission. Typically, flashes have several of these strokes, resulting in the characteristic “flicker” of lightning when observed with the naked eye.\nHowever, there exists a class of lightning flashes in which one or more strokes sustain continuing current, i.e., a stroke in which a channel exists for tens of milliseconds, during which the channel remains luminous. These flashes are thought to be responsible for destructive events associated with lightning, e.g., forest fires. Despite the high impact, the occurrence of this class of flashes remain largely unexplored on a global scale.\nWhile long range, ground based VLF/LF systems can detect return strokes from hundreds of kilometers away, they are generally incapable of detecting the signature of continuing current flashes. However, optical detectors are well suited to identify this signature.\nIn this paper, we use data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) to identify a continuing current signature and quantify its occurrence on a global scale. Since in general LIS cannot uniquely identify a stroke that comes to ground on a flash by flash basis, we utilize ground based VLF/LF networks to further classify the data.

            "abstract": "Observational studies suggest that the QBO has impacts on tropical deep convection. During different QBO phases, tropical deep convection regions show related OLR anomalies, as well as shifts in the precipitation patterns. Giving a physical explanation for these results is difficult since the QBO signal mainly exists in the stratosphere and does not penetrate too far below the tropopause. We investigate this QBO influence on tropical convection with a cloud-resolving model with an associated idealized Walker circulation. The Walker circulation is simplified as a 2D circulation with a prescribed sinusoidal SST. QBO-like temperature perturbations are then added near the tropopause. Results show that the Walker circulation changes with these imposed temperature perturbations, and the change is sensitive to the height of the temperature forcing. By contrast, cloud-resolving simulations under radiative-convective equilibrium show little response to similar QBO perturbations. This suggests that the interaction between local convection and the large-scale circulation is crucial in determining the degree of influence of the QBO on tropical convection. Another crucial component is the cloud-radiation feedback, which enables the influence of high cloud anomalies near the tropopause to propagate to lower altitudes.",

            "abstract": "Marine sources of nitrous oxide (N2O), an important greenhouse gas, account for up to 25% of global emissions, out of which 25-75% originates from oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). The Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) OMZ is characterized by low to undetectable oxygen concentrations within the water column and is known to be a region of intense N2O cycling. However, the balance of processes regulating N2O production and emissions is still uncertain. The isotopic composition of dissolved N2O is a tracer of its production, transport, and consumption processes in the ocean. Here we use concentration, isotopic and isotopomeric measurements of dissolved N2O collected during cruise NBP1305 to the ETSP in 2013 to examine the processes affecting the distribution of N2O throughout the water column. Dissolved N2O concentrations ranged between 42-65 nmol/L at the edges of the oxycline while ranging between 6 -20 nmol/L at the core of the OMZ. The nitrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of dissolved N2O (reported as δ15N vs air N2 and δ18O vs VSMOW in units of ‰, respectively) displayed maxima coincident with the OMZ core. δ15N of N2O ranged between 14 - 22‰, δ18O of N2O ranged between 68 - 100‰ while site preference of N2O ranged between 39 – 60‰ at the OMZ core. Based on the T-S plot and N2O concentration profiles, there appears to be a strong correlation between N2O and water mass features within the OMZ. Thus, the differences in δ15N and δ18O of N2O along the north- south transect within the OMZ core may be related to differences in N2O production-consumption mechanisms along with N2O transport. Within the OMZ, the δ18O: δ15N relationship is also much lower than the 2.5:1 ratio expected for N2O consumption via denitrification, leading us to believe that both production and consumption processes are likely to be at play.",

            "abstract": "The combination of regionally high heat flow, deep basins, and permeable reservoir rocks in the eastern Great Basin may yield substantial new geothermal resources. We explore a deep sedimentary basin geothermal prospect beneath Tintic Valley in central Utah using new 2D and 3D models coupled with existing estimates of heat flow, geothermometry, and shallow hydrologic data. Tintic Valley is a sediment-filled basin bounded to the east and west by bedrock mountain ranges where heat-flow values vary from 85 to over 240 mW/m2. Based on modeling of new and existing gravity data, a prominent 30 mGal low indicates basin fill thickness may exceed 2 km. The insulating effect of relatively low thermal conductivity basin fill in Tintic Valley, combined with typical Great Basin heat flow, predict temperatures greater than 150 °C at 3 km depth. The potential reservoir beneath the basin fill is comprised of Paleozoic carbonate and clastic rocks. The hydrology of the Tintic Valley is characterized by a shallow, cool groundwater system that recharges along the upper reaches of the basin and discharges along the valley axis and to a series of wells. The east mountain block is warm and dry, with groundwater levels just above the basin floor and temperatures >50 °C at depth. The west mountain block contains a shallow, cool meteoric groundwater system. Fluid temperatures over 50 °C are sufficient for direct-use applications, such as greenhouses and aquaculture, while temperatures exceeding 140°C are suitable for binary geothermal power plants. The geologic setting and regionally high heat flow in Tintic Valley suggest a geothermal resource capable of supporting direct-use geothermal applications and binary power production could be present.",

However, the Fermi mission with superior gamma-ray sensitivity, has registered almost two dozen such flares. This number allows for investigations into the distribution of the relevant parameters governing these events, in part mitigating some of the observational bias due to instrument sensitivity. We report progress in quantifying key solar parameters that describe these events to see if pre-Fermi reports of this phenomenon misrepresent this class of events. The context for interpreting the gamma-ray data is a stochastic acceleration diffusion model that predicts the precipitation of high-energy ions accelerated in large loops. Two versions of this model are used: a leaky box and one that explicitly includes the spatial diffusion into the denser parts of the solar atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Plate tectonics framework is usually complex in a collision zone, where continental lithosphere is involved. In the young Taiwan orogeny, with geologic understanding and large new geodetic and subsurface datasets now available an environment has been created for testing tectonic hypotheses regarding collision and orogeny. Against the background of the commonly accepted view of Taiwan as a southward propagating, self-similar 2-D orogen, a fully 3-D structure is envisaged. Along the whole length of the island the convergence of the Eurasian plate (EUP) the Philippine Sea plate (PSP) takes shape with different plate configurations. In northern Taiwan the convergence occurs with simultaneous collision of the oceanic PSP with continental EUP and the northward subduction of the PSP; in the south, EUP, in the guise of the South China Sea rifted Eurasian continent, subducts toward the east; in central Taiwan collision of oceanic PSP with continental EUP dominates. When relocated seismicity and focal mechanisms are superposed on subsurface P and Vp/Vs velocity images the configurations and the kinematics of the PSP and EUP collision and subduction become clear. While in northern Taiwan the subduction/collision explains well the high peaks and their dwindling (accompanied by crustal thinning) toward the north. In the south, mountains rise above the east-dipping EUP subduction zone as the Eurasian continental shelf veers toward the southwest, divergent from the trend of the Luzon Arc – calling into question the frequently cited arc-continent collision model of Taiwan orogeny. High velocity anomaly and Benioff seismicity coexist in the south. Going north toward Central Taiwan the high velocity anomaly persists for another 150 km or so, but it becomes seismically quiescent. Above the quiescent section the PSP and EUP collide to build the main part of the Central Range and its parallel neighbor the eastern Coastal Range. Key implications regarding orogeny include: 1) Significant petrological changes may accompany the crustal thickening, e.g., eclogitization, and delamination, 2) Rather than the detachment the exhumation of the metamorphic core of the Central Range is the main engine of the orogeny, and 3) The lithosphere has a complex rheological structure, indicated, in part, by the spatial distribution of seismicity.",

            "abstract": "The Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) encompasses some of the warmest sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of the world oceans. This region influences seasonal and decadal variability of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and climate anomalies such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Long-term changes coupled with anomalous events like El Niño can greatly influence the position of the ITCZ and subsequently alter weather patterns on a global scale. WPWP dynamics may have contributed to the slowdown in global warming during the last decade. The processes that control these variations are complex, and gaining insight into these systems on decadal to centennial timescales is necessary to improve climate modeling and future predictions for drought or floods associated with global climate change. Chuuk Atoll (7°N, 152°E), located in the Federated States of Micronesia, is positioned within the WPWP at the northern extent of the mean boreal summer position of the ITCZ, making this location optimal for studying WPWP dynamics and ocean-atmosphere linkages. Two coral cores from the species Porites lobata were collected from the outer-atoll at Fannuk Island and the inner-atoll at Lobata Reef. Using stable isotope (δ18O and δ13C) composition and Sr/Ca trace metal analysis, the sites were identified as distinct hydrologic environments. Low seasonal variability in δ18O and Sr/Ca values at the outer-atoll site indicates a hydrologically-open system that is strongly influenced by the WPWP. At the inner-atoll site, δ18O and Sr/Ca values reflect a small seasonal SST cycle. In this hydrologically-restricted basin, the δ18O record is likely responding to salinity variations influenced by local climatology, specifically anomalously high or low precipitation events associated with ENSO. The average δ18O between 2003-2011 was 0.5‰ lighter at the inner-atoll site. These values can be interpreted as warmer sea surface temperatures and/or lower sea surface salinities, suggesting the inner-atoll coral is more sensitive to seasonal temperature and salinity variations. Comparison of these distinct proxy records could afford some new insights into overall trends and decadal variations in the ocean-atmosphere coupling in the WPWP.",

            "abstract": "The ongoing drought in California necessitates the conservation of existing water resources while protecting the water quality. There is a critical need to improve the understanding of evaporation losses from dairy lagoons in California, and their corresponding changes in pathogen levels in the lagoon wastewater. We have carried out preliminary studies involving extensive dairy lagoon water sampling, and batch-scale experiments. The dairy wastewater was collected from both primary and secondary lagoons in three counties of California (Merced, Tulare, and Glenn Counties) for enumerating the levels of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes. Subsequently, we conducted batch-scale experiments at mesophilic (31 and 37 ⁰C) and thermophilic temperatures (43 and 49 ⁰C) to understand the E. coli O157:H7 inactivation process and potential evaporative water losses. In addition, we compared the evaporation losses under the environment of biological activity and the environment of restricted biological activity (extreme environment with low pH). For E. coli O157:H7 enumeration, we used MacConkey agar, while for Salmonella spp., XLD agar was used. Listeria monocytogenes levels were measured using PALCAM agar (with selective supplement). In flushed dairy wastewater (fresh) samples, the average of E. coli O157:H7 levels were 2 × 104 CFU/mL. The average Listeria monocytogenes levels in flushed manure were 9 × 101. The levels of Salmonella spp. were non-detectable. In mesophilic condition (37 ⁰C) after 5 days of incubation, 8% of total water loss was observed, while at thermophilic temperature (49 ⁰C), 70% of total water loss was observed. After 5 days of incubation at 37 ⁰C, E. coli O157:H7 levels in flushed dairy manure were increased from 2.8 × 103 to 5.2 × 104 CFU/mL, while at 49 ⁰C, E. coli O157:H7 levels were reduced from 2.8 × 103 to 5 × 101 CFU/mL after 4 days of incubation. We anticipate that the results of this study would be useful in understanding the dynamics of water losses and pathogen inactivation in dairy lagoon wastewater.  ",

            "abstract": "Branching Acropora coral species have fast growth and carbonate production rates, and thus have functioned as important reef-building species throughout the Pleistocene and Holocene. Recently, net carbonate production (kg CaCO3 m-2 year-1) has been recognized as an important measure of reef health, especially when monitoring endangered species, such as Acropora cervicornis. This study examines carbonate production in a thriving population of A. cervicornis at the Coral Gardens reef in Belize. Photographic surveys were conducted along five transects of A. cervicornis-dominated reefs from 2011-2014. Matching photographs from 2013 and 2014 were scaled to 1 m2 and compared to calculate 84 individual A. cervicornis linear extension rates across the reef. Linear extension rates averaged 12.4 cm/yr and were as high as 17 cm/yr in some areas of the reef. Carbonate production was calculated two ways. The first followed the standard procedure of multiplying percent live coral cover, by the linear extension rate and skeletal density. The second used the number of live coral tips per square meter in place of percent live coral multiplied by the average cross-sectional area of the branches. The standard method yielded a carbonate production rate of 113 kg CaCO3 m-2 year-1 for the reef, and the tip method yielded a rate of 6 kg m-2 year-1. We suggest that the tip method is a more accurate measure of production, because A. cervicornis grows primarily from the live tips, with only limited radial growth and resheeting over dead skeleton. While this method omits the contributions of radial growth and resheeting, and is therefore somewhat of an underestimate, our future work will quantify these aspects of growth in a more complete carbonate budget. Still, our estimate suggests a carbonate production rate per unit area of A. cervicornis that is on par with other Caribbean coral species, rather than two orders of magnitude higher as reported by Perry et al (2013). Although gross coral production at Coral Gardens is high by Caribbean standards, further assessment is required to understand the complete carbonate budget and how well live coral growth may balance bio-erosion or future predicted high CO2 acidification at this site.",

In previous work with HiRISE images that confirmed the origin of these deposits, we: detailed their meter-scale morphology, constituent features, and variability; identified fractures of BU ice layers and NPLD scarps as additional mass-wasting facilitators; and, based on inter- and inter-annual monitoring, discovered that new deposits appear over time, thereby establishing mass wasting (of both BU and NPLD ice) as a currently active process.\nHere, we advance from qualitative descriptions of new, active processes to quantification of the rates at which they are occurring. From ~4 years of HiRISE observations, we cataloged the location, volume, source, and timing constraints of >160 landslide events along ~ 20 km of BU-NPLD scarp. Average rates are ~44 events/yr and ~2000 m3/yr, although 7 large events account for ~3/4 of the volume; this is a very geologically dynamic environment. BU events are more frequent and smaller than NPLD events, reflecting the relative thickness of ice source deposits but also perhaps differing proportions of two causal mechanisms: sand-removal undercutting and thermal-stress induced expansion, contraction, and fracturing. BU events prefer summer over spring; NPLD events strongly prefer fall-winter over spring-summer. We compare this observational data with 1) thermal stress models of the ice scarp to assess consistency in timing of activity, and 2) sublimation models of the ice scarp to assess the relative contributions to scarp retreat - our preliminary mass-wasting estimate is ~2.5 mm/yr. The value in developing such rate estimates is the potential to consider time scales in exploring aspects of large-scale north polar landscape evolution (e.g., retreating cap edges, the growth of proto-Chasma Boreale, etc.) and the release of water to the atmosphere.",

Precipitation affects these sectors as concerns about precipitation timing and intensity can affect the agricultural growing season, runoff, and subsequent water quality. Here, we examine precipitation projections for mid-century (2041-2065) within the Great Lakes basin (GLB) and two sub-regions using three climate model ensembles of varying resolutions to constrain and compare associated precipitation uncertainties. These include: 1. atmosphere-ocean models from the CMIP5 global simulations with the RCP 8.5 scenario (12 members, resolution ranging from ~1 to ~3 degrees), 2. dynamically downscaled regional climate models from NARCCAP with the SRES A2 scenario (4 members at ~0.5 degree resolution (50 km)), and 3. high resolution (~0.25 degree resolution (25 km)) regional climate model simulations with the RCP 8.5 scenario (RegCM (hereafter RCM3(HiRes)), 2 members). For the entire GLB, all three ensembles captured the intensity of historical events well, but with a bias in the high intensity precipitation events as compared to observed intensity, with fewer overprediction events by the NARCCAP and RCM3(HiRes) ensembles. Daily probability density functions from three model ensembles reveal consistent increases in high precipitation event probabilities for all seasons, even after accounting for wet model biases during the observation period (1980-1999). Comparing all three ensembles to the historical period for the GLB, both CMIP5 and NARCCAP ensembles capture the annual seasonal cycle with a wet bias in the winter and spring, while the RCM3(HiRes) ensemble shows a dry bias for all seasons except winter. For the Lake Michigan and Western Lake Erie basin sub-regions, the spring and winter biases remain present across ensembles, however the RCM3(HiRes) summer dry bias is reduced. Overall, the three climate model ensembles show consensus for an increase in precipitation intensity as well as increased seasonal spring and winter precipitation across the GLB.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is expected to have an impact on meteorological and therefore hydrological extremes, thereby possibly altering the vulnerability of exposed populations. Our study focuses on Bangladesh, which is particularly vulnerable to changes in extremes due to both the large population at risk, as well as geographical characteristics such as the low-rising slope of the country through which the outflow of the combined catchments of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers (GBM, ~1.75 million km2) is channeled.\nTime series of daily discharge and water level data for the past 100 years were analyzed with respect to trends in frequency, magnitude and duration, focusing on rare but particularly high-risk events using extreme-value theory. Mortality data is available for a five-year period (2003-2007), with a distributed lag non-linear model used to examine possible connections between extreme water levels and mortality.\nThen, using output from the Community Climate System Model CCSM4, projections were made regarding future flooding due to changes in precipitation intensity and frequency, while also accounting for the backwater effect of sea-level rise. For this, the upper catchment precipitation as well as monthly mean thermosteric sea-level rise at the river mouth outflow were taken from the four CCSM4 1° 20th Century ensemble members as well as from six CCSM4 1° ensemble members for the RCP scenarios RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5.\nResults show that while e.g. the mean water level did not significantly rise during the past 100 years, a change in extreme water levels can be detected. In addition, annual minimum water levels have decreased, which is of particular importance as there is a significant connection to an increase in mortality for low water levels. While mortality does not seem to increase significantly due to extreme floods, our results indicate that return levels projected for the future shift progressively, with the effect being strongest for RCP 8.5. Further measures to strengthen the resilience of the exposed population are therefore required to ensure that climate change effects do not overwhelm the population’s coping capacities.",

            "abstract": "The global peat carbon pool exceeds that of global vegetation and is similar to the current atmospheric carbon pool. Because fire is increasingly appreciated as a threat to peatlands and their carbon stocks, here we discuss controls on and effects of peat fires across biomes and how they vary. Peat fires are dominated by smoldering combustion, which is easier to ignite and persists under greater moisture content than flaming combustion. In undisturbed peatlands, the peat C stock typically is protected from deep smoldering, and fire resistance has played a role in tropical and boreal peat carbon storage over millennia. However, drying mediated by climate change and anthropogenic activity is altering peatland hydrology and increasing the frequency and extent of peat fires; in some cases, processes of drying and fire may be coupled in positive feedbacks that could result in increasingly large fires and consequent releases of carbon to the atmosphere. The combustion of deep peat affects older soil carbon that has not been part of the active carbon cycle for centuries to millennia, and will dictate the importance of peat fire emissions with respect to future climate change and human health effects.",

            "abstract": "Since a decade, observations and experiments conducted in underground environments worldwide (mines, underground research laboratories - URL) allowed to bridge the scale gap between laboratory scale and large earthquake scale. Indeed, underground rock laboratories allow developing decameter scale relatively well constrained experiments at the smallest distance from the hypocenters. URL’s experiments allowed developing new monitoring technologies coupling pressure-strain-seismic measurements and reproducing complete earthquakes sequence analogue to natural ones. They also allowed exploring past movements of faults and sometimes also paleofluids in three dimensions and characterizing different fault architectures and hydromechanical properties in unaltered conditions. This is particularly important in the study of faults affecting clay formations which could not be observed at the Earth’s surface because of the high alteration. Here we show how examples from the Mont Terri (Switzerland) and Tournemire (France) URLs may help in (i) defining the concepts of fault architecture in shales, complemented with some examples from Rustrel (LSBB URL, France) in carbonates, (ii) estimating fault hydromechanical properties from field decameter scale experiments. Some key results are that faults which are critically stressed or at the rupture limit can reactivate for stresses variations within the range of the ones produced by such shallow underground excavations, and that slight micrometer-to-millimeter scale reactivations may lead to large factor-of-10-to-more permeability increases. This appears to be more related to complex multi-scale geological processes linked to fault history such as differential hardening, partial sealing, pressure solution and gouge development within the fault zones than to the regional state of stresses.",

            "abstract": "As part of the “Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climate and Environmental Change” (SPRUCE) experiment, we made initial measurements of sulfur speciation in peat. These observations represent a “time-zero” relative to the intended soil warming experiment which begins in 2015. Total sulfur and sulfur speciation were measured in peat cores (solid phase) from nine plots (hollows and hummocks) to a depth of 2 m. Peat samples were packed under nitrogen and frozen in the field immediately after collection. All subsequent sample storage, handling, and processing were conducted under inert gas. Sulfur speciation was measured using bulk sulfur 1s X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy at the SXRMB instrument at the Canadian Light Source, Saskatoon, SK, Canada and at the 9-BM instrument, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, IL, USA. Total sulfur concentrations ranged from 968 to 4077 mg sulfur / kg dry peat. Sulfur content increased with depth from 2 g sulfur / m2 in the 0-10 cm increment to a maximum value of 38 g sulfur / m2 in the 50-60 cm increment. These sulfur loadings produced high quality XANES spectra. The nine cores exhibited reproducible trends with depth in both total sulfur and specific sulfur species; however, variability in sulfur speciation was greatest in the top 40 cm. All sulfur detected within the peat solids was in an organic form. The most abundant sulfur species group was composed of organic mono-sulfide and thiol forms, representing approximately half of the total sulfur at all depths. Sulfonate and ester-sulfate species were 10-15 mol% of sulfur and exhibited low variability with depth.  A subsurface maximum in organic di-sulfide was observed in the 20-30 cm depth increment, which is the transition zone between transiently oxidized acrotelm and permanently saturated anaerobic catotelm. Quantification of major sulfur pools is important for the SPRUCE experiment as they are likely to be indicators of changes in the oxidation-reduction (redox) status, and mercury methylation potential, of the peat in response to warming and enhanced carbon dioxide.",

            "abstract": "Bouguer gravity data, initial Sr isotope values, zircon U–Pb, and multiple occurrences of felsic Proterozoic rocks, have revealed an elevated, less deformed, felsic cratonic block in the northern Mexico. The block is situated in western Chihuahua and is bounded by active zones or mobile belts on three sides, and is here referred to as the Western Chihuahua Cratonic Block (WCCB). Bouguer gravity data clearly indicate a region of a highly negative anomaly (< -200 mgal) in contrast to adjoining areas. The region is large and the anomaly is relatively smooth over broad areas; the WCCB appears as a smaller version of the Colorado Plateau. The block is characterized by high initial Sr isotope ratios (<0.706). Several occurrences of Proterozoic rocks are located within or next to the WCCB, and they reveal the character of the Bouguer anomaly. On the east, at Los Filtros, Proterozoic rocks crop out in a basement cored uplift interpreted to having been derived from the WCCB during the Ouachita orogeny. At Sierra La Mojina boulders of 1.1 Ga granites are found in Permian conglomerates. And at Basasiachic, xenoliths of 1.1 Ga granites are present in ash flow tuffs. Establishment of the Precambrian character of the WCCB is of importance, and these multiple occurrences are evidence. Prior studies of the Sierra Madre Occidental suggest that the region was uplifted because of a vast Cenozoic batholith presumed to lie under the SLIP (Silicic Large Igneous Province), the Upper Volcanic Series. The present study challenges that conclusion and maintains the SMO is underlain by Proterozoic silicic crust. The geology of age dated samples supports this. The WCCB is surrounded on three sides by Active Zones or Mobile Belts, which have been active extensional and translational zones periodically over a long period of time. On the east are the Paleozoic Pedrogosa Basin, Mesozoic Chihuahua Trough and Cenozoic Rio Grande Rift, the first two of which also continue around the northern border of the block. On the west are the Paleozoic Sonora embayment and Mesozoic Sahuaripa basin. A possible model for the origin of the WCCB is that it was an integral part of the North American Proterozoic craton but has been displaced from North America by multiple episodes of extension associated with the mobile belts.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic change has been detected in many regions of the world in the form of trends in annual streamflows, varying depths to the regional water table, or other alterations of the hydrologic balance. Most models used to investigate these changes implement sophisticated descriptions of the physical system but use simplified descriptions of the socioeconomic system. These simplifications come in the form of prescribed water diversions and land use change scenarios, which provide little insight into coupled natural-human systems and have limited predictive capabilities. We present an integrated model that adds realism to the description of the hydrologic system in agricultural regions by incorporating a component that updates the allocation of land and water to crops in response to hydroclimatic (water available) and economic conditions (prices of commodities and agricultural inputs). This component assumes that farmers allocate resources to maximize their net revenues, thus justifying the use of optimality conditions to constrain the parameters of an empirical production function that captures the economic behavior of farmers. Because the model internalizes the feedback between climate, agricultural markets, and farming activity into the hydrologic system, it can be used to understand to what extent human economic activity can exacerbate or buffer the regional hydrologic impacts of climate change in agricultural regions. It can also help in the attribution of causes of hydrologic change. These are important issues because local policy and management cannot solve climate change, but they can address land use and agricultural water use. We demonstrate the model in a case study.",

During the summer of 2014 we\nbegan assessing the water quality at nearby Peralta Creek to compare the health\nof Courtland Creek with another one within the same watershed. In making our\nassessment we have analyzed samples collected from three different sites along both\ncreeks for Nitrate, Phosphate, and Ammonia concentration levels. Additionally, we\nconducted benthic macroinvertebrate surveys at one site along each creek. Preliminary\nresults indicate that nitrate levels in Courtland Creek waters are very high, which we\nbelieve is the result of human and animal waste entering into the creek. There were also\nunusually high levels of Phosphate and Ammonia detected in creek waters. Such high\nconcentrations were noted in a past study and in an attempt to address this problem we\ninitiated a native plant restoration project at one particular site located at the intersection\nof Courtland and Thompson avenues. This effort has resulted in a reduction in levels\nof Nitrate, Phosphate and Ammonia. The average levels of these compounds in waters\ncollected near the restoration site were lower than those found in samples collected at\nother sites. However, they are still well above levels that are harmful to invertebrates\nand fish. Nitrate, Phosphate and Ammonia concentration levels in samples collected\nfrom Peralta Creek were significantly lower than those collected from Courtland Creek.\nFor example, the maximum level of nitrate detected in Courtland Creek waters was\n50 PPM while the maximum found in Peralta Creek waters was 15 PPM. We have\nconcluded that the observed high levels of various compounds are the result of animal\nwaste and human feces spilling directly into Courtland Creek.

Remote sensing can be utilized to track these responses and ecosystem functioning in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. This study elucidates these climate-phenology relations in native chaparral- and coastal sage scrub-dominated ecosystems in southern California. Whole ecosystem phenology is monitored for the period 2000-2014 using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from MODIS MOD13Q1. Changes in phenology are assessed through comparison of the time series with raw data and anomalies of temperature, precipitation, and Palmer Drought Indices (Modified Drought Index and Z Index) data to address the following questions: 1) Which climatic factors have the greatest impact on southern California whole ecosystem phenology? And 2) What are the differences between chaparral- and coastal sage scrub-dominated ecosystems? In addressing these questions, special consideration is given to late 2013/ 2014; a season of exceptional drought. We find that anomalous Palmer Drought Indices show highest correlations with vegetation NDVI. Each vegetation type displays a different response to short-term climate; with chaparral ecosystems having highest correlations with drought indices, and coastal sage scrub correlations highest with discrete precipitation events and temperature. Climate anomalies had little to no correlations with NDVI, indicating that the phenology of these native plants may be highly resilient to short-term changes in climate.",

            "abstract": "Drought is a natural disaster with serious implications to environmental, social and economic well-being at local, regional and global scales. In its third year, California’s drought condition has seriously impacted not just the agricultural sector, but also the natural resources sector including forestry, wildlife, and fisheries. As of July 15, 2014, the National Weather Service drought monitor shows 81% of California in the category of extreme drought. As future predictions of drought and fire severity become more real in California, there is an increased awareness to pursue innovative and cost-effective solutions that are based on silvicultural treatments and controlled burns to improve forest health and reduce the risk of high-severity wildfires. The main goal of this study is to develop a GIS map of the drought-impacted region of northern and central California using remote sensing data. Specifically, based on a geospatial database for the study region, Landsat imagery in conjunction with field and ancillary data will be analyzed using a combination of supervised and unsupervised classification techniques in addition to spectral indices such as the Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI). This spectral index basically scales the line perpendicular to the soil line defined in the Red-NIR feature space in conjunction with added information about vegetative fraction derived using NDVI. The image processing will be conducted for two time periods (2001 and 2014) to characterize the severity of the drought. In addition to field data, data collected by state agencies including calforests.org will be used in the classification and accuracy assessment procedures. Visual assessment using high-resolution imagery such as NAIP will be used to further refine the spatial maps. The drought severity maps produced will greatly facilitate site-specific planning efforts aimed at implementing resource management decisions.",

            "abstract": "In order to improve the representation of the land surface and subsurface properties and their associated feedbacks with climate forcings, climate change, and drivers in Earth System Models (ESMs), detailed observations need to be made at climatically relevant spatial and temporal scales. Pan-Arctic spatial heterogeneity and temporal variation present major challenges to the current generation of ESMs. To enable highly spatially resolved and high temporal frequency measurements for the independent validation of modeled energy and greenhouse gas surface fluxes at core to intermediate scales, we have developed, tested, and deployed an automated observational platform, the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment (NGEE)-Arctic Tram. The NGEE-Arctic Tram, installed on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) near Barrow, AK in mid May 2014, consists of 65 meters of elevated track and a fully automated cart carrying a suite of radiation and remote sensing instrumentation. The tram transect is located within the NGEE eddy covariance tower footprint to help better understand the relative contribution of different landforms (e.g. low center vs high center polygonal tundra and associated vegetation) to the overall energy budget of the footprint. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), soil moisture, and soil temperature sensors are acquired autonomously and co-located with the tram to link subsurface properties with surface observations. To complement the high frequency and fine spatial resolution of the tram, during the summer field seasons of 2013 and 2014 a portable version of the NGEE-Arctic Tram (also know as the portable energy pole or PEP); was used to characterize surface albedo, NDVI, surface temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) across two ~500 m BEO transects co-located with subsurface ERT and ground penetrating radar (GPR) measurements. In addition, a ~ 3 Km transect across three drained thaw-lake basins (DTLB) of different climate-change relevant ages (from 50 years to more than 3000 years old) was measured with PEP. Soil surface CO2 and CH4 flux measurements were co-located with tram and PEP measurements. These data will enhance our understanding of the spatial distribution of climate forcing variables across the Arctic landscape through validation of Earth system models.",

            "abstract": "Northwest South America is actively deforming through the interaction between the Nazca, South American, and Caribbean plates. Though the Colombian Andes are well studied, much uncertainty remains in the rate of Quaternary deformation along the east directed frontal thrust faults hundreds of kilometers in board from the subduction zones. The eastern foothills of the Eastern Cordillera (EC) preserve deformed landforms, allowing us to quantify incision rates. Using 10Be in-situ terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) geochronology, we dated 2 deformed fluvial terraces in the hanging wall of the Guaicaramo thrust fault. From the 10Be concentration and terrace profile relative to local base level, we calculated incision rates. We present a reconstructed slip history of the Guaicaramo thrust fault and its Quaternary slip rate. Furthermore, to quantify the regional Quaternary deformation, we look at the fluvial response to tectonic uplift. Approximately 20 streams along the eastern foothills of the Eastern Cordillera (EC) were studied using a digital elevation model (DEM). From the DEM, longitudinal profiles were created and normalized channel steepness (Ksn) values calculated from plots of drainage area vs. slope. Knickpoints in the longitudinal profiles can record transient perturbations or differential uplift. Calculated Ksn values indicate that the EC is experiencing high rates of uplift, with the highest mean Ksn values occurring in the Cocuy region. Mean channel steepness values along strike of the foothills are related to increasing uplift rates from south to north. In contrast, we suggest that high channel steepness values in the south appear to be controlled by high rates of annual precipitation.",

            "abstract": "In the “Standard Flare Model” energy from accelerated electrons is deposited at the footpoints of newly reconnected flare loops, heating the surrounding plasma. Understanding the relation between the multi-thermal nature of the footpoints and the energy flux from accelerated electrons is therefore fundamental to flare physics. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images of bright flare kernels, obtained from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, are often saturated despite the implementation of automatic exposure control. These kernels produce diffraction patterns often seen in AIA images during the most energetic flares. We implement an automated image reconstruction procedure, which utilizes diffraction pattern artifacts, to de-saturate AIA images and reconstruct the flare brightness in saturated pixels. Applying this technique to recover the footpoint brightness in each of the AIA EUV passbands, we investigate the footpoint temperature distribution. Using observations from the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), we will characterize the footpoint accelerated electron distribution of the flare. By combining these techniques, we investigate the relation between the nonthermal electron energy flux and the temperature response of the flare footpoints.",

            "abstract": "High magnitude flood events can completely restructure fluvial systems and condition subsequent geomorphic and ecological regimes. The effects of such disturbances depend on factors such as existing morphology, flood magnitude and duration, and sediment supply. However, the inherent rarity of large floods makes untangling potential controls and interactions difficult. In this study, we take advantage of complete high resolution topographic and air photo data sets collected with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing to assess the reach-scale effects of catastrophic flooding that occurred in Alberta, Canada in June 2013. In particular, we combine 2D flow models with pre- and post-flood topographies to constrain the range of conditions during high flow on two rivers, and then relate these conditions to observed changes. We find that flooding on the Elbow River led to a complete channel restructuring associated with tractive forces well above thresholds for sediment transport, whereas the Kananaskis River experienced less drastic change and maintained its channel pattern. Consequently, morphodynamics are more reliably predicted using pre-flood data for the Kananaskis River. Physical changes are then related to in-stream hydraulic habitat, and implications for post-flood channel readjustment are discussed. This work provides a detailed analysis of relationships between flooding, channel morphology, and aquatic habitat in two contrasting systems, with implications for predictive capacity and stream ecosystem management.",

From these, we derive the local electron density and the ratio of O+ to S2+ and S+ in the torus. Since these quantities are difficult or impossible for the JAXA EXCEED mission to measure directly, our data are quite complementary. In contrast to the FUV, the brightness of the optical wavelength emissions peaks in the \"ribbon\" region of the torus, a consequence of the factor of 5 lower photon energies. S+ also shows a secondary brightness peak in the cold inner torus region. Typical observed electron densities in the ribbon region are around 3000 cm-3.",

Closest approach is expected to occur at 18:30 UT on the 19th October. This provides an opportunity for a ``free’’ flyby of a different type of comet than those investigated by spacecraft so far, including comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko currently under scrutiny by the Rosetta spacecraft. At the same time, the passage of the comet through Martian space will create the opportunity to study the reaction of the planet’s upper atmosphere to a known natural perturbation. The flip-side of the coin is the risk to Mars-orbiting assets, both existing (NASA’s Mars Odyssey & Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA’s Mars Express) and in transit (NASA’s MAVEN and ISRO’s Mangalyaan) by high-speed cometary dust potentially impacting spacecraft surfaces. Much work has already gone into assessing this hazard and devising mitigating measures in the precious little warning time given to characterise this object until Mars encounter.\nIn this presentation, we will provide an overview of how the meteoroid stream and comet coma dust impact models evolved since the comet’s discovery and discuss lessons learned should similar circumstances arise in the future.",

            "abstract": "Low water availability is a major constraint in crop production, especially as agriculture is pushed to marginal lands. Therefore, improving drought resistance such as increasing water use efficiency (WUE) through plant breeding is needed to expand the range of soil water availability adequate for food production. With the goal of finding the genomic basis for WUE in C4 grasses, Setaria viridis makes an ideal model species because of its small size, short lifespan, and sequenced genome. Also it is part of the panicoid grass clade, which is one of the most important clades for food and biofuel production. In plant breeding programs, large numbers of genotypes must be quickly screened for drought resistance traits, but there is no well-defined method of screening for WUE in C4 grasses. However, bulk leaf oxygen (Δ18OBL) and carbon (δ13C) isotopic signatures have shown potential as recorders of transpiration rate (E) and stomatal conductance (gs), and combined with biomass production potentially serve as a measure of WUE. Values of Δ18OBL record differences in transpiration rate because leaf water becomes more enriched as transpiration rate decreases, and leaf tissue records the isotopic composition of leaf water in which it is synthesized. Additionally, in C4 plants δ13C values decrease as gs decreases but the change in δ13C in response to gs may not be adequate to tease apart differences in WUE. In this study, we grew S. viridis plants under well-watered and water-limited conditions to determine if Δ18OBL and δ13C could be used as proxies for E and gs, and be used to screen S. viridis for differences in WUE in breeding programs. The Δ18OBL and δ13C were significantly different between well-watered and water-limited plants and correlated with each other and with E, gs, and instantaneous water use efficiency (Anet/gs). Therefore, Δ18OBL and δ13C can be useful proxies to screen genotypes for drought resistance by recording differences in E, gs, and WUE. Measuring Δ18OBL and δ13C are relatively simple and quick, requiring the collection of a single leaf sample from each genotype instead of making laborious gas exchange measurements of E and gs.",

            "abstract": "An understanding of physiological limitations to tree establishment at alpine treeline form the basis for predicting how this climate-driven boundary will respond to climate shifts. Most research on this topic has focused on limitations related to carbon balance and growth of trees. Carbon balance could limit survival and establishment primarily through slow-acting, chronic means. We asked whether tree survival and thus establishment patterns reflect control by chronic effects in comparison to acute, threshold responses, such as survival of frost events. Seedling survivorship patterns were compared to thresholds in freezing (temperature causing leaf freezing, or freezing point, FP; and physiological response to freezing) and water status (turgor loss point, TLP; and related physiological adjustments). Subject seedlings were from forest, treeline, and alpine sites in the Alpine Treeline Warming Experiment in Colorado, and included limber and lodgepole pine (a low-elevation species), and Engelmann Spruce. Preliminary results show survival increases with seedling age, but the only corresponding increase in stress acclimation was photosynthetic resistance to freezing and TLP, not FP. Differences in survivorship among the species were not consistent with variation in FP but they generally agreed with variation in photosynthetic resistance to deep freezing and to early-season drought avoidance. Mortality of limber pine increased 35% when minimum temperatures decreased below -9C, which compares with FPs of >-8.6C, and about 1/3 of its mortality occurred during cold/wet events, particularly in the alpine. The other major correlate of mortality is midsummer drying events, as previously reported. Also in limber pine, the TLP for year-old seedlings (-2.5 MPa) corresponded with seasonal-drought mortality. In summary, we show several examples of correspondence in physiological thresholds to mortality events within a species, although the relationships are not strong. Across species, photosynthetic resistance to freezing and early-season drought avoidance related well to mortality patterns. These results are generally more supportive of the role of chronic rather than acute climate effects in broad patterns of tree seedling establishment at treeline.",

            "abstract": "InTeGrate (serc.carleton.edu/integrate/) is the geoscience component of NSF’s STEM Talent Expansion Center program. As such, it is a $10M, 5 year effort, with dual goals of improving undergraduate STEM education and addressing an important national challenge, which in InTeGrate’s case is environmental sustainability.\nInTeGrate is very complicated, involving five PI’s, dozens of curriculum developers, scores of workshops and webinars, hundreds of faculty, and thousands of students. To get a handle on this complexity, the leadership team and evaluators are viewing project activities and outcomes through a system thinking lens, analogous to how geoscientists view the Earth system. For each major component of the project, we have a flowchart logic model that traces the flows of information, materials, influence, and people that are thought to result from project activities. As is to be expected in a complex system, individual activities are often influenced by multiple inputs and contribute to multiple outputs. The systems approach allows us to spot critical points in the system where evaluative probes are needed; for example, are workshops actually resulting in a flux of new people into roles of increased responsibility within InTeGrate as intended?\nInTeGrate is permeated with opportunities for participants to engage in assessment, reflection and peer-review. From a systems perspective, this evaluative culture can be seen as an effort to create reinforcing feedback loops for processes that advance InTeGrate’s values. For example, assessment team members review draft instructional materials against a materials development rubric and coach developers through an iterative development cycle towards materials that embody InTeGrate’s priorities.\nOf particular interest are flows of information or influence that may carry InTeGrate’s impact outward in space and time beyond activities that are directly funded by the project. For example, positive experiences during materials development may influence developers’ teaching practice such that they embed InTeGrate’s methods into their teaching of non-InTeGrate materials and advocate for InTeGrate methods on their campuses. Only if such influence pathways exist will InTeGrate be able to achieve national and enduring impact.",

            "abstract": "The Continuously Operating Caribbean Observational Network (COCONet) is a collaborative project to create an international network of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations in the Caribbean for natural hazards research. Atmospheric data products generated from COCONet include estimates of column integrated tropospheric water vapor, precipitation, as well as measurements of surface temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and horizontal winds. Upon completion in late 2014, the network will consist of at least 50 new and refurbished stations, with an additional 60 contributing stations. More than 30 of these stations now have a data record of at least two years, with some of the contributing stations operating for more than seven years. Previous research indicates that current atmospheric analysis and reanalysis models of the Caribbean have biases in precipitable water vapor (PWV) that are dependent on the magnitude of PWV. Analysis conditions appear too moist in relatively low PWV conditions, and too dry when there is relatively large PWV. Stations with data records spanning multiple seasonal cycles can now be used to evaluate some of the annual signals that are contained within the data record. We use continuous records of GPS derived PWV and satellite derived sea surface temperatures (SST) to assess the relative degree of coupling between local SST conditions and atmospheric water vapor. This analysis provides a way to differentiate areas that are strongly influenced by local sources of moisture to those locations where moisture is advected from more distant sources.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation generation in a cumulus cloud depends on the nature of available aerosols and the turbulent entrainment of dry air. These two processes were observed in the orographic clouds during the DOMEX (Dominica Experiment) field campaign. On days with thermally driven convection, little precipitation develops and the orographic clouds are composed on average of clouds with 125 cm-3 droplet number concentration and 15 μm cloud droplet diameter. Aerosol number concentrations as high as 325 cm-3 are found in the detrained air above the tropical island of Dominica. The island surface aerosol source and the relatively dry cloud layer are two independent variables that play a role in the composition and development of the observed orographic clouds.\nWe use idealized 3D WRF simulations with the new aerosol-aware Thompson and Eidhammer microphysics scheme to compare with observations. A 1 km high mountain with a constant surface sensible heat flux drives convection with no background wind. Four simulations are performed to explore the parameter space with and without an aerosol source, and with a dry and moist cloud layer: (1) aerosol source / dry, (2) aerosol source / moist, (3) no source / dry, and (4) no source / moist. The aerosol source is composed of an organic-like aerosol with a mean radius of 0.08 μm and a hygroscopicity of 0.6. The aerosol flux comes only from the island surface at a rate of 5 aerosols cm-3 s-1 or 1.5x108 aerosols m-2 s-1. Precipitation efficiency, drying ratio, and microphysical conversion rates of liquid water are computed and tracked, and cloud and rain water mass and number budgets are completed. Comparing the development of orographic clouds and precipitation in the four simulations leads toward an improved understanding of the observations and the relative controls on convection.",

            "abstract": "Estuarine water column methylmercury (MeHg) is an important driver of bioaccumulation in pelagic organisms so it is important to understand the sources and cycling of MeHg. As MeHg biomagnifies in food webs, increased water column concentrations can be transferred to fish consumed by humans. Few studies have taken a multi-estuary approach to look at MeHg cycling in the water column of these important MeHg producing areas. We examined the distributions and partitioning of sediment and water column MeHg across a geographic range of estuaries. In 2008 we sampled 10 shallow-water estuarine sites from Maine to New Jersey, sampled 11 sites in 4 estuaries in 2009, and sampled at 3 estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) sites in 1 estuary in 2012. Sediment measurements included both solid phase and pore water MeHg and total mercury (HgT). Water column parameters included dissolved and particulate MeHg and HgT, total suspended solids, nutrients, and dissolved organic carbon. Average suspended particle MeHg was highest at Wells (ME; 6 to 11.5 pmol/g; 4.5 to 7% of HgT) and lowest at Portsmouth (NH) and in Long Island Sound (CT-NY; 0.2 to 5.5 pmol/g; 0.25 to 3.75% of HgT). Average water column dissolved MeHg was highest in the Delaware River ETM (0.5 to 0.7 pM; 16 to 24% of HgT) and lowest at Portsmouth (0.06 to 0.12 pM; 1 to 2% of HgT). Significant positive correlations were found between MeHg and HgT across multiple estuaries in both sediment and the water column in 2008 and 2009. In contrast, water column dissolved and suspended particle MeHg do not correlate well with sediment MeHg or HgT, pore water MeHg or methylation rates in sediment across estuaries, indicating that sediment is often not a good predictor of water MeHg levels. However, ratios of average dissolved:pore water MeHg and suspended particle:sediment MeHg are close to 1 in the Delaware River ETM, suggesting that sediment supplies MeHg to the water column in this turbulent region, but average pore water MeHg was uniformly elevated above water dissolved MeHg in the other estuaries studied. Several estuaries had higher MeHg at low tide suggesting input as water was delivered from the watersheds. We conclude that the relative importance of sources is dependent on the physical (water residence time, water depth) and chemical characteristics (sediment organic carbon content) of the estuary.\n ",

            "abstract": "Groundwater quality is a concern in alluvial aquifers underlying agricultural areas worldwide, an example of which is the San Joaquin Valley, California. Nitrate from land applied fertilizers or from animal waste can leach to groundwater and contaminate drinking water resources. Dairy manure and synthetic fertilizers are the major sources of nitrate in groundwater in the San Joaquin Valley, however, septic waste can be a major source in some areas. As in other such regions around the world, the rural population in the San Joaquin Valley relies almost exclusively on shallow domestic wells (≤150 m deep), of which many have been affected by nitrate. Consumption of water containing nitrate above the drinking water limit has been linked to major health effects including low blood oxygen in infants and certain cancers. Knowledge of the proportion of each of the three main nitrate sources (manure, synthetic fertilizer, and septic waste) contributing to individual well nitrate can aid future regulatory decisions. Nitrogen, oxygen, and boron isotopes can be used as tracers to differentiate between the three main nitrate sources. Mixing models quantify the proportional contributions of sources to a mixture by using the concentration of conservative tracers within each source as a source signature. Deterministic mixing models are common, but do not allow for variability in the tracer source concentration or overlap of tracer concentrations between sources. Bayesian statistics used in conjunction with mixing models can incorporate variability in the source signature. We developed a Bayesian mixing model on a pilot network of 32 private domestic wells in the San Joaquin Valley for which nitrate as well as nitrogen, oxygen, and boron isotopes were measured. Probability distributions for nitrogen, oxygen, and boron isotope source signatures for manure, fertilizer, and septic waste were compiled from the literature and from a previous groundwater monitoring project on several dairies in the San Joaquin Valley. Median percent contribution of nitrate to wells from fertilizer, manure, and septic waste generally match the expected source based on land use patterns, with some exceptions.",

            "abstract": "Paleomagnetic results from a 150m thick stack of 15.2 my old lava flows in the Sheep Creek Range (north central Nevada; 40.7N, 243.2E) show that distinctive aspects of the reversing geomagnetic field can recur after 1.5 million years. The Sheep Creek lavas preserve a partial record of what is likely the C5Br-C5Bn geomagnetic reversal. That event occurred 1.5 million years and five polarity switches after reversal (C5Cr-C5Cn) recorded in great detail at Steens Mountain in SE Oregon. During both transitions, the VGP made repeat visits to low latitude positions in South America and near Africa although in different order. This behavior implies a control that varies over a timescale much longer that associated with flow in the outer core (~60 yrs), presumably lateral variations in lower mantle temperature or topography on the core-mantle boundary. Furthermore, the field in both reversals moved from clearly transitional to normal-polarity-like (i.e., down and north) directions before “rebounding” to intermediate directions. It has been suggested recently (Valet et al., Nature 2012) that this kind of behavior (i.e., directional change in the form of precursor- main polarity switch-rebound) may be a systematic aspect of transitional field behavior, a suggestion reinforced by these new observations.\nThe distinctive, two component magnetization of a particular lava flow in the Sheep Creek section has been interpreted by Bogue and Glen (GRL, 2010) as evidence of directional change (~1 deg/week) orders of magnitude faster than normal secular variation. If the field was strong at the end of the directional change, then a large change in the local geomagnetic field vector is implied by the directional data for any initial field strength. Preliminary paleointensity experiments aimed at resolving this aspect of the record are in progress.",

            "abstract": "Over the past century, various anthropogenic activities have resulted into loss of more than 95% shrub cover from the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV), TX, USA. Restoration of these shrublands has been a priority for two endangered felids, ocelots and jaguarondis, that require contiguous shrub cover. While woody shrub restoration may be considered the antithesis of shrub encroachment, this type of habitat restoration also provides a substantial opportunity of increasing carbon sequestration. Restoration of these shrublands by U.S. federal refuge managers during the past three decades have resulted some successful reestablishment of native shrub communities. We assessed restoration efficacy, carbon storage capacity, and future climate change impacts using combined remote sensing and modeling techniques. We first developed a canopy identification algorithm using a spectral vegetation index from the Digital Ortho Quarter Quadrangle data to estimate individual shrub canopy area. The area was used as input into allometric equations to estimate aboveground biomass for dominant shrub species across this region. The accuracy of the automated canopy identification by the algorithm was 79% when compared to the number of visually-determined, hand-digitized shrub canopies. From this analysis, we found that naturally regenerated sites had higher average shrub densities of 174/ha when compared with 156 individuals/ha for replanted sites. However, average biomass for naturally regenerated sites (3.28 Mg C/ha) stored less biomass compared to that of replanted sites (3.71 Mg C/ha). We found that average biomass per shrub in naturally regenerated sites was lower compared to that of replanted sites (p < 0.05). Shrub density and biomass estimated from the remote sensing data was used as input for the Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth model to predict future shrub biomass for three GCM scenarios projected by IPCC (2007). Modeling showed that the LRGV may produce lower biomass per ha for the projected higher emission scenarios compared to lower emission scenarios. We conclude that restoration efforts within LRGV have contributed to increasing shrub density and sequestering carbon in tissue biomass, but future climate change is likely to reduce its carbon sequestration potential.",

We have made spectroscopic observations of comets using both long-slit and integral-field unit spectrographs on the Harlan J. Smith telescope at the University of Texas McDonald Observatory in order to study radical species in cometary comae. We will discuss the techniques used to extract chemical abundances in comets from these data and show how the spatial distribution of the observed species and large-scale coma morphological features (e.g. jets or fans) are mapped and characterized. Analyses of data we have acquired for several comets to date will be presented that examine their chemical abundances, track the temporal evolution of coma morphology in relation to nuclear rotational behavior (where known), and gauge potential chemical heterogeneity of cometary nuclei. We will also place this work into broader context by comparing our results to existing large-sample photometric and spectroscopic surveys of comets, as well as comparing our results to those obtained during prior apparitions to determine whether these comets show any evolutionary changes in measured chemical abundances or sources of outgassing on their surfaces.

            "abstract": "Small oxygen deficient zones (ODZs) below the ocean surface play a major role in regulating marine biological productivity, through the removal of bioavailable nitrogen (N). Recent observations have shown diverse microbial communities affecting N metabolic pathways, but the large-scale consequences of this complexity are unknown. Here we investigate the key microbial interactions and their importance for N loss in a circulation and ecosystem model of the largest ODZ, in the North Pacific. The microbial model replicates observed chemical distributions, but exhibits fundamentally distinct behavior from traditional models based on chemistry alone. The ecosystem undergoes local oscillations that create large variability in the regional rate of N loss, even in a steady circulation. These N loss fluctuations occur at the boundary between oxic and anoxic waters, where miniscule fluctuations in scarce resources are driven by competitive dynamics and dramatically shift the balance between aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The coexistence of these populations and their competing geochemical effects reduces overall rates of N loss while expanding the scale of anoxic waters. Intrinsic ecosystem oscillations also cause dramatic swings in the ratio of heterotrophic to autotrophic N loss pathways, possibly underlying the wide variations observed in nature.",

            "abstract": "Debris flows are massive flows consisting of mixtures of particles of different sizes and interstitial fluids such as water and mud. In sheared mixtures of different-sized (same density) particles, it is well known that larger particles tend to go up (toward the free surface), and the smaller particles, down, commonly referred to as the “Brazil-nut problem” or “kinetic sieving”. When kinetic sieving fluxes are combined with advection in flows, they can give rise to a spectacular range of segregation patterns. These segregation / advection dynamics are recognized as playing a role in the coarsening of a debris flow front (its “snout”) and the coarsening of the self-formed channel sides or levees. Since particle size distribution influences the flow dynamics including entrainment of bed materials, modeling segregation dynamics in debris flows is important for modeling the debris flows themselves.\nIn sparser systems, the Brazil-nut segregation is well-modeled using kinetic theory applied to dissipative systems, where an underlying assumption involves random, uncorrelated collisions. In denser systems, where kinetic theory breaks down we have recently developed a new mixture model that demonstrates the segregation fluxes are driven by two effects associated with the kinetic stress or granular temperature (the kinetic energy associated with velocity fluctuations): (1) the difference between the partitioning of kinetic and contact stresses among the species in the mixture and (2) a kinetic stress gradient. Both model frameworks involve the temperature gradient as a driving force for segregation, but kinetic theory sends larger particles toward lower temperatures, and our mixture model sends larger particles away from lower temperatures. Which framework works under what conditions appears to depend on correlations in the flow such as those manifested in clusters and force chains. We discuss the application of each theoretical framework to representing segregation dynamics in debris flows and the application to modeling flow and entrainment as they depend on particle size distributions.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex and poorly understood mixture of natural organic compounds that play important roles in terrestrial C transport and biogeochemical cycles, and its reactivity makes it sensitive to seasonal variations and longer term climate change. As a component within the LBNL Science Focus Area 2.0, this study is designed to determine the spatial and temporal variability of DOM concentrations and characteristics throughout the vadose zone and groundwater within a semi-arid floodplain at Rifle, Colorado. Three sets of vertically stratified pore water samplers and wells were installed along a groundwater flow transect. These installations allowed acquisition of vertically- and temporally-resolved pore water samples from the vadose zone, capillary fringe, and saturated zone from April 2013 to May 2014. Ultraviolet-visible absorbance (UVA) and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy are being applied to trace the changes in DOM characteristics. Initial results indicate that the aromatic C contents (%) of DOM vary with depth and season and exhibit patterns distinct from groundwater. EEM analysis identified fulvic- and humic-like substances as the major fluorescent components of DOM in pore water samples. The concentrations of fulvic- and humic-like matter decreases with depth within the vadose zone, and increases from Spring and Summer to Fall, then decreases in Winter. The trend is consistent with UVA results. Microbial by-product-like components in DOM show higher concentrations in the vadose zone, and decrease from Spring to Winter. Fulvic- and humic-like substances are the only detectable fluorophore components in the groundwater samples. The results from both UVA and EEM suggest that (1) aromatic C or fulvic- and humic-like matter are preferentially adsorbed within shallower sediments during transport; and (2) microbial transformations of DOM composition may occur in the vadose zone, particularly during late Spring and early Summer.",

            "abstract": "Soil water storage and dynamics are of critical importance for a variety of processes in terrestrial ecosystems, including agriculture. Many of those systems are under significant pressure in terms of water availability and use. Therefore, assessing alternative scenarios through hydrological models is an increasingly valuable exercise. Soil water holding capacity is defined by the concepts of soil field capacity and plant available water, which are directly related to soil physical properties. Both concepts define the energy status of water in the root system and closely interact with plant physiological processes. Furthermore, these concepts play a key role in the environmental transport of nutrients and pollutants. Soil physical parameters (e.g. saturated hydraulic conductivity, total porosity and water release curve) are required as input for field-scale soil water redistribution models. These parameters are normally not easy to measure or monitor, and estimation through pedotransfer functions is often inadequate. Our objectives are to improve field-scale hydrological modeling by: (1) assessing new undisturbed methodologies for determining important soil physical parameters necessary for model inputs; and (2) evaluating model outputs, making a detailed specification of soil parameters and the particular boundary condition that are driving water movement under two contrasting environments.\nSoil physical properties (saturated hydraulic conductivity and determination of water release curves) were quantified using undisturbed laboratory methodologies for two different soil textural classes (silt loam and sandy loam) and used to evaluate two soil water redistribution models (finite difference solution and hourly cascade approach). We will report on model corroboration results performed using in situ, continuous, field measurements with soil water content capacitance probes and digital tensiometers. Here, natural drainage and water redistribution were monitored following a controlled water application where the study areas were isolated from other water inputs and outputs. We will also report on the assessment of two soil water sensors (Decagon Devices 5TM capacitance probe and UMS T4 tensiometers) for the two soil textural classes in terms of consistency and replicability.",

We intend for these slide sets to help Astronomy 101 instructors include new developments (discoveries not yet in their textbooks) into the broader context of the course.\nIn a similar effort to keep the astronomy classroom apprised of the fast moving field of planetary science, the Division of Planetary Sciences (DPS) has developed the Discovery slide sets, which are 3-slide presentations that can be incorporated into college lectures. The slide sets are targeted at the Introductory Astronomy undergraduate level. Each slide set consists of three slides which cover a description of the discovery, a discussion of the underlying science, and a presentation of the big picture implications of the discovery, with a fourth slide includes links to associated press releases, images, and primary sources. Topics span all subdisciplines of planetary science, and sets are available in Farsi and Spanish.

The modeling results reported in [Pasko, GRL, 41, 179, 2014] are consistent with the existence and continuous advancement of VHF-dark positive leaders at the positive end of the bi-directional leader system. It was demonstrated that the electric dipole moment of the entire leader system is a quadratic function of the leader length, and the dipole moment changes due to the leader steps increase proportionally to the overall leader length (i.e., even when step length remains constant), in good agreement with observations. In particular, the model time dynamics of the vertical electric field as would be observed on the ground at 30 km horizontal distance exhibited a progressive increase in electric field changes during steps of the negative leader, very similar to cases reported by Marshall et al. [2013]. We note that the data set reported in [Winn et al., 2011] in addition to the electric field components measured by balloon-borne electric field change instrument in the close vicinity to the IC leader, also contains a ground based electric field measurements. The purpose of this work is to conduct quantitative comparisons of the model results with these measurements. The obtained results and related analysis are supportive of the bi-directional leader ideas. We will present a comparison of model results obtained with and without advancement of the positive leader that indicate that the stalled positive leader model leads to unrealistic behavior of electric field components at close and long ranges from the IC leader when compared to observations.",

            "abstract": "Many astrobiological/exobiological studies have been directed at searching for evidence of life on planetary bodies within our solar system, but the search for life does not have to be restricted to our stellar neighborhood. The field of exoplanet research has grown rapidly over the last several years. Studies have moved beyond detection to assessing the habitability and biosignatures of these worlds. The biosignatures considered thus far focus on biogenic gases and planetary surface features, such as the light reflected from the surface of plants to generate the “red edge” of vegetation. Much work has focused on detecting biosignatures of higher life forms (vegetation) on exoplanets. However, land plants only appeared on the Earth 450 million years ago, and required a long path of photosynthetic evolution. There is a dearth of studies examining how light might interact with much simpler, more evolutionarily ancient pigmented communities, such as photosynthetic microbes. These anoxygenic phototrophs, which have inhabited Earth for nearly 80% of its history, may dominate exoplanets at a similar stage of evolution as the Archean or Paleoproterozoic Earth.\nSimilar to the remotely detectable “red edge” of chlorophyll a – containing vegetation, we measured the reflectance spectra of pure cultures and environmental samples of purple sulfur, purple non-sulfur, heliobacteria, green sulfur, and green non-sulfur anoxygenic phototrophs. We observed an increase in reflectivity just past the absorption maximum for the bacteriochlorophyll pigments. Since this reflectance feature is shifted into the NIR compared to that of the red edge of vegetation, we’re calling this the “NIR edge” of anoxygenic phototrophs. The bacteriochlorophyll pigments are particularly well suited to absorb the far-red and near-infrared radiation emitted by M dwarf stars, the most common type of star in our galaxy. Therefore these phototrophs serve as model organisms for photosynthesis adapted to alternative spectral environments.",

            "abstract": "What does the general US public know, or think they know, about Arctic change? Two broad nationwide surveys in 2006 and 2010 addressed this topic in general terms, before and after the International Polar Year (IPY). Since then a series of representative national or statewide surveys have carried this research farther. The new surveys employ specific questions that assess public knowledge of basic Arctic facts, along with perceptions about the possible consequences of future Arctic change. Majorities know that late-summer Arctic sea ice area has declined compared with 30 years ago, although substantial minorities -- lately increasing -- believe instead that it has now recovered to historical levels. Majorities also believe that, if the Arctic warms in the future, this will have major effects on the weather where they live. Their expectation of local impacts from far-away changes suggests a degree of global thinking. On the other hand, most respondents do poorly when asked whether melting Arctic sea ice, melting Greenland/Antarctic land ice, or melting Himalayan glaciers could have more effect on sea level. Only 30% knew or guessed the right answer to this question. Similarly, only 33% answered correctly on a simple geography quiz: whether the North Pole could best be described as ice a few feet or yards thick floating over a deep ocean, ice more than a mile thick over land, or a rocky, mountainous landscape. Close analysis of response patterns suggests that people often construct Arctic \"knowledge\" on items such as sea ice increase/decrease from their more general ideology or worldview, such as their belief (or doubt) that anthropogenic climate change is real. When ideology or worldviews provide no guidance, as on the North Pole or sealevel questions, the proportion of accurate answers is no better than chance. These results show at least casual public awareness and interest in Arctic change, unfortunately not well grounded in knowledge. Knowledge problems seen on these surveys highlights both the need and the challenge of communicating polar science.",

            "abstract": "Subglacial volcanoes provide insight into Antarctic geothermal flux, a critical parameter for understanding ice sheet stability. Behrendt and others have identified a region in the West Antarctic Rift System that they hypothesize to be volcanic in nature. Here, a combined airborne gravity/radar analysis of data collected during 1994/1996 and 2004/2005 surveys is applied to test the region of interest's proposed volcanic origin. The reprocessed gravity disturbance more accurately accounts for aircraft dynamics and cross seasonal differences, producing improved resolution of the gravity field. Likewise, the new bed simulation created by Goff et al. 2014 (Journal of Glaciology) represents a significant advancement over previous interpolations of the surveyed region. We add supplementary radar data to further improve this model and maintain the continuity of additional recognizable topographic features.\n2 1/2 and 3D forward modeling of Behrendt's “caldera-like” model and hypothesized volcano Mt. Thiel, constrained by the bed topography, produces an inferred gravity field to be compared with the observed gravity field. Although other influences on the gravitational field, such as isostatic compensation, cannot be definitively ruled out without additional constraining information, the results are consistent with a volcanic province as hypothesized. This type of gravity/radar analysis represents a valuable approach that can be used elsewhere to characterize the distribution of volcanic edifices that can be sources of heterogeneous heat flux, allowing for the better understanding of ice sheet basal conditions and their implications for ice sheet evolution and potential instability.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between the carbon and sulfur cycles in the Neoproterozoic has proven to be complex. Unusually high δ13Ccarbonate persists throughout this period, however large negative excursions precede both the Sturtian (~710 Ma) and the Marinoan (635 Ma) glaciations, the mechanisms of which are still debated. Previous data shows that during the interglacial interval, sulfate concentrations were very low and abnormally enriched δ34Spyrite values inversely correlate with shifts in δ13Ccarbonate. However, very little carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) could be extracted from these sections. To better understand the relationship between the global carbon and sulfur cycles during this tumultuous time, high-resolution coupled records of δ13Ccarbonate and δ34Ssulfate are needed. Here we present paired δ34Ssulfate and δ34Spyrite data from carbonates of the Coates Lake Group (Mackenzie Mountains, Canada), which represent deposition preceding the Sturtian glaciation, to further explore the connection between the Neoproterozoic sulfur and carbon cycles, and to gain insight into the possible mechanisms driving major perturbations in the carbon isotope record. Leading into the glaciation, δ13Ccarbonate increases from -9.5‰ to 8‰ over approximately 200 meters of section, then abruptly drops to ~2‰ over 30 meters. Both sulfate and pyrite isotopes track these changes, indicating that as organic carbon burial is steadily increasing and driving δ13Ccarbonate more positive, pyrite burial is increasing as well. Δ34S decreases as δ13Ccarbonate and δ34S increase, providing further evidence that more organic carbon and pyrite are being buried, leading to a decrease in oceanic sulfate concentrations. Δ34S then increases as δ13Ccarbonate decreases, indicating a positive flux to the sulfate reservoir prior to the Sturtian glaciation. This relationship between carbon and sulfur differs significantly from what is seen during the interglacial interval, and represents one of the earliest occurrences of positively coupled changes between carbon and sulfur isotopes in the Neoproterozoic.",

            "abstract": "The mechanisms of soil organic matter (SOM) protection and their relationship with carbon inputs and decomposition are poorly understood. We used Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to characterize SOM in soils exposed to litter-input exclusion or addition for 20 years, and subsequently incubated for more than a year. Our aim was to describe shifts in SOM content and chemical composition due to the input manipulation and degree of decomposition, particularly in the light (i.e., free particulate, younger) versus the heavy (mineral-adsorbed, older) fractions of SOM, and to link these shifts to carbon mineralization rates.\nThe soils were collected from a deciduous hardwood forest in Meadville, PA, one of the Detritus and Input Removal Treatment (DIRT) sites. They were subjected to either litter and root exclusion (NI), double litter (DL), or ambient inputs (CO) for 20 years and subsequently incubated at 35oC for 525 days. Soils from the beginning and end of the incubation were divided into light and heavy fractions using 1.8 g cm-3 sodium polytungstate. Bulk CO soils and heavy fractions of NI, DL, and CO soil were analyzed with FTICR-MS, while light and heavy fractions were analyzed with FTIR.\nTwenty years of input exclusion decreased the mineralization rate, the total carbon respired, and total carbon content, though litter addition had no significant effect (NI < CO = DL). The FTICR-MS and FTIR data reveal substantial differences in SOM chemistry among DIRT treatments, fractions, and before and after incubation. CO contained several classes of compounds, including alcohols and phenols, not detected in either DL or NI soils, and all samples showed an enrichment in aromatics between the light and heavy fractions. The heavy fraction DL soils were proportionally enriched in lipids compared to NI and CO soils, and these lipids were preferentially mineralized during incubation. Heavy fraction CO and NI soils were similar initially, though CO soil lost primarily lipids, while NI soil lost unsaturated hydrocarbons and proteins. These results indicate the complex interrelationships between litter inputs and soil carbon content, chemistry, and SOM decomposition.",

            "abstract": "Short and long term effects of site water availability impacts the spectrum of management outcomes including landslide risk, hydropower generation, and sustainable agriculture in mountain systems heavily influenced by climate and land use changes. Climate change and land use may predominantly affect the hydrologic cycle of mountain basins as soil precipitation interception is affected by land cover. Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, we estimated stream discharge and sediment yield associated with climate and land use changes for two Himalaya basins located at eastern and western margins of Nepal that included drainages of the Tamor and Seti Rivers. Future climate change was modeled using average output of temperature and precipitation changes derived from Special Report on Emission Scenarios (B1, A1B & A2) of 16 global circulation models for 2080 as meteorological inputs into SWAT. Land use change was modeled spatially and included 1) deforestation, 2) expansion of agricultural land, and 3) increased human settlement that were produced by considering current land use with projected changes associated with viability of elevation and slope characteristics of the basins capable of supporting different land use types. We found higher annual stream discharge in all GCM-derived scenarios compared to the baseline with maximum increases of 13 and 8% in SRES-A2 and SRES-A1B for the Tamor and Seti basins, respectively. With 7% of original forest land removed, sediment yield for Tamor basin was estimated to be 65% higher, but increased to 124% for the SRES-B1 scenario. For the Seti basin, 4% deforestation yielded 33% more sediment for the SRES-A1B scenario. Our results indicated that combined effects of future, intensified monsoon rainfall with deforestation lead to dramatic potential for increased stream discharge and sediment yield as rainfall on steep slopes with thin exposed soils increases surface runoff and soil erosion in the Himalayas. This effect appears to be geographically important with higher influence in the eastern Tamor basin potentially due to longer and stronger monsoonal period of that area. Future slope stability and sediment deposition in downstream reservoirs are important future potential vulnerabilities for these basins of which land management plays an important mediating role.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed hourly temperature records over 30 years for 486 snow telemetry (SNOTEL) stations at the highest elevations in 13 states across the western USA. Trends determined using robust linear modeling (resilient to outliers) across the region are 0.88 +/- 0.09 C/decade, which is about three times the magnitude of the regional warming trend and six times the trend in global mean temperatures. Temperature trends across SNOTEL sites are not significantly correlated with elevation (r^2 = 0.03). Trends at most sites are strongest in fall and winter, and weakest in spring and summer. The much faster warming at very snowy sites in the western USA relative to the global mean might be related to “alpine amplification” through snow-albedo feedback. To evaluate this hypothesis we analyzed trends in the number of days with significant snow cover at the same 486 sites for which temperature trends were obtained. High-elevation warming was most rapid in Arizona, New Mexico, and southern Colorado, where trends at 23 sites exceeded 1.25 C/decade. These sites also showed strong trends toward fewer days with snow cover of more than 5 days per decade. Increasing dust deposition has been documented on mountain snowpack in that region, probably contributing to shorter snow seasons and warmer temperatures. Warming trends are typically weakest in the Pacific Northwest, northern Utah and southwest Wyoming where many stations have warmed less than 0.5 C/decade. Many of these sites have significantly more days with significant snow cover which may slow warming. Trends in both temperature and snow-covered days elsewhere in the Rocky Mountains are intermediate. Rapid warming trends at the snowiest sites in the western USA have important implications for projections of water supply in the region in coming decades.",

During 1990-2000, the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, the tsunami scientific community took on the difficult task of developing the modeling capability that would provide accuracy needed for long-term tsunami forecast — tsunami hazard maps. After exhaustive field, laboratory and modeling efforts by the international scientific community, the modeling capability has been achieved with accuracy deemed sufficient for operational use. Several real-time model forecast tools started to be used at TWCs in the US and Japan. In parallel, the observational component of tsunami warning systems had been improving, including updated existing seismic and coastal sea-level stations array. New early detection and measurement system (DART) has been developed specifically for tsunami forecast applications.\nThe 2004 Sumatra tsunami has triggered the efforts of intensive implementation of science results into operational tsunami warning capabilities. At present, several tsunami forecast systems, based on various modeling and detection capabilities, are operational. Since 2004, over 40 tsunamis, including the 2011 Japanese tsunami, provided real-time tests for the tsunami forecast system capabilities. Preliminary assessment of tsunami forecast performance will be presented based on the analysis of the U.S. operational tsunami inundation forecast. Assessing forecast performance is important to evaluate the needs for improvement and further research. Baseline of the tsunami forecast skills has now been established and will be presented based on the data from the tsunamis during the decade. Future improvements and future challenges will also be discussed.",

To\nthe west, undeformed tonalite is dominant. Moving east, tonalite becomes foliated and\nmylonitized in places. Further east, the full transition to the footwall is unclear as it is covered\nby Quaternary deposits. While roughly continuous on a regional level, there is no clear cut\nband of mylonite that can be followed locally for greater than several hundred meters. The\nmylonitized tonalite shows lower amphibolite to upper greenschist facies metamorphism,\nwhich may indicate why there is no local uninterrupted band of mylonitization, as it\nmetamorphosed at the brittle/ductile transition. Dated at ~92MA, it is surmised that\ndeformation ended no later than 65-70MA due to 40Ar/40K dates from biotite in the\nmylonitized tonalite. Felsic pegmatite dikes also cut through the area, showing evidence of\nductile shear in some places, but again, not consistently throughout the region.\nDetailed mapping of the area shows a synformal structure of tonalitic mylonite between\nundeformed tonalite. Foliations are roughly perpendicular to the hinge line of the synform.\nThis evidence, along with intermittent mylonitization, indicates non-uniform deformation. No\nevidence of overprinting was seen in the synform, suggesting that the fold formed after the\nmajority of ductile deformation.",

Yet our understanding of critical processes and interactions along the Arctic land-ocean interface is limited. Arctic-COLORS is a Field Campaign Scoping Study funded by NASA's Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program that aims to improve understanding and prediction of land-ocean interactions in a rapidly changing Arctic coastal zone, and assess vulnerability, response, feedbacks and resilience of coastal ecosystems, communities and natural resources to current and future pressures. Specific science objectives include:\n- Quantify lateral fluxes to the arctic inner shelf from (i) rivers and (ii) the outer shelf/basin that affect biology, biodiversity, biogeochemistry (i.e. organic matter, nutrients, suspended sediment), and the processing rates of these constituents in coastal waters.\n- Evaluate the impact of the thawing of Arctic permafrost within the river basins on coastal biology, biodiversity and biogeochemistry, including various rates of community production and the role these may play in the health of regional economies.\n- Assess the impact of changing Arctic landfast ice and coastal sea ice dynamics.\n- Establish a baseline for comparison to future change, and use state-of-the-art models to assess impacts of environmental change on coastal biology, biodiversity and biogeochemistry.\nA key component of Arctic-COLORS will be the integration of satellite and field observations with coupled physical-biogeochemical models for predicting impacts of future pressures on Arctic, coastal ocean, biological processes and biogeochemical cycles. Through interagency and international collaborations, and through the organization of dedicated workshops, town hall meetings and presentations at international conferences, the scoping study engages the broader scientific community and invites participation of experts from a wide range of disciplines, to refine our science objectives and outline detailed research strategies needed to attain these objectives. The deliverable will be a comprehensive report to NASA outlining the major scientific questions, and developing the initial study design and implementation concept.",

The mechanical models inherently allow slips along through-going and discontinuous faults and the viscosity of the lithospheric sheet relaxes unreasonable stress build-up.

Theoretical treatments of ARedi often assume it should scale as the eddy energy or the growth rate of mesoscale eddies,. producing a picture where it is high in boundary currents and low )of order a few hundred m2/s) in the gyre interiors. However, observational estimates suggest that ARedi should be very large (of order thousands of m2/s) in the gyre interior. We present results of recent simulations comparing a range of spatially constant values ARedi (with values of 400, 800, 1200 and 2400 m2/s) to a spatially resolved estimate based on altimetry and a zonally averaged version of the same estimate. In general, increasing the ARedi coefficient destratifies and warms the high latitudes. Relative to our control simulation, the spatially dependent coefficient is lower in the Southern Ocean, but high in the North Pacific, and so the temperature changes mirror this. We also examine the response of ocean hypoxia to these changes. In general, the zonally averaged version of the altimetry-based estimate of ARedi does not capture the full 2d representation.",

The Mars crust is at least 20 times more intensely magnetized, on average, than Earth's crust. The Mars crust formed by crustal spreading in the presence of a reversing dynamo, a continuous process that is capable of producing uniform volume magnetizations over global scale distances. No other proposed mechanism can match the efficiency of plate tectonics in this regard. We apply a novel downward continuation method to magnetic survey data acquired from orbit and show that at ever greater spatial resolution, the hallmarks of plate tectonics (magnetic lineations, transform faults) are evident in the magnetic imprint. Where catastrophic volcanic flows have buried the crust at great depth (volcanic edifices and the northern lowlands) the primordal magnetic imprint has been effectively erased. This indicates that the effective magnetic carrier in the crust is confined to a layer no more than a few km thick and that magnetization intensities of order ~100 A/m exist throughout the magnetized crust. The average Mars crustal rock must therefore be a rock that acquires impressive magnetization intensity cooling under conditions prevalent in the Mars crust some 4 billion years ago, during the dynamo age.",

            "abstract": "Over millennial timescales, the oceanic reservoir of fixed nitrogen (N) is regulated by a balance between N loss in sediments and low oxygen (O2) waters, and N2-fixation by diazotrophic phytoplankton. The two processes are coupled by selection for diazotrophs under N-limited conditions that arise from denitrification, although the spatial scale of this coupling is debated. A strong local coupling has been argued against because the export of newly fixed N would boost nearby denitrification rates, stimulating further N2-fixation in overlying water, resulting in runaway N loss and deoxygenation of the ocean. Using a global ocean circulation model with a prognostic ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles, we show that no such runaway feedback arises. Even when the majority of N2-fixation occurs directly above suboxic zones, N sources and sinks quickly reach a stable equilibrium without widespread N depletion. Taking a systems dynamics approach, we derive a “feedback factor” (f) for the interaction of N inputs and losses, which depends on the stoichiometry of diazotroph biomass, ventilation of the tropical thermocline, and upwelling rate of denitrified waters. Under modern conditions of ocean circulation and O2 solubility, f is much lower than 1 – the value that separates stable and runaway amplification of a system response – and the oceanic N reservoir is remarkably insensitive to spatial proximity of N sources and sinks, as might accompany the alleviation of diazotroph Fe-limitation. Based on these parameters, we identify climatic conditions that might push the system into a runaway feedback regime, allowing for periods of catastrophic N loss and deoxygenation during Earth’s history.",

            "abstract": "Marine organisms and ocean ecosystems are increasingly stressed by human-induced changes. Since many of these stressors – including rising ocean temperatures, ocean acidification, ocean deoxygenation, and perturbations to ocean biological productivity – co-occur in time and space, marine organisms and ocean ecosystems are increasingly being subjected to the simultaneous impact of multiple stressors. The cumulative impact of multiple stressors on ocean ecosystems may lead to damages far more severe than those from individual threats alone.\nDetecting trends in the individual and combined stressors, however, is challenged by natural variability of the climate system. Here we use a 30-member ensemble simulation from GFDL's Earth System Model ESM2M under a historical/RCP8.5 concentration pathway over the period 1950 to 2100 to evaluate the time of emergence (ToE) at which the signal of changes in the individual and combined ecosystem stressors emerges from the noise of natural climate variability. The natural variability of the ensemble suite is used to quantify the variance in the system against which the ensemble mean signal is to be detected.\nWe show that the ToE in ocean acidification occurs much earlier than for other stressors, namely at the end of the 20th century in most regions of the global ocean. In contrast, for primary productivity the signal does not emerge from the noise over most of the global ocean before the end of the 21st century. The ToE pattern for sea surface temperature with early emergence simulated in high latitudes has reversed spatial patterns relative to the deoxygenation ToE pattern in the top 100 to 600 meters. However, for sea surface temperature, the trend emerges earlier (late 20th/early 21st century) for the majority of the tropical oceans, compared mid-21st century for ocean deoxygenation. The combined ToE for the different multiple stressors and the implications for adaption and mitigation policies will be discussed.",

The network includes over 60 new and refurbished continuously operating Global Positioning System (GPS) and surface meterology stations. It will also include data from at least 60 existing stations that are being operated by one of our more than 40 regional partners. As COCONet approaches the completion of its build-out phase, it is appropriate to evaluate the activities associated with the project that facilitate capacity building. These activities include three workshops to solicit feedback from regional partners regarding science objectives, station location, and long-term network operation. COCONet graduate research fellowships have been used to support nine students, with seven from countries within the COCONet footprint. The establishment of three regional data and archive centers to foster access to data and promote free and open data standards. Lastly, two Pan American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) workshops on topics that are central to the main goals of COCONet were also organized to engage early career scientists who are interested in working on topics that are directly relevant to the region. Perhaps the most significant effort on expanding capacity in the region is the recent deployment of a station in Camaguey, Cuba with full support from both the U.S. and Cuban governments.

            "abstract": "We report the first observations at 56 MHz (MORRO radar) of the overshoot effect in the polar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE) when they are subject to artificial high power HF pulsed waves (Heating). Statistics indicate that there is an overall overshoot at this frequency despite of the high fluctuation of the backscatter. Simultaneous and co-located PMSE measurements at 224 MHz (EISCAT VHF radar) show also the overshoot effect. This experimental campaign was done around the peak of the PMSE season in 2013. The overall effect of the active modification of the PMSE strength is studied through the overshoot characteristic curve (OCC). At 224 MHz, available PMSE OCC measurements and modeling results indicate that during Heating the time scale of electron diffusion is shorter than the charging of dust particles. In this way, the free electron Bragg scatter structures surrounding dust particles are dispersed right after the Heating is turned on and leading to a decrease of the PMSE strength which can be followed by a recovery due to a slight increase of dust particle charging while the pulse is still active. Once the Heating is turned-off, the electrons cool down almost instantaneously and adopt the spatial distribution defined by dust particles, which at this time they are expected to be more charged due to influx of electrons. A highlight in this study is that we found some particular cases at 56MHz and 224MHz indicating that dust charging may overcome the diffusion process. This condition is known as the onset overshoot in which the backscatter increases after the heater was switched on. We have resorted to available models of the PMSE OCC at these two frequencies for finding similarities with our observations; especially those related to the onset overshoot. Through this evaluation we provide discussions about the differences between present measurements and model results, and plausible interpretation of physical conditions of particles and processes constituting PMSE observations included in this work.",

            "abstract": "Pescadero Lagoon is a complex lagoon system located on the central California coast in San Mateo County. Over the last decade, external stressors such as degraded water quality, restricted circulation, heightened groundwater withdrawals, changes in the fluvial geomorphology that affect surface water runoff, and widespread agriculture in the watershed have impacted the lagoon. The lagoon system is bounded on the marine side by an ephemeral sand berm that is seasonally closed and so hinders open exchange with the ocean. This berm and the Mediterranean-type climate play an important role in the lagoon’s circulation and water quality. The most high-profile and deleterious effect of reduced ocean-lagoon exchange and restricted water circulation is the occurrence of bottom-water low oxygen events that can trigger seasonal fish kills. This project employed a suite of geophysical and geochemical techniques to better understand the role of groundwater on lagoon water and constituent balances. The main objective of this research was to quantify groundwater seepage rates into Pescadero Lagoon across broad spatial and temporal scales using electrical resistivity, temperature, and Radon-222 (222Rn) as tracers of groundwater movement. Resulting seepage rate estimates were then used to derive associated nutrient flux estimates, which can be compared to atmospheric and riverine nutrient load estimates to yield more comprehensive nutrient budgets. The groundwater seepage into the lagoon for the time period of March 2013 to February 2014 was relatively low and did not exceed 0.2 m/day.

Mechanistic understanding of the effects of long-term and transient moisture conditions are needed to quantify linkages between changing redox conditions, microbial activity, and soil mineral and nutrient interactions on C cycling and greenhouse gas releases. To illuminate relationships between the soil chemistry, microbial communities and organic C we established transects across hydraulic and topographic gradients in a small watershed with transient moisture conditions. Valley bottoms tend to be more frequently saturated than ridge tops and side slopes which generally are only saturated when shallow storm flow zones are active. Fifty shallow (~36”) soil cores were collected during timeframes representative of low CO2, soil winter conditions and high CO2, soil summer conditions. Cores were subdivided into 240 samples based on pedology and analyses of the geochemical (moisture content, metals, pH, Fe species, N, C, CEC, AEC) and microbial (16S rRNA gene amplification with Illumina MiSeq sequencing) characteristics were conducted and correlated to watershed terrain and hydrology. To associate microbial metabolic activity with greenhouse gas emissions we installed 17 soil gas probes, collected gas samples for 16 months and analyzed them for CO2 and other fixed and greenhouse gasses. Parallel to the experimental efforts our data is being used to support hydrobiogeochemical process modeling by coupling the Community Land Model (CLM) with a subsurface process model (PFLOTRAN) to simulate processes and interactions from the molecular to watershed scales. Including above ground processes (biogeophysics, hydrology, and vegetation dynamics), CLM provides mechanistic water, energy, and organic matter inputs to the surface/subsurface models, in which coupled biogeochemical reaction networks are used to improve the representation of below-ground processes. Preliminary results suggest that inclusion of above ground processes from CLM greatly improves the prediction of moisture response and water cycle at the watershed scale.",

            "abstract": "Delineating flood zones in systems that are susceptible to flooding from a single mechanism (riverine flooding) is a relatively well defined procedure with specific guidance from agencies such as FEMA and USACE. However, there is little guidance in delineating flood zones in systems that are susceptible to flooding from multiple mechanisms such as storm surge, waves, tidal influence, and riverine flooding. In this study, a new flood mapping method which accounts for multiple extremes occurring simultaneously is developed and exemplified. The study site in which the method is employed is the Tijuana River Estuary (TRE) located in Southern California adjacent to the U.S./Mexico border. TRE is an intertidal coastal estuary that receives freshwater flows from the Tijuana River. Extreme discharge from the Tijuana River is the primary driver of flooding within TRE, however tide level and storm surge also play a significant role in flooding extent and depth. A comparison between measured flows at the Tijuana River and ocean levels revealed a correlation between extreme discharge and ocean height. Using a novel statistical method based upon extreme value theory, ocean heights were predicted conditioned up extreme discharge occurring within the Tijuana River. This statistical technique could also be applied to other systems in which different factors are identified as the primary drivers of flooding, such as significant wave height conditioned upon tide level, for example. Using the predicted ocean levels conditioned upon varying return levels of discharge as forcing parameters for the 2D hydraulic model BreZo, the 100, 50, 20, and 10 year floodplains were delineated. The results will then be compared to floodplains delineated using the standard methods recommended by FEMA for riverine zones with a downstream ocean boundary.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost contains large stocks of organic carbon (C) that are vulnerable to decomposition following thaw, which could increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions leading to a potential C-climate feedback. Despite their global importance, GHG emissions from thawing permafrost are difficult to predict due to their complex mechanisms. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms controlling GHG flux from permafrost soil, comparing CH4 and CO2 production. We simulated permafrost thaw under drained and anoxic conditions at 1 and 15 °C, and measured CH4 and CO2 production. We also measured soil chemical and biological parameters (e.g. mid-infrared spectroscopy, iron speciation, soil redox, and next generation sequencing of the 16S gene).\nAll treatments produced considerable amounts of CO2 (oxic, 15 °C: 0.3-2.0 mg CO2-C gdws-1). CH4 production was highly variable (anoxic, 15 °C: 0.4-67 μg CH4-C gdws-1), which was not explained by soil C content (2-603 μg CH4 g soil C-1). We explored the reasons behind this seemingly random variability in CH4 production, and found that it can be explained by the activity of non-methanogenic anaerobes and substrate supply. For example, we found that the activity of iron reducers improved the fit of CH4 production model, reducing second order bias correction (AICc) from 80 to 38, as did a gross measure of anaerobic activity (AICc reduced from 80 to 60), however neither was statistically significant (p>0.05). In methanogenesis, the lability, rather than the total chemistry of the dissolved organic matter, was important for determining gas production, but the opposite was found to be important for predicting CO2 production. Differences in methanogen populations likely also contributed to the variability in the CH4 production, and further analysis of the 16S gene abundances will elucidate this. In summary, production of CH4 depends not only on the methanogens themselves, but also on the activity of the non-methanogenic anaerobes and the lability of the DOM. Thus, methanogenesis should be viewed as a process dependent on a consortium of anaerobes. Because the prediction of GHG fluxes is critical to our understanding of the impact of permafrost C on the global C cycle, a more mechanistic understanding of the processes governing anaerobic GHG flux will be crucial.",

            "abstract": "Air pressure constrains atmospheric composition, which, in turn, is linked to the Earth system through biogeochemical cycles and fluxes of volatiles from and to the Earth’s interior. Previous studies have only placed maximum levels on surface air pressure for the early Earth [1]. Here, we calculate an absolute value for Archean barometric pressure using gas bubble size (vesicle) distributions in uninflated basaltic lava flows that solidified at sea level 2.7 billion years ago in the Pilbara Craton, Western Australia. These vesicles have been filled in by secondary minerals deposited during metasomatism and so are now amydules, but thin sections show that infilling did not change vesicle dimensions. Amygdule dimensions are measured using high-resolution X-ray tomography from core samples obtained from the top and bottom of the lava flows. The modal size expressed at the top and at the bottom of an uninflated flow can be linked to atmospheric pressure using the ideal gas law. Such a technique has been verified as a paleoaltimeter using Hawaiian Quaternary lava flows [2]. We use statistical methods to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the volumetric size of the amygdules by applying ‘bootstrap’resampling and the Central Limit Theorem. Our data indicate a surprisingly low atmospheric pressure. Greater nitrogen burial under anaerobic conditions likely explains lower pressure. Refs: [1] Som et al. (2012) Nature 484, 359-262. D. L.

We employed iterative, multistep relocation procedures that initially correct for large location errors present in standard global earthquake catalogs, followed by a simultaneous inversion of delay times formed from regional and teleseismic arrival times of first and later arriving phases. An efficient multi-scale double-difference (DD) algorithm is used to solve for relative event locations to the precision of a few km or less, while incorporating information on absolute hypocenter locations from catalogs such as EHB and GEM. We run the computations on both a 40-core cluster geared towards HTC problems (data processing) and a 500-core HPC cluster for data inversion. Currently, we are incorporating waveform correlation delay time measurements available for events in selected regions, but are continuously building up a comprehensive, global correlation database for densely distributed events recorded at stations with a long history of high-quality waveforms. The current global DD catalog includes nearly one million earthquakes, equivalent to approximately 70% of the number of events in the ISC/EDR catalogs initially selected for relocation. The relocations sharpen the view of seismicity in most active regions around the world, in particular along subduction zones where event density is high, but also along mid-ocean ridges where existing hypocenters are especially poorly located. The new data offers the opportunity to investigate earthquake processes and fault structures along entire plate boundaries at the ~km scale, and provides a common framework that facilitates analysis and comparisons of findings across different plate boundary systems.",

            "abstract": "North Pond, a sediment deposit ringed by basalt outcrops just west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, remains a site of intense study of the subseafloor biosphere. During IODP Expedition 336, core samples of sediment and basalt were drilled and permanent CORK observatories were installed in the basalt crust. Heterotrophic enrichments were started aboard ship and multiple aerobic, heterotrophic bacterial isolates were obtained from two sediment horizons. Isolate identities were compared to sequences from drilling fluid and surrounding sediment to establish the likelihood of their sedimentary source. Three isolates currently in pure culture are from site U1382B and include an Arthrobacter species from 4 meters below seafloor (mbsf) as well as a Paracoccus and Pseudomonas species from 70 mbsf. All isolates grow at tested temperatures of 4 to 37°C. Only the Arthrobacter species grows at 42°C and no isolates grew at 50°C. The presence of aerobic microorganisms at these depths is consistent with previously published oxygen profiles of site U1382B where O2 is present in low amounts (10 to 20μm) at both 4 mbsf (originating from overlying seawater) and 70 mbsf (originating from subseafloor aquifer leaching into deep sediment), yet substantial enough to support aerobic heterotrophy. Despite similar oxygen concentrations, two key differences between these depths are the origin and quality of organic matter and the surrounding lithology. Section 1H4 from site U1382B, where the Arthrobacter species was isolated, consists primarily of a nanofossil ooze. Section 8H6 (~70 mbsf) is much more clay-rich. Previous explorations of microbial heterotrophy in North Pond sediments using 14C-acetate have suggested that this metabolism may be linked to particular lithologies. A 2011 study noted higher rates of potential aerobic heterotrophy in sandy and clay-rich layers compared to nannofossil ooze layers. Since isolates are from different depths, ages and lithologies they can be used to examine the potential fitness of an indigenous organism to it’s surrounding environment, by comparatively studying the shallow and deep isolates in each others habitats.",

The RCM is the Eta model used at CPTEC since 1997 for weather forecasts, since 2000 for seasonal forecasts and since 2012 for climate change studies. The model has suffered some upgrades and has turn into a finite volume model. Some examples of upgrades are the vertical coordinate refinement, the vertical advection scheme, some physics parameters, etc. To run for the time range of several decades and to synchronize with the global models, the calendar of this version of this model was modified. The global models are: the Hadley Centre model, HadGEM2-ES, the Japanese MIROC5 model, and the Brazilian BESM2.3.1 model. Their resolutions range from about 250 km to about 150 km. The present period simulations started from about 1960 until 2005. This step is the preparation for the future climate change scenarios runs driven by the same global models. Evaluations were based on CRU data. The mean spatial distribution of precipitation and temperature showed agreement against the observations. The simulated precipitation and temperature fields from the Eta showed correct seasonality along the year. The regional model simulations driven by BESM showed the least amount of precipitation over the tropical Pacific and Atlantic oceans, whereas the simulations driven by MIROC5 showed the largest amount in those oceans. The mean seasonal cycle of precipitation for three major regions in Brazil showed underestimate in the Amazon region, but overestimate in Central-South Brazilian region. The mean seasonal cycle of temperature were underestimated along all the year. The frequency distribution of precipitation showed that the regional model reach more intense precipitation rates than the global models, and similarly for temperature extremes. Trends of extreme indicators such as consecutive dry days, total annual precipitation were also calculated and compared against some previous works.",

PERSIANN-CDR estimations are biased corrected using GPCP monthly climatology data. PERSIANN-CDR provides daily rainfall estimates at 0.25° x 0.25° grid boxes for 1983-2014 (delayed present). This newly released product makes it feasible to model the streamflow over the past 30 years. Three test basins from the Distributed Hydrologic Model Intercomparison Project - Phase 2 (DMIP 2) are chosen. Comparing with other satellite products, the Version 7 TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product is used. Stage IV radar data is used as a reference data for evaluating the PERSIANN-CDR and TMPA precipitation data. All products are scaled to 0.25° and daily spatiotemporal resolution. The study is performed in two phases. In the first phase, the 2003-2011 period where all the products are available is chosen. Precipitation evaluation results, presented on Taylor Diagrams, show that TMPA and PERSIANN-CDR have close performances. The National Weather Service (NWS) Office of Hydrologic Development (OHD) Hydrology Laboratory-Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) is then forced with the PERSIANN-CDR and the TMPA precipitation products, as well as the stage IV radar data. USGS Streamflow observations at the outlet of the basins are used as the reference streamflow data. The results show that in general, in all the three DMIP 2 basins the simulated hydrographs forced with PERSIANN-CDR and TMPA show good agreement, as the statistical measures such as root mean square error, bias, and correlation coefficient are close. In addition, with respect to the streamflow peaks, PERSIANN-CDR shows better performance than Stage IV radar data in capturing the extreme streamflow magnitudes. Based on the results from the first phase of the study and given the fact that PERSIANN-CDR covers the 1983-2014, in the second phase of the study we model the streamflow for the period of 1983-2014. The results will be presented in the meeting.",

Flights were focused on the lowest 1000 m across the Central Valley axis just north of Fresno in order to characterize the wintertime atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). For seven flights we report the observed ABL growth rates, and compare these with a simple mixed layer model driven by surface heat flux estimates from the North American Regional Reanalysis data set. By enforcing a mixed layer budget closure of the observed water vapor trend and the differential across the ABL top, we derive midday entrainment velocities for the region that average 1.2 (± 0.4) cm s-1. A similar budgeting method is used for ozone to estimate wintertime photochemical production rates that ranged from 0.5 to 7.0 ppb h-1, and exhibited a strong correlation with ambient temperature (see Figure) and total ozone abundance. Finally, the gross emissions of methane for this heavily agricultural region are estimated and compared to existing inventories. These results can provide important constraints on ABL growth and entrainment to aid surface studies of aerosol composition and other trace gases that are being conducted for DISCOVER-AQ.",

            "abstract": "Differences in the way that climate models simulate changes in low tropical clouds account for the majority of the inter-model spread in cloud feedback. However, the Community Earth System Model (CESM1) and its predecessors CCSM4 and CCSM3 show uncommon sensitivity to the shortwave cloud feedback in the storm tracks rather than the tropics. The storm track feedback is coupled to aspects of the meridional overturning circulation in both CESM and its predecessors, so these effects are somehow linked but the connection is poorly understood. In order to further explore the connection between climate sensitivity and circulation in CESM, an ensemble is being conducted using a slab ocean, perturbed atmospheric convection parameters, and the spectral element dycore. The ensemble is controlled by the Multiple Ensemble Control System (MECS), which stochastically samples the uncertainty in convection parameters using very fast simulated annealing (VFSA) to converge on an approximation of the posterior probability distribution of uncertain parameters.",

            "abstract": "Plants typically expend a significant portion of their available carbon for nitrogen (N) acquisition, especially through root exudation in N-limited soils; this is the amount of carbon that would otherwise go to growth in the presence of ample N. Most global terrestrial biogeochemistry models (TBMs) do not consider the carbon cost for N acquisition. In order to evaluate the carbon–nitrogen trade process and improve the carbon­–nitrogen dynamics in TBMs, this study integrates a cutting-edge global plant nitrogen model—Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN) version 2.0 (FUN2.0) into the Community Land Model 4.0. The coupled model (i.e., CLM4CN-FUN2.0) is tested at local and global scales. Generally, plant N acquisition is dynamically simulated, and the carbon cost for N acquisition is estimated by the coupled model. Sensitivity tests indicate that the low soil N uptakes of the coupled model are associated with the low soil mineral N amount represented by CLM4CN. According to the observational evidence, the retranslocated N pool in CLM4CN needs to be combined with other non-structural N pools. These deficiencies in the model open new possibilities for improving TBMs, which is widely used in global climate change studies.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in synchrotron sources, x-ray optics, area detectors, and sample environment control have enabled many time-resolved experimental techniques for studying materials at extreme pressure and temperature conditions. The High Pressure Collaborative Access Team (HPCAT) at the Advanced Photon Source has made a sustained effort to develop and assemble a powerful collection of high-pressure apparatus for time-resolved research, and considerable time has been invested in developing techniques for collecting high-quality time-resolved x-ray scattering data. In this talk we will outline recently developed capabilities at HPCAT for studying elasticity and anelasticity of minerals using fast compression and cyclic compression-decompression. A few recent studies will be highlighted. For example, with fast x-ray area detectors having millisecond time resolution, accurate thermal equations of state of materials at temperatures up to 1000K and megabar pressures can be collected in a matter of seconds using membrane-driven diamond anvil cells (DAC), yielding unprecedented time and pressure resolution of true isotherms. Short duration of the experiments eliminates temperature variation during the experiments and in general allows volume measurements at higher pressures and temperatures. Alternatively, high-frequency (kilohertz range) radial diffraction measurements in a panoramic DAC combined with fast, precise cyclic loading/unloading by piezo drive could provide the short time scale necessary for studying rheology of minerals from the elastic response and lattice relaxation as a function of pressure, temperature and strain rate. Finally, we consider some possible future applications for time-resolved high-pressure, high-temperature research of mantle minerals.",

            "abstract": "The NW Zagros orogen is the result of the multistage collisional history associated with Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic convergence of the Arabian and Eurasian continents and final closure of Neotethys. Siliciclastic strata preserved within a ~400 km segment of the NW Zagros fold-thrust belt and foreland basin in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR) provide a widespread record of exhumation and sedimentation. As a means of assessing NW Zagros foreland basin evolution and chronostratigraphy, we present coupled detrital zircon (DZ) U-Pb and (U-Th)/He geo-thermochronometric data of Upper Cretaceous to Pliocene siliciclastic strata from the Duhok, Erbil, and Suleimaniyah provinces of IKR. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age analyses reveal that the foreland basin fill in IKR in general was dominantly derived from Pan-African/Arabian-Nubian, Peri-Gondwandan, Eurasian, and Cretaceous volcanic arc terrenes. However, the provenance of these strata varies systematically along strike and through time, with an overall increase in complexity upsection. DZ age distribution of Paleocene-Eocene strata is dominated by a ~95 Ma grain age population, likely sourced from the Late Cretaceous Hassanbag-Bitlis volcanic arc complex along the northern margin of Arabia. In contrast, DZ U-Pb age distributions of Neogene strata show a major contribution derived from various Eurasian (e.g., Iranian, Tauride, Pontide; ~45, 150, 300 Ma) and Pan-African (~550, 950 Ma) sources. The introduction of Eurasian DZ ages at the Paleogene-Neogene transition likely records the onset of Arabian-Eurasian collision. Along strike to the southeast, the DZ U-Pb spectra of Neogene strata show a decreased percentage of Pan-African, Peri-Gondwandan, Tauride, and Ordovician ages, coupled with a dramatic increase in 40-50 Ma DZ ages that correspond to Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic rocks in Iran. Combined with paleocurrent data, this suggests that Neogene sediments were transported longitudinally southeastward through an unbroken foreland basin system and progressively diluted downstream by detritus shed from the Iranian Plateau. Combined (U-Th)/He dating of DZ grains derived from the Hassanbag-Bitlis complex documents a major tectonothermal event at ~75 Ma, corresponding to the timing of proto-Zagros uplift and initial basin development in IKR.",

            "abstract": "Hundreds of thousands of symmetrical, vertical, bullet-shaped cavities known as bellholes are present in the ceilings of caves restricted to the tropical Americas. Most have circular diameters (rarely influenced by joints or bedding) of at least 30 cm, and may be several meters in height. They are often paired with bellbasins (shallow depressions located vertically beneath them that contain guano produced by bats). Members of the species Artibeus jamaicensis (Jamaican Fruit Bat) are almost exclusive users of these roosts. Brown streaks flowing down the sides of the bellholes and centimeters-thick rinds of the basins below are largely apatite minerals produced by the reaction of the host limestone with phosphoric acids in the guano.\nMany bellholes have developed in speleothem in the cave ceilings, disproving early theories that they are the result of solution by phreatic currents in flooded caves. A. jamaicensis roosts singly or in harem groups of 2-14 that commonly cluster in the bellholes and it is likely that these social habits of this species focus corrosion resulting from the transfer of feces to rock (producing altered rock then removed by claws) to create discretely-spaced upward-growing cavities. Fossil evidence from Jamaica supports an arrival there from the mainland in the past 12,000 years, suggesting bellholes and bellbasins are geologically recent features in the Caribbean islands.\nTheir locations (not all cave passages have bellholes) can provide information on the hydrological history or microclimate of a cave, due to the absence of both bellholes and bats in some specific situations, e.g. where physical barriers exist such as sumps, small airspaces above streams or through rock collapses, or with increasing distance from an entrance.\nSmaller circular, increasingly-indented ceiling cavities demonstrate a sequence of bellhole development. Small (23 cm diameter, 9 cm high), circular, streaked cavities in a limestone drainage tunnel constructed in 1927 in Puerto Rico suggest that a 30 cm diameter, 50 cm high bellhole could develop in fewer than 900 years. The numbers of bellholes and bellbasins suggest they may be an important post-formational erosional process in tropical caves, e.g. 4.8 linear cm of ceiling rock has been eroded just from the bellholes of only the first 600 m of a single cave in Puerto Rico.",

To do so, we combine: (i) estimates of\nphotospheric horizontal velocities, v_h, determined by local\ncorrelation tracking applied to a sequence of line-of-sight magnetic\nfield maps from the Narrowband Filter Imager, with (ii) a vector\nmagnetic field measurement from the SpectroPolarimeter. Plage fields\nare ideal observational targets for estimating energy injection by\nconvection, because they are: (i) strong enough to be measured with\nrelatively small uncertainties; (ii) not so strong that convection is\nheavily suppressed (as within umbrae); and (iii) unipolar, so S_z in\nplage is not influenced by mixed-polarity processes (e.g., flux\nemergence) unrelated to heating in stable, active-region fields. In\nthis plage region, we found that the average S_z varied in space, but\nwas positive (upward) and sufficient to explain coronal heating, with\nvalues near (5 +/- 1) x 107 erg / cm2 / s. We find the energy input\nper unit magnetic flux to be on the order of 105 erg / s / Mx. A\ncomparison of intensity in a Ca II image co-registered with one plage\nmagnetogram shows stronger spatial correlations with both total field\nstrength and unsigned vertical field, |B_z|, than either S_z or\nhorizontal flux density, B_h. The observed Ca II brightness\nenhancement, however, probably contains a strong contribution from a\nnear-photosphere hot-wall effect, which is unrelated to heating in the\nsolar atmosphere.",

While these results show considerable agreement with historical observations for convective storms, this method has difficulty characterizing electricity in stratiform clouds and storms at different stages of the convective lifecycle. The algorithm also does not take advantage of the full suite of observations available in the 16-year TRMM dataset, which also includes Precipitation Radar (PR) observations of the structure of storms overflown by the satellite. As a first step towards building an algorithm that can characterize electrical input to the Global Electric Circuit (GEC) from a wide variety of storms across the globe, this study compares passive microwave-based approximations of global electricity with precipitation radar-based approximations in order to determine the relative skill each platform has in describing the “battery” of the GEC and to identify a possible pathway towards a combined metric that can use the strengths of both instruments to better describe electrified clouds.",

Although a comparatively small amount of the original province remains today, the locations of the existing outcrops on four continents (North America, South America, Africa, and Europe) show the extensive reach of igneous activity and indicate that the CAMP was likely one of the biggest LIPs known. Because of the geologic and global significance of this episode, a knowledge of the conditions that generated and emplaced such a large volume of magma would help better understand mantle and tectonic processes.\nIn this study, we compare whole rock and mineral chemistry data from three of the North American outcrops: the Palisades Sill of the Newark Basin in eastern New York and New Jersey, the Centreville Sheet of the Culpeper Basin in northern Virginia, and the York Haven pluton of the Gettysburg Basin in southeastern Pennsylvania. The diabases are quartz-normative theoleiites; their chemistries are indicate high degrees of internal differentiation and thermal disequilbirum, consistent with magma bodies cooling as a closed or near-closed system. The trace element data shows that, although there is evidence to support a deep mantle source for CAMP melts, there is also a shallower component influencing the chemistries of the samples. We interpret this as the signal of an ancient subducted slab through which CAMP melts passed.",

            "abstract": "Accurately quantifying emissions of ammonia (NH3) from confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) is vital not only to the livestock industry, but essential to understanding nitrogen cycling along the Front Range of Colorado, USA, where intensive agriculture, urban sprawl, and pristine ecosystems (e.g., Rocky Mtn Nat’l Park) lie within 100-km of each other. Most observation-based techniques for estimating NH3 emissions can be expensive and highly technical. Many methods rely on concentration observations on location, which implicitly depends on weather conditions. A system for sampling NH3 using on-site weather data was developed to allow remote measurement of NH3 in a simple, cost-effective way. These systems use passive diffusive cartridges (Radiello, Sigma-Aldrich) that provide time-averaged concentrations representative of a typical two-week deployment. Cartridge exposure is robotically managed so they are only visible when winds are 1.4 m/s or greater from the direction of the CAFO. These concentration data can be coupled with stability parameters (measured on-site) in a simple inverse model to estimate emissions (FIDES, UMR Environnement et Grandes Cultures). Few studies have directly compared emissions estimates of NH3 using concentration data obtained from multiple measurement systems at different temporal and spatial scales. Therefore, in the summer and autumn of 2014, several conditional sampler systems were deployed at a 25,000-head cattle feedlot concomitant with an open-path infrared laser (GasFinder2, Boreal Laser Inc.) and a Cavity Ring Down Spectrometer (CRDS) (G1103, Picarro Inc.) which each measured instantaneous NH3 concentrations. This study will test the sampler technology by first comparing concentration data from the three different methods. In livestock research, it is common to estimate NH3 emissions by using such instantaneous data in a backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLs) model (WindTrax, Thunder Beach Sci.) Considering this, NH3 fluxes from the inverse model (FIDES) using all three datasets will be compared to emissions from the bLS model (WindTrax) using only high speed data (laser; CRDS). Results may lend further validity to the conditional sampler approach for more easily and accurately monitoring NH3 fluxes from CAFOs and other strong areal sources.",

            "abstract": "Lake deposits can be used to assess past hydrological and atmospheric conditions and aid in understanding regional climate of the western Basin and Range. Walker Lake, Nevada has a maximum water depth of ~35 m and is situated in a half-graben basin that formed during late Cenozoic transtension, in the Walker Lane tectonic belt. Small-scale climatic variations are preserved in the sediments of this hydrologically closed lake basin. Ten Kullenberg sediment cores (~2 to ~10 m in length), and ~300 km of CHIRP seismic reflection data were collected in Walker Lake to assess late-Quaternary stratigraphic framework and paleoclimate history. Core 4A is one of the longest cores acquired (9.19 m) and contains the oldest recovered sediments. Analyses of total inorganic carbon, total organic carbon, carbon and nitrogen abundances, and carbon stable isotopes from core 4A yield a valuable multi-proxy paleoclimate record. This record documents changes in effective moisture in the eastern Sierra Nevada and western Basin and Range. Sediments range from laminated to massive mud with three tephra deposits 0.5 - 4 cm thick. Total percentage of calcium carbonate, ranging from 3 to 35%, shows oscillations we interpret to be millennial forcings. The average C/N ratio of core 4A is 7.71 (2.5 - 11.3 range), and the stable carbon isotope measurements range from -21.0 to -25.3‰, and average -23.8‰. At ~3.7 m depth a basin-wide angular unconformity is observed in the seismic data and is also reflected in the geochemical data. An estimated age of this surface, 2000-2500 ka, is consistent with previous interpretations of partial diversion of the Walker River into the Carson sink. A δ13Corganic excursion, -25 to -20.8‰, occurs at the depth of the unconformity. We interpret this to be a result of enhanced deposition of aquatic organic matter during the Walker Lake drawdown. From 3.7 to 7.5 m depth, the carbon and nitrogen abundances and isotopes are surprisingly consistent down core and may be the result of protracted stability. Below 7.5 m depth the carbon and nitrogen abundances decrease, as do %CaCO3 and δ13Corganic values. These signatures may reflect past connectivity between Walker Lake and other Lahontan sub-basins. AMS radiocarbon analyses are underway, which will help constrain the paleolimnologic history of the basin.",

            "abstract": "Foam injection into the subsurface is performed to improve gas control mobility for residual oil extraction in, e.g., enhanced oil recovery and contaminated site remediation. Foam improves the gas mobility control as the gas viscosity is increased through its dispersion into a liquid phase. Finer the bubbles the lower the gas apparent viscosity (or foam viscosity) and the better is the sweep efficiency of the residual oil. A chemical surfactant adsorbed at the gas-liquid interface is generally used to maintain an optimal foam texture (number of bubbles for unit volume) however it can be desorbed making the foam coarser.\nHere, we present an experimental and modeling study on the effect of nanoparticles on foam stability. Nanoparticles are adsorbed onto the bubble interface irreversibly and therefore they are expected to keep the desired texture of the foam for the entire time of its application. In this study, we use silica nanoparticles in conjunction with a surfactant to study the transport behavior of a CO2 foam in a porous medium. Experiments were performed using a glass-bead pack and Boise sandstone with foam quality (fg) 0.1-0.9 until steady-state. Foam flow was described by a mechanistic population balance model coupled with the fractional flow equation and constitutive equations for foam generation and destruction based on lamella division and bubble coalescence mechanisms, respectively. In order to minimize the uncertainty, model parameters were estimated by combining experimental data of pressure gradient during steady-state and transient.\nExperiments and theory agree very well and the overall results show a significant increase in foam texture and stability when nanoparticles and surfactant are added to a foam flow in a low permeability porous medium. Data from tests with various nanoparticle concentrations (cn) show that gas apparent viscosity changes with fg and cn. But its optimal value does not vary with cn and it is already attained at fg equal to 0.8 when 0.1 wt.% of nanoparticles are added together with 0.04 wt.% of surfactant. Employing 0.04 wt.% of surfactant under conditions of temperature, salinity, and permeability comparable to a deep formation, foam viscosity is approximately 4·10-2 Pa·s, and increases of one order of magnitude when only 0.1 wt.% of nanoparticle is also added.",

            "abstract": "Introduction:Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have been used to investigate neutron production and leakage from the lunar surface to assess the composition of the lunar soil [1-3]. Orbital measurements of lunar neutron flux have been made by the Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer (LPNS)[4] of the Lunar Prospector mission and the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND)[5] of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. While both are cylindrical helium-3 detectors, LEND’s SETN (Sensor EpiThermal Neutrons) instrument is shorter, with double the helium-3 pressure than that of LPNS. The two instruments therefore have different angular sensitivities and neutron detection efficiencies. Furthermore, the Lunar Prospector’s spin-stabilized design makes its detection efficiency latitude-dependent, while the SETN instrument faces permanently downward toward the lunar surface. We use the GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation code[6] to investigate the leakage lunar neutron energy spectrum, which follows a power law of the form E-0.9 in the epithermal energy range, and the signals detected by LPNS and SETN in the LP and LRO mission epochs, respectively. Using the lunar neutron flux reconstructed for LPNS epoch, we calculate the signal that would have been observed by SETN at that time. The subsequent deviation from the actual signal observed during the LEND epoch is due to the significantly higher intensity of Galactic Cosmic Rays during the anomalous Solar Minimum of 2009-2010.\n",

The objective of this study was to use chemical indicators to reliably determine sources of nitrate contamination in private wells. We developed an analytical method for a suite of human waste indicators. The selection of chemical tracers was based on their likely occurrence and mobility in groundwater. The suite included artificial sweeteners, pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Pesticide metabolites were used to identify contamination due to agricultural practices. A densely populated suburban area with adjacent agricultural land was selected. Eighteen private water supply wells and six monitoring wells were analyzed for nitrate-N and contaminant indicators. All of the wells with nitrate concentrations greater than 3 mg/L had at least one chemical indicator. Of these, 90% had two or more human waste contaminants, 40% had pesticide metabolites, and 30% had both. Of the wells with nitrate greater than 10 mg/L, 80% had two or more human waste indicators, 70% had pesticide metabolites, and 50% had both. The results of this research will help direct land management decisions and selection of appropriate water treatment options.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the effect of potentially important, but hitherto unexplored, gas- and particle-phase photolysis reactions on the lifetime and budgets of SOA. Recent laboratory studies showed that freshly formed SOA from e.g. monoterpenes have a lifetime of a few hours when exposed to UV radiation both in dry particles and aqueous solutions, suggesting that photolytic processing of secondary organic vapors and particles could be removing aerosols from the troposphere on timescales comparable to those of wet deposition. Photolytic reactions lead to fragmentation of molecules, changes in their properties (e.g. volatility, solubility, photo-bleaching) and thus their ability to form SOA or remain in the particle phase. These reactions are currently not included in 3D models, and as we are using more and more explicit SOA mechanisms in 3D models this issue comes to the forefront. Here, we use an explicit chemical model to estimate the effect of gas-phase photolysis on SOA formation for various precursors (biogenic and anthropogenic mixtures) and environments (low-, high-NOx). By comparison with laboratory studies, we estimate the relative importance of gas- vs. particle phase photolysis. This understanding is then parameterized within a global chemistry model to assess the potential effect on the SOA global budgets. The results confirm that photolytic reactions are an important loss process, which competes with the wet removal, but has however very different temporal and spatial patterns.",

            "abstract": "Laurentia and Kalahari are currently interpreted as independently moving continents ca. 1110 million years ago that subsequently became conjoined in the supercontinent Rodinia. Their relative positions and orientations are dependent both on the directional comparison of paleomagnetic poles and geomagnetic polarity choices for those poles. In this contribution, we use newly developed and existing paleomagnetic and geochronological data from both the ca. 1110-1085 Ma Midcontinent Rift of Laurentia and the ca. 1109 Ma Umkondo Large Igneous Province (LIP) of Kalahari to present improved constraints on relations between the two continents. Previous mean poles for the Umkondo LIP have been either calculated by taking the mean of regional submeans or at the site level which is problematic given the preponderance of multiple sites from single individual cooling units. We report a new Umkondo grand mean pole that is the mean of the virtual geomagnetic poles (VGPs) of individual cooling units and is reinforced with new data from ~20 previously unstudied Umkondo sills from Botswana. This approach yields a pole whose position and uncertainty are the most robust calculated to date. The portion of Laurentia’s Mesoproterozoic apparent polar wander path (APWP) known as the Logan Loop and Keweenawan Track partially overlaps in age with the Umkondo pole and is of central importance in efforts to reconstruct late Mesoproterozoic paleogeography. Ongoing debates as to the geometry and timing of Rodinia assembly critically hinge on the comparison of paleomagnetic poles from other continents to the Keweenawan record. We present an updated compilation for the Keweenawan Track APWP using an improved chronostratigraphic context enabled by new geochronological and paleomagnetic data. Ongoing improvements and time-calibration of this record further constrains the rate of Laurentia’s motion and provides opportunities for increased rigor in the determination of relative paleogeographic positions such as between Laurentia and Kalahari.",

            "abstract": "Feedbacks from terrestrial and marine ecosystems will significantly influence future climate, but the magnitude of these feedbacks is poorly constrained by observation and experiment. A major limitation is the mismatch between the local scale of process observations and the coarse resolution at which fluxes are resolved in the atmosphere. New capabilities from GOSAT and OCO-2 will aid significantly bringing the scale of atmospheric inverse estimates of fluxes closer to the process scale, but these powerful instruments are a partial solution. Specifically, resolution and seasonal and spatial sampling biases increase uncertainty for partitioning fluxes between temperate and tropical, terrestrial and marine and land use versus earth system feedbacks. These limitations affect the estimation of feedbacks apparent in mean fluxes, such as effects of increasing CO2 and in flux variability, reflecting climate and land use changes. We show simulations of climate feedback signatures in atmospheric concentration patterns and analyze how these might be best observed. We conclude that separation of land use and earth system driven fluxes is crucial, that resolution of tropical ocean variability is important to estimating the terrestrial sensitivity to climate and that uncertainty from fossil emissions significantly affects estimates of feedback strength.",

During the DAQ campaign, 58 ozonesondes were launched from the University of Houston-Main Campus and Smith Point, Texas combined. These launches were coordinated with the nine P-3B aircraft spirals and 4 TES (Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer) satellite overpasses. The combination of data sources provides useful insight into the composition and potential origins of free tropospheric ozone. Surface ozone production was not active during the 2013 DAQ Texas campaign with the Houston region only recording two eight-hour average ozone exceedance days during the campaign. The potential sources of free tropospheric ozone during DAQ include stratosphere-troposphere exchange, long-range transport of biomass burning, and lightning. High-resolution potential vorticity data from the NASA Goddard Trajectory Model is used to identify stratosphere-troposphere exchange. The HYSPLIT trajectory model is used to trace air parcels from areas of biomass burning. Lightning data provided by the Lightning Mapping Array will help determine ozone production from lightning. Through the use of these tools, this study will examine the origins of free tropospheric ozone over the Houston area during this campaign.",

Spatio-temporal interpolation of 3D+T point data produces continuous estimates that can then be used for prediction at unsampled times and locations, as input for process models, and can simply aid in visualization of properties through space and time. Regression-kriging with 3D and 2D+T data has successfully been implemented, but currently the field of geostatistics lacks an analytical framework for modeling 3D+T data. Our objective is to develop robust 3D+T models for mapping dynamic soil data that has been collected with high spatial and temporal resolution. For this analysis, we use data collected from a sensor network installed on the R.J. Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF), a 37-ha Long-Term Agro-Ecosystem Research (LTAR) site in Pullman, WA. For five years, the sensors have collected hourly measurements of soil volumetric water content at 42 locations and five depths. The CAF dataset also includes a digital elevation model and derivatives, a soil unit description map, crop rotations, electromagnetic induction surveys, daily meteorological data, and seasonal satellite imagery. The soil-water sensor data, combined with the spatial and temporal covariates, provide an ideal dataset for developing 3D+T models.

            "abstract": "Global climate change is expected to increase the severity of floods and droughts and the frequency of extreme streamflow events in the Midwestern United States. Managing these projected impacts poses a major challenge for water resources, conservation, and land use management. Wetlands have been considered as a conservation strategy and work to increase the capacity of watersheds by storing runoff upstream. The implementation of wetlands, especially in tile-drained agricultural watersheds, can reduce peak flows and help mitigate the anticipated impacts of climate change. The goal of this study was to evaluate the long-term performance of wetlands to reduce peak flows in future climate scenarios in the Eagle Creek Watershed in Indiana. A secondary goal of this research was to establish a methodology for incorporating climate change into hydrological models to conduct long-term land management studies and decisions. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was forced with an ensemble of bias corrected climate projections from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) to evaluate the impacts of climate change on watershed hydrology and the ability of wetlands to reduce peak flows. Long-term monthly streamflow results predicted a slight increase in streamflow in the winter and a slight decrease in the summer from the past (1971-2000) to future (2041-2070) time periods. About half of the climate realizations produced an increase in the 5% exceedance flow and half a decrease, but all predictions agreed that high flow events will increase in frequency in the winter and decrease in the spring and summer. Results from the wetland analysis showed that if all potential wetlands identified in a previous study are installed in the watershed, maximum peak flow reductions of around 20-50 cubic meters per second for the past and future, as well as decreased frequency of extreme events, can be seen. Wetlands proved to be a robust solution for peak flow reduction, producing consistent reductions across all climate projections for both the past and future time periods.",

This is enabled at Shasta Lake via a temperature control device installed on Shasta Dam that allows selective withdrawal of reservoir water from different elevations and temperatures. Risk based decision making and planning requires ability to generate ensemble of water temperatures released from the lake - especially when the planning needs to be made under future climate conditions. To this end, we developed a stochastic hydroclimate simulation method that generates ensembles of influent lake streamflow, influent stream temperatures and air temperature over the lake. These, combined with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model, CE-QUAL-W2 provides ensembles of water temperatures released from the various levels of the lake. A nonparametric K-nearest neighbor based disaggregation method is used to generate streamflow ensembles at five streams entering the lake. Then, conditionally the temperatures of water entering the lake and the air temperature over the lake are also simulated. The W2 model generates lake temperatures. The disaggregation method is also modified to generate streamflows consistent with wet and dry conditions and consequently, the lake temperature scenarios, enabling the water managers to assess various decision options.",

            "abstract": "Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) emit massive amounts of ammonia (NH3) to the atmosphere. Current measurements of NH3 are generally conducted far away from the sources (satellites, airplanes, etc.). There is insufficient knowledge about the dry deposition rate of NH3 near the sources, which might contribute to the large discrepancies between measured concentrations at CAFOs and those from models. During the 2014 NASA DISCOVER-AQ campaign, we designed a series of tests to measure the deposition rate of NH3 by utilizing a suite of sensors, including a LICOR LI-7700 methane sensor and Princeton University’s custom open path NH3 sensor, which was mounted on top of a small SUV. Our mobile sampling technique enables us to follow feedlot emission plumes to see how ambient NH3 concentration decays as gases moves away from the CAFO. The mobile platform is used to perform upwind and downwind sampling to characterize the NH3 emission source. We tracked the change of the enhancement of NH3 concentration relative to the enhancement of CH4 concentration (ΔNH3:ΔCH4), while transecting the plume of individual cattle feedlots. Measured data shows that the high concentration of NH3 seen at the source decreases quickly as one moves further downwind from it. A time constant of approximately ten minutes has been calculated from the decay of the ΔNH3:ΔCH4 ratios while moving away from the sources. We also will compare our measurements with those of NASA’s P-3B aerosol measurements to show that the majority must be lost to dry deposition. This rapid deposition suggests that large amounts of NH3 are being deposited in very close proximity to these CAFOs, which is consistent with previous findings of locally high soil pH near NH3 sources. Our results will be used to better characterize nitrogen deposition from cattle feedlots and estimate NH3 lifetime.",

Geology is dominated by Tertiary volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks that yield abundant coarse clasts. Surface and subsurface bed material was sampled volumetrically at twenty-five sites. The textural types range from gravelly cobbles to sandy cobbly gravels, sand content is low (2 to 13%), mud content is very low, and sorting is poor to very poor.\nGenerally the surface layer is an open framework gravel or cobble, while the subsurface layer is a filled or partially filled framework gravel or cobble. Despite an armored appearance, only 20% of the sites are armored using the standard armor ratio (surface D50/subsurface D50). While surface layers are not coarser than their subsurface layers in terms of the median or coarse end of the distribution, they are coarser in terms of fines (ratios based on D25, D16, % sand), suggesting that alternatives to the D50armor ratio might be useful.\nMultivariate analysis of size fraction data reveals four distinct groups of samples, distinguished mainly by differences in proportions of coarse to fine gravels, and in abundance of sand. While one group comprises only surface samples and another subsurface samples, two of the groups are mixed.\nOne goal of the project is to evaluate the effects of land use history on bed material characteristics and mobility. Sediment characteristics were examined in relation to distance downstream, geology, relation to debris-flow sources, land use history, and other potential influences. There are no geologic associations or downstream trends in fining or other grain size parameters. Differences in land use history, such as former dredged-mined reaches and reaches with recent restoration projects also do not explain patterns of armoring or other sediment characteristics. High variability within each reach suggests that local hydraulic factors may be influencing sediment characteristics. ",

            "abstract": "The exchange of water, energy, and carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere is largely influenced by vegetation. In turn, vegetation is strongly influenced by the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and runoff. Ultimately, the hydrologic cycle exerts a strong control on the climate system. In fact, positive feedbacks between vegetation and the hydrologic cycle at small scales may have the ability to elicit non-linear responses with important large scale consequences. Therefore, capturing the synergies between hydrologic processes at different space and time scales is necessary for appropriately modeling the influence of vegetation and the hydrologic cycle on the climate system. Understanding the controls on land-atmosphere interactions and how they influence larger scale feedbacks will become increasingly important as climatic and other global changes continue to alter the water availability of our ecosystems.\nWater-limited ecosystems are especially sensitive to precipitation changes, and therefore insights concerning how their functioning responds to possible changes in precipitation patterns are important in understanding future climate scenarios. Over a decade of field work from my research group has highlighted the importance of deep soil moisture (from large storms) in the healthy functioning of water-limited ecosystems. This has led to the development of a two-layer soil moisture conceptual framework for exploring land surface-atmosphere interactions in water-limited ecosystems. Here I demonstrate how this framework can been used to link small scale processes investigated in field with large scale processes for water-limited ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "For more than a decade the occurrence of systematic discrepancies between the U-Pb ages of zircons determined by LA-ICP-MS and ID-TIMS has been acknowledged. Trace element concentrations, crystallographic orientation and damage to the crystal lattice by radioactive decay have all been cited as possible causes for the discrepancy termed the “matrix effect”. Recent studies have concluded that differences in Laser Induced Elemental Fractionation (LIEF) between zircon reference materials results from variations in the ablation rate between the primary reference, which is used to build a model for LIEF during data reduction, and the unknowns. These variations are likely related to physical differences in the crystal lattice caused by alpha particle ejection. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the ablation rate for ~200 individual ablation pits in a variety of reference materials using an optical profilometer. Our data demonstrate a clear relationship between delta age (the difference between the age calculated by LA-ICP-MS and the accepted ID-TIMS age, expressed as a percentage) and ablation rate. The relationship between calculated alpha dosage for each ablation and delta age is less clear. This suggests that the zircon’s thermal history may play an important role in controlling ablation rate through annealing of crystal lattice defects. However, alpha dosage is readily quantifiable during routine zircon U-Pb analyses and therefore its relationship to delta age may provide a useful first order correction to remove systematic biases from U-Pb ages. Raman spectroscopy could provide a more robust measure of radiation damage in the zircon lattice and could help to refine our understanding of the processes involved.",

            "abstract": "Compared to electronic and photonic transports, heat transport is less well understood for many materials. At high temperature, thermal conductivity often displays a saturated behavior deviating from the well-known 1/T scaling. The understanding relies on a minimal mean free path phenomenology, additionally implemented to phonon gas model and often used for practical investigations. Unfortunately, a validity check of this minimal mean free path phenomenology against the underlying microscopic behavior is missing. In this work, we investigate lattice thermal conductivity of MgSiO3 perovskite within the framework of phonon gas model. Such study is possible due to a recent theoretical advance – a hybrid approach of first principle molecular dynamics fused with lattice dynamics. MgSiO3 perovskite, the most abundant component of Earth minerals existing in the Earth lower mantle, provides an excellent test bed for studying thermal conduction under high temperature conditions. Surprisingly, the calculated phonon mean free paths do not have the prescribed minima even at extremely high temperature, and neither does the lattice thermal conductivity. The obtained lattice thermal conductivity is in good agreement with the measured values from ambient pressure to lower mantle pressures at room temperature and obeys the typical linear dependence on pressure as revealed by experiments.\nResearch supported by NSF/EAR and Chinese Academy of Sciences.",

INFLUX observational components include several-times-per-month aircraft measurements of gas concentrations and meteorological parameters, as well as a number of towers observing CO2, CH4, and CO and a single continuously operating Doppler lidar to estimate wind, turbulence and aerosol structure in the boundary layer. The observations are used to develop top-down emissions estimates from the aircraft measurements and as input to inversion models. The Doppler lidar provides information on boundary layer structure for both the aircraft and inversion studies.\nA commercial Doppler lidar characterized by low pulse energy and high pulse repetition rate has operated for well over a year at a site NE of downtown Indianapolis. The lidar produces profiles of horizontal wind speed, vertical velocity variance, and aerosol structure two to three times per hour. These data are then used to investigate boundary layer mixing and thickness and horizontal transport as inputs for the flux calculations. During its one year deployment the lidar generally operated reliably with few outages. Comparisons with aircraft spirals over the site and with the NOAA High Resolution research Doppler lidar deployed to Indianapolis for one month during May, 2014, were used to assess the performance of the INFLUX lidar. Measurements agreed quite well when aerosol loading was sufficient for lidar observations throughout the boundary layer. However, low aerosol loading during some periods limited the range of the lidar and precluded characterization of the full boundary layer.\nWe present an overall assessment of the commercial Doppler lidar for providing the needed information on boundary layer structure for emission estimations, and show variability of the boundary layer observations over diurnal, seasonal, and annual cycles. Recommendations on system design changes to obtain data under a more complete range of atmosphere conditions are suggested.",

A major difference between this and the previous ICESat mission is the utilization of a photon counting lidar. Such systems are relatively new, and their ability to produce vegetation measurements remains largely unexplored. This study focuses on development and testing of an automated processing algorithm for high altitude photon counting lidar data, utilizing Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL) and mATLAS data. mATLAS data are simulated data generated utilizing previously collected MABEL data. Conditions present during MABEL data collection are typically static while simulating mATLAS data enables varied noise levels, allowing us to test algorithm robustness. Specific goals of this algorithm include: (1) reduction of noise within the data; (2) delineation of top of canopy (TOC) and ground surfaces; (3) classification of photon returns (e.g. noise, TOC, ground, within canopy); and (4) calculation of above ground level (AGL) heights for signal photons not classified as ground. Algorithm accuracy assessment is performed using spatially coincident MABEL and Goddard’s Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal Airborne Imager (G-LiHT) data. Our algorithm processes data utilizing an overlapping moving window approach, ancillary datasets, median filters, pseudo-waveforms, and spline fitting techniques. Early performance on MABEL data shows lower overall RMSE for ground than TOC (3.26 and 9.58, respectively), and identified high TOC commission error rates in open areas (i.e. areas with little or no vegetation). These TOC commission errors were responsible for increased ground omission errors. After adjusting algorithm parameters, visual assessments of subsequent tests suggest reductions in open area TOC commission and ground omission rates. Overall, ground identification performed well in areas with dense canopy cover. Similar results were observed when processing mATLAS data. A notable exception is data exhibiting weak beam strength conditions, causing signal to become more difficult to identify. Future work will focus on completion of a formal accuracy assessment for mATLAS processing results, and fine-tuning algorithm parameters to deal with varied topographic relief.",

Our study synthesizes a suite of data, including flux tower measurements, vegetation sampling, time-lapse photography and concurrent remotely sensed variables over plots with variable burn patterns.\nAlbedo decreased immediately after fire, converging on unburned values 10 days post-burn. The magnitude and direction of this response was comparable to the albedo change elicited by strong rainfall events. Soil temperature and soil heat flux were not significantly modified by fire. Carbon fluxes showed no discernible difference from an unburned control site immediately after fire. There was a small burst in ecosystem respiration at immediately following the first post-fire rainfall event, returning to baseline values after 3 days. Persistent CO2 release, which we attribute to soil respiration, occurred for 10 days after successive strong wetting events, confirming the centrality of available moisture in determining ecosystem function. Fire delayed the green-up in some plots, but this effect was variable and short-lived. One month after fire there was no evidence of a difference in ground observations of greenness between burnt and control plots or plots that differed in their time of burning. We attribute the relatively ephemeral effects of fire to the low intensity ground fires at our site. Preliminary results of a regional climate model incorporating our ground-based measurements are presented and the implications of these results on the understanding of the climatic role that fire plays in southern Africa are discussed.",

            "abstract": "A significant decline of Arctic sea ice has been observed in recent years. The decline was particularly steep during summers 2007–2013, when the arctic sea ice extent decreased to the lowest levels observed in the satellite era. The summer melt back was most severe in the Pacific sector including the Beaufort Sea where increasing areas of warming open water and marginal ice zone (MIZ) have been observed. To enhance our understanding of MIZ processes, an Office of Naval Research MIZ initiative is under way, which is an integrated program of observations and numerical simulations to investigate ice–ocean–atmosphere dynamics in and around the Beaufort Sea MIZ. In early 2014, the observation team of this program deployed 4 clusters of instruments of various platforms in the Beaufort Sea in order to capture the processes that affect MIZ evolution during the ice melt season.\nTo assist the field work, we have developed a numerical framework for 48-hour forecast of sea ice thickness and drift in and around the Beaufort Sea MIZ using the Marginal Ice Zone ice/ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (MIZMAS). MIZMAS is a variant of the Pan-arctic Ice/Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS), with a high-resolution focus of the Chukchi, Beaufort, and Bering seas. The 48-hour sea ice forecast system is forced by the forecast atmospheric data from the NCEP (National Center for Environmental Prediction) Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2). The CFSv2 forecast ranges from hours to months and the forecast atmospheric data are widely accessible, thus ideal for forcing our sea ice forecast over a range of time scales. The sea ice forecast system has been used to predict sea ice thickness in the Beaufort Sea MIZ 48 hours in advance, focusing on the areas around the 4 clusters. It has also been used to predict the movement of these clusters. In this presentation, we will assess MIZMAS’ forecast skills by comparing available ice thickness observations and the actual cluster trajectories. We will examine ways to improve the forecast system. We will also explore the possibility to extend the forecast to a seasonal time scale.",

Accurate estimates of the emissions and distribution of BC and CO are critical to studies of the atmospheric environment and climate change. We attempt to reduce uncertainties in BC emissions and improve BC model simulations by developing top-down, spatially resolved, estimates of BC emissions through assimilation of OMI observations aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) over Southeast Asian (70°E–150°E, 11°S–55°N) with the GEOS-Chem model. The impacts of different inversion approaches (scaling factor based and emission based), observation operators, a priori constraints and resolution errors on the optimization are investigated and discussed. A remarkable correlation between BC and CO has been found in a number of studies of in situ measurements or model results, and the source-specific emission ratios are an important constraint on global climate and regional air quality models. We thus diagnose these correlations with satellite observations by analyzing the long-term OMI AAOD and MOPITT CO from 2005 to 2013 to investigate the AAOD/CO ratio in seasonal and inter annual scale to assess the seasonal variability and long-term trends of BC and CO sources, including the major emissions sources of anthropogenic activities by sectors and biomass mass burning emissions. The strengths and deficiencies of simulated AAOD/CO ratio using global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem are discovered and compared to the observed AAOD/CO ratio to quantify the biases and uncertainties of corresponding emission sources of BC and CO.",

            "abstract": "Paleosols and lacustrine sediments of the Yellow Cat Member (YCM), Cedar Mountain Formation (CMF), Eastern Utah were collected at the “Lake Madsen” (a dominantly lacustrine section) and Doelling’s Bowl (a mixed lacustrine/ palustrine/ paleosol section) and analyzed for bulk organic carbon isotopes (δ13Corg) . The YCM is thought to span the Barremian to Aptian based on dinosaur faunal assemblages. Correlation with distinct carbon isotope excursions (CIE) specifically those associated with the Selli Event or OAE 1a would allow insight into the response of terrestrial ecosystems to C-cycle perturbations during the Aptian, and may improve chronostratigraphy. Lake Madsen data ranges between a minimum of -28.5‰ and a maximum of -21.4‰ with an average of ~ -25‰ and shows a stepped negative isotope excursion of -3‰., with three distinct negative steps starting ~ 7.5 m above the Jurassic Morrison Formation and an intervening large positive excursion ~ 4.5 m from the base of the Poison Strip Sandstone (~119Ma) Member of the CMF. Doelling’s Bowl data spans a longer vertical distance and ranges from a minimum of -29.0‰ to a maximum of -25.7‰, averages -27.7‰ and is somewhat cyclic in nature. δ13Corg chemostratigraphic profile for Doelling’s Bowl poorly correlates to the Lake Madsen section, likely due to recycling of organic C and wet/dry cycles of the palustrine environment. Correlation of the Lake Madsen section to marine δ13CCO3 curve from Cismon Valley of the southern Alps indicates the lower Aptian C-isotope excursions C1 to C6, with the distinctive C3 negative CIE occur at the top of the Yellow Cat Member, therefore documenting a terrestrial manifestation of the CIE associated with OAE1a – Selli Event. This suggests the age of the majority of the Yellow Cat Member is Barremian to lower Aptian and the Barremian-Aptian boundary occurs at the top of the Member ~ 25cm below the base of the Poison Strip Sandstone. Further isotopic analysis of vertebrate fossils in addition to other proxies may help determine if these excursions are correlated to changes in paleoenvironment, paleoclimate and paleoecology.",

            "abstract": "Biochar has become a desirable material for use in agricultural application to enhance soil quality and in-situ soil and sediment remediation to immobilize organic contaminants. We investigated the effects of biochar sediment amendments on the bioavailability of a suite of inorganic trace metals (Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb) in contaminated sediments from multiple sites in Elizabeth River, VA. We incubated sediments in microcosms with a variety of water column redox and salinity conditions and compared sediments amended with two types of woody biochar to sediments amended with charcoal activated carbon and unamended sediments. We leached sediments in artificial gut fluid mimic of the benthic invertebrate Arenicola marina as a measure of bioavailability of the trace metals analyzed. In unamended anaerobic sediments, the gut fluid mimic leachable fraction of each trace metal is 1-4% of the total sediment concentration for each metal. Initial results indicate that in anaerobic microcosms, woody biochar sediment amendments (added to 5% dry wt) decrease the gut fluid mimic leachable fraction by 30-90% for all trace metals analyzed, and have comparable performance to charcoal activated carbon amendments. However, in microcosms without controlled redox conditions, woody biochar amendments increase the bioavailable fraction of Ni and Cu by up to 80%, while decreasing the bioavailable fraction of Co, Zn, and Pb by approximately 50%; charcoal activated carbon amendments decreased the bioavailability of all trace metals analyzed by approximately 20%. In microcosms without an overlying water column, biochar and activated carbon amendments had no significant effects on trace metal bioavailability. This research demonstrates that biochar can effectively decrease the bioavailability of trace metals in marine sediments, but its efficiency is metal-specific, and environmental conditions impact biochar performance.",

            "abstract": "Over half of global soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored in subsurface soils (>30 cm). This deep SOC may generate a positive feedback with climate change if warming increases its turnover. While most warming experiments have only warmed surface soils, we are warming (+4°C) a coniferous forest soil in situ down to 1 m. Our experiment is investigating: (1) how the mechanisms controlling SOC turnover differ with depth, (2) the temperature sensitivity of native SOC and added substrate decomposition at different depths, and (3) interactions between warming and carbon inputs on native SOC decomposition.\nWarming began in October 2013, and we will present the first year of results. Thus far, warming has increased surface soil respiration by 39% relative to the control and increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil water collected from tension lysimeters at 30 and 70 cm depths. We have added highly 13C-enriched substrates to 15, 50, and 90 cm depths within the warming plots in two related experiments: a long-term (>2 year) incubation of root litter and a short-term (4 day) incubation of injected DOC. The labeled substrates allow us to trace how the transformation of organic carbon differs with depth and warming and to measure how native SOC decomposition at different depths is affected by carbon inputs. After six months, depth has not affected the decomposition of the root litter. This study is one of the first to test whole-profile SOC responses to warming and root carbon inputs, and will enhance our understanding of carbon cycling mechanisms throughout the soil profile to improve predictions of soil carbon’s role in our changing climate.",

            "abstract": "The interaction of near surface soil water with surrounding rock and soil matter plays a crucial role in determining the chemical composition of biogeological systems. This interaction drives subsurface processes such as erosion, mineralization, and depletion. However, how and why soil pore water chemistry fluctuates based on localized conditions such as rock type and landscape position is not fully understood. This study examines the role these two factors play in altering soil water chemistry by analyzing samples collected from schist and granite field sites within the Biosphere 2 Desert Site of the Santa Catalina Mountains Critical Zone Observatory. We hypothesized that soil water from the schist site would have higher solute concentrations than the granite site because schist is a more weatherable rock and, thus, is more susceptible to chemical erosion. We also hypothesized that soil water from convergent positions would have higher solute concentrations than those from divergent positions due to a longer upgradient flow path. Each field site was situated within a Zero Order Basin (ZOB) with seven Zero Tension Lysimeters (ZTL). At the schist site, there were 3 convergent (SC 1-3) and 4 divergent (SD 1-4) ZTL positions. For the granite site, there were 4 convergent (GC 1-2, 4-5) and 3 divergent (GD 1-3) ZTLs. Samples were collected following rainstorms from July 2011-July 2013. Each solution sample was analyzed for major and trace cations, anions, pH, EC, and organic and inorganic carbon. Comparisons between SC and GC and all schist and all granite are consistent with the hypotheses for multiple elements. Results also indicate higher solute levels for SC relative to SD. Thus, our analyses suggest that rock type and landscape position influence the chemical composition of soil water at these two sites.",

            "abstract": "At least 20 meteorites and meteorite candidates have now been found by science teams at three Mars rover landing sites, all within 15 degrees of the martian equator. Thirteen of these are iron meteorites, comprising 65% of the population — an order of magnitude greater abundance than found among witnessed iron falls in Earth-based collections (~6%). Chondritic meteorites, which comprise some 86% of Earth-based falls, are conspicuously absent from the Mars inventory. The reasons for this disproportion may involve a) post-fall environmental resistance differences favoring iron survivability; b) fragmentation from impact shock (and possibly internal weathering stresses associated with oxide production in desert environments [1]); combined with c) selection biases arising from residual chondritic fragments appearing less conspicuous. Impact features along rover traverses often show evidence of dark materials likely to be impactor fragments [e.g., 2], which could represent the missing chondritic fraction.\nThe reactivity of reduced (metallic) iron to aqueous alteration, combined with the near equatorial and widely distributed locations of these rocks, makes them particularly useful to the assessment of climate models arguing for geologically recent ice at the martian equator. Exposure histories involving alternating wind/water cycles are imprinted on several Meridiani irons, for example [3]. Evidence for oxide coating removal demonstrates the current epoch to be one of coating destruction, not production, showing that atmospheric exposure alone is insufficient to produce the coating. Cavernous weathering is likely associated with acidic corrosion, while evidence of aeolian scouring is found in Widmanstätten patterns, sharp-crested scallops, regmaglypt enlargement, and abundant pitting. Further study of these features could help constrain wind direction and velocity during epochs of sculpting [e.g., 4], and assist in exposure age estimation.\n",

            "abstract": "Understanding the geologic composition of the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) is critically important in assessing seismic hazards in the Pacific Northwest. Despite being a potential earthquake and tsunami threat to millions of people, key details of the structure and fault mechanisms remain poorly understood in the CSZ. In particular, the position and character of the subduction interface remains elusive due to its relative aseismicity and low seismic reflectivity, making imaging difficult for both passive and active source methods.\nModern active-source reflection seismic data acquired as part of the COAST project in 2012 provide an opportunity to study the transition from the Cascadia basin, across the deformation front, and into the accretionary prism. Coupled with advances in seismic inversion methods, this new data allow us to produce detailed velocity models of the CSZ and accurate pre-stack depth migrations for studying geologic structure. While still computationally expensive, current computing clusters can perform seismic inversions at resolutions that match that of the seismic image itself.\nHere we present pre-stack full waveform inversions of the central seismic line of the COAST survey offshore Washington state. The resultant velocity model is produced by inversion at every CMP location, 6.25 m laterally, with vertical resolution of 0.2 times the dominant seismic frequency. We report a good average correlation value above 0.8 across the entire seismic line, determined by comparing synthetic gathers to the real pre-stack gathers. These detailed velocity models, both Vp and Vs, along with the density model, are a necessary step toward a detailed porosity cross section to be used to determine the role of fluids in the CSZ. Additionally, the P-velocity model is used to produce a pre-stack depth migration image of the CSZ.",

            "abstract": "Eclogite provides the only record of kinematic events at the deepest levels of orogens. Integrating the U-Pb geochronology and trace element chemistry of zircon in eclogite reveals the most complete view of the PTt history, yet low concentrations of uranium and zirconium and drier compositions that hinder zircon growth at peak conditions render it a challenging rocktype for this approach.\nThe iconic Western Gneiss Region (WGR) in Norway is one of the largest terranes of deeply subducted continental rocks in the world, and contains many indicators of ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic conditions (P>2.8 GPa) that developed during the Siluro-Devonian Caledonian Orogeny. A metamorphic transition from amphibolite-facies to ultrahigh-pressure eclogite facies broadly coincides with a km-scale shear zone that underlies the majority of the WGR. A critical unknown is the timing of movement on this feature, which emplaced allochthonous units above the Baltica basement, but might also have accommodated late-orogenic exhumation of the WGR from mantle depths.\nWe carried out laser ablation split-stream ICPMS (LASS) and selected multigrain TIMS analyses of zircons from eleven eclogites across the southern WGR, of which eight are located within or above the shear zone. LASS spots on polished grains mostly yield weakly discordant Proterozoic intrusive ages, and often minimal indication of a Caledonian (U)HP metamorphic overprint. Direct ablation into unpolished zircon reveals thin rims of Caledonian age in some cases. Overall, the dataset shows that all samples began zircon growth at approximately the same time (ca. 430-420 Ma). Eclogite from lower levels of the shear zone does not contain any dates younger than ca. 410 Ma, however, while eclogite from higher levels continued growth until ca. 400 Ma. We interpret this to result from thrusting of the WGR above cooler basement after 410 Ma, terminating new zircon crystallization within the shear zone but allowing limited further growth in rocks above.",

            "abstract": "Oblique-divergent or transtensional zones present particular challenges in ancient belts because of the poor preservation potential of the thinned continental crust and young oceanic crust. Many oblique belts will preferentially preserve their boundary zones that lie within continents rather than the main plate boundary zone, which will be at a much lower elevation and composed of denser crust. Zones of tectonic escape or strike-slip overprinting of arcs or plateaus deform continental crust and may be better preserved. Here I highlight parameters and processes that have major effects on oblique divergent belts. Strain partitioning is common, but not ubiquitous, along and across oblique boundaries; the causes of partitioning are not always clear and make this especially vexing for work in ancient belts. Partitioning causes complexity in the patterns of structures at all scales. Inherited structures commonly determine the orientation and style of structures along oblique boundaries and can control the pattern of faults across transtensional belts. Regionally, inherited trends of arcs or other 1000-km-scale features can control boundary structures. Experiments and natural examples suggest that oblique boundary zones contain less of a record of strike-slip faulting and more extensional structures. The obliquity of divergence produces predictable families of structures that typify (i) strike-slip dominated zones (obliquity <~20°), (ii) mixed zones (~20° - ~35°), and (iii) extension dominated zones (>~35°). The combination of partitioning and mixed structures in oblique zones means that the boundaries of belts with large-magnitude strike-slip faulting will commonly preserve little of no record of that faulting history. Plate boundaries localize strain onto the main plate boundary structures from the broader plate boundary and therefore the boundary zones commonly preserve the earlier structures more than later structures, a major problem in interpreting ancient belts. Sediment input is critical in some oblique plate boundaries because these belts become more pronounced sediment sinks over time. The evolving topography of oblique boundaries means that they have great variability of sediment flux into differing parts of the system; large rivers enter these belts only in special circumstances.",

Ion anisotropies seem to be constrained by instability thresholds which are in agreement with linear kinetic theory. For plasma states below these instability thresholds, the quasi-stable solar wind plasma sustains a small but detectable level of magnetic fluctuation power. These fluctuations may be related to spontaneous electromagnetic fluctuations arising from the discreteness of charged particles. Here, we study electromagnetic fluctuations propagating along a background magnetic field in a plasma composed of thermal and suprathermal protons and electrons via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The total fluctuating magnetic power is estimated in a proton temperature anisotropy-beta diagram for three different families of proton distribution functions, which can be compared to a number of recent measurements in the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "Stromatolite growth models based on diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) has been fairly successful at producing features commonly recognized in stromatolitic structures in the rock record. These models generally require slow mixing of solutes at time scales comparable to the growth of organisms and largely ignore fluid erosions. Recent research on microbial mats suggests that fluid flow might have a dominant control on the formation, deformation and erosion of surface microbial structures, raising the possibility that different styles of fluid flow may influence the morphology of stromatolites. Many stromatolites formed in relatively high energy, shallow water environments under oscillatory currents driven by wind-induced waves. In order to investigate the potential role of oscillatory flows in shaping stromatolites, we are constructing a numerical model of stromatolite growth parameterized by flume experiments with cyanobacterial biofilms. The model explicitly incorporates reaction-diffusion processes, surface deformation and erosion, biomass growth, sedimentation and mineral precipitation. A Lattice-Boltzmann numerical scheme was applied to the reaction-diffusion equations in order to boost computational efficiency. A basic finite element method was employed to compute surface deformation and erosion. Growth of biomass, sedimentation and carbonate precipitation was based on a modified discrete cellular automata scheme. This model will be used to test an alternative hypothesis for the formation of stromatolites in higher energy, shallow and oscillatory flow environments.",

            "abstract": "Electric field and plasma density observations gathered on the C/NOFS satellite are presented in cases where the ionosphere F-peak has been elevated above the satellite perigee of 400 km near sunset. During these passes, data from the electric field and plasma density probes on the satellite frequently show evidence of “medium scale” (40-80 km) undulations in conjunction with, yet distinct from, series of periodic, larger scale (200-800 km) density depletions. The observations suggest that a second category of wavelike variations of the bottomside plasma density may be important for the subsequent development of the larger scale density depletions and their associated “spread-F” irregularities. The electric fields associated with the medium scale undulations are typically a few mV/m with density variations of a few percent in which upwards E x B drifts are associated with their depletions. The undulations are observed both before and after local sunset and are typically observed, in the satellite frame as it journeys from west to east, prior to the onset of the larger scale depletions. We present examples of these medium scale undulations and discuss their implications for driving the larger scale depletions, possibly in a manner similar to that discussed by Hysell and Kudeki [2004], Kudeki et al.

The mechanical properties (i.e. density, porosity and compressive strength) and the electrical properties (i.e. the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant) of the comet nucleus, constrain both the mechanical and electromagnetic probing capabilities of Rosetta, as well as the choice of landing site, the safety of the landing, and subsurface data interpretation. During landing, the sounding radar data that will be collected by Rosetta’s CONSERT experiment can be used to probe the comet’s upper regolith layer by assessing its dielectric properties, which are then inverted to retrieve the surface mechanical properties. These observations can help characterize the mechanical properties of the landing site, which will optimize the operation of the anchor system. In this effort, we correlate the mechanical and electrical properties of cometary analogs to each other, and derive an empirical model that can be used to retrieve density, porosity and compressive strength from the dielectric properties of the upper regolith inverted from CONSERT observations during the landing phase. In our approach we consider snow as a viable cometary material analog due to its low density and its porous nature. Therefore, we used the compressive strength and dielectric constant measurements conducted on snow at a temperature of 250 K and a density range of 0.4-0.9 g/cm3 in order to investigate the relation between compressive strength and dielectric constant under cometary-relevant density range. Our results suggest that compressive strength increases linearly as function of the dielectric constant over the observed density range mentioned above. The minimum and maximum compressive strength of 0.5 and 4.5 MPa corresponded to a dielectric constant of 2.2 and 3.4 over the density range of 0.4-0.9 g/cm3. This preliminary correlation will be applied to the case of porous and dust contaminated snow under different temperatures to assess the surface mechanical properties for Comet 67P.",

Successfully planning for these future changes requires a sound scientific understanding of the timing, location, and magnitude of climate change impacts on water needs and availability – not only on average trends, but also on interannual and decadal variability and associated uncertainties. In recent years, two types of large ensemble runs ­of climate projections have become available, those from groups of more than 20 different climate ­models, and those from repeated runs of several individual models. These have provided new approaches to the probabilistic evaluation of both climate change and the resulting effects on water resources. Using a range of available climate model ensembles, this research explores the spatial and temporal patterns of uncertainty in projected river runoff and irrigation water requirements. The research compares the time of emergence of anthropogenic signals in precipitation against those of runoff and irrigation needs, considering emergence from both interannual and inter-model noise. Implications of the patterns of model uncertainty are discussed for water management in the U.S. and globally.",

            "abstract": "Liquid water alone does not make an environment habitable. Environmental settings dominated by water-rock reactions such as in hydrothermal vents and springs are natural targets for astrobiological investigation of waterworlds because the rich geochemical diversity at these locales provides abundant energy in solvent to support microbial life. Hydrogen oxidizers are of particular interest because H2-based metabolisms are widespread and deeply rooted throughout the phylogenetic tree of life, implying they may have emerged extremely early in the evolution, and possibly even the origin, of life on Earth and potentially any other rocky bodies bearing liquid water. Dihydrogen (H2) can be lithogenically produced by the hydrolytic oxidation of the ferrous iron component in Fe-bearing minerals as well as by radiolytic cleavage of water by α, β, or γ radiation produced during the decay of radioactive isotopes. Lithogenic H2 production mechanisms operate across a range of rock types, but the concentration of dissolved H2 available to life is controlled by a number of subsurface factors such as surface geometry, water to rock ratio, production rate, and fluid flux. These factors are often controlled by the larger geologic and structural context of a particular site. We present results of an ongoing project that surveys H2 concentrations from terrestrial hydrothermal waters in diverse chemical and physical settings. Aqueous H2 concentrations and potential subsurface controls are presented for sites across the western U.S. including Yellowstone National Park, Lassen Volcanic National Park, and Iceland. In coordination with field data, we also investigate the habitability of various sites numerically by coupling a geochemical model of water-rock interaction with that of single-cell methanogenesis and compute a habitability index for the given environment. In particular, we investigate the control that temperature, rock composition, water composition, and water to rock ratio (dilution) has on biological potential.",

A well constrained thermal equation of state for CaPv is key to several geophysical problems, e.g., lower mantle composition, density contrast between mantle and plates, nature of D” region, etc. Its experimental and theoretical determination have been very challenging because the cubic structure that CaPv adopts at lower mantle conditions is unstable at low temperatures and some of its harmonic phonons have imaginary frequencies. We have used a recently developed hybrid method combining ab initio molecular dynamics with vibrational normal mode analysis to compute its free energy and thermal equation of state at lower mantle conditions. These results are essential to understand the fate of subducted MORB in the mantle.\nResearch supported by NSF grants EAR-1319361 and EAR-1019853",

On the other hand, there are contradictory reports on the response of the potential evaporation to a warming climate. In this study, ground based observations of temperature, and direct measurements of pan potential evaporation are evaluated across the United States. Furthermore, empirical simulations of the potential evaporation have been evaluated against observations. The results show that empirical (e.g., Thornthwaite method) estimates of the potential evapotranspiration show trends inconsistent with the ground-based observations. In fact, while temperature data show a significant upward trend across most of the United States, ground-based evaporation data in most locations do not exhibit a statistically significant trend. Empirical methods of potential evaporation estimation, including the Thornthwaite method, show trends similar to temperature. The primary reason is that many of the empirical approaches are dominated by temperature. Currently, empirical estimates of potential evaporation are widely used for numerous applications including water stress analysis. This indicates that using empirical estimates of potential estimation for irrigation water demand estimation and also drought assessment could lead to unrealistic results.",

            "abstract": "The solar cycle can be understood as a process that alternates the large-scale magnetic field of the Sun between poloidal and toroidal configurations. Although the process that transitions the solar cycle between toroidal and poloidal phases is still not fully understood, theoretical studies, and observational evidence, suggest that this process is driven by the emergence and decay of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) at the photosphere. Furthermore, the emergence of BMRs at the photosphere is the main driver behind solar variability and solar activity in general; making the study of their properties doubly important for heliospheric physics. However, in spite of their critical role, there is still no unified catalog of BMRs spanning multiple instruments and covering the entire period of systematic measurement of the solar magnetic field (i.e. 1975 to present).\nOne of the interesting aspects of the detection of BMRs is that, due to the time and spatial scales of interest, it is tractable for both human observers and automatic detection algorithms. This makes it ideal for comparative studies of the advantages and failing of both approaches. In this presentation we will compare three different BMR catalogs, reduced from magnetograms taken by SOHO/MDI, using human, automatic, and hybrid methods of detection. The focus will be the comparative performance between the three methods, their merits, and disadvantages, and the lessons that can be applied to other imaging data sets.",

            "abstract": "Changes in mountain snow and glaciers have been our strongest indicators of the effects of changing climate. Earlier melt of snow and losses of glacier mass have perturbed regional water cycling, regional climate, and ecosystem dynamics, and contributed strongly to sea level rise. Recent studies however have revealed that in some regions, the reduction of albedo by light absorbing impurities in snow and ice such as dust and black carbon can be distinctly more powerful than regional warming at melting snow and ice.\nIn the Rocky Mountains, dust deposition has increased 5 to 7 fold in the last 150 years, leading to ~3 weeks earlier loss of snow cover from forced melt. In absolute terms, in some years dust radiative forcing there can shorten snow cover duration by nearly two months. Remote sensing retrievals are beginning to reveal powerful dust and black carbon radiative forcing in the Hindu Kush through Himalaya. In light of recent ice cores that show pronounced increases in loading of dust and BC during the Anthropocene, these forcings may have contributed far more to glacier retreat than previously thought.\nFor example, we have shown that the paradoxical end of the Little Ice Age in the European Alps beginning around 1850 (when glaciers began to retreat but temperatures continued to decline and precipitation was unchanged) very likely was driven by the massive increases in deposition to snow and ice of black carbon from industrialization in surrounding nations.\nA more robust understanding of changes in mountain snow and ice during the Anthropocene requires that we move past simplistic treatments (e.g. temperature-index modeling) to energy balance approaches that assess changes in the individual forcings such as the most powerful component for melt – net solar radiation. Remote sensing retrievals from imaging spectrometers and multispectral sensors are giving us more powerful insights into the time-space variation of snow and ice albedo.",

Although the presence of macro-seeps can only be verified through visual confirmation, several studies suggest that gaseous bubbles emitted by seeps are uniquely detected in sonar water-column backscatter returns (Judd and Hovland, 1992; Nikolovska et al., 2008; Weber et al., 2012). In this study, more than 200 seeps were independently identified from a subset of water-column backscatter data collected in March and April, 2014. Additional data collected aboard the Okeanos Explorer includes bathymetry, seafloor backscatter, sub-bottom seismic reflection profiles, and ROV video footage. These datasets, along with calculated geomorphic parameters such as slope, were used to develop specialized mapping products to display physical characteristics of the seafloor and subsurface surrounding a number of gaseous seeps. Preliminary results indicate that seeps occur in a wide variety of geomorphic settings, including the edges of salt domes, and at depths ranging from approximately 300 meters to 1,100 meters. Study results could be used to make predictions about where seeps are most likely to be detected along the continental margin of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. These predictions could inform future efforts to study seeps and their associated biological communities within the study area or aid in the development of larger scale seep characterization and predictive modeling.",

            "abstract": "Annual average Arctic sea ice coverage has declined by 3.6% per decade since the 1980s, but factors driving this trend are uncertain. Long-term surface observations and ice core records suggest recent, large declines in the Arctic atmospheric burden of sulfate aerosol, which may account in part for the warming trend. The decline in black carbon (BC) aerosol in the Arctic during the same period may partly offset the warming due to decreases in sulfate. Here we use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model together with a detailed inventory of historical anthropogenic trace gas and primary aerosol emissions to quantify changes in Arctic radiative forcing from tropospheric ozone and aerosol between 1980 and 2010. Previous studies have reported an increasing trend in observed ozone at 500 hPa over Canada, but our simulation shows no significant trend. Over Europe, good agreement is found with observed long-term trends in sulfate in surface air (observed = -0.14±0.02 μg m-3 yr-1, model = -0.13±0.01 μg m-3 yr-1), while the observed trend in sulfate in precipitation (-0.20±0.03 μg m-3 yr-1) is underestimated by 40%. At Alert, the timing of the observed decline in sulfate after 1991 is well captured in the simulation, but the observed trend between 1991 and 2001 (-36.3±4.1 ng m-3 yr-1) is underestimated by 26%. BC observations at remote Arctic surface stations are biased low throughout 1980-2010 by a factor of 2. At Greenland ice cores, observed 1980-2010 trends in sulfate deposition are underestimated by 35%. The smaller model bias in observed sulfate and BC deposition at ice cores in southern Greenland (5% and 65%) compared to northern Greenland (56% and 90%) indicates greater uncertainty in pollution emissions from Eurasian sources. We estimate a surface radiative forcing from atmospheric aerosols in the Arctic during 2008 of -0.51 W m-2. The forcing is largest in spring (-1.36 W m-2) and dominated by sulfate aerosol (87%). We will quantify the contributions to the observed trends in Arctic aerosol, tropospheric ozone, and net forcing in the Arctic between 1980 and 2010 from emissions changes in Western Europe, Russia, China, North America and the former Soviet Union and Eastern block countries.",

Increases in P loading have been attributed to land use changes, such as timber harvest and wetland drainage. The contribution of P to Upper Klamath Lake has been estimated from each major tributary, yet little research has explored what land use or other variables have most influence on P loading within the tributaries. In addition, previous work has shown a range of potential hydroclimatic shifts by the 2040s, with potential to alter P loading mechanisms. In this study, we use statistical methods including principle component analysis and multiple linear regression to determine what hydroclimatic and landscape variables best explain flow-weighted P concentration in the Sprague River, one of three main tributaries to Upper Klamath Lake. Identification of key variables affecting P loading has direct implications for management decisions in the Upper Klamath River Basin. Increases in P loading related to sediment loading are due to bank and upslope erosion. The former is more prevalent in areas of historic channel alteration and cattle grazing, while the latter is more dominant in areas of heavy timber harvesting and more precipitation as rain.",

Stress analysis in a borehole such as breakout may give stress information, but drilling seismogenic fault at depth is still challenging and it is even more difficult to perform repeated stress measurements for temporal evolution of stress state. Here we consider applying seismic anisotropy as an index of stress state and by observing its temporal change to identify change of stress around the seismogenic fault. In this study, we explored techniques to assess seismic anisotropy in the Nankai Trough accretionary prism, using a borehole seismometer deployed in IODP borehole C0002G, which is located just above the Tonankai earthquake fault. The borehole seismometer is situated at about 900 m below 1966 m deep seafloor, and is operational since January 2013 when the observatory was connected to DONET seafloor cable network.\nWe developed a technique to analyze seismic anisotropy on converted S-wave from microseismic noise records and applied the technique on the borehole seismometer records, by which we expect to evaluate temporal change of anisotropy continuously. We obtained anisotropy of a few percent. We further evaluated depth dependency of anisotropy direction and obtained the difference between the uppermost sedimentary basin and accretionary prism near the plate boundary.\nWe also performed airgun array shooting around the borehole in November 2013 to check validity of the anisotropy result. We applied two different analysis on the airgun records, the one was P-wave seismic anisotropy from the travel time, and the other was S-wave anisotropy using converted S-wave from airgun P-wave. Preliminary results from these analysis were consistent with the microseismic noise analysis. Repeated airgun shooting is planned at the interval of a year or so to evaluate our ability to detect its temporal change.",

            "abstract": "Geological repositories for disposal of high-level nuclear waste generally rely on a multi-barrier system to isolate radioactive waste from the biosphere. An engineered barrier system (EBS), which comprises in many design concepts a bentonite backfill, is widely used. Clay formations have been considered as a host rock throughout the world. Illitization, the transformation of smectite to illite, could compromise some beneficiary features of EBS bentonite and clay host rock such as sorption and swelling capacity. It is the major determining factor to establish the maximum design temperature of the repositories because it is believed that illitization could be greatly enhanced at temperatures higher than 100 oC. However, existing experimental and modeling studies on the occurrence of illitization and related performance impacts are not conclusive, in part because the relevant couplings between the thermal, hydrological, chemical, and mechanical (THMC) processes have not been fully represented in the models. Here we present a fully coupled THMC simulation study of a generic nuclear waste repository in a clay formation with a bentonite-backfilled EBS. Two scenarios were simulated for comparison: a case in which the temperature in the bentonite near the waste canister can reach about 200 oC and a case in which the temperature in the bentonite near the waste canister peaks at about 100 oC. The model simulations demonstrate that illitization is in general more significant under higher temperature. However, the quantity of illitization is affected by many chemical factors and therefore varies a great deal. The most important chemical factors are the concentration of K in the pore water as well as the abundance and dissolution rate of K-feldspar. For the particular case and bentonite properties studied, the reduction in swelling stress as a result of chemical changes vary from 2% up to 70% depending on chemical and temperature conditions, and key mechanical parameters. The modeling work is illustrative in light of the relative importance of different processes occurring in EBS bentonite and clay host rock at higher than 100 oC conditions, and could be of greater use when site specific data are available.",

The P response to forcing may be partitioned into a “slow” temperature-mediated component, and a “fast” response that depends on the nature of the external forcing. Abrupt GHG forcing, for example, leads to an immediate suppression of global-mean P followed by a slower temperature-mediated increase. Previous studies have established that this slow response is roughly independent of forcing, and thus removing the temperature-mediated component from the observed precipitation response yields a picture of the forcing-dependent fast response. The GPCP satellite dataset indicates that, in recent years, global-mean precipitation has decreased even as global-mean surface temperature has remained roughly constant. Does this atypical behavior reveal the signatures of external forcing agents? Using observational data and CMIP5 single-forcing experiments, we examine the roles of various external forcing agents in the hiatus decade and explore their effect on the scaling of precipitation with temperature.",

            "abstract": "The increasing rate of CO2 accumulating in Earth’s oceans creates a threat to organisms that can lead to disturbances in their reproduction, survival and growth. Euphausia pacifica is the dominant species of krill in Monterey Bay, CA, and a keystone species in the bay’s food web. Previous work on the effects of ocean acidification on the survival, growth and molting of E. pacifica have shown they are fairly tolerant to increased CO2 concentrations. However, less is known about energy costs associated with maintaining their internal pH levels which could affect food consumption, swimming behavior or growth activity.\n We hypothesized that krill exposed to high CO2 will increase their feeding rate on local species of phytoplankton to account for increased energy costs of pH buffering activity. We exposed experimental E. pacifica to waters of pH 7.6 (the expected pH surface waters in year 2100), and pH 8.0 (control) periods.test for acclimation or longer term stress. Feeding rates were calculated as changes in phytoplankton counts over 24 hours of feeding using Frost’s equations (Frost 1972). Understanding the way E. pacifica is affected by ocean acidification is important because of the role they play as the primary food source for a variety of predators necessary to maintain the Pacific’s ecology.",

            "abstract": "We developed methodologies that heavily rely on observations extracted from a wide-range of remote sensing data sets (TRMM, Landsat ETM, ENVISAT, ERS, SPOT, Orbview, GeoEye) to develop a warning system for rainfall-induced debris flows in the Jazan province in the Red Sea Hills. The developed warning system integrates static controlling factors and dynamic triggering factors. The algorithm couples a susceptibility map with a rainfall I-D curve, both are developed using readily available remote sensing datasets. The static susceptibility map was constructed as follows: (1) an inventory was compiled for debris flows identified from high spatial resolution datasets and field verified; (2) 10 topographical and land cover predisposing factors (i.e. slope angle, slope aspect, normalized difference vegetation index, topographical position index, stream power index, flow accumulation, distance to drainage line, soil weathering index, elevation and topographic wetness index) were generated; (3) an artificial neural network model (ANN) was constructed, optimized and validated; (4) a debris-flow susceptibility map was generated using the ANN model and refined (using differential backscatter coefficient radar images). The rainfall threshold curve was derived as follows: (1) a spatial database was generated to host temporal co-registered and radiometrically and atmospherically corrected Landsat images; (2) temporal change detection images were generated for pairs of successively acquired Landsat images and criteria were established to identify “the change” related to debris flows, (3) the duration and intensity of the precipitation event that caused each of the identified debris flow events was assumed to be that of the most intense event within the investigated period; and (4) the I-D curve was extracted using data (intensity and duration of precipitation) for the inventoried events. Our findings include: (1) the spatial controlling factors with the highest predictive power of debris-flow locations are: topographic position index, slope, NDVI and distance to drainage line; (2) the ANN model showed an excellent prediction performance (area under receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve: 0.961); 3) the preliminary I-D curve is I=39.797×D-0.7355 (I: Intensity and D: duration).",

Between 1947 and 1961, 37-53 million liters of DDT waste (containing an estimated 350-700 metric tons of DDT) were disposed of at these deep-ocean dumpsites. In 2011 and 2013 we explored these sites with ROV Jason and AUV Sentry, discovering the remains of ~60 barrels scattered across dumpsite 2. Strikingly, many of these barrels were surrounded by distinctive white rings suggestive of microbial activity. We describe our identification and exploration of these sites and present results from chemical analysis of sediment cores collected around waste barrels. DDT and its degradation products (DDE, DDD and DDMU) were detectable at ng to μg per gram concentrations and showed spatial trends with both distance and depth around barrels. Analysis of microbial community DNA provides a first look at the role of microbiological processes in shaping these trends.",

            "abstract": "Particle filters rely on sequential importance sampling and it is well known that their performance can depend strongly on the choice of proposal distribution from which new ensemble members (particles) are drawn. The use of clever proposals has seen substantial recent interest in the geophysical literature, with schemes such as the implicit particle filter and the equivalent-weights particle filter. A persistent issue with all particle filters is degeneracy of the importance weights, where one or a few particles receive almost all the weight. Considering single-step filters such as the equivalent-weights or implicit particle filters (that is, those in which the particles and weights at time tk depend only on the observations at tk and the particles and weights at tk-1), two results provide a bound on their performance. First, the optimal proposal minimizes the variance of the importance weights not only over draws of the particles at tk, but also over draws from the joint proposal for tk-1 and tk. This shows that a particle filter using the optimal proposal will have minimal degeneracy relative to all other single-step filters. Second, the asymptotic results of Bengtsson et al. (2008) and Snyder et al. (2008) also hold rigorously for the optimal proposal in the case of linear, Gaussian systems. The number of particles necessary to avoid degeneracy must increase exponentially with the variance of the incremental importance weights. In the simplest examples, that variance is proportional to the dimension of the system, though in general it depends on other factors, including the characteristics of the observing network. A rough estimate indicates that single-step particle filter applied to global numerical weather prediction will require very large numbers of particles.",

While prior geologic models can provide important input to constrain the spatial variability in subsurface models, in many cases several plausible, but distinct, geologic scenarios may present equally likely descriptions of the available static data. We present an effective model calibration framework for discriminating against several candidate geologic scenarios using nonlinear dynamic data. Our formulation exploits sparse representations for flexible and robust low-rank description of geologic continuity to capture field-scale reservoir connectivity under alternative geologic scenarios. This sparse formulation offers a model selection regularization that is invoked during model calibration to discriminate against proposed geologic scenarios. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods using several examples and case studies.\n  ",

            "abstract": "Costa Rica has a very high seismicity rate and geological processes are part of everyday life. Traditionally, information about these processes has been provided by conventional mass media (television and radio). However, due to the new trends in information flow a new approach towards Science Education is necessary for transmitting knowledge from scientific research for the general public in Costa Rica. Since 1973, the National Seismological Network of Costa Rica (RSN: UCR-ICE) studies the seismicity and volcanic activity in the country. In this study, we describe the different channels to report earthquake information that the RSN is currently using: email, social networks, and a website, as well as the development of a smartphone application. Since the RSN started actively participating in Social Networks, an increase in awareness in the general public has been noticed particularly regarding felt earthquakes. Based on this trend, we have focused on enhancing public outreach through Social Media. We analyze the demographics and geographic distribution of the RSN Facebook Page, the growth of followers, and the significance of their feedback for reporting intensity data. We observe that certain regions of the country have more Facebook activity, although those regions are not the most populated nor have a high Internet connectivity index. We interpret this pattern as the result of a higher awareness to geological hazards in those specific areas. We noticed that the growth of RSN users on Facebook has a strong correlation with the seismic events as opposed to Twitter that displays a steady growth with no clear correlations with specific seismic events. We see the Social Networks as opportunities to engage non-science audiences and encourage the population to participate in reporting seismic observations, thus providing intensity data. With the increasing access to Internet from mobile phones in Costa Rica, we see this approach to science education as an opportunity to transform the view of earthquake hazards in Costa Rica.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Systems there currently experience a balance between frozen and thawed conditions and the proportion of frozen and thawed conditions are expected to change with increasing temperatures and changes in snowfall. Increased temperatures will make these frozen stocks of carbon, much of it labile, vulnerable to decomposition and translocation. Most studies on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems have focused on gaseous fluxes of carbon to the atmosphere, but numerous studies have shown that production and loss of dissolved carbon can be a crucial mechanism for high-latitude ecosystem carbon loss that results in considerable export off the Arctic landscape and may reduce or eliminate terrestrial carbon sinks. In addition, hydrological vertical transport of DOC is an important process in permafrost areas. In collaboration with the NGEE-Arctic study, we measured 14C of DOC from surface waters and from shallow and deep subsurface porewater collected from various locations in the Barrow Arctic Ocean Observatory (BAO) including different drainage locations and thawed lake basins of varying age. Locations were sampled in July and September 2013 to assess changes in 14C-DOC across the landscape and from early and late summer. Preliminary results suggest that DOC in surface and pore water increases in age with depth and across the growing season. These patterns as well as patterns across the landscape will be presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Observations by the NIMS instrument (Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) on the Galileo orbiting spacecraft indicate the surface of Europa is largely dominated by water ice and frost. The dark terrain of Europa is likely to also have highly hydrated salts such as magnesium and sodium sulfate. Various hydration states of these compounds have previously been investigated and spectrally characterized. However, frozen brine solutions, which could more directly represent the subsurface ocean composition, have been largely neglected in these studies. Where frozen brine salts have been considered, changes in their reflectance spectra have not been well characterized with respect to changes in concentration, temperature and grain size. We present a quantitative comparison of spectral reflectance changes (0.35-10 µm) of magnesium and sodium sulfate brines with respect to changes in concentration (0%, 1%, 10%, and saturated solutions in water), temperature (100K, 175K, and 250K), and grain size (5 µm to 200µm). We have also developed a novel technique to simulate very fine grain brine frost that could represent emplaced material on the surface by ejection from plumes. This plume material could have physical properties and composition unique from other regions, providing spectroscopic evidence that is diagnostic of surface activity. Our analysis has shown that the spectral features of the frozen brines are grain size dependent, most noticeably near 3.0µm. We intend to use this grain size dependent spectral feature as a diagnostic tool for comparative analysis of surface spectra and visual imaging of geological features. The implications of this research will allow for a better understanding and validation of theories regarding geological morphology, more precise linear mixture modeling for the determination of exact surface composition, and improved inputs for precipitation and fractional crystallization models of ocean content and ocean concentrations.",

Specifically, FOSTERRS will work to ensure that (1) suitable aircraft and satellite imagery and radar observations are quickly made available in a manner that can be integrated into oil spill detection and mitigation efforts, (2) existing imagery interrogation techniques are in the hands of those who will provide the 24 x 7 operational support and (3) efforts are made to develop new technology where the existing techniques do not provide oil spills responders with important information they need. The FOSTERRS mission goal places it in an ideal place for identification of critical technological needs, and identifying bottlenecks in technology acceptance.\nThe core FOSTERRS team incorporates representation for operations and science for agencies with relevant instrumental and platform assets (NASA, NOAA, USGS, NRL). FOSTERRS membership will open to a wide range of end-user agencies and planned observer status from industry and academic experts, and eventually international partners. Through these collaborations, FOSTERRS facilitates interagency and cooperation and communication to the larger end-user community on remote sensing and its best use.",

Ensemble regression has been recently utilized in modeling various hydrologic systems and showed advantage over classical regression approaches to such studies. A challenging task in ensemble modeling is the proper training of the ensemble’s individual learners and the ensemble combiners. In this work, an ensemble framework is proposed to enhance the generalization ability of the sub-ensemble models and its combiner. Information mixtures between the subsamples are introduced. Such measure is dedicated to the ensemble members and ensemble combiners. Controlled homogeneity magnitudes are then stimulated and induced in the proposed model via a two-stage resampling algorithm. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used as ensemble members in addition to different ensemble integration plans. The model provided superior results when compared to previous models applied to the case study in this work. The root mean squared error (RMSE) in the testing phase for the drought quantiles improved by 67% - 76%. The bias error (BIAS) also showed 61% - 95% improvement.",

            "abstract": "A large apparent plume of water vapor was detected at the south pole of Europa in December 2012 by the Hubble Space Telescope [Roth et al., 2014] when Europa was near maximum radial distance (apojove) in its orbit around Jupiter. The absence thus far of further detections both at apojove and elsewhere may indicate an episodic source. There was reportedly no evident brightening locally or globally of the Europa oxygen neutral atmosphere coincident with the plume water vapor detection. This could be consistent with an O2-driven cryovolcanism model in which bubbles of trapped gases in the ice crust are released from clathrates on thermal contact with rising oceanic water and expand to force upward fluid flows to the surface. It has long been suggested [Chyba, 2000; Cooper et al., 2001] that the Europa ocean could be oxygenated by radiolytic oxygen from surface irradiation, also implying that the overlying ice crust could be saturated in oxygen clathrates [Hand et al., 2006]. That the moon ocean could be a potentially habitable environment by oxygenation or other processes has been a major motivation for missions to Europa. The radiolytic gas source would be far greater at Europa as compared to much lesser source rates for a similar model at Enceladus [Cooper et al., 2009]. Detected plume emissions could arise from both the directly ejected vapor and from sputtering and/or sublimation of chemically-active plume frost in the polar cap region. Europa’s surface gravity is much higher than that of Enceladus, so most of the plume vapor would return to the surface as frost. If sputtering or radiolysis were active contributors to polar cap emissions from the frost, then emissions could also maximize at 6.5-hour intervals as Europa passes through the densest part of the jovian magnetospheric plasma sheet as well as at 85-hour apojove intervals of the orbital period. For comparison to available polar cap plume and global atmospheric observations we present ballistic simulations of the resultant neutral gas density distributions for different source models.\nChyba, C., Nature, 403, 381, 2000.\nCooper, J.

We studied the properties of the turbulent plasma sheet in the presence and in the absence of the bursty bulk flow events for different phases of geomagnetic substorms and for quiet geomagnetic conditions. The criteria used for the selection of BBFs are similar to ones established by Angelopoulos et al., (JGR, 1994). The classification of time intervals as quiet, expansion phase, and recovery phase was based on the variation of the AL-index (Stepanova et al., 2011). Statistical analysis was performed using the data of THEMIS probes during tail-science seasons. It was found that the plasma pressure is the parameter which experienced major variation if we compare the data for different substrom phases, and also in the presence and absence of BBFs: The radial plasma pressure profiles are steaper during the substorm expansion phase, the presence of BBFs smoothes this effect, especially during the recovery phase and the quiet time. Study of eddy diffusion showed that even in the absence of BBFs the plasma sheet is strongly turbulent. Analysis of bulk velocity data 20 minutes before and after a BBF showed that the BBFs could generate additional vorticity at the leading and trailing edges, but their contribution is not decisive.",

            "abstract": "Producing undergraduates capable of broad, independent thinking is one of the grand challenges in science education. Experience-based learning, specifically hands-on research, is one mechanism for increasing students’ ability to think critically. With this in mind, we created a two-semester long research program called SUPER (Skills for Undergraduate Participation in Ecological Research) aimed at teaching students to think like scientists and enhancing the student research experience through instruction and active-learning about the scientific method. Our aim was for students to gain knowledge, skills, and experience, and to conduct their own research. In the first semester, we hosted active-learning workshops on “Forming Hypotheses”, “Experimental Design”, “Collecting and Managing Data”, “Analysis of Data”, “Communicating to a Scientific Audience”, “Reading Literature Effectively”, and “Ethical Approaches”. Each lesson was taught by different scientists from one of many ecological disciplines so that students were exposed to the variation in approach that scientists have. In the second semester, students paired with a scientific mentor and began doing research. To ensure the continued growth of the undergraduate researcher, we continued the active-learning workshops and the students attended meetings with their mentors. Thus, the students gained technical and cognitive skills in parallel, enabling them to understand both “the how” and “the why” of what they were doing in their research. The program culminated with a research poster session presented by the students.\nThe interest in the program has grown beyond our expectations, and we have now run the program successfully for two years. Many of the students have gone on to campus research jobs, internships and graduate school, and have attributed part of their success in obtaining their positions to their experience with the SUPER program. Although common in other sciences, undergraduate research experiences are rare in ecology. We feel that development and implementation of these types of active-learning, research based programs can help universities to produce undergraduate researchers capable of contributing meaningfully to research, and to greater societal issues by enhancing their problem solving and critical thinking skills.",

The system utilizes the Navy’s Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM), the Navy’s HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), and the Los Alamos National Laboratory’s sea ice (CICE) model for the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice model respectively. Using this model, we examine lead times needed to predict ice free conditions, and examine the model biases with multiple approaches. For the years 2013 and 2014, we perform hindcast runs starting at intervals of days to weeks before the minimum Arctic ice extent. As expected, shorter lead times lead to a better performance of the prediction of ice free periods, but biases associated with relatively short lead times (i.e., days) differ from biases associated with relatively longer lead (i.e., weeks) times. The representation of synoptic events is important during short lead times, while difficulties in representing surface fluxes are important for longer lead times. This study aids in the understanding of the important processes needed for sea ice prediction at different time-scales.",

ASR performs slightly better than ERAI in terms of annual mean bias for near-surface temperature, dewpoint, pressure, and wind speed, but RMSE and correlations significantly improve over ERAI. These results demonstrate the advantage that the higher resolution ASR provides in the assimilation of additional observations. Upper-level analyses are shown to be well assimilated as biases in temperature, geopotential height, relative humidity, and wind speed are very small compared to radiosonde data. ASR demonstrates lower RMSEs and higher correlations than ERAI throughout most of the free atmosphere, particularly for relative humidity and wind speed. An investigation of the forecast precipitation shows negative biases during cool months similar to ERAI, but positive precipitation biases in ASR during the summer months in the mid-latitudes. A closer look at stations north of 60°N shows that ASR is slightly better than ERAI with smaller biases, except during the summer when too little precipitation falls. Downward shortwave radiation is larger in ASR compared to ERAI and BSRN station observations; however both reanalyses have modest downward longwave radiation deficits during most months.",

However, little is known about how local phenomena such as variations in water and carbon fluxes at a fine temporal scale relate to large scale phenomena and vice versa. The EcoSpec project aims to identify patterns and associations between high frequency optical data and meteorological and biological measurements for investigating near-surface biosphere-atmosphere interactions. To meet the data needs of this investigation, we are constructing a tower-based system that integrates multiple sensor types including a radiometer, thermal infrared sensor, shadowband direct-diffuse radiometer, albedometer, and a RGB camera. This optical tower will be a self-sufficient and easily deployable unit using solar power and cellular data communications for data transfer. Data flow, system architecture, and networking are designed to transmit data wirelessly to a remote location near real-time and maintain versatility to support anticipated upgrades. In this presentation, we will discuss this critical first step—a multi-sensor optical tower system—as a means of collecting optical data toward new investigations for biosphere-atmosphere interactions. This system will provide valuable insights into facilitating an optical sensor network for analyzing ecosystem fluxes across ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Utilization of CO2 to stimulate natural gas production in previously fractured shale-dominated reservoirs where CO2 remains in place for long-term storage may be an attractive new strategy for reducing the cost of managing anthropogenic CO2. A preliminary analysis of capacities and potential revenues in US shale plays suggests nearly 390 tcf in additional gas recovery may be possible via CO2 driven enhanced gas recovery. However, reservoir transmissivity properties, optimum gas recovery rates, and ultimate fate of CO2 vary among reservoirs, potentially increasing operational costs and environmental risks. In this paper, we identify key mechanisms controlling the sorption of CH4 and CO2 onto phyllosilicates and processes occurring in mixed gas systems that have the potential of impacting fluid transfer and CO2 storage in shale dominated formations. Through a unique set of in situ experimental techniques coupled with molecular-level simulations, we identify structural transformations occurring to clay minerals, optimal CO2/CH4 gas exchange conditions, and distinguish between adsorbed and intercalated gases in a mixed gas system. For example, based on in situ measurements with magic angle spinning NMR, intercalation of CO2 within the montmorillonite structure occurs in CH4/CO2 gas mixtures containing low concentrations (<5 mol%) of CO2. A stable montmorillonite structure dominates during exposure to pure CH4 (90 bar), but expands upon titration of small fractions (1-3 mol%) of CO2. Density functional theory was used to quantify the difference in sorption behavior between CO2 and CH4 and indicates complex interactions occurring between hydrated cations, CH4, and CO2. The authors will discuss potential impacts of these experimental results on CO2-based hydrocarbon recovery processes.",

            "abstract": "Long-term, high-resolution paleoclimate data has never been more important as a means of putting global climate change in context. The inherent complexities of natural climate variability require a very long paleoproxy record that spans many cycles of overlapping multi-scale climate oscillations, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), in order to distinguish the true effects of climate change. The tropical region has important linkages to global climate regulation and its annual stability makes it highly sensitive to climate change. It is predicted that tropical ecosystems will experience greater climate-related stress than those located at the poles. Yet, this region has an underrepresentation of high-resolution terrestrial paleoclimate records, such as those derived from the tree ring archives. South Florida, like many areas of the subtropics, has few tree species that are suitable for dendrochronological studies due to non-visible or seasonally inconsistent ring production.\n This study examines the potential of Pinus elliottii trees from Big Pine Key as a high-resolution terrestrial paleoclimate proxy for South Florida. The trees were difficult to cross-date using standard dendrochronology techniques. Instead, a chronology extending from 1927 to 2005 was developed by cross-dating patterns in the δ13C records. There is a strong, but complex, correlation between δ13C, ENSO and the AMO. The δ13C record trends with ENSO during the cool phase of the AMO, but there is an inverse relationship between δ13C and ENSO during the warm phases. The transition in the relationship between δ13C and ENSO occurs about 5 years before the AMO phase shift. In addition, preliminary analysis shows that about 45% of the variance in the carbon isotope chronology is related to precipitation and the ENSO signal is captured through the timing of that precipitation. During El Niño years, there is an increase in dry season precipitation, so a decrease in δ13C is witnessed in the latewood; whereas during La Niña years, when winters and springs are drier but the summer precipitation is close to normal, there is a decrease in the δ13C of the earlywood. These P. elliottii trees show promise as a paleoclimate proxy for precipitation, ENSO and the AMO in subtropical Florida.",

Recent advances in high speed measurement of Rayleigh scattering has enabled distributed recording of seismic waves over long sections of fiber; this approach, referred to as distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has the potential to allow nearly continuous monitoring of near-surface mechanical properties, a crucial target for geotechnical management of infrastructure dependent on soil strength.\nWe present initial results from our effort to build a real-time soil property monitoring system based on DAS; our approach employs seismic interferometry and dispersion analysis of ambient noise generated by infrastructure to provide a continuously updated model of shear modulus. Our preliminary results include an in-depth investigation of DAS fiber response in the context of active sources; this component of our study verifies classical models for the azimuthal response of straight fibers to propagating surface waves. We also explore the “noisescape” of linear infrastructure and show a usable seismic signal band of 8-40 hz at a series of sites, primarily consisting of Rayleigh waves. Finally, we present preliminary results from a DAS monitoring array installed at the Richmond Field Station near a heavily used road and compare interferometric processing of the acquired data to that generated by surface deployment of geophones.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural ammonia (NH3) emissions are highly uncertain in current bottom-up inventories. Ammonium nitrate is a dominant component of fine aerosols in agricultural regions such as the Central Valley of California, especially during winter. Recent high resolution regional modeling efforts in this region have found significant ammonium nitrate and gas-phase NH3 biases during summer. We compare spatially-resolved surface and boundary layer gas-phase NH3 observations during NASA DISCOVER-AQ California with Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) regional model simulations driven by the EPA NEI 2008 inventory to constrain wintertime NH3 model biases. We evaluate model performance with respect to aerosol partitioning, mixing and deposition to constrain contributions to modeled NH3 concentration biases in the Central Valley Tulare dairy region. Ammonia measurements performed with an open-path mobile platform on a vehicle are gridded to 4 km resolution hourly background concentrations. A peak detection algorithm is applied to remove local feedlot emission peaks. Aircraft NH3, NH4+ and NO3- observations are also compared with simulations extracted along the flight tracks. We find NH3 background concentrations in the dairy region are underestimated by three to five times during winter and NH3 simulations are moderately correlated with observations (r = 0.36). Although model simulations capture NH3 enhancements in the dairy region, these simulations are biased low by 30-60 ppbv NH3. Aerosol NH4+ and NO3- are also biased low in CMAQ by three and four times respectively. Unlike gas-phase NH3, CMAQ simulations do not capture typical NH4+ or NO3- enhancements observed in the dairy region. In contrast, boundary layer height simulations agree well with observations within 13%. We also address observational constraints on simulated NH3 deposition fluxes. These comparisons suggest that NEI 2008 wintertime dairy emissions are underestimated by a factor of three to five. We test sensitivity to emissions by increasing the NEI 2008 NH3 emissions uniformly across the dairy region and evaluate the impact on modeled concentrations. These results are applicable to improving predictions of ammoniated aerosol loading and highlight the value of mobile platform spatial NH3 measurements to constrain emission inventories.",

            "abstract": "Here we present the LA-ICP-MS U–Pb ages and Hf isotopic record of detrital zircons from the active alluvial fans at the west coast of the Red Sea. The Ras Manazal alluvial fan (primarily composed of zircon, magnetite with some rutile, ilmenite and monazite) yielded a relatively restricted age population ranges from 765 to 666 Ma. These ages and present-day drainage pattern is consistent that the sediments are primarily derived from erosion of nearby subduction related granitoids in the immediate west (i.e., not more than 50 km from the Red Sea coast) of the fan. In contrast, approximately 160 km south, at the Egypt-Sudan border, the Wadi Diit fan is relatively more enriched in ilmenite and REE-bearing phases (e.g., thorite, monazite, xenotime, garnet etc.) and yielded five zircon age populations of 1) 824–733 Ma, 2) 730–705 Ma, 3) 646–608 Ma, 4) 516–500 Ma, and 5) 134–114 Ma. The age populations 1–3 if coupled with the present-day drainage pattern can be related to the earlier subduction related and later post collision granitoids in the southern part of the South Eastern Desert and Gebeit terrane of northern Sudan. Sparse Early Cretaceous zircons (134–114 Ma) are derived from the Mesozoic volcanic suits in the source region. However, the age group 516–500 Ma is enigmatic. Wadi Diit zircons are primarily derived from granitoids in the broad S-N directed Hamisana Shear Zone and its subordinate SW to NE directed Onib-Sol-Hamed Suture Zone. These shear zones provided pathways for the present-day drainage system for sediment transportation to the Wadi Diit and adjacent coastal region. We infer that the ca. 500 Ma late-stage magmatic zircons represent a hitherto unknown magmatic event, possibly related to the shear heating associated with the crustal scale shear zones. This implies that the shear zones in the South Eastern Desert and northern Sudan remained thermally active as late as ~500 Ma. The time resolved hafnium composition (εHf (t)) of both fans varies from +3.5 to +13.5. Our new U–Pb ages and Hf isotopic composition suggests that the detrital zircons were derived from the Neoproterozoic juvenile crust. This is consistent with the Neoproterozoic juvenile igneous and metamorphic rocks in the Eastern Desert and northern Sudan.",

            "abstract": "We apply a cohesive fracture (CF) model to results of short-rod (SR), notched 3-point-bend (N3PB) tests, and Brazil tests in Indiana Limestone. Calibration and validation of the model are performed within a commercial finite element modeling platform. By using a linear traction-displacement softening response for a defined fracture-opening displacement (w1) following peak tensile stress (σcrit), the CF model numerically lumps different spatially distributed inelastic processes occurring at and around fracture tips into a thin zone within an elastic domain. Both the SR and the N3PB test specimen geometries use a notch partway through the sample to control the location of fracture propagation. We develop a mesh for both the SR and N3PB geometries with a narrow cohesive zone in the center of notches. From the Brazil tests, we find a tensile splitting stress (σsplit) of 5.9 MPa. We use a σsplit as the peak tensile stress (σcrit) for all simulations. The Young’s modulus (E) and the critical crack opening distance (w1) of the CF model are calibrated against the SR data. The model successfully captures the elastic, yield, peak, and initial and late failure behavior and compares favorably against the N3PB tests. Differences in force-displacement and crack propagation are primarily caused by: more mixed-mode (shear and opening) crack propagation in N3PB than in SR tests, causing a higher peak; and transition from compression (high E) to tension (low E) in a larger volume of the N3PB sample than in the SR geometry.

While all of these agents can act as forcing or feedbacks, they are analyzed here using a forcing/response framework. We estimate perturbations of these species using observations (stratospheric ozone and aerosol) and using modeled changes in carbon dioxide increase experiments using a climate model (stratospheric water vapor). We use the Community Earth System Model (CESM) throughout. The radiative forcing and climate responses are estimated using consistent model calculations (fixed sea surface temperature and slab ocean configurations of the model). Thus, we are estimating the efficacy of these forcing agents. The results suggest that some stratospheric forcing agents have less impact on surface climate than there radiative forcing would indicate. Since the perturbation used for stratospheric water is obtained by its change in carbon dioxide change experiments, the results have direct implications to the climate feedback strength of stratospheric water vapor.",

            "abstract": "From initial motion of sediment in rivers, to landslides and rock fall, predictions of granular transport typically rely on a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion in which resistance to motion is parameterized by a friction angle. Empirically determined friction angles are generally large and variable when applied to the movement of a single grain as in fluvial transport, but are generally smaller and more consistent when applied to effectively infinite numbers of grains as in soil mechanics. We propose that these two end member definitions of friction angle are linked by transmission of force along grain to grain contacts (i.e. granular force chains) over length scales of 1 to ~ 20 grain diameters. A numerical model based on the statistics of individual grain-pocket friction angles, targeted physical experiments, and discrete element modeling all demonstrate that the maximum stable angle of granular material on a rough bed decreases by up to 15° as the number of potentially unstable particles increases. Decreased stability with increasing number of grains occurs as force chains become longer and more effective at dislodging downslope grains. The average friction angle for an assembly of particles therefore emerges directly from the statistics of the individual grain-pocket friction angles and is distinct from the sliding coefficient of friction acting between grains. Small clusters of grains abound at the earth’s surface, and we suggest that force chains are important for a wide variety of subaerial and subaqueous sediment transport processes.",

They also fulfil a unique role of public outreach officer, conducting live presentations about their field site and research as well as journaling, answering questions, and posting photos.\nEvaluation data collected over the past eight years on program participants shows that PolarTREC has clearly achieved it goals and strongly suggests programs that link teachers and researchers can have the potential to transform the nature of science education. By giving teachers the content knowledge, pedagogical tools, confidence, understanding of science in the broader society, and experiences with scientific inquiry, participating teachers are using authentic scientific research in their classrooms. Not surprisingly this has also led to increases in student interest and knowledge about the Polar Regions.\nIn this presentation, we will highlight the best practices of teacher research experiences as well as discuss why it is vital to have teachers and researchers work together to communicate science to the broader public.",

            "abstract": "Bromine possesses a chemistry broadly comparable to that of Cl and F, however its heavier mass and lower abundance results in slightly different behaviours in geochemical cycling. For example it is disproportionately enriched in sea water with respect to Cl. Br can be considered to be a “hydrophile” element, and hence its behaviour is in governed by that of water. It possesses two isotopes 79Br (50.686%) and 81Br (49.314%).\nThis study has developed new chemical extraction, and most significantly, new mass spectrometric protocols for Br isotopes on silicates, evaporites and waters using N-TIMS methodologies. Existing CF-IRMS methodologies offer internal precision of ~0.3‰ (1SD, [1]), whereas N-TIMS measurements of laboratory HBr and seawater standards produce external reproducibility of <0.07‰ (1SD) over an 18 month period with internal precision typically <0.06‰ (1SD) on single analyses.\nThis study presents the first high precision, N-TIMS isotopic data on playa lake evaporites, recording a >5‰ variation in solar system 81Br/79Br. Also presented is data from the analysis of the halophylic saltbush (sp Atriplex) adjacent to the lakes to constrain biological fractionation of Br isotopes. Variations of ~4‰ are observed between the lakes with a comparable shift for the leaves of the saltbush.\n[1] Shouaker-Stash et al., Anal. Chem, 77; p4027-4033, 2005.",

            "abstract": "The use of reservoir stimulation techniques, such as hydraulic fracturing, has grown tremendously over the last decade, and concerns have arisen that reservoir stimulation creates environmental threats through the creation of permeable pathways that could connect the stimulated reservoir to shallower groundwater aquifers. This study investigates, by numerical simulation, gas and water transport between a deeper tight-gas reservoir and a shallower overlying groundwater aquifer following hydraulic fracturing operations, assuming that the formation of a connecting pathway has already occurred. We focus on two general transport scenarios: 1) communication between the reservoir and aquifer via a connecting fracture or fault and 2) communication via a deteriorated, preexisting nearby well. The simulations explore a range of permeabilities and geometries over time scales, and evaluate the mechanisms and factors that could lead to the escape of gas or reservoir fluid and the contamination of groundwater resources. We also examine the effects of overpressured reservoirs, and explore long-term transport processes as part of a continuing study.\nWe conclude that the key factors driving short-term transport of gas include high permeability for the connecting pathway and the overall volume of the connecting feature. Gas production from the reservoir via a horizontal well is likely to mitigate release through the reduction of available free gas and the lowering of reservoir pressure. We also find that fractured tight-gas reservoirs are unlikely to act as a continuing source of large volumes of migrating gas, and incidents of gas escape are likely to be limited in duration and scope. Reliable field and laboratory data must be acquired to constrain the factors and determine the likelihood of these outcomes.",

            "abstract": "The stable isotopic composition (δ18O and δD) of precipitation and derivative surface and ground water has been shown to be a function of elevation (precipitation-weighted hypsometric mean elevation in the case of surface or ground water), particularly for the windward side of mountain ranges. The elevation dependence of this relationship has been exploited for paleoaltimetry studies where δ-values of geological proxies for paleowaters have been used to estimate the paleoelevation and topographic growth (or decay) of many of the world’s mountain ranges and plateaux. However, these same water δ-elevation relationships have also been used to infer surface elevation and/or climate change on the leeward side of mountain ranges and interior of plateaux, where factors other than elevation have a significant impact.\nHere, we present new surface water isotope data across the Andean plateau from the Eastern Cordillera to the Pacific Ocean. This dataset provides much needed constraints on modern water isotope evolution across the plateau and a context for the interpretation of elevation and climate proxies from the rock record in this continental environment. Our results show: 1) A progressive westward increase in δ18O that we attribute to a larger fraction of recycled water in precipitation, similar to what is observed on the Tibetan Plateau; 2) A southward increase in δ18O, likely due to the relatively arid climate in the south and; 3) That Easterly-derived precipitation appears to dominate the entire Andean plateau (including the Western Cordillera). These data suggest that paleoaltimetry studies based on samples collected on the Andean Plateau and Western Cordillera may overestimate increases in surface elevation.",

            "abstract": "There is a long history of cooperation between students at the University of Colorado, Boulder and professional engineers and scientists at LASP, which has led to many successful space missions with direct student involvement. The recent student-led missions include the Student Nitric Oxide Explorer (SNOE, 1998 – 2002), the Student Dust Counter (SDC) on New Horizons (2006 – present), the Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment (CSSWE), being a very successful NSF CubeSat that launched in September 2012, and the NASA Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) CubeSat (launch will be in early 2015). Students are involved in all aspects of the design, and they experience the full scope of the mission process from concept, to fabrication and test, and mission operations. A significant part of the student involvement in the CubeSat projects is gained by using the CubeSat development as a focal point for an existing two-semester course sequence in CU’s Aerospace Engineering Sciences (AES) Department: the Space Hardware Design section of Graduate Projects I & II (ASEN 5018 & ASEN 6028). The goal of these courses is to teach graduate students how to design and build systems using a requirement-based approach and fundamental systems engineering practices. The two-semester sequence takes teams of about 15 students from requirements definition and preliminary design through manufacturing, integration, and testing. In addition to the design process, students learn key professional skills such as working effectively in groups, finding solutions to open-ended problems, and actually building a system to their own set of specifications. The partnership between AES and LASP allows us to include engineering professionals in the mix, thus more effectively training science and engineering students for future roles in the civilian or commercial space industry. The mentoring process with LASP engineers helps to mitigate risk of the inexperience of the students and ensures consistent system engineer oversight for the multi-year CubeSat programs.",

            "abstract": "Bed load transport is a notoriously unpredictable process. A primary component of this unpredictability arises from stochastic fluctuations which require non-trivial averaging. This averaging must be informed by the length and time scales of the fluctuations, and a rigorous method for arriving at the proper averaging scales must link grain scale motion to macroscopic transport. A statistical mechanical framework has been suggested by Furbish and colleagues to accomplish this goal. This model assumes that grain motion is independent of other particles. Experiments show that this is not the case, and that bed load fluctuations possess length and time scales larger than any hydrodynamic scaling. This indicates that fluctuations in grain motion are correlated; as hydrodynamics cannot explain this behavior, we posit that its origins lie in the granular dynamics of bed load transport. Evidence to support this view can be found in the work of Ancey and colleagues where they show that, upon approaching the threshold of motion: intermittency of transport grows, dynamics of grain motion slow down, and collective entrainment occurs. These behaviors are hallmarks of a disordered system approaching a jamming transition, or the point where motion ceases. This points to the utility of using the jamming framework to study transport near threshold. We seek to use this framework to document the occurrence and understand the origins of the collective entrainment of grains. This is done using a 2D experiment with spherical particles driven by a turbulent flow where collisions are a significant driver of entrainment due to the momentum transfer that occurs when saltating particles collide with the bed. We characterize the collective particle motion observed in the system using the Χ4 susceptibility. This measure uses the variance of the displacement of a population of sediment in the system to characterize the timescales at which a subset of grains move collectively relative to the rest of the system. We find evidence that the correlation scales of collective particle dynamics change with the driving rate. These observations elucidate the granular contributions to stochastic bed load transport, and demonstrate how the requisite averaging time for bed load measurements increases rapidly on approach to the threshold of motion.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how students use their conceptual models to reason about societal challenges involving societal issues such as natural hazard risk assessment, environmental policy and management, and energy resources can improve instructional activity design that directly impacts student motivation and literacy. To address this question, we created four laboratory exercises for an introductory physical geology course at Texas A&M University that engages students in authentic scientific practices by using real world problems and issues that affect societies based on the theory of situated cognition. Our case-study design allows us to investigate the various ways that students utilize model based reasoning to identify and propose solutions to societally relevant issues.\nIn each of the four interventions, approximately 60 students in three sections of introductory physical geology were expected to represent and evaluate scientific data, make evidence-based claims about the data trends, use those claims to express conceptual models, and use their models to analyze societal challenges. Throughout each step of the laboratory exercise students were asked to justify their claims, models, and data representations using evidence and through the use of argumentation with peers. Cognitive apprenticeship was the foundation for instruction used to scaffold students so that in the first exercise they are given a partially completed model and in the last exercise students are asked to generate a conceptual model on their own.\nStudent artifacts, including representation of earth systems, representation of scientific data, verbal and written explanations of models and scientific arguments, and written solutions to specific societal issues or environmental problems surrounding earth systems, were analyzed through the use of a rubric that modeled authentic expertise and students were sorted into three categories. Written artifacts were examined to identify student argumentation and justifications of solutions through the use of evidence and reasoning. Higher scoring students justified their solutions through evidence-based claims, while lower scoring students typically justified their solutions using anecdotal evidence, emotional ideologies, and naive and incomplete conceptions of earth systems.",

            "abstract": "Advancements in monitoring and prediction of precipitation and severe storms can provide significant benefits for water resource managers, allowing them to mitigate flood damage risks, capture additional water supplies and offset drought impacts, and enhance ecosystem services.\nA case study for the San Francisco Bay area provides the context for quantification of the benefits of an Advanced Quantitative Precipitation Information (AQPI) system. The AQPI builds off more than a decade of NOAA research and applications of advanced precipitation sensors, data assimilation, numerical models of storms and storm runoff, and systems integration for real-time operations. An AQPI would dovetail with the current National Weather Service forecast operations to provide higher resolution monitoring of rainfall events and longer lead time forecasts.\nA regional resource accounting approach has been developed to quantify the incremental benefits assignable to the AQPI system; these benefits total to $35 M/yr in the 9 county Bay region. Depending on the jurisdiction large benefits for flood damage avoidance may accrue for locations having dense development in flood plains. In other locations forecst=based reservoir operations can increase reservoir storage for water supplies. Ecosystem services benefits for fisheries may be obtained from increased reservoir storage and downstream releases. Benefits in the transporation sectors are associated with increased safety and avoided delays. Compared to AQPI system implementation and O&M costs over a 10 year operations period, a benefit – cost (B/C) ratio is computed which ranges between 2.8 to 4. It is important to acknowledge that many of the benefits are dependent on appropriate and adequate response by the hazards and water resources management agencies and citizens.",

            "abstract": "Carbon in the subsurface below the root zone is an important yet poorly understood link in the terrestrial C cycle, interfacing between overlying soil and downstream aquatic systems. Thus, the nature and behavior of C in the vadose zone and groundwater, particularly the dynamics of mobile dissolved and suspended aqueous species, need to be understood for predicting C cycling and responses to climate change. This study is designed to understand the C balance (influxes, effluxes, and sequestration) and mechanisms controlling subsurface organic and inorganic C transport and transformation. Our initial investigations are being conducted at the Rifle Site floodplain along the Colorado River, in Colorado (USA). Within this floodplain, sediment samples were collected and sampling/monitoring instruments were installed down to 7 m depth at three sites. Pore water and gas samplers at 0.5 m depth intervals within the ~3.5 m deep vadose zone, and multilevel aquifer samplers have yielded depth- and time-resolved profiles of dissolved and suspended organic and inorganic C, and CO2 for over 1.5 years. Analyses conducted to determine seasonally and vertically resolved geochemical profiles show that dissolved organic matter (DOM) characteristics vary among three distinct hydrobiogeochemical zones; the vadose zone, capillary fringe, and saturated zone. The concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are many times higher in the vadose zone and the capillary fringe than in groundwater, and vary seasonally. The DOM speciation, aqueous geochemistry, solid phase analyses, and d13C isotope data show the importance of both biotic and abiotic C transformations during transport through the vertical gradients of moisture and temperature. In addition to DOM, suspended organic C and bacteria have been collected from samplers within the capillary fringe. Based on the field-based findings, long-term laboratory column experiments are being conducted under simulated field moisture, temperature, and geochemical conditions in order to gain more quantitative understanding of the C balance within different hydrobiogeochemical zones.",

            "abstract": "During the ten years since entry into Saturn orbit in 2004, the Cassini spacecraft has made more than 100 close flybys of Titan, measuring the properties of the atmosphere by both in situ and remote sensing techniques. Cassini’s Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) senses the infrared spectrum from 7-1000 μm (1400-10 cm-1), a region which exhibits the vibrational emissions of many different molecular species. CIRS has therefore been able to map the spatial distributions and temporal variations of hydrocarbons, nitriles and other gas species in Titan’s atmosphere, yielding information about the chemistry and dynamics. Recently, Nixon et al. (2013) made the first detection of a new stratospheric gas species from Cassini using CIRS – the C3H6 molecule (propene). This filled in a long-time missing link in the chemical picture of Titan’s lower atmosphere, since the C3H4 (propyne) and C3H8 (propane) molecules had been detected in 1981 by Voyager 1 IRIS. The inferred abundance of C3H6 is less than both C3H8 and C3H4, and this pattern is repeated also in the C2Hx molecules where C2H4 is less abundant than C2H2 and C2H6. Therefore a pattern emerges whereby: alkanes > alkynes > alkenes within the C2Hx and C3Hx chemical families in the lower stratosphere. We comment on how this trend compares to published photochemical model predictions, and also give updates on the search for C3Hx isomers (allene: CH2CCH2, and cyclopropane: c-C3H6) and C4Hx species using CIRS.",

            "abstract": "We apply cluster and factor analyses to bulk chemical data of 130 soil and rock samples measured by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity through sol 650. Multivariate approaches such as principal components analysis (PCA), cluster analysis, and factor analysis compliment more traditional approaches (e.g., Harker diagrams), with the advantage of simultaneously examining the relationships between multiple variables for large numbers of samples. Principal components analysis has been applied with success to APXS, Pancam, and Mössbauer data from the Mars Exploration Rovers. Factor analysis and cluster analysis have been applied with success to thermal infrared (TIR) spectral data of Mars. Cluster analyses group the input data by similarity, where there are a number of different methods for defining similarity (hierarchical, density, distribution, etc.). For example, without any assumptions about the chemical contributions of surface dust, preliminary hierarchical and K-means cluster analyses clearly distinguish the physically adjacent rock targets Windjana and Stephen as being distinctly different than lithologies observed prior to Curiosity’s arrival at The Kimberley. In addition, they are separated from each other, consistent with chemical trends observed in variation diagrams but without requiring assumptions about chemical relationships. We will discuss the variation in cluster analysis results as a function of clustering method and pre-processing (e.g., log transformation, correction for dust cover) and implications for interpreting chemical data. Factor analysis shares some similarities with PCA, and examines the variability among observed components of a dataset so as to reveal variations attributable to unobserved components. Factor analysis has been used to extract the TIR spectra of components that are typically observed in mixtures and only rarely in isolation; there is the potential for similar results with data from APXS. These techniques offer new ways to understand the chemical relationships between the materials interrogated by Curiosity, and potentially their relation to materials observed by APXS instruments on other landed missions.",

We consider the effect of Europa’s gravity in pulling plume vapor back to the surface and the subsequent spreading of adsorbed and exospheric material by thermal desorption and re-sputtering across the entire body. Our results show the global spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the surface exospheric density and composition for several scenarios, e.g., a solely sputtered / radiolytic exosphere, and the inclusion of transient and/or steady plume sources with an Enceladus-like composition.

            "abstract": "Free tropospheric aerosol in the North Atlantic was studied at the Pico Mountain Observatory located on the Pico volcano in the Azores, Portugal (2225 m asl; 38.47°N, 28.40°W). Overall the aerosol chemical, morphological and physical properties indicate a predominance of biomass burning emissions during polluted North American outflows. Black carbon (BC) equivalent mass concentrations have been measured at the station since 2001 with a 7-wavelength aethalometer and were analysed to study seasonal and diurnal variations. There was a large day-to-day variability in the BC values due to varied meteorological conditions that resulted in different diurnal patterns for different months. The daily mean BC at this location ranged between 0 and ~430 ngm-3, with the most frequent values occurring in the range 0–100 ngm-3. The BC values exhibited a consistent annual trend being lower in winter months and higher in summer months, barring year to year variations. Recently, additional aerosol properties were studied using a set of four high-volume samplers for the chemical analysis of aerosol, a 3-wavelength nephelometer to measure aerosol light scattering and backscattering fraction, a two channel optical particle counter and a sequential sampler to collect aerosol for electron microscopy analysis. Summertime daily concentrations of free tropospheric organic carbon, elemental carbon, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), anions and cations were measured from the high-volume filter samples. Selected WSOC samples from September 2012 were further analysed using ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). In this analysis, an increase in aerosol loading was linked to biomass burning emissions using detailed molecular properties and markers associated with the aerosol despite the long-range transport from North America consistent with previous observations.",

            "abstract": "Irrigation substantially alters the timing and magnitude of surface water flows, and continued agricultural intensification to keep up with demand means perpetual stress on surface water resources. A critical challenge is to manage irrigation in a way that balances ecosystem health with sustaining agricultural economies. Coupled hydrologic-agroeconomic models are promising tools for meeting this challenge: the models can quantify 1) how water withdrawal for irrigation impacts streamflows, 2) how these impacts propagate through a surface water system, 3) how the amount of water available for irrigation changes the allocation of resources (e.g. land, water) to available crops, and 4) the impact of water availability on agricultural economies. However, these models can be very data intensive, which limits their applicability. We present a parsimonious coupled hydrologic-agroeconomic model that uses the Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) method, extensively used in agricultural resource economics, and calibrates to data on allotment of agricultural inputs, available from sources such as the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service. PMP assumes that farmers allocate resources to maximize net revenues, justifying the use of optimality conditions to constrain the parameters of the agroeconomic model. We improve the standard PMP model by 1) having the calibrated model reproduce not only the observed input allotment but also the observed yield, and 2) using the ensemble Kalman filter equations to solve the mathematical programming problem recursively, which permits refinement of the model calibration as new observations become available. We demonstrate the proposed agroeconomic model by coupling it to HEC-HMS, a hydrologic model capable of simulating regional natural and man-made water distribution networks, to investigate the sensitivity of streamflows to the allocation of agricultural inputs (land and water) in response to changes in climatic and economic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Many efforts have been made to estimate the maximum run-up height of tsunamis associated with large earthquakes. This is a difficult task, because of the time it takes to construct a tsunami model using real time data from the source. It is possible to construct a database of potential seismic sources and their corresponding tsunami a priori. However, such models are generally based on uniform slip distributions and thus oversimplify our knowledge of the earthquake source. Instead, we can use finite fault models of earthquakes to give a more accurate prediction of the tsunami run-up.\nHere we show how to accurately predict tsunami run-up from any seismic source model using an analytic solution found by Fuentes et al, 2013 that was especially calculated for zones with a very well defined strike, i.e, Chile, Japan, Alaska, etc. The main idea of this work is to produce a tool for emergency response, trading off accuracy for quickness. Our solutions for three large earthquakes are promising. Here we compute models of the run-up for the 2010 Mw 8.8 Maule Earthquake, the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku Earthquake, and the recent 2014 Mw 8.2 Iquique Earthquake. Our maximum rup-up predictions are consistent with measurements made inland after each event, with a peak of 15 to 20 m for Maule, 40 m for Tohoku, and 2,1 m for the Iquique earthquake. Considering recent advances made in the analysis of real time GPS data and the ability to rapidly resolve the finiteness of a large earthquake close to existing GPS networks, it will be possible in the near future to perform these calculations within the first five minutes after the occurrence of any such event. Such calculations will thus provide more accurate run-up information than is otherwise available from existing uniform-slip seismic source databases.",

The theory is capable of simultaneous estimation of model boundary conditions (for simple transient problems, also the initial conditions) and fluid flow and transport parameters, i.e., spatially distributed permeabilities, source/sink rates, storativity, and dispersivity. The theory is robust to measurement errors and strong parameter variability. Effective parameters can be estimated to represent unresolved heterogeneity, e.g., sub-grid features and spatially variable recharge. The theory has been extended to new problems including parameter structure identification, unsaturated and variably saturated flows (e.g., directly estimating the soil retention functions), joint flow and transport inversion (e.g., containment source identification), uncertainty analysis (e.g., integrating subsurface static and dynamic data via geostatistical inversion), and high performance computing (e.g., solving large inversion systems with parallel computing).

However, the Navy Sound Surveillance System hydrophone network, the Canadian National Seismic Network, the U.S. Advanced National Seismic System, and the Harvard Centroid Moment Tensor Catalog report significantly different epicentral locations for swarms of earthquakes near Explorer Ridge in August and October 2008. We relocated the larger (M>5) earthquakes in the August 2008 swarm using data from both U.S. and Canadian networks to improve azimuthal coverage. Absolute locations were determined for the largest events in the swarm, and the smaller events were relocated relative to the largest using a double difference method. To better understand why the locations from land-based seismic networks differ from those computed from the hydrophone arrays, we also examine T-phases from regional events recorded on Ocean Bottom Seismometers from the COLZA and Cascadia Initiative experiments and evaluate the potential for using T-phases to improve the epicentral locations of submarine earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest region.",

            "abstract": "Inland waters act as an important control on the global carbon cycle. Deep tectonic lakes may provide a key link between short-term and long-term carbon cycles as buried carbon is essentially locked away from the atmosphere over geological timescales. Here we investigate Holocene carbon dynamics in one of the worlds most important lake ecosystems, Lake Baikal, Siberia. We test the hypothesis that multiple factors play a significant role in determining long-term carbon dynamics in central Asia, and that these factors change in importance over time.\nCarbon isotopes (δ13C), percentage total organic carbon (%TOC) were analysed during combustion in a Carlo Erba 1500 on-line to a VG Triple Trap and dual-inlet mass spectrometer. A multi-decadal organic geochemistry record (%TOC; δ13C, C/N ratios) was determined on Holocene sediments extracted from a slope terrace c. 600 m deep. Age-depth modelling on radiocarbon-dated pollen extracts was undertaken using ‘Bacon’, which takes into account variable sediment accumulation rates. Carbon mass accumulation rates (CMAR; g cm-2 yr-1) were estimated at a centennial scale resolution.\nδ13C values were routinely higher during cool glacial periods (-26 ‰) than during warmer climates (-28 ‰) linked to changes in carbon sources. Diatom productivity & boreal forest expansion were strongly associated with δ13C variability during the early Holocene, but after 8 kyr BP, no relationships are apparent. CMAR were highest during the early Holocene (11.7 – 8 kyr BP) although rates fluctuated considerably. Peak values of 12.5 g cm-2 yr-1 were observed at 10.35 kyr BP before a rapid decline to c. 5.2 g cm-2 yr-1 at 10.05 kyr BP. CMAR declined to lowest Holocene values of 3.5 g cm-2 yr-1 by 3.9 kyr BP at the same time as maximum δ13C values (-27.0 ‰), indicative of low palaeoproductivity.\nOur data show that measures of palaeoproductivity in Lake Baikal are complex, and during the early Holocene are strongly associated with allochthonous inputs mediated by taiga forest expansion and fluvial input into the lake. Minima in Holocene palaeoproductivity are coincident with peaks in hematite stained grains in North Atlantic sediments, a proxy for ice-rafted debris, highlighting tight linkages via teleconnection processes between changes in the North Atlantic and remote central Asia.",

            "abstract": "Land use disturbance from grazing, timber harvest, and transportation infrastructure has been implicated in stream incision within groundwater-dependent montane meadow ecosystems, particularly in the Sierra Nevada of California. Restoration approaches, such as the widely-used \"Plug-and-Pond\" technique, attempt to restore groundwater levels in incised meadows by introducing shallow, meandering channel morphologies that support more frequent overbank flows and prevent meadow dewatering via seepage to stream networks. Systematic field surveys of over ten \"Plug-and-Pond\" projects built at least eight years ago and distributed across the Sierra Nevada indicate that pre- and post-restoration basin-scale and meadow-scale sediment transport strongly influence restoration outcomes. The scale of anthropogenic disturbance, along with abiotic factors such as climatic gradients and meadow-scale soil characteristics, influence the resilience of restored meadow systems. Based on these observations and analyses, a conceptual model of meadow ecosystem vulnerability to disturbance and potential for restoration prominently features multi-scaled geomorphic feedbacks that incorporate the influence of geology, climate, vegetation, and hydrology.",

            "abstract": "The Southern Ocean has been identified as one of the key regions that need aerosol measurements to improve our models of global climate change. The Portable AERosol Observing System (PAEROS) was deployed in an extended field campaign to measure CCN and aerosols in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean from October 2013 to mid-March 2014. PAEROS is a lightweight, man-portable instrument package developed at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography for the purpose of collecting autonomous measurements of aerosol and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) properties in remote and challenging environments. The initial phase involved the PAEROS package sampling onboard the R/V Gould during the five-day transit of the Drake Passage between Punta Arenas, Chile and Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula. Upon arrival at Palmer Station, PAEROS was transferred to land and installed on top of a hill about 500 m from the main buildings. For five months, aerosol and CCN number concentrations, size distributions, black carbon concentrations, solar fluxes, and meteorological parameters were continuously measured at Palmer Station. The experiment covered most of an austral spring and summer cycle, during which time the sea ice retreated and biological activity flourished along the Antarctic Peninsula. While crossing the Drake Passage, a distinct gradient in aerosol concentrations was observed with increasing distance from South America. At Palmer Station, the total aerosol concentrations showed a seasonal cycle with lowest concentration in air masses originating from the Antarctic continent and highest number concentrations coming from the ocean during the peak of biological activity. Chlorophyll concentrations are routinely measured at Palmer Station and showed peak activity in the month of January 2014. Total aerosol and CCN concentrations increased in late spring (November) as the sea ice recedes from Palmer Station, probably a result of being closer to sea spray and biological activity. Aerosol hygroscopicity decreased for ultrafine particles during the biological periods, which suggests enhanced organic contribution to the composition of smaller particles.",

            "abstract": "When simulating a hydraulic fracturing, the analyst has historically prescribed a single planar fracture. Originally (in the 1950s through the 1970s) this was necessitated by computational restrictions. In the latter part of the twentieth century, hydraulic fracture simulation evolved to incorporate vertical propagation controlled by modulus, fluid loss, and the minimum principal stress. With improvements in software, computational capacity, and recognition that in-situ discontinuities are relevant, fully three-dimensional hydraulic simulation is now becoming possible.\nAdvances in simulation capabilities enable coupling structural geologic data (three-dimensional representation of stresses, natural fractures, and stratigraphy) with decision making processes for stimulation – volumes, rates, fluid types, completion zones. Without this interaction between simulation capabilities and geological information, low permeability formation exploitation may linger on the fringes of real economic viability.\nComparative simulations have been undertaken in varying structural environments where the stress contrast and the frequency of natural discontinuities causes varying patterns of multiple, hydraulically generated or reactivated flow paths. Stress conditions and nature of the discontinuities are selected as variables and are used to simulate how fracturing can vary in different structural regimes. The basis of the simulations is commercial distinct element software (Itasca Corporation’s 3DEC).",

            "abstract": "During violent volcanic eruptions, a shock wave may be generated that is immediately followed by the formation of a supersonic jet. The overpressurized vapor-solid-liquid mixture being ejected begins to expand and accelerate. Oblique shock waves and rarefaction waves are generated at the edge of the crater. The oblique shock waves, inclined relatively to the flow axis, intersect forming a structure called a “Mach disk” or “Mach diamond”. This pattern repeats until the jet decelerates into subsonic flow. In an explosive volcanic eruption, unlike other applications involving jets, a mixture of hot gas and solid particles is present. The mixture typically contains a relatively high percentage of solid particles of different sizes. The relationship between jet and particle is one the major parameters affecting the formation of ash plume dynamics and the pyroclastic flows. Therefore, a more comprehensive study is needed in order to understand the mixing occurring within the volcanic eruption jet, specifically, the effect of particle size and concentration.\nIn this work, a series of analog explosive volcanic experiments using an atmospheric shock tube are performed to generate supersonic jets. High-speed video imaging of the expanding jet as well as the pressure evolution at different points in space are recorded for different values of initial energy and particle sizes and concentrations. Particles of different sizes and in various concentrations are placed inside the jet stream in which all the environmental conditions are monitored. Understanding of the coupling between the particles and the jet dynamics interaction is the first step toward a more thorough understanding of ash plume dynamics and the pyroclastic flows formation.",

            "abstract": "Due to its ability to both store information and catalyze reactions, RNA is considered by many to have been the dominant biopolymer at the origin of life. We are screening a large, random RNA population for catalytic activity in the presence and absence of prebiotically relevant clay minerals, to investigate the effect of RNA-clay mineral interactions on RNA function.\nThere is an extensive precedent for screening RNA populations for enzymatic functions such as ligation, cleavage and binding in the laboratory. While several environmental parameters have been explored, previous screens have not considered geological interactions. This is surprising as the role of clay minerals has featured prominently in many origin of life theories. Recent empirical evidence demonstrating that clay minerals can adsorb and protect RNA molecules as well as catalyze RNA polymerization has specifically reinvigorated the proposed importance of clay mineral-RNA interactions.\nAlthough the identity of the first true biomolecules remains uncertain, interaction between emerging life and its geological environment appears inevitable. We therefore consider understanding the effect of geological-biological interactions to be of crucial importance when considering the earliest biopolymers at the origin of life. Our screens are from a random population of 10^14 unique random RNA sequences and are conducted with and without montmorillonite clay. We are screening for the ability of sequences to self cleave, one of the most basic enzymatic functions considered important to the earliest biopolymers. Our RNA function screens will therefore illuminate the effect of geological interactions at a crucial stage of early evolution.",

            "abstract": "We demonstrate that objective prediction of fire season severity in Oregon is possible and promising. The causes of fire season severity are various but seasonal climate plays a dominant role in the Pacific Northwest. Seasonal climate prediction has been gaining momentum in recent decades, and skillful forecasting occurs when perturbed boundary conditions alter weather regimes regionally. Regimes most conducive to fire season severity in Oregon are anomalously warm, dry seasons with pronounced dry lightning activity. Here, we used Non-Parametric Multiplicative Regression, a forecasting algorithm well suited to automatically accommodating complex interactions, to identify meaningful interactions and predict fire season severity as a function of sea surface temperature anomalies and atmospheric modes. We find the severity of a fire season can be forecast several months ahead of time in March with a cross-validated R-squared of 0.53. A cross-validated R-squared is more conservative than an R-squared as it is a measure of model fit to previously unseen data. The model we developed predicts fire season severity as the result of a complex interaction between specific modes the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Pacific North American Pattern, and the Madden Julian Oscillation. Modes were derived using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). VMD is a new algorithm in signal processing that improves upon the limitations of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to decompose a signal into different modes of unknown but separate spectral bands. Prediction of fire season severity from atmosheric and boundary conditions can help budgetary planning and reduce the number of stand replacing fires and related economic losses.",

Our continued imaging campaign reveals temporal evolution of cloud and haze morphologies in the northern hemisphere, which is approaching northern summer solstice in May 2017. Our analysis shows that the disturbance left in the aftermath of the Great Storm of 2010-2011 continues to have an impact on the morphology of the storm-affected latitudes between 35-45 degree N latitudes. The region surrounded by the northern hexagon and the north-polar vortex exhibits changes in the upper tropospheric haze opacity and reflectivity. \nWe also present a new dynamical model of Saturn’s northern Hexagon. Observations show that the Hexagon is a near-stationary meandering atmospheric jetstream that acts as a transport barrier of materials; however, past experimental and numerical models of the Hexagon reproduced the six-sided morphology as a vortex street (VS). The VS model does not reproduce the near-stationary drift rate measured in System III reference frame, and a VS is also a poor transport barrier. Our new model demonstrates that a shallow atmospheric jet that is confined above the water condensation level exhibits many of these key characteristics better than the VS model.\nOur study is supported by the Cassini Project, NASA Outer Planet Research Program grant NNX12AR38G, and NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics grant 1212216.",

However, empirical lake surface sediment calibrations of the brGDGT-temperature relationship yield uncertainties of several degrees, which limits the application of this approach to orbital and millennial scale reconstructions. Little has been done to assess the relative importance of within-lake processes on the variability in brGDGT climate reconstructions and uncertainties in mean annual air temperature estimates. To address this, we examined brGDGT variations in the surface sediments and in a high-resolution varved sediment sequence from anoxic Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana. Lake surface sediment samples show significant variations in brGDGT distributions in shallow water, but yield temperature estimates that are generally consistent with measured lake water temperatures in sediments from throughout the deepest part of the lake. Down-core temperature reconstructions show multidecadal to centennial scale trends that are broadly consistent with a cooler Little Ice Age and recent warming. However, on shorter timescales reconstructed temperature variations are much larger than expected (1-2°C) based on instrumental air temperature data, complicating the interpretation of the brGDGT temperature data. We hypothesize that these variations are related to within-lake processes that affect brGDGT production such as the depth and timing of mixing events.",

The dyke intrusion was associated with the development of the ~1.1 Ga North American Mid-Continent Rift (MCR) system. Most rocks representing the early stage of MCR are characterized by steep reversed directions of the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM), whereas the rocks from the main stage of MCR generally yield shallower normal polarity ChRM directions. Rock magnetic experiments show that the principal magnetic carrier in the BM dykes is single-domain to pseudosingle-domain magnetite or low-Ti titanomagnetite with minor occurrences of hematite, maghemite, or pyrrhotite in some dykes. The majority of BM dykes yielded steep reversed-polarity directions of ChRM indicating that they belong to the early stage of MCR development. The corresponding paleomagnetic pole plots close to the apex of the so called “Logan Loop”, a segment of the Apparent Polar Wander Path (APWP) for the North American continent for ~1000-1200 Ma. Several BM dykes yielded steep normal-polarity ChRM directions, significantly different from the direction exhibited by the normally magnetized MCR sequences. This may indicate that these dykes are older than the reversed polarity dykes. In addition, a single mafic dyke from the Baraga basin with a recently published U/Pb age of 1120±4 Ma resulted in a shallow normal ChRM direction. The implications of our new paleomagnetic results for the North American APWP and the evolution of MCR will be discussed.",

At approximately 13 Ma, subduction along the northwestern coast of Mexico stopped, subsequently the Gulf of California opened and strike slip faults formed parallel to the ancient trench. After subduction ended, arc-related magmatism continued as the Baja peninsula was forming until about 2 Ma. The lavas erupting in the peninsula have variable compositions including calc-alkalic and tholeiitic arc basalts and bajaites. The term bajaite is a collective term for the high magnesian andesites and basaltic andesites in Baja California that have adakitic characteristics. Adakites, on the other hand, are arc lavas characterized by high silica content and Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios; these are generally believed to have formed through melting of subducted basaltic crust.\nThe origin of bajaite is controversial. It has been proposed as product of melting of either subducted basaltic crust primarily because of its adakitic characteristics (Saunders et al, 1987) or metasomatized mantle wedge because of its arc lava-like geochemical features (Castillo, 2008); it has also been proposed as a mixture of differentiated and mafic arc lavas (Streck et al, 2007). The composition of bajaite is similar to that of the bulk continental crust and, thus, its true origin can shed light on the mechanism for continental growth. In this study, we use geochemical techniques to resolve some of the controversies surrounding the origin of bajaite. We analyze the petrographic, major element, trace element, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions of bajaites from the San Borja Volcanic Field in Baja California Norte, Mexico to better constrain their petrogenetic history and origin.",

            "abstract": "The Atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O) has increased by 20% relative to pre-industrial level. It has attracted growing attention since N2O has long life time and radiative forcing 265 times higher than CO2 at 100-year time horizon. Global N2O emission from terrestrial ecosystem is among the most important contributors to the increase of atmospheric N2O. However, compared to CO2- and CH4-related research, less intensive studies have been performed in assessing the spatiotemporal patterns of terrestrial N2O emission and attributing its changes to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances across the globe. Here we integrated gridded time-series data of climate variability, atmospheric CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition, land use and land cover changes, and agricultural land management practices (i.e., synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use, manure application, and irrigation etc.) to a process-based land ecosystem model, DLEM, for answering the above questions.\nDuring 1900-2010, the inter-annual variation and long-term trend of terrestrial N2O emission driven by individual and combined environmental changes have been examined. Through this, we distinguished and quantified the relative contributions of changes in climate, atmospheric composition, and human activities to N2O emission growth at biome-, latitudinal, continental and global scales. The impacts of climate variability, and increasing nitrogen input, particularly nitrogen fertilizer use along with enhanced food production, have been paid special attention. Hot spots and hot time periods of global N2O emission are identified in this study. It provides clue for scientific community and policy makers to develop potential management strategies for mitigating atmospheric N2O increase and climate warming.",

            "abstract": "Kīlauea Volcano is a large emitter of volcanic CO2 with emission rates ranging from 7500-30,000 t/d. However, Kīlauea presents a challenging situation for CO2 emission rate measurement in that the main source of SO2 is the active vent in Halema’uma’u Crater, whereas CO2 emits mainly from a large (> 1km2) diffuse region east of the vent. Previous researchers recognized this issue and advocated for the use of a plume-integrated concentration ratio paired with the SO2 emission to determine CO2 emission rates; however, this worked best prior to the opening of the summit vent in 2008, or when SO2emission was still diffuse as opposed to focused degassing from the vent.\nWe used two techniques to study the spatial distribution and temporal variability of CO2 release from the summit caldera in July, 2014. Eddy covariance measurements made at 14 locations in the area of diffuse emission resulted in elevated fluxes that generally ranged from 500 to > 5000 g/m2d, or typical of other volcanic and hydrothermal areas worldwide. MultiGas measurements of the CO2 and SO2 concentration in air at 1-m above the ground identified approximately seven areas of elevated area of CO2 degassing in the caldera. The CO2 concentrations in air were spatially well correlated to approximately 100 m and displayed anisotropy that was consistent with the measured wind direction. Areas of highest CO2 concentration correlated with the areas of highest flux using the eddy covariance method and were found near the middle of the caldera approximately 1 km NE of the active vent. This area overlies the inferred location of the shallow summit reservoir, and is characterized by linear fractures with adhered sublimate deposits at the surface. A few of the fractures are visibly fuming, but much of the degassing in the area is not apparent. Future work includes monitoring the fluxes in this area over time, and attempting to quantify emission rates from the areas of measured flux.",

            "abstract": "Hurricanes and tsunamis are known to be highly erosive events, even though their characteristics differ greatly. A hurricane is a storm that typically impacts an area over a number of hours, has an associated storm surge, and generates wind waves with periods on the order of seconds. Tsunamis, however, impact an area over one or two hours and are long waves with periods on the order of tens of minutes. In this study, we use the numerical model XBeach to simulate typical hurricane and tsunami conditions, using an idealized bathymetric profile of a barrier island, to determine differences in the resulting morphology from each event type. For hurricane conditions, the offshore wave heights, periods and peak surge level range from 6m to 14m, 8s to 12s, and 1m to 3m, respectively, and the storm duration is 6 hours. Tsunami conditions are then determined using a 1:100 scale, such that the total energy of the hurricane equals 100 times the energy of the tsunami. By assuming a constant 20-minute wave period for the tsunami and a total duration of 1 hour, the tsunami wave heights are calculated using linear wave theory, resulting in wave heights ranging from 1m to 3.5m. The results show that tsunamis mobilize about 20% more sediment from the dune and deposit it at least 50% farther into the bay area, when compared to a hurricane with 100 times the energy. These results exemplify morphological characteristics of hurricanes and tsunamis and provide important insights into the differences between deposits from both events.",

            "abstract": "Recent increases in unconventional gas development have been accompanied by public concern for methane contamination in drinking water wells near production areas. Although not a regulated pollutant, methane may be a marker contaminant for others that are less mobile in groundwater and thus may be detected later, or at a location closer to the source. In addition, methane poses an explosion hazard if exsolved concentrations reach 5 – 15% volume in air. Methods for determining dissolved gases, such as methane, have evolved over 60 years. However, the response time of these methods is insufficient to monitor trends in methane concentration in real-time. To enable rapid, real-time monitoring of aqueous methane concentrations during ground water purging, a new gas-water equilibrator (GWE) was designed that increases gas-water mass exchange rates of methane for measurement. Monitoring of concentration trends allows a comparison of temporal trends between sampling events and comparison of baseline conditions with potential post-impact conditions. These trends may be a result of removal of stored casing water, pre-purge ambient borehole flow, formation physical and chemical heterogeneity, or flow outside of well casing due to inadequate seals. Real-time information in the field can help focus an investigation, aid in determining when to collect a sample, save money by limiting costs (e.g. analytical, sample transport and storage), and provide an immediate assessment of local methane concentrations. Four domestic water wells, one municipal water well, and one agricultural water well were sampled for traditional laboratory analysis and compared to the field GWE results. Aqueous concentrations measured on the GWE ranged from non-detect to 1,470 μg/L methane. Some trends in aqueous methane concentrations measured on the GWE were observed during purging. Applying a paired t-test comparing the new GWE method and traditional laboratory analysis yielded a p-value 0.383, suggesting no significant difference between the two methods for the current study. Additional field and laboratory experimentation are necessary to justify use beyond screening. However, early GWE use suggests promising results and applications.",

In order to place recent and projected changes in context, we are undertaking a collaborative field-modeling study that aims to reconstruct the Holocene history of ice-margin fluctuation near Thule (~76.5°N, 68.7°W), and also along the North Ice Cap (NIC) in the Nunatarssuaq region (~76.7°N, 67.4°W). Fieldwork reported by Kelly et al. (2013) reveals that ice in the study areas was less extensive than at present ca. 4700 (GIS) and ca. 880 (NIC) cal. years BP, presumably in response to a warmer climate. We are now exploring Holocene ice-climate coupling using the University of Maine Ice Sheet Model (UMISM). Our approach is to first test what imposed climate anomalies can afford steady state ice margins in accord with field data. A second test encompasses transient simulation of the Holocene, with climate boundary conditions supplied by existing paleo runs of the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4), and a climate forcing signal derived from Greenland ice cores. In both cases, the full ice sheet is simulated at 10 km resolution with nested domains at 0.5 km for the study areas. UMISM experiments are underway, and results will be reported at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "The boundary layer within the eyewall of intense tropical cyclones has been shown to be both highly turbulent and to contain coherent small-scale (of order 1 km) vortices. Dropsonde observations have indicated that extreme updrafts of 10-25 m/s can occur in the lowest 2 km, sometimes as low as a few hundred meters above the surface. These updrafts are often collocated with or found very nearby to local extrema in horizontal wind speed, which sometimes exceed 100 m/s.\nHere, the CM1 model is used to simulate intense tropical cyclones in an idealized framework, with horizontal grid spacing as fine as ~30 meters. At this grid spacing, the scales of the vortices are well resolved. By examining individual features and compositing over many updrafts, we find that there is a consistent structure and relationship between vorticity, vertical velocity, and near-surface windspeeds. We quantitatively show that buoyancy is not responsible for the acceleration of strong boundary layer updrafts. Instead, the updrafts are forced by dynamical pressure gradients associated with strong gradients in the velocity fields.\nIt is currently unknown whether dropsonde observations represent quasi-vertical profiles through the features, or if instead the sondes are horizontally advected through the features. Using simulated dropsonde trajectories, we show that sondes are likely to be horizontally advected through features, and therefore apparent vertical variability in observed kinematic and thermodynamic profiles may actually be primarily in the horizontal. In observations, extreme updrafts are almost exclusively found in Category 4 and 5 hurricanes. We conduct simulations at varying intensity to investigate whether or not similar features exist in weaker storms. Finally, we have developed an objective algorithm that allows us to track individual updrafts/vortices in time, and we use this to investigate the evolution and lifecycle of these features and to gain further insight into their dynamics.",

Flow observation gages for headwaters streams are less common than for larger rivers, and gages with records lengths of ten year or more are even more scarce. Thus, there is a great need for estimating streamflows in ungaged or sparsely-gaged headwaters. Further, there is often insufficient basin information to develop rainfall-runoff models that could be used to predict future flows under various climate scenarios.\nHeadwaters in the northeastern U.S. are of particular concern to aquatic biologists, as these stream serve as essential habitat for native coldwater fish. In order to understand fish response to past or future environmental drivers, estimates of seasonal streamflow are needed.\nWhile there is limited flow data, there is a wealth of data for historic weather conditions. Observed data has been modeled to interpolate a spatially continuous historic weather dataset. (Mauer et al 2002).\nWe present a statistical model developed by pairing streamflow observations with precipitation and temperature information for the same and preceding time-steps. We demonstrate this model's use to predict flow metrics at the seasonal time-step. While not a physical model, this statistical model represents the weather drivers. Since this model can predict flows not directly tied to reference gages, we can generate flow estimates for historic as well as potential future conditions.",

            "abstract": "The recent inclusion of an urban land model within a large-scale global climate model has allowed for a more realistic representation of the Earth’s surface, aiding in a better understanding of land cover and climate relationships. This research uses the NCAR Community Climate System Model version 4.0 (CCSM4.0) with the land component, the Community Land Model version 4.0 (CLM4.0), coupled with the atmospheric component, the Community Atmosphere Model version 4.0 (CAM4). Although the urban land type is a sub-grid phenomena that rarely occupies more than half of a grid cell at the 1° by 1° scale, significant changes in basic climate variables are present in some regions. These changes are primarily seen where a denser network of grid cells exist with an urban presence. Seasonality to the urban influence also exists with the transition months of Spring and Fall having the largest difference in temperatures.\nAdditional relationships beyond the present day urban land cover and climate are investigated. By setting all urban land cover to only one urban density type, the importance of city composition on climate, even within the same city, is highlighted. While preserving the distinct urban regional characteristics and the geographical distribution of urbanized areas, the model is run with homogeneous urban types: high density and tall building district. Although it is unrealistic to assume any of these regions will ever be completely covered with either high density or tall building district density types, it is reasonable to say that the ratio of high density and tall building district areas may increase as population continues to increase.\nAs with the default urban and excluded urban runs, there is strong seasonality to the differences between the all high density, the all tall building district, and default urban simulations. Overall, the transition and winter months are most sensitive to changes in urban density type. The dramatic increases in waste heat, impervious surface fraction, and height to width ratio in the tall building district simulation resulted in significantly increased temperatures. A large significant increase in surface albedo with the tall building district density type also exists although the warming influence of these other variables outweighs the extra reflection from the surface.",

            "abstract": "Explosive interaction of magma and water leads to vaporization and introduces external water vapor to volcanic plumes. Theoretical considerations on the effect of external water magma ratio on volcanic plumes indicate that plume buoyancy should be enhanced by external water fractions up to at least 30%, while fractions reaching 40% should lead to plume collapse. The basaltic VEI 4 eruption of Grímsvötn in May 2011 produced a 15-20 km high eruption plume and over 100 km wide umbrella cloud. External water interacted with the magma and entered the plume from the melting out of a 100-150 m deep ice cauldron that had acquired a volume of 0.1 km3 at the end of the eruption. About 0.7 km3 of tephra was produced in the eruption whereof about half was erupted in phreatomagmatic phases and the other half in magmatic phases. During the dry, magmatic phases melting was apparently not fast enough to supply sufficient external water to the vents to control the style of activity. The only source of external water was the melting out of the ice cauldron since no changes took place in the level of the larger, subglacial lake in the center of the Grímsvötn caldera, and no meltwater was drained from the caldera. The eruption site therefore had little or no hydrological connection with the adjacent subglacial lake. Water remaining at the eruption site at the end of the eruption was miniscule compared to the amount of ice melted. Hence, most of the meltwater was vaporized and carried away as a part of the eruption plume. About one third of the thermal energy of the magma erupted was used to melt, heat up and vaporize water. A large part of this water was released from the plume through condensation and re-freezing, manifested in hail-rich tephra deposited out to several kilometers from the vent. The data indicate that the external water/tephra mass ratio in the phreatomagmatic phases was 20-25%, but similar to 5% for the predominantly magmatic phases.",

            "abstract": "There is considerable empirical evidence that the specific energy ε determined from shallow scratch tests on sedimentary rocks is about equal to the uniaxial compressive strength q, see Figure showing the correlation between ε and q for 334 rocks (Richard et al, J Engineering Geology, 2012). The specific energy ε, defined as the energy expended per unit volume of fragmented rock, corresponds to the ratio of the average cutting force over the cross-sectional area of the groove created by the motion of the cutter; it is virtually independent of the depth of cut provided that the cutter is sufficiently sharp so that frictional dissipation beneath the cutter is negligible and also provided that the depth of cut is below a critical value dc that is proportional to the intrinsic length scale (KIc/q)2 with KIc denoting the rock toughness. Indeed, the critical depth of cut dc separates two regimes of cutting, ductile and brittle. In the ductile regime (depth of cut d smaller than dc but larger than the grain size), the rock is intensively sheared ahead of the cutter and the specific energy is constant. On the other hand, in the brittle regime (d larger than dc) chipping takes place and the specific energy decreases as the inverse square root of d. In sedimentary rocks, dcis typically less than 1 mm.\nThe apparent correlation between the specific energy ε in the ductile regime and the uniaxial compressive strength q can be explained from an analysis of results of plane strain compression tests conducted in an apparatus that does not inhibit the development of shear bands (Labuz and Dai, J. of Geotechnical and Reoenvironmental Eng., 2000). This analysis indicates that the residual strength is reached on the shear band for slip distance of about 1~2 grain size and that the thickness of the shear band is also equal to about 2 grain size. Furthermore, the ratio of the energy required to destroy the cohesive links between the grains inside the shear band over the volume of the shear band can be shown to be indeed comparable to q. The specific energies pertaining to the compression test and the scratch test are thus comparable, not only because there is complete de-cohesion of the constitutive matrix in both cases, but also because the strains are of order 1 in both tests.",

            "abstract": "The ocean circulation in the western South Atlantic is characterized by the presence of the subtropical gyre, the largest dynamical feature in the region. The Brazil Current, located in the western limb of this gyre, is a weak western boundary current, resulting from the bifurcation of the southern branch of the South Equatorial Current at around 15°S. The spatial and temporal variability of this current is critical to assess the transport of subtropical waters into subpolar regions and of its link to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Here we use data from hydrographic (XBT transects, surface drifters, and Argo floats) and satellite altimetry observations to investigate the interannual variability of the upper circulation in the western South Atlantic, in particular the subtropical gyre and the Brazil Current, since 1992. The main data sets used here correspond to data from three XBT transects: AX18 (along 34°S), AX97 (along 22°S, between Rio de Janeiro and Trinidade Island), and AX08 (across the subtropical gyre), as well as wind stress data and from satellite altimetry observations. Results obtained are compared against numerical model outputs. Wavelet analysis and complex empirical orthogonal functions are used on the altimetry data to provide the characteristics of propagating features for each frequency band. The main bands are represent eddy-scale, Rossby wave and gyre characteristics. Interannual variability of mesoscale activity in the western part of the basin is analyzed using data, model reanalysis and reduced gravity modeling, and associated to the basin-scale patterns. Results show that the Brazil Current has a mean volume transport of ~4 Sv at 22°S and increase to ~ 12 Sv at 34°S, which is consistent with the additional southward flow at intermediate level between the two sections. Basin wide wind stress anomalies produce anomalous Sverdrup circulation, with a delayed response (up to a few years) in the western boundary due to the propagation time of baroclinic Rossby waves. A five year oscillation is apparent in the eddy energy of the Brazil Current region, and also in the mixed layer depth across the basin, suggesting a coherent variability between the two regions.",

            "abstract": "In a pre-industrial control simulation of CESM changes of Greenland temperature show an asymmetric pattern that is a slow decrease at centennial timescales and an abrupt increase at decadal timescales, resembling the pattern of Dansgaard-Oeschger-cycles. A strong influence of equatorial Pacific SST anomalies on the pressure state above the North Atlantic and hence the wind forcing of the Labrador Sea gyre is found. The cooling is triggered by a stochastic anomalous pressure pattern over the North Atlantic that weakens the wind forcing of the Labrador gyre, slowing down and advecting less warm and saline subtropical waters to high latitudes. Then sea ice growth commences in the Labrador Sea due to locally reduced warm water transport. The sea ice anomaly above the Labrador Sea enhances the anomalous atmospheric circulation and eventually causes a cold core anticyclonic high pressure anomaly to persist during the entire 300 years that the cold North Atlantic phase lasts. Furthermore the decreased salinity transport towards the Labrador Sea induces a positive feedback that weakens the gyre circulation further and causes a reduced deep water convection. This leads to a reduced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation of about 4 Sverdrup, and eventually a reduced northward heat transport. After a 30 year period of prevailing cold SST anomalies in the east Pacific the disturbed atmospheric circulation above the North Atlantic slowly disappears, the Labrador Sea gyre circulation and deep water convection resume, melting the additional sea ice away and eventually causing an abrupt increase of Greenland temperatures. First ocean-sea ice only simulations forced with the anomalous atmospheric fluxes extracted from the original simulation reproduce the climate transition and the changed ocean circulation , even if starting from background ocean conditions that differ from the original ones.",

            "abstract": "We conducted a satellite-based survey of Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) sediment processes using all images of Greenland in the Landsat7 archive (1999 – 2013). Imaging over 150 proglacial rivers near their ice sheet source to calculate median suspended sediment concentration (SSC) for the Landsat7 era, we find ice sheet evacuation of suspended sediment via rivers is highly spatially variable, with a small percentage of ice sheet termini evacuating sediment at elevated SSCs. Most (67 %) of termini had a median SSC value less than 1000 mg/l, while only 8% had values greater than 2000 mg/l, yet these termini with SSC in excess of 2000 mg/l export ~90 % of suspended sediment from the ice sheet. Combining surface ice velocity data and ice thickness data we find that ice discharge at ice sheet termini largely drives this spatial variability in SSC.\nThough 1% of the Earth’s land surface area, using modeled ice sheet runoff we estimate that the GrIS exports 6 to 11 % of the total sediment export to the global ocean if all sediment is assumed to reach the ocean. Finally, we find river mouth SSC high enough to cause hyperpycnal flow to occur. Hence, sediment can at times be efficiently mobilized from ice sheet directly to fjord bottom/continental shelf.",

However, US agricultural ecosystems have experienced frequent and intensive droughts over past decades including extreme droughts in recent two years, which led to large reductions in crop productivity and have been posing unprecedented challenges to US agricultural land. Therefore, there is an increasing concern about how future drought condition would be and how agricultural ecosystems would respond to future droughts. Here, we use the process-based ecosystem model DLEM-Ag (the agricultural module of the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model) driven by future climate change scenarios, new-released RCPs data from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, to examine the impacts of future climate change/extremes on crop productivity and yield in the US during 2015-2099. The preliminary results show that more pervasive global-change-type droughts over the 21st century would be projected to occur in large areas of cropland in the Mississippi River basin and the southeastern US, which would significantly cause adverse impacts on crop productivity, particularly under high emission scenario RCP8.5. Our study implies that the restrictions on anthropogenic greenhouse gases emissions would benefit crop productivity in US.",

            "abstract": "An underappreciated source of uncertainty in paleoecology is the uncertainty of palynological identifications. The confidence of any given identification is not regularly reported in published results, so cannot be incorporated into subsequent meta-analyses. Automated identifications systems potentially provide a means of objectively measuring the confidence of a given count or single identification, as well as a mechanism for increasing sample sizes and throughput.\nWe developed the software ARLO (Automated Recognition with Layered Optimization) to tackle difficult visual classification problems such as pollen identification. ARLO applies pattern recognition and machine learning to the analysis of pollen images. The features that the system discovers are not the traditional features of pollen morphology. Instead, general purpose image features, such as pixel lines and grids of different dimensions, size, spacing, and resolution, are used. ARLO adapts to a given problem by searching for the most effective combination of feature representation and learning strategy. We present a two phase approach which uses our machine learning process to first segment pollen grains from the background and then classify pollen pixels and report species ratios. We conducted two separate experiments that utilized two distinct sets of algorithms and optimization procedures. The first analysis focused on reconstructing black and white spruce pollen ratios, training and testing our classification model at the slide level. This allowed us to directly compare our automated counts and expert counts to slides of known spruce ratios. Our second analysis focused on maximizing classification accuracy at the individual pollen grain level. Instead of predicting ratios of given slides, we predicted the species represented in a given image window. The resulting analysis was more scalable, as we were able to adapt the most efficient parts of the methodology from our first analysis.\nARLO was able to distinguish between the pollen of black and white spruce with an accuracy of ~83.61%. This compared favorably to human expert performance. At the writing of this abstract, we are also experimenting with experimenting with the analysis of higher diversity samples, including modern tropical pollen material collected from ground pollen traps.",

COWVR is an 18-34 GHz fully polarimetric radiometer designed to provide measurements of ocean vector winds with an accuracy that meets or exceeds that provided by WindSat, but using a simpler design which has both calibration and cost advantages.\nHeritage conical radiometer systems, such as WindSat, AMSR, GMI or SSMI(S), all have a similar overall architecture and have exhibited significant intra-channel and inter-sensor calibration biases, due in part to the relative independence of the radiometers between the different polarizations and frequencies in the system. The COWVR system uses a broadband compact hybrid combining architecture and Electronic Polarization Basis Rotation to minimize the number of free calibration parameters between polarization and frequencies, as well as providing a definitive calibration reference from the modulation of the mean polarized signal from the Earth. This second calibration advantage arises because the sensor modulates the incoming polarized signal at the input antenna aperture in a known way based only on the instrument geometry which forces relative calibration consistency between the polarimetric channels of the sensor and provides a gain and offset calibration independent of a model or other ancillary data source, which has typically been a weakness in the calibration and inter-calibration of heritage microwave sensors.\nThis paper will give a description of the COWVR instrument and an overview of the technology demonstration mission. We will discuss the overall calibration approach for this system, its advantages over existing systems and how many of the calibration issues that impact existing satellite radiometers can be eliminated in future operational systems based on this design. COWVR is currently in flight fabrication at JPL, having successfully passed its Critical Design Review in June 2014, and will be flight ready in September 2015 with launch no earlier than 2016.",

In mixed-phase, deep convective clouds, these CCN and IN can alter physical processes related to droplet activation and heterogeneous freezing, affecting the dynamics, microphysics, and ultimately evolution of the cloud. However, modifying the CCN and IN budget entrained into a cloud eventually leads to many simultaneous, competing microphysical processes which make it difficult to precisely predict how cloud properties will change.\nHere, we study the sensitivity of a continental convective system observed during the Mid-latitude Airborne Cirrus Properties Experiment (MACPEX) in 2011 to changes in CCN and IN burden with the help of 2D and 3D cloud-resolving model simulations. We explore how the potential for convective invigoration is sensitive to the treatment of droplet activation at the cloud base by adopting an emulator of an adiabatic parcel model to parameterize the activation calculation. Furthermore, we study how changes in the IN budget can enhance the role of heterogeneous freezing and diminish the efficacy of homogeneous freezing above the -40C isotherm within the cloud. Since anvil ice is typically produced homogeneously, we also study how this shift in freezing mechanisms affects the size distributions and properties of the system's anvil cirrus. The in situ observations of anvil ice obtained during MACPEX and the ice nuclei residuals are used as a reference to constrain the simulations.",

Therefore, it is important to quantify the snow redistribution by wind and gravity after touching down to the ground surface. The snow movement equations were formulated in terms of snow transport, wind snow diffusion, and snow gravitational movement effects, for horizontal two-dimensional watershed scale applications in this study. It was shown that the snow surface diffusion coefficient by wind can be evaluated from an autocorrelation function of the measurable wind velocity field using G.I. Taylor’s theorem. In this presentation, the numerical algorithm for the generalized snow movement equation will be discussed in detail, as it requires a mechanism to limit the over-erosion of the immobilized snow and the ground after mobile snow disappearance. This numerical algorithm was named SMOOTH model that can explicitly describe the dynamic snow transportation from peaks and ridges to dips, valleys, and places behind objects. Two dominating components of wind-snow process, advection and diffusion, will be discussed using the SMOOTH model outputs for several sites in Wyoming.",

In the troposphere, OCS is irreversibly consumed during photosynthesis and may serve as a tracer for gross primary production (GPP). Its primary sources are ocean outgassing, industrial processes, and biomass burning. Its primary sinks are vegetation and soils. Despite the importance of OCS in atmospheric processes, the OCS atmospheric budget is poorly determined and has high uncertainty.\nOCS is typically monitored using either canisters analyzed by gas chromatography or integrated atmospheric column measurements. Improved in-situ terrestrial flux and airborne measurements are required to constrain the OCS budget and further elucidate its role in stratospheric aerosol formation and as a tracer for biogenic volatile organics and photosynthesis.\nLos Gatos Research has developed a flight capable mid-infrared Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (OA-ICOS) analyzer to simultaneously quantify OCS, CO2, CO, and H2O in ambient air at up to 2 Hz. The prototype was tested on diluted, certified samples and found to be precise (OCS, CO2, CO, and H2O to better than ±4 ppt, ±0.2 ppm, ±0.31 ppb, and ±3.7 ppm respectively, 1s in 1 sec) and linear (R2 > 0.9997 for all gases) over a wide dynamic range (OCS, CO2, CO, and H2O ranging from 0.2 – 70 ppb, 500 – 3000 ppm, 150 – 480 ppb, and 7000 – 21000 ppm respectively). Cross-interference measurements showed no appreciable change in measured OCS concentration with variations in CO2 (500 – 3500 ppm) or CO.\nWe report on high altitude measurements made aboard NASA’s WB-57 research aircraft. Two research flights were conducted from Houston, TX. The concentration of OCS, CO2, CO, and H2O were continuously recorded from sea level to approximately 60,000 feet. The concentration of OCS was observed to increase with altitude through the troposphere due to the consumption in photosynthesis at ground level and was well correlated with CO2.\nThese results demonstrate that the OA-ICOS instrument is capable of high altitude airborne operation that will advance our understanding of OCS’s role in Earth’s atmosphere by providing precise and accurate measurements throughout the troposphere and into the stratosphere.",

Ensemble regression has been recently utilized in modeling various hydrologic systems and showed advantage over classical regression approaches to such studies. A challenging task in ensemble modeling is the proper training of the ensemble’s individual learners and the ensemble combiners. In this work, an ensemble framework is proposed to enhance the generalization ability of the sub-ensemble models and its combiner. Information mixtures between the subsamples are introduced. Such measure is dedicated to the ensemble members and ensemble combiners. Controlled homogeneity magnitudes are then stimulated and induced in the proposed model via a two-stage resampling algorithm. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used as ensemble members in addition to different ensemble integration plans. The model provided superior results when compared to previous models applied to the case study in this work. The root mean squared error (RMSE) in the testing phase for the drought quantiles improved by 67% - 76%. The bias error (BIAS) also showed 61% - 95% improvement.",

For this purpose, we developed a high-resolution watershed-scale ecohydrologic model (MicroBasin) that simulates the interactions between crops, soil and atmosphere systems over the vertical and horizontal space domain. This sub-model for crop growth and soil biogeochemical processes is derived from the well-developed CropSyst model, which simulates crop yields and soil organic matter processes under given environmental conditions (water, nitrogen, and heat, etc.) and management (tillage, fertilization, irrigation, rotation, and harvest). For vertical movement of water and nutrients along the soil profile, both hourly cascade and finite difference infiltration methods were implemented. For horizontal flows, MicroBasin simulates the overland flows and within-soil lateral flows according to the roughness of land surface, watershed topology, and soil properties. We considered a closed energy budget incorporating frozen soil and snowpack processes with detailed characterization of specific parameters, with the freeze-thaw process simulated in each soil layer. Exhaustive observations from two small watersheds of the Inland Pacific Northwest of the United States were used for evaluating this model. Over the watershed with non-tillage (1.1 ha), the estimated evapotranspiration had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.94 mm, whereas the simulated net exchange ecosystem had a RMSE of 2.31 gC/m2 over two observation years. Over the watershed with conventional tillage (1.9 ha), the modeled hourly and daily water fluxes (such as runoff) and soil moisture showed a consistency with observations (RMSE= 54 m3/yr, R2=0.46).",

            "abstract": "While spatiotemporal characteristics of soil moisture content have been frequently studied, that of soil matric potential (ψ) remains sparse. The objects of this study was to investigate the spatial variability and temporal stability of ψ at multiple depths and their relationships with soil moisture content (θ) across a forested catchment under the influence of soil type, terrain, and season. In addition, we also attempted to identify representative locations across the catchment where overall-averaged values of ψ may be found. We analyzed a 5.5-yr database consisting of 62 sites from the surface down to 1.0 m depth that were distributed throughout the 7.9-ha Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory. The results clearly showed a downward parabolic trend in spatial variability of ψ with decreasing spatial mean value of ψ across all depths. The catchment’s overall spatial variability of ψ generally increased with soil depth and was relatively high during summer and fall due to varying responses of sites within different landforms and soil types to wetting and drying. Percent of sand and silt were significant factors (p<0.05) influencing ψ at surface soil layers; while ψ at subsurface layers (40 to 100 cm) were highly correlated with elevation, suggesting convergent topography and subsurface lateral flow as important drivers of soil water dynamics in this catchment. Temporal stability of the spatial pattern in ψ was generally higher in surface soil layers than that in the subsurface due to more frequent preferential flow and more heterogeneous tree root water demand in the subsurface. In addition, the temporal stability of ψ spatial pattern was also weaker in the spring as compared to other seasons, and wet areas tended to have less evident temporal stability at each depth, all due to more pronounced preferential flow occurrence under wet conditions. Finally, at least one of the representative sites of the catchment-averaged ψ at each depth was found within a south-facing concave hillslope at the middle elevation. The results from this study have implications for upscaling soil water from point-based observations to the hillslope and catchment scales.",

Using three daily global climate datasets and three fire danger indices, we mapped spatio-temporal trends in wildfire weather season lengths from 1979 to 2013. We found extensive fire weather season lengthening focused within 27.7M km2 (23.7%) of the Earth’s vegetated land surface, resulting in a 16.3% increase in global mean fire weather season length. We also observed a near doubling (90.3%) of global burnable area affected by anomalously long fire weather seasons (>1.0 σ above historical mean) and an increased frequency of long fire weather seasons across 62.3M km2 (53.3%) of the globe’s vegetated areas during the second half of the study period. Strikingly, inter-annual fire weather season length variations were significantly correlated with annual global atmospheric CO2 growth rates (r= 0.42 and r = 0.41, respectively, p < 0.05), consistent with a fire-climate feedback loop.",

            "abstract": "Thiols are the dominant form of sulfur in terrestrial organisms where they are present in the amino acids cysteine and methionine as well as various co-enzymes. Despite their biogeochemical importance, thiols are not typically evaluated as biosignatures of past life because their high reactivity prevents analysis by GC-MS and suggests they would likely not be preserved over geological timescales. Employing microchip capillary electrophoresis coupled to fluorescence detection we observed thiols in samples from a ~200 million year old methane seep in the south of England. In order to identify the thiol in the sample we have developed a new GC-MS method that involves derivatization of thiols with a trialkysilyl reagent (MSTFA). We are currently optimizing the method to improve the yield of derivatization and to maximize chromatographic separation.\nThe abundance of sulfur on Mars has been confirmed by numerous data from both in situ and remote sensing instruments. Most recently, NASA's Curiosity Mars rover detected calcium sulfates and iron sulfides among the sedimentary rocks at Yellowknife Bay. In anticipation of a Mars sample return mission, we have begun collection and evaluation of Mars-analog sedimentary facies for the presence of thiols. Discovery of thiols in martian rocks would provide strong evidence for a biologically-mediated sulfur cycle on Mars.\n ",

This research makes use of dropsonde and sounding observations, which were collected during both the Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP) and the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud Systems in the Tropics (PREDICT) field campaigns. E4DVar uses a mix of climatological and flow-dependent background error covariance obtained from ensemble forecasts together with the tangent linear model and its adjoint to perform the four-dimensional data assimilation. As a result, E4DVar analyses are able to capture multi-scale features of the developing disturbances accurately, such as the evolving thermodynamic and kinematic structure of pre-genesis Karl and Mathew. Preliminary diagnostics shows that the genesis of both storms followed a bottom-up process with several mesoscale convective vorticies (MCVs) observed in the pre-genesis stages. To determine the role of these MCVs and to better understand the initial development of the surface cyclone, a two-dimensional spectral decomposition and filtering of model variables, together with a vorticity budget, are performed on high-resolution (1.5 km) simulations of both systems.",

            "abstract": "Geologic structures play a crucial role in focusing geothermal fluid circulation in the upper crust. In a variety of geothermal provinces worldwide, studies have shown that young or active faults, and especially locations where faults intersect and interact, generate the accentuated fracture permeability required for geothermal circulation. Fault intersection and interaction areas are characterized by concentrated stresses, which leads to the generation of secondary faults and fractures and heightened permeability. In the Great Basin, USA, fault terminations, fault step-overs (or relay ramps) and accommodation zones are among the most common structural settings for geothermal circulation. Fault scaling relationships provide a first-order indication of the ideal extent and geometry of these features as well as the location(s) and extent of concentrated stresses (and therefore a high potential for permeability generation) within these structures. The most favorable locations for fracture permeability, those with optimal stress concentrations, are on the order of ~1-2 km wide for typical 10-20 km fault lengths in the Great Basin. Examination of known, production geothermal systems within each of these structural settings indicates that although thermal anomalies are commonly 5-10 km wide, the production reservoir and corresponding well fields are confined to smaller areas. We suggest that the limited aerial extent of these production zones is controlled by the extent of concentrated stresses and the most accentuated fracture permeability associated the specific fault intersection or interaction areas. Though is it well established that specific structural geometries like fault terminations, step-overs and accommodation zones are promising ‘plays’ for geothermal exploration, our analysis further constrains the scale and extent of the most favorable occurrences of these structures, as well as the most prospective permeability zones within them.",

We leveraged information from the full 1985–2014 time series to optimize compositing year ranges to prevent bias due to directional changes (e.g., shrubification), and “step-changes” (e.g., tundra fire, lake drainage, ice-wedge degradation) in vegetation and landscape characteristics over the Landsat era.

The halo electrons are omni-directional, and strahls are magnetic field aligned beams of electrons that predominantly move in the anti-sunward direction. Properties of strahls represent a great interest, because this population is most energetic, but its origination is still unclear. Usually, it is supposed that strahls is a focused part of halo electrons, non-scattered during their propagation from the Sun.\nWe demonstrate a possibility to better understand nature of strahls if to suggest their acceleration directly in the solar wind due to a magnetic reconnection, occurring at current sheets. We use results of our PIC-simulation of particles behaviour at reconnecting current sheets (Zharkova, Khabarova, ApJ, 2012) in order to explain such effects as:\n- mismatches between a position of suprathermal electrons pitch-angle changes and real crossing of the heliospheric current sheet,\n- correlation between heat flux/solar energetic particles dropouts and high plasma beta,\n- occurrence of counterstreaming electrons at the ICME front and at corotating shocks at r > 2 AU,\n- radial evolution of strahls/halo density.\nMulti-spacecraft observations (STEREO, ACE, Ulysses) of properties of suprathermal electrons attributed to crossings of the heliospheric current sheet as well as smaller-scale current sheets during SEP events and CME-CIR interactions will be discussed.",

Although various contributing factors have been examined, including changes in the atmospheric circulation, increase in meridional span of jet stream fluctuation, and anomalous snow and sea ice forcing, it still remains unclear how internally or externally altered large-scale atmospheric dynamics has driven daily-based extreme cold events. In this study, we further investigated variability of and changes in extratropical storm tracks and anticyclones and their resultant dynamic and thermodynamic role in causing extreme cold weathers over Eurasia. The major approach employed is a modiﬁed automated cyclone and anticyclone identiﬁcation and tracking algorithm. Our results reinforced our previous finding that storms have weakened and anticyclones have intensified over Eurasia during 1978/79–2011/2012 winter seasons. Corresponding to these long-term changes, anomalous high pressure occurred over the Ural area, providing fundamental dynamic setting favoring occurrence of blocking events. As a consequence, polar cold air was advected southward to the midlatitude, causing extreme cold events. Along with this dynamic process, snow cover also extended southward to reduce surface absorption of downwelling shortwave radiation and further the cooling process. Barents-Kara sea ice forcing was examined to identify underlying physical mechanisms for changes in storm tracks and anticyclone activities.",

SNAC is a deep earth process model (a geodynamic/tectonics model), built upon a scientific software framework called StGermain and also compatible with a model coupling framework called Pyre. CHILD is a popular surface process model (a landscape evolution model), interfaced to the CSDMS (Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System) modeling framework. We first present proof-of-concept but non-trivial results from a simplistic coupling scheme. We then report progress towards augmenting SNAC with a Basic Model Interface (BMI), a framework-agnostic standard interface developed by CSDMS that uses the CSDMS Standard Names as controlled vocabulary for model communication across domains. Newly interfaced to BMI, SNAC will be easily coupled with CHILD as well as other BMI-compatible models. In broader context, this work will test BMI as a general and easy-to-implement mechanism for sharing models between modeling frameworks and is a part of the NSF-funded EarthCube Building Blocks project, \"Earth System Bridge: Spanning Scientific Communities with Interoperable Modeling Frameworks.”",

            "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) contamination is considered one of the greatest threats to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and the San Francisco Estuary ecosystems. This threat is driven by the transformation of Hg, deposited in the Delta from erosion of upstream historic mining debris and atmospheric deposition, by native bacteria into the more toxic and biologically available form, methylmercury (MeHg), in the wetlands and sediment of the Delta. To effectively manage this threat, a quantitative understanding of the relative contribution of the different Hg sources to MeHg formation is needed. Mass balance estimates indicate as much as 99% of the Hg entering the Delta arrives via tributary inputs. Of the tributary Hg load, approximately 90% is adsorbed to suspended particles from tributary discharge and 10% is in the dissolved fraction, potentially of atmospheric origin. In comparison, the remaining 1-2% of the Hg entering the Delta arrives through direct atmospheric deposition (wet and dry). The relative importance of these sources to MeHg production within the Delta is not linearly related to the mass inputs because atmospherically-derived Hg is believed to be more reactive than sediment-bound Hg with respect to MeHg formation. We conducted an in situ mesocosm dosing experiment where different Hg sources to the Delta (direct atmospheric, dissolved riverine and suspended sediment) were “labeled” with different stable Hg isotopes and added to mesocosms within four different wetlands. Mercury isotopes added with the streambed sediments were equilibrated in sealed containers for six months; while the Hg isotopes associated with the precipitation and river water were equilibrated for 24 hours prior to use. After adding the isotopes, we sampled the water column, overlying air, bottom sediments and fish (Gambusia) at time intervals up to 30 days. Preliminary results from this experiment suggest that aqueous Hg sources (Hg introduced with precipitation and filtered river water) are 10-1,000x more available to methylating microbes and fish uptake than particle bound Hg. Consequently, although atmospheric Hg deposition may contribute a relatively small portion of the total Hg loading to the Delta, it may contribute to a substantial portion of the MeHg produced within the Delta.",

            "abstract": "Calibrated watershed models are widely used as tools for estimating the outcomes of management scenarios. Multiple models are often recommended for well-informed decision making to gain an estimate of uncertainty, to allow for multiple representations of the physical-chemical-biological system, and to provide confidence in the model predictions. Implementing and maintaining multiple watershed models, particularly of a large-scale watershed, poses significant financial and logistical challenges associated with model calibrations, computation requirements, and differences in data formats. Moreover, analysis of results from multiple models adds additional complexity in decision-making. We propose and demonstrate a framework to simulate management scenarios using a ‘sensitivity’ approach that incorporates the findings of multiple models into a single simulation framework. This simple and easily-understood modeling framework provides the ability to explicitly incorporate the best available science-based understanding of watershed responses to changes in nutrient balances. Generalized watershed nutrient response are derived from the synthesis of multiple lines of evidence, which include studies involving multiple physically-based models of watersheds at catchment to regional scales, along with experimental studies and watershed observatories. The framework provides simplified accounting for planning, implementation, and tracking of management scenarios while providing capabilities to incorporate complex watershed phenomenon such as lag-times in nutrient response. The framework is being developed by the Chesapeake Bay Partnership for an assessment of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) in 2017 and to develop management plans to meet water quality standards in the Bay waters.",

            "abstract": "Lateral sediment transport is a key momentum-exchange mechanism to model equilibrium channel geometry and channel bar evolution. We study sediment transport from a statistical mechanical point of view akin to Furbish et al. 2012. This approach holds promise for linking grain-scale motion to macroscopic transport, but there are few data to definitively develop and test such models. We study an experimental model river, composed of monodisperse acrylic spheres dispersed in silicon oil, driven by a layer of fluid under steady shear. We choose to drive fluid flow in the laminar regime (Re < 1) to suppress fluid turbulence and isolate granular and bed structure controls. We use a refractive-index-matched laser scanning technique to observe the motion of particles at the surface of the bed as well as the particle dynamics below the surface. We study how the probability distribution of displacements varies as a function of distance from the bed surface and as a function of distance to the channel center. In the streamwise direction, in agreement with Furbish et al. 2012, we find that the dynamics can be decomposed into an advection and a diffusion term. In the lateral direction, we find a competition between diffusion and an elastic-like interaction with the bed. We study this lateral stochastic process and find a need to introduce two parameters to quantify this competition. The first parameter describes the tendency for particles to reside near the center of the channel and the second parameter describes the kinetic energy distribution of the particles. We study how the requisite averaging scales and ensemble sizes to achieve statistically convergent parameters, and we explore how these parameters depend on the driving rate.",

These subtleties are investigated here with respect to canopy height comparisons with 3 airborne LiDAR sites in Australia. Optimal GLAS results were obtained from high energy laser transmissions from laser 3 during leaf-on conditions; GLAS data best corresponded with 95th percentile heights from an all return airborne LiDAR point cloud. In addition, best GLAS results were obtained over relatively open canopies, where prominent ground returns can be retrieved.\nOptimized GLAS data within Australian forests were employed as canopy height observations, and related to 6 predictor variables (landcover, cover fraction, elevation, slope, soils, and species) by random forest (RF) models. Fifty seven RF models were trained, varying by binomial combinations of predictor data, from 2 to 6 inputs. Trained models were separately utilized to predict Australia wide canopy heights; RF canopy height outputs were validated against spatially concurrent airborne LiDAR 95th percentile canopy heights from an all return point cloud for 10 sites, encompassing multiple ecosystems.\nThe best RF output was obtained from predictor data inputs: landcover, cover fraction, elevation soils, and species, yielding a RMSE=7.98 m, and R2=0.97. Results indicate inherent issues (noted in existing literature) in GLAS observations that propagate through RF algorithms, manifested as canopy height underestimations for taller vegetation (>45 m).\nTo extend this research to the Canadian boreal forest context, research is also targeting canopy height model development in the Northwest Territories, allowing investigations of time-variant phenology and landcover sensitivity due to wetland extent and growth, snow cover and other land cover changes common within boreal forest ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "An essential procedure to increase the analytical efficiency of Δ47 measurements requires raising the temperature of phosphoric acid digestion for carbonate materials. This temperature change introduces a fractionation offset in Δ47 that must be accounted for prior to calculation of temperatures of carbonate formation and to allow interlaboratory comparison of results. We measured the phosphoric acid fractionation factor relative to reaction at 25 °C for calcite, aragonite, and dolomite across a temperature range from 25-90 °C. Significantly, all three minerals behave similarly during phosphoric acid digestion, allowing for a single temperature dependent acid fractionation relationship:\n1000ln∝𝐶𝑂2(𝐴𝑐𝑖𝑑)−𝛥47=(0.022434±0.001490)∗10^6 𝑇2 −(0.2524±0.0168)\nwhere α is the phosphoric acid fractionation factor, and T is in degrees Kelvin. Mineralogical or isotopic compositional effects on the fractionation factor were not observed, suggesting that this acid fractionation factor may be valid for all carbonate minerals.\n We also present inorganic temperature calibrations for both calcite and aragonite at low temperatures (5-70 °C) and find them to agree with prior published data. Using the new acid fractionation factor, published Δ47-temperature calibrations are recalculated. This analysis confirms a statistically significant Δ47-temperature calibration difference between data analyzed at 25 °C versus higher temperatures. The origin of the discrepancy remains unknown, but it appears that the acid fractionation factor is not the cause.",

In this study, we develop and apply an integrated and cost-effective approach, involving geophysical, geochemical, isotopic, field, and remote sensing investigations to understand the origin, evolution, and the factors controlling the paleo and current distribution of the RAKAS groundwater. Paleohydrological setting of the RAK is investigated by exploring the spatial relations between plaeo-drainage, paleo-lakes, faults, and sapping features. The following investigations were accomplished: (1) groundwater samples were collected from wells in the western portion of the Rub Al Khali and analyzed for their solute chemistry, stable isotopic composition (O, H), and Cl-36 and C-14 ages; (2) paleo-topography (prior to dune encroachment) was extracted using elevations within inter-dunal areas; (3) drainage systems were extracted using standard stream delineation techniques; (4) a regional mosaic of dual polarized (HH,HV) ALOS PALSAR data (10 m resolution) was created covering entire Arabian Peninsula; (5) paleo-drainage systems across the RAK were mapped using PALSAR data and SRTM-derived networks; and (6) Landsat 8 imagery and Digital Elevation Models (DEM) were used to map the distribution of paleo-lakes and to delineate sapping features. Findings include: (1) presence of relatively fresh (TDS ranging from 800 - 2,800 mg/L in deeper wells) suitable for drinking and/or irrigation; (2) major ions are Na, Ca, Cl, SO4 and HCO3; (3) radiocarbon model ages range from 1,400 to 30,600 years before present, but conservative Cl-36 model ages indicate much higher residence time (up to 750,000 years or more); (4) Cl-36 ages and stable isotopic compositions indicate that groundwater recharge in previous wet climatic periods; (5) features with stubby looking geometry, theater-like heads, U-shaped profile, flat floors and structurally controlled patterns indicative of sapping processes were mapped along scarps; (6) landscape analysis indicate onset of stream networks from mapped sapping features along escarpments suggesting groundwater discharge; and (7) large paleodrainage patterns indicate a general runoff direction from west to east.",

However, some basic questions about the interhemispheric SST shift remain unresolved, including its scale and whether the constituent changes in different basins were coordinated. In this study, we systematically investigate the spatial and temporal behavior of the late-1960s interhemispheric SST shift using ocean surface and subsurface observations. We also evaluate potential mechanisms using control and specific-forcing CMIP5 simulations.\nUsing a regime shift detection technique, we identify the late-1960s shift as the most prominent in the historical observational SST record. We additionally examine the corresponding changes in upper-ocean heat content and salinity associated with the shift. We find that there were coordinated upper-ocean cooling and freshening in the subpolar North Atlantic, the region of the largest-magnitude SST decrease during the interhemispheric shift. These upper-ocean changes correspond to a weakened North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC). However, the THC decrease does not fully account for the rapid global interhemispheric SST shift, particularly the warming in the extratropical Southern Hemisphere.",

Evidence of glacial retreat in the Ross Sea Embayment shows that deglaciation happened in several stages of rapid collapse and persisted well after the melting of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets was complete. The ice rise on Roosevelt Island should record the timing of the recession of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) past Roosevelt Island. The transition between ice originating from WAIS and ice originating local to Roosevelt Island could, in principle, be identified in the RICE ice core by the Total Air Content (TAC), which depends on surface air pressure and climate. Because the accumulation zone of WAIS is at a higher altitude than Roosevelt Island, it is expected that TAC will record a sharp drop during the transition. Existing data back to 3.7 ka show a relatively constant air content, probably implying only small elevation changes over that time. New results from deeper sections will be discussed at the meeting.",

Fractionation of its stable isotopes has been shown to be useful indicators of many geological, chemical and biological processes. For example, biogenic carbonates display ~5‰ range of d26Mg values, which is attributed to variable degree of biological control on Mg ions during biomineralisation. Understanding this biological control is essential for developing proxies based on biogenic carbonates. Current methods of magnesium isotope measurements in carbonates are often time consuming and require relatively large volumes of samples. In this work, we present a new approach of measuring Mg isotopes in biogenic carbonates using Laser Ablation MC-ICP-MS. We will show that this microanalytical approach provides accurate and relatively fast measurements of Mg isotopes in biological carbonate with precision down to 0.2‰ (1sd). We will also present examples on how this new method can provide additional information about foraminiferal biomineralisation. For example, we will demonstrate submicron variation in Mg isotopes across shells of Orbulina universa, which are linked to high and low Mg/Ca layers in this species. We will also report changes in Mg isotope composition of benthic foraminifera Amphistegina sp. cultured in seawater with different Mg/Ca values. Both examples will be used to draw attention to the complexity and possibilities of multiple mechanisms of Mg incorporation into biogenic carbonates during biomineralisation.",

The EPP has a premier goal of increasing the numbers of students, especially from underrepresented communities, who are trained and awarded degrees in NOAA mission-relevant STEM fields. This goal is being achieved through awards to support undergraduate and graduate level student scholarships and to enhance NOAA mission-relevant education, research and internships at EPP Cooperative Science Centers located at MSIs. The internships allow undergraduate students to gain technical experience in STEM fields while gaining an understanding of a science mission agency such as NOAA. EPP has built evidence supporting the value of internships with its Undergraduate Scholarship Program (USP). Program metrics are used to refine and improve the internship to ensure student success. Scholarships are competitively awarded and requires applicants to submit a personal statement detailing the NOAA-relevant professional experience the applicant seeks to acquire, and gauges the depth of understanding of the work of NOAA.\nA focus is the EPP USP Student Internship at NOAA, which has two training phases. The first occurs at NOAA HQ in Maryland and incorporates exposure to NOAA professional culture including mentoring and professional development for scholarship recipients. The second occurs at NOAA facilities in the 50 states and US Territories. The internship projects are conducted under the supervision of a NOAA mentor and allow the scholars to: acquire increased science and technology skills: be attached to a research group and participate in a research activity as part of the team; and, acquire practical experience and knowledge of the day-to-day work of the NOAA facility. EPP has recently initiated the Experiential Research and Training Opportunities (NERTO) for students from the CSCs. The NERTO is a longer term immersion at NOAA facilities, with a NOAA mentor working collaboratively with their academic advisor on a NOAA science priority. Consequently, the NERTO is strengthening the undergraduate to graduate education and workforce pipeline.",

            "abstract": "Diagnostic crystal field 4fn-4fn transition features in the ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum have been observed in many common rare earth element (REE)-bearing minerals. The partial filling of the 4f electron shell combined with a shielding effect caused by the fully filled 5s25p6-electron shells, which weaken any effects from external magnetic or electric fields on the electrons, makes rare earth ions unique. The narrow absorption features occur as a result of parity forbidden transitions and crystal field splitting of the trivalent REEs, and since they are well shielded, only subtle wavelengths shifts are seen in their spectral features. Synthetic single REE phosphates, carbonates, oxides, hydroxides and glasses have been measured in the lab to help identify absorption band positions that are characteristic of each REE as they occur in different minerals. Because spectral resolution is critical to identifying shifts in the absorption band positions, these materials have been measured on several different high resolution spectrometers. Using a combination of Ocean Optics USB 2000+ UV-VIS, USB2000+ VIS-NIR and ASD FS 4 spectrometers we have characterized REE-bearing materials from 0.2 to 2.5 microns with a spectral resolution of ~2 nm between 0.2 and 1.0 microns and 11 to 12 nm between 1.0 and 2.5 microns.\nResults to date suggest that wavelength shifts and variations in the degree of crystal field splitting allow spectral differentiation between REE-bearing minerals. To support these results, a comprehensive suite of marine phosphates, paleo-beach placers, IOCG deposits, alkaline to peralkaline igneous complexes, pegmatites associated with alkaline magmas and carbonatite intrusives, have been measured and included in our database. Core, rock chips, billets, sediment samples and grab samples were manually scanned to identify the most intense or spectrally different REE features. While REE-bearing minerals have been measured from around the world, significant effort has been taken to characterize samples from deposits associated with ongoing USGS projects related to phosphates from the SE region of the U.S., beach placers from the east coast of the U.S., Bokan Mountain Alaska, the Pea Ridge area of Missouri, Mountain Pass California and Elk Creek Nebraska.",

Dispersion coefficients depend on the interaction between the velocity fluctuation scales and the scale on which the scalar is homogenized. The mixing, or coarse grained scale is the characteristic length below which the scalar is well mixed. The mixing scale evolves in time as a result of dispersion and deformation of material fluid elements in the heterogeneous flow. We propose to use the mixing scale as a natural coarse graining scale for dispersion in heterogeneous flows. Using a stochastic modeling framework, we derive explicit expressions for the mixing-scale dependent dispersion tensor and its variance for a spatially heterogeneous steady-state flow field within a porous formation. The fundamental mechanisms of local scale dispersion and compression of material fluid elements on evolving velocity scales determine the evolution of mixing-scale dependent dispersion and its self-averaging behavior.",

            "abstract": "The Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO), lasting from ~53-50 Ma, has been characterized as the warmest sustained interval through the Cenozoic. It was comprised of a broad temperature maximum with elevated atmospheric pCO2, noticeable shifts in carbon cycling, and a variety of faunal and floral changes. This included one, and likely additional, brief (<200 kyr) intervals of extreme warming, the K/X event. At least for the most prominent events, the long-term drop in δ13C and short-term Carbon Isotope Excursions (CIEs) have been coupled to massive fluxes of 13C-depleted carbon into the exogenic system and global climate change. However, much about EECO remains unknown because of a lack of detailed and coupled proxy records; we are currently generating useful records to better characterize lithological and geochemical signatures of EECO. Here, we help rectify this problem by presenting a new lithologic and carbon isotopic record for a ~84-m-thick section of early Eocene upper slope calcareous-rich sediments, now lithified and exposed along Branch Stream, New Zealand. Comparison of new carbon isotopic and lithologic records of this greatly expanded section to nearby Mead Stream identifies multiple negative CIEs in short succession and generally more marl during lowermost EECO (~53.3-51.7 Ma), with the most prominent of these equating to the K/X event. The early Eocene lithologic and δ13C records at Branch and Mead Streams are remarkably similar to each other, with the following distinctions: sequences at Branch Stream are thicker and generally have a wider range of δ13C across CIEs. Both expanded sections are marked by terrigenous dilution, best explained by enhanced seasonal precipitation, elevated greenhouse-gas concentrations, and likely global warming. These data indicate lowermost EECO can be described as a time with a general δ13C low superimposed by a series of short-term climate perturbations.",

            "abstract": "Sedimentary sequences containing turbidites can provide important paleoseismic records. We present sedimentary records from 3 distinct sedimentary systems which provide a reliable well-dated paleseismic record. All 3 sites are subject to strong ground shaking in the event of a megathrust earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone near Vancouver Island, Canada. Effingham Inlet is an anoxic fjord on the west coast of Vancouver Island with an age model based on radiocarbon dates from terrestrial plant material (no marine correction), the Mazama Ash, and sedimentation rates constrained by annual laminations [Dallimore et al. 2008, Enkin et al., 2013]. Barkley Canyon [Goldfinger et al., 2012], 150 km SW, has been sampled at the abyssal plain fan in front of a submarine canyon. Slipstream Slump [ms submitted], 40 km north of Barkley Canyon, is a well-preserved 3 km wide sedimentary failure from the frontal ridge of the Cascadia accretionary wedge. At Slipstream, given the 2300 m water depth and the thin weak crust at the outer edge of the accretionary wedge, megathrust earthquake shaking is the most likely trigger for the turbidity currents, with sediments sourced exclusively from the exposed slide scar. Correlations based on sedimentology and physical property logging are made between turbidites observed at Barkley Canyon and Slipstream Slump, and a mutually consistent age model is defined using only planktonic foraminiferal dates and Bayesian analysis with a Poisson-process sedimentation model. A young marine reservoir age of ΔR=0 yr brings the top to the present and produces age correlations consistent with the thickest (>10 cm) Effingham Inlet turbidites. Correlations of physical property logs tie the Effingham Inlet record to the offshore, despite the extreme differences in the sedimentology. Having good marine geophysical data and well positioned core transects allows the facies analysis needed to interpret the turbidite record. This study provides a much needed link between the marine and terrestrial paleoseismic records. The combined paleoseismic record has 10 turbidites between 10.8 and 6.6 ka, after which the offshore sites became sediment-starved and only 2 or 3 more turbidites were deposited. The recurrence interval for the inferred Early Holocene megathrust earthquakes is 460 ± 140 years.",

            "abstract": "In the North American boreal forest, black spruce forests accumulate a C pool in the FF that is often greater than the vegetation C pool. In addition, the FF’s insulating properties help maintain colder soil temperatures and inhibit the microbial decomposition of ‘deep’ soil C. To estimate how climate change might alter the FF of black spruce forests, we examined the C accumulation rate and characteristics (percent wood, fine roots, moss, and needles; and bulk density) of the FF for three stands in four climatic regions of Alaska. Mean annual temperature ranged from -2.9 °C to 2.3 °C and precipitation from 263 mm to 716 mm and the two climatic variables correlated with one another. Both climatic factors were unrelated with the total C stored in the FF or its rate of C accumulation, despite trees growing faster with warmer and wetter average conditions. Although FF mass was similar across regions, its thickness decreased with temperature and precipitation, reflecting a significant increase in bulk density. The change in bulk density could have been from a shift in constituents because the warmer and wetter regions accumulated more wood and less fine root material. The shift between these two constituents may have also been the reason that the FF mass remained unchanged across the climate gradient because wood has a decomposition rate that is ~10% of fine roots. Although these results suggest that there will be little change in FF mass under warmer and wetter conditions, the increase in FF bulk density will amplify the warming of the mineral soil because of the increase in FF thermal conductivity.",

            "abstract": "Water resources in the high altitude, snow-dominated Tahoe basin are susceptible to long-term climate change and extreme climatic events due to large inter-annual climate variations. Lake Tahoe and its contributing watersheds exhibit high climatic (precipitation, temperature) and hydrologic (streamflow, evaporation) variation that exert significant control over regional water supply on annual and sub-annual timescales. To adequately quantify these controls, a high resolution (300m) physically based integrated surface and groundwater model, GSFLOW, of the Tahoe basin has been developed to identify key hydrologic mechanisms that explain recent changes in water resources of the region. The model is parameterized using geographical datasets and maintains a balance between (a) accurate representation of spatial (e.g., geology, streams, and topography) and hydrologic (groundwater, stream, lake, and wetland flows and storages) features, and (b) computational efficiency, which is a necessity for exploring critical vulnerabilities of water-supplies in the region. The calibrated model reproduces multiple observations of streamflow, snow water equivalent, satellite derived snow covered area, lake stage, and groundwater head. Climate input uncertainty was significantly decreased in the model through incorporating additional precipitation station data and helped improve model simulations of observed fluxes more than adjusting model parameters alone. The model simulates fluxes at the outlet of the watershed, but is also consistent at simulating streamflow at internal nodes. This integrated modeling framework helped assess both surface and groundwater resources in a coupled manner in the Tahoe basin.",

It is, therefore, crucial to assess the ability of such particles to absorb/scatter incoming solar radiation as well as act as cloud condensation nuclei, which is closely linked to the physical and chemical aerosol properties. However, observations of Siberian wildfire emissions are limited, and no systematic database of smoke particle properties is available for this region to date.\nAs part of this study, ambient aerosol samples were collected during two smoke episodes in Tomsk, Siberia, in the summers of 2012 and 2013. In addition, the chemical composition and optical properties of smoke particles derived from the combustion of typical Siberian fuels, including pine wood and debris, were determined during chamber burn experiments in a large aerosol/combustion chamber under controlled combustion conditions representative of wildfires and prescribed burns. Detailed multi-component characterization of individual particles and bulk properties was accomplished with a suite of techniques, including various types of chromatography, microscopy, spectroscopy, and thermo-optical analysis.\nIndividual particle analysis by SEM-EDX combined with cluster analysis revealed characteristic smoke structural components and major types of particles, which allowed to discriminate between flaming and smoldering regimes, reflected in specific morphological and chemical microstructure. The physicochemical properties representing the combustion phase (smoldering versus flaming) and the degree of processing (fresh versus aged) were assessed in the ambient aerosol based on the chamber burn results. For instance, some chemical transformation (aging of smoke particles) was noticed over a period of two days in the absence of sun light in the combustion chamber for certain chemical species, while the molecular tracer levoglucosan appeared to be rather stable, and can thus be considered a good marker of Siberian pine wood burning, specifically in the smoldering phase.\nThe findings from this study show the importance of various factors influencing the chemical and physical properties of smoke particles derived from Siberian biomass burning as a function of combustion conditions.",

            "abstract": "To date, seismic experiments have been key in our understanding of the internal structure of volcanic systems. However, most experiments, especially subaerial-based, are often restricted to refraction geometries with limited numbers of sources and receivers, and employ smoothing constraints required by tomographic inversions that produce smoothed and blurry images with spatial resolutions well below the length scale of important features that define these magmatic systems. Taking advantage of the high density of sources and receivers from multichannel seismic (MCS) data should, in principle, allow detailed images of velocity and reflectivity to be recovered. Unfortunately, the depth of mid-ocean ridges has the detrimental effect of concealing critical velocity information behind the seafloor reflection, preventing first arrival travel-time tomographic approaches from imaging the shallowest and most heterogeneous part of the crust.\nTo overcome the limitations of the acquisition geometry, here we are using an innovative multistep approach. We combine a synthetic ocean bottom experiment (SOBE), 3-D traveltime tomography, 2D elastic full waveform and a reverse time migration (RTM) formalism, and present one of the most detailed imagery to date of a massive and complex magmatic system beneath Axial seamount, an active submarine volcano that lies at the intersection of the Juan de Fuca ridge and the Cobb-Eickelberg seamount chain.\nWe present high-resolution images along 12 seismic lines that span the volcano. We refine the extent/volume of the main crustal magma reservoir that lies beneath the central caldera. We investigate the extent, volume and physical state of a secondary magma body present to the southwest and study its connections with the main magma reservoir. Additionally, we present a 3D tomographic model of the entire volcano that reveals a subsiding caldera floor that provides a near perfect trap for the ponding of lava flows, supporting a “trapdoor” mechanism for caldera formation. Finally, we show that crustal aging (increase in layer 2A velocity with age) is controlled by pipe-like pattern of focused hydrothermal mineralization.",

Several studies have examined the microphysical details of orographically-enhanced clouds from either an aircraft or from a mountain top location. However, further research is needed to characterize the relationships between mountain top and airborne microphysical properties. During the winter of 2011, an airborne study, the Colorado Airborne Mixed-Phase Cloud Study (CAMPS), and a ground-based field campaign, the Storm Peak Lab (SPL) Cloud Property Validation Experiment (StormVEx) were conducted in the Park Range of the Colorado Rockies. The CAMPS study utilized the University of Wyoming King Air (UWKA) to provide airborne cloud microphysical and meteorological data on 29 flights totaling 98 flight hours over the Park Range from December 15, 2010 to February 28, 2011. The UWKA was equipped with instruments that measured both cloud droplet and ice crystal size distributions, liquid water content, total water content (vapor, liquid, and ice), and 3-dimensional wind speed and direction. The Wyoming Cloud Radar and Lidar were also deployed during the campaign. These measurements are used to characterize cloud structure upwind and above the Park Range. StormVEx measured cloud droplet, ice crystal, and aerosol size distributions at SPL, located on the west summit of Mt. Werner at 3220m MSL. The observations from SPL are used to determine mountain top cloud microphysical properties at elevations lower than the UWKA was able to sample in-situ. Comparisons showed that cloud microphysics aloft and at the surface were consistent with respect to snow growth processes while small crystal concentrations were routinely higher at the surface, suggesting ice nucleation near cloud base. The effects of aerosol concentrations and upwind stability on mountain top and downwind microphysics are considered.",

            "abstract": "The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is commonly used to estimate suspended sediment loads and predict changes in loads as a result of changes in management or conservation practices at large watershed (>2000 km2) scales. However, several simplifications and omissions of processes render the model susceptible to systematic biases. For example, net gains or losses of sediment during channel routing are estimated by very simplified means that are difficult to validate. Also, the model does not account for channel processes such as bluff erosion, which is implicated as a major contributor of sediment in the Le Sueur River Basin (LRB) in south central Minnesota. As sediment yield is directly proportional to channel (peak or mean) velocity or flow depth for all four formulations of sediment yield models utilized by SWAT, it is critical to correctly quantify the water available and the distribution time of its arrival. In that context, proper quantification of the extent, distribution and efficiency of subsurface tile drainage is important in agricultural landscapes. SWAT provides a mechanism to account for sub-surface tile drainage, but in practice actual data to constrain this flow pathway are typically not available. For example, although extensive use of subsurface drainage in LRB has been documented, the location, density and extents of the tile drainage are unknown, leading to uncertainty in the flow residence time estimates. In this study we have explored the uncertainties related to subsurface drainage and channel-margin sediment gains and losses. The base SWAT model is modified to account for changes in geometry resulting from the simultaneous occurrence of deposition and erosion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multiple parameter combinations can result in statistically similar sediment yields at sub-basin outlets and suggest approaches to quantify and/or circumvent such problems of equifinality.",

            "abstract": "For the first time a U.S. tsunami warning center created and issued a tsunami forecast model animation while the tsunami was still crossing an ocean. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) scientists had predicted they would have this ability (Becker et al., 2012) with their RIFT forecast model (Wang et al., 2009) by using rapidly-determined W-phase centroid-moment tensor earthquake focal mechanisms as tsunami sources in the RIFT model (Wang et al., 2012). PTWC then acquired its own YouTube channel in 2013 for its outreach efforts that showed animations of historic tsunamis (Becker et al., 2013), but could also be a platform for sharing future tsunami animations.\nThe 8.2 Mw earthquake of 1 April 2014 prompted PTWC to issue official warnings for a dangerous tsunami in Chile, Peru and Ecuador. PTWC ended these warnings five hours later, then issued its new tsunami marine hazard product (i.e., no coastal evacuations) for the State of Hawaii. With the international warning canceled but with a domestic hazard still present PTWC generated a forecast model animation and uploaded it to its YouTube channel six hours before the arrival of the first waves in Hawaii. PTWC also gave copies of this animation to television reporters who in turn passed it on to their national broadcast networks. PTWC then created a version for NOAA’s Science on a Sphere system so it could be shown on these exhibits as the tsunami was still crossing the Pacific Ocean.\nWhile it is difficult to determine how many people saw this animation since local, national, and international news networks showed it in their broadcasts, PTWC’s YouTube channel provides some statistics. As of 1 August 2014 this animation has garnered more than 650,000 views. Previous animations, typically released during significant anniversaries, rarely get more than 10,000 views, and even then only when external websites share them. Clearly there is a high demand for a tsunami graphic that shows both the speed and the severity of a tsunami before it reaches impacted coastlines, similar to how radar and satellite images show the advancement of storms. Though this animation showed that most of the tsunami waves would not be dangerous, future publication of these animations will require additional outreach and education to avoid any unnecessary alarm.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/PacificTWC",

            "abstract": "Anomalously dry soil moisture can lead to reduced evapotranspiration and increased surface temperatures. These higher temperatures have been hypothesized to further reduce soil moisture, enhance temperature variability, and prolong dry extremes, particularly in warmer climates. Historical and future climate projections from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5) were investigated in this study to identify climate trends attributable to soil moisture-temperature coupling and feedback processes. It was found that the probability of temperature extremes (departures from seasonal averages) increases under global warming, and the time taken to return toward average warm-season temperatures following temperature extremes (i.e. persistence) increases by more than 25% over many land regions. An analysis of changes in surface energy balance suggests that this increased persistence of warm temperature extremes results from decreased surface longwave radiative cooling at warm temperature extremes under global warming. This process was also found in radiative forcing experiments using a single-column climate model having a realistic radiation scheme and a simplified land surface model, where the sensitivity of extremes to the relationship between soil moisture and transpiration was further investigated. The persistence of warm extremes depends on the soil moisture content at stomatal closure (wilting point), where higher wilting points lead to larger reductions in surface longwave emission at warm extremes and increased persistence of extremes. These results highlight the importance of surface radiation regime and vegetation in soil moisture-temperature feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "Major tsunami events occuring in the years since 2010 in the Pacific Ocean have been recorded by an unprecedented number of instruments deployed both in the open ocean and along coastal margins. Open, or deep-ocean instruments are especially valuable in that they provide high precision observations, have a lower level of background noise than coastal counterparts, and are free from the distortion effects of coastal bathymetry and topography. We take advantage of these observations to investigate the prevalence of a negative wave (trough) leading the first positive wave observed by the more than 40 deep-ocean bottom pressure recorders and approximately 200 tide gauges that were in operation over this time period. We consider two major events: 2010 Chile, and 2011 Tohoku, and present negative trough signatures for 2012 Haida Gwaii and 2014 northern Chile. Careful investigation of tsunami arrival at each deep-ocean site highlights the role filtering techniques may play in masking phenomenon such as the leading negative wave that is the basis of this study. The main focus of this investigation is to characterize the scale and repeatability of the phenomenon rather than provide a definitive explanation as to the cause.",

The observation period starting from 2010 to 2013 with more than 60 CGPS observation stations. The GPS analysis indicates that present-day deformation of Java Island is controlled by rotation of Sunda land, extension in the southern Strait of Sunda, postseismic deformation of the 2006 earthquake and the coupling between Indo-Australian plate and Sunda land. Strain rate solutions indicate compression in the south of Java Island. Using elastic dislocation theory the estimated interplate seismozonic coupling in the Java trench is about 50 percent in the sunda strait, smaller in the south west java and become larger to the east.

Methanesulfonate ion and sulfate ion are major sulfur compounds packed in snow ice in Antarctica. The isotopic ratio of an element reflects the origin and the history of the particle matter. Since the isotopic ratio of sulfur species depends on the source, the information about the source contribution of particulate matter can be estimated by analyzing the isotopic ratios of sulfur species. In this research, concentrations of sulfur species and isotopic ratios of sulfur species in snow collected on the route form coastal area to Dome Fuji station in Antarctica were analyzed.\nThe snow samples were collected along ca. 1000 km traverse route from Mikaeridai (S16; 69°01'S, 40°03'E, 590 m) to Dome Fuji station (77°19'S, 39°42'E, 3810 m) by the Japan Antarctica research expedition. The snow samples were also collected from a pit dug at Dome Fuji station. Those samples were collected in the 2009/2010 austral summer. The samples were transported to Japan without thawing. Quantitative analyses of sulfur species were performed using ion chromatograph and quadrupole type mass spectrometer. The isotopic ratios of isolated sulfur species were measured using elemental analyzer and the magnetic field type mass spectrometer.\nAverage concentrations and maximum concentration of methanesulfonate ion in the snow samples were 17 ng/ml and 123 ng/ml, respectively.

            "abstract": "More than one-sixth of the Earth’s human population relies on freshwater originating in mountain headwaters, which is understood to be generated largely from snowpacks that melt throughout the spring and summer. Annual hydrographs in these regions are characterized by large peaks occurring in the spring, followed by slow recession towards winter baseflow conditions. However, atmospheric warming trends are found to coincide with earlier periods of snowmelt, leading to increased flows in spring and decreased flows in summer. This decreased ability of our ‘water towers’ to store snow late into the summer suggests that other mechanisms of storage and release may become more important in sustaining baseflows. In particular, subsurface processes leading to late summer and winter flow will become increasingly important earlier on, but are as yet poorly understood. By utilising historical data to inform a better understanding of late-season subsurface processes, we will be better prepared to predict how these mountains will temporarily store and release groundwater in a warmer climate. Here, we analyse long-term data sets from a small (Marmot Creek, Alberta ~10 km2) and a large (Bow River at Banff, Alberta ~1000 km2) basinwithin the Canadian Rocky Mountains, comparing observations with model outputs, to investigate late-season hydrological responses, and particularly the role of groundwater as a temporary storage mechanism.",

            "abstract": "We perform a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) for strong ground motion within the Marmara region, Turkey, from potential earthquakes along the North Anatolian fault segments in and around Marmara Sea. Because of the increasing awareness of earthquake threat in the Marmara Region, the need for seismic hazard studies has become progressively more important for planning risk reduction actions. We perform the PSHA utilizing empirical Green’s functions (EGFs) along with models of finite rupture in place of standard “attenuation relations”. The important aspect of this study is that we combined the basic PSHA with ground motion simulations and obtained hazard analysis for all significant magnitude earthquakes, and provide the necessary full-waveform simulated ground motions to calculate building response, and thus risk. Recordings of small earthquakes from a local seismic array operated by Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute (KOERI) were used as EGFs.\nOver the past 50 years, probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) has been based upon estimating annual frequency of exceedance for a ground-motion parameter at a particular site (i.e., a hazard curve, Cornell, 1968). In the present study, we estimated the seismic hazard in Marmara Region and we expand and utilize the “physically based” approach proposed by Hutchings et al. (2007), Scognamiglio and Hutchings (2009). This approach replaces the aleatory uncertainty that current PSHA studies estimate by regression of empirical parameters with epistemic uncertainty that is expressed by the variability in the physical parameters of earthquake rupture. Epistemic uncertainty can be reduced by further research. By ‘physically based’ we refer to ground motion synthesized with quasi-dynamic rupture models derived from physics and an understanding of earthquake process. This methodology provides source- and site-specific calculations of full-waveform ground motion time histories, which is important for nonlinear dynamic analysis of structures, and reduce uncertainties in estimating standard engineering parameters. Further, based on these calculations, PSHA results are presented 2%, 10% and 50% hazards for all investigated sites in Marmara Region.",

A stirred reactor-type model was developed that considers DNAPL dissolution using a field-scale mass transfer function, instantaneous reaction of oxidant with aqueous and adsorbed contaminant and with readily oxidizable natural oxygen demand (\"fast NOD\"), and second-order kinetic reactions with \"slow NOD.\" DNAPL dissolution enhancement as a function of oxidant concentration and inhibition due to manganese dioxide precipitation during permanganate injection are included in the model. The DNAPL source area is divided into multiple treatment zones with different areas, depths, and contaminant masses based on site characterization data. The performance model is coupled with a cost module that involves a set of unit costs representing specific fixed and operating costs. Monitoring of groundwater and/or soil concentrations in each treatment zone is employed to assess ISCO performance and make real-time decisions on oxidant reinjection or ISCO termination. Key ISCO design variables include the oxidant concentration to be injected, time to begin performance monitoring, groundwater and/or soil contaminant concentrations to trigger reinjection or terminate ISCO, number of monitoring wells or geoprobe locations per treatment zone, number of samples per sampling event and location, and monitoring frequency. Design variables for each treatment zone may be optimized to minimize expected cost over a set of Monte Carlo simulations that consider uncertainty in site parameters. The model is incorporated in the Stochastic Cost Optimization Toolkit (SCOToolkit) program, which couples the ISCO model with a dissolved plume transport model and with modules for other remediation strategies. An example problem is presented that illustrates design tradeoffs required to deal with characterization and monitoring uncertainty. Monitoring soil concentration changes during ISCO was found to be important to avoid decision errors associated with slow rebound of groundwater concentrations.",

            "abstract": "The San Marcos Pueblo, one of the largest and most important cities of the pre-European Southwest, has long been a place of curiosity for archaeologists and geophysicists alike. Despite numerous archaeological investigations, primarily test excavations and surface surveys carried out at San Marcos from the early 1900s to the present, the site retains pottery sherds scattered along the surface from when it was first occupied in the thirteenth century to its abandonment during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Geophysical investigations have identified locations of kivas (ceremonial pits), middens (trash heaps), room blocks and possible metallurgy activity in the area. The site is located south of Santa Fe, NM and to the east of the Cerrillos Hills, a source for lead ore and turquoise.\nThe students of SAGE have studied the San Marcos Pueblo for the past 11 years, and produced a map of the northeastern portion of the Pueblo colloquially called ‘El Mapa Grande.’ Ground penetrating radar (GPR), magnetics, and electromagnetic (EM) data were acquired on 30mx30m grids and seismic refraction data on various profiles throughout El Mapa Grande. During the 2014 field season new GPR data were acquired on two grids, magnetics data on one, and multiple grids were resurveyed with magnetics and EM to enhance resolution. The most recent GPR data extend coverage of two large anomalies that are part of linear EW-trending structures previously identified and consistent with a possible block wall or midden. Low GPR scatter and circular magnetic lows define several kivas. A target area in the NE of El Mapa Grande was thought to be related to metallurgic activity. Analysis of previous seismic data did not resolve any subsurface features corresponding to a metallurgy operation, but detected the magnetically-chaotic Ancha formation. Comparison with magnetic profile data support the interpretation that this anomaly is caused by a sub-crop of the Ancha Formation.",

            "abstract": "Statistical downscaling models developed for precipitation rely heavily on predictors chosen and on accurate relationships between regional scale predictand and GCM-scale predictor for providing future precipitation projections at different spatial and temporal scales. This study provides two new screening methods for selection of predictor variables for use in downscaling methods based on predictand-predictors relationships. Methods to characterize predictand-predictors relationships via rigid and flexible functional relationships using mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model with binary variables and artificial neural network (ANN) models respectively are developed and evaluated in this study. In addition to these two methods, a stepwise regression (SWR) and two models that do not use any pre-screening of variables are also evaluated. A two-step process is used to downscale precipitation data with optimal selection of predictors and using them in a statistical downscaling model based on support vector machine (SVM) approach. Experiments with the proposed two new methods and three additional methods based on correlation between predictors and predictand and the other based on principal component analysis are evaluated in this study. Results suggest that optimal selection of variables using MINLP albeit with linear relationship and ANN method provided improved performance and error measures compared to two other models that did not use these methods for screening the variables. Of all the three screening methods tested in this study, SWR method selected the least number of variables and also ranked lowest based on several performance measures.",

            "abstract": "The challenges in full wave form inversion (FWI) are many fold: non-linear objective functions, multiple local minima, awkward mathematics, bad starting velocity model guesses, extreme computational problems, and very large seismic data sets. The primary goal is to use a computer modeling system with all the right partial differentiable equations for the waves, including anisotropy and attenuation. Then simulate the earth with an initial starting velocity model. Once the simulation is complete, compare the computed seismic with the real data, and compute a meaningful error function. If the error is too high, find a method to update the velocity model and redo the simulation.\nRecent changes in active and passive seismic recording systems allow for long time continuous recording. This passive data stream is now being recorded into the active data devices. So yet another input from the “Earth Computer” is now available. And the question to be asked is: how to process it?\nThe Laplace and Laplace Fourier methods for FWI have demonstrated for synthetic, and real seismic data sets a powerful results in final velocity models and depth migrations. To understand these FWI schemes the following results have been computed and will be presented. Using a 2D marine seismic line the FWI results for the smooth Laplace Domain, the Laplace Fourier, and Logarithmic Wave Form Inversion will be presented. These are then compared to the Frequency Domain Inversion method and each in sequence has a remarkable increase in quality. The final velocity model is used as input to the demonstrated RTM migration result.\nIn summary, FWI methods can be extended to include passive seismic activity if we can find ways to model that activity effectively. Using previous surface wave examples we extend the use of Rayleigh waves to actively help FWI find near surface shear velocities. The new methods are incorporated into the Laplace and Laplace Fourier FWI schemes.",

            "abstract": "Climate change in Arctic wetlands is resulting in a widening phenological mismatch between the onset of the growing season and the arrival and hatch date of migratory geese, the primary consumers in the system. During the past three decades, the growing season has advanced but geese have not advanced arrival or hatch date at the same rate. Geese now arrive into a system that has been growing longer than in the past with potential changes in forage quality because sedges have their highest nutrient density shortly following emergence. One potential concomitant result of this phenological gap is altered carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) of leaf tissue being returned to the ecosystem as feces that is more N-poor. Altering the C:N of these inputs can further influence C and N cycling in the system. We examine the influence of advanced growing season and different arrival times by black brant on leaf and soil C:N ratio and soil N-form. Our experiment consists of six blocks with nine study plots each. Half the plots are warmed to advance the growing season. Two plots each receive early, typical, late, and no grazing; one plot is a control that is not warmed and grazing is natural. Leaf tissue was collected to determine C and N concentration using an elemental analyzer. Anion and cation exchange membranes were used to monitor inorganic N forms in soil; samples were analyzed via fluorescence following extraction. Soil water collected from lysimeters was analyzed for organic N. Warming advanced plant growth between one and two weeks and resulted in higher C:N of leaf tissue Geese maintained ‘grazing lawns’, areas of exceptionally short vegetation, where plants had high N compared to non-grazed areas. Grazing early in the season promoted higher N content of leaves and soil while grazing late had little influence on N. The timing of the growing season and grazing both have important implications for C and N in this system.",

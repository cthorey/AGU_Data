            "abstract": "In the shallow portion of crustal fault zones, fracturing and cataclasis are thought to be the dominant processes during earthquake propagation. In the lower crust/upper mantle, viscous flow is inferred to facilitate aseismic creep along shear zones. Recent studies show that slip zones (SZs), in natural and experimental carbonate seismic faults, are made of nanograins with a polygonal texture, a microstructure consistent with deformation by grain boundary sliding (GBS) mechanisms.\nFriction experiments performed on calcite fine-grained gouges, at speed v = 1 ms-1, normal stress sn = 18 MPa, displacements d = 0.009–1.46 m, and room temperature and humidity, show a four stage-evolution of the fault strength: SI) attainment of initial value, f = 0.67; SII) increase up to peak value f = 0.82; SIII) sudden decrease to low steady-state value, f = 0.18; and SIV) sudden increase to final value, f = 0.44, during sample deceleration.\nSamples recovered at the end of each displacement-controlled experiments (Stages I–IV) show the following microstructures evolution of the SZ material, which is: SI) poorly consolidated, and made of fine-grained (1 < D < 5 microns), angular clasts formed by brittle fracturing and cataclasis; SII) cohesive, and made of larger clasts of calcite (D ≈ 1 microns), exhibiting a high density of free dislocations and hosting subgrains (D ≤ 200 nm), dispersed within calcite nanograins. SIII) made of nanograin aggregates exhibiting polygonal grain boundaries, and 120° triple junctions between equiaxial grains. The grains display no preferred elongation, no crystal preferred orientation and low free dislocation densities, possibly due to high temperature (> 900 C) GBS creep deformation.\nOur microstructural observations suggest that GBS mechanisms can operate in geological materials deformed at high strain rates along frictionally heated seismogenic slip surfaces. The observed microstructures in experimental slip zones are strikingly similar to those predicted by theoretical studies, and to those observed during experiments on metals and fine-grained carbonates deformed at T > 900 °C, where superplastic behaviour due to GBS has been inferred. A regime of frictionally-induced GBS could thus account for the dynamic weakening of carbonate faults during earthquake propagation in nature.",

            "abstract": "An ongoing effort to simulate plasma instability in the equatorial ionosphere leading to equatorial spread F (ESF) in the American sector is described. Ionospheric state parameters including plasma number density and vector drift velocity profiles have been measured at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory in campaigns in 2013 and 2014. Coherent radar backscatter from plasma irregularities has been recorded simultaneously, and images of the irregularities have been generated using aperture synthesis methods. A fully 3D numerical simulation of ionospheric irregularities, initialized and forced using parametrizations derived from measurements and empirical models, has been used in attempts to reproduce the ESF activity observed. Emphasis is placed on representing currents in the bottomside F region completely with the simulation. The simulations have been able to recover many of the features of the irregularities, although some important exceptions have been noted. ESF events in which the first appearance of radar plumes occurs either very early or very late cannot be reproduced in simulation and may be indicative of nonlocal influences. A new multistatic network of HF beacons is being deployed to estimate and track nonlocal influences on ionospheric stability. The network eploys PRN coding, Doppler discrimination, and interferometry and provides data suitable for inverse modeling. Preliminary results from the network will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric processes, especially those that occur in the surface and boundary layer, are significantly impacted by soil moisture (SM). Due to the observational gaps in the ground-based monitoring of SM, methodologies have been developed to monitor SM from satellite platforms. While many have focused on microwave methods, observations of thermal infrared land surface temperature (LST) also provides a means of providing SM information. One particular TIR SM method exploits surface flux predictions retrieved from the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model. ALEXI uses a time-differential measurement of morning LST rise to diagnose the partitioning of net radiation into surface energy fluxes. Here an analysis will be presented to study relationships between three SM products during a multi-year period (2000-2013) from an active/passive microwave dataset (ECV), a TIR-based model (ALEXI), and a land surface model (Noah) over the CONUS. Additionally, all three will be compared against in-situ SM observations from the North American Soil Moisture Database.\nThe second analysis will focus on the use of ALEXI towards diagnosing SM source/sink processes. Traditional soil water balance modeling is based on one-dimensional (vertical-only) water flow, free drainage at the bottom of the soil column, and neglecting ancillary inputs due to processes such as irrigation. However, recent work has highlighted the importance of secondary water source (e.g., irrigation, groundwater extraction, inland wetlands, lateral flows) and sink (e.g., tile drainage in agricultural areas) processes on the partitioning of evaporative and sensible heat fluxes. ALEXI offers a top-down approach for mapping areas where SM source/sink processes have a significant impact on the surface energy balance. Here we present an index, ASSET, that is based on comparisons between ALEXI latent heat flux (LE) estimates and LE predicted by a free-drainage prognostic LSM lacking irrigation, groundwater and tile drainage modules. ASSET is compared to existing maps of estimated groundwater depth, open water fraction, and irrigated area to provide a preliminary evaluation of the index as a diagnostic tool for evaluating the impact of SM source/sink processes not captured by traditional one-dimensional water balance models.",

            "abstract": "Measurements from ACE and Ulysses have revealed a multifaceted solar wind, with distinctly different kinetic and compositional properties dependent on the source region of the wind. One of the major outstanding issues in heliophysics concerns the origin and also predictability of quasi-stationary slow solar wind. While the fast solar wind is now proven to originate within large polar coronal holes, the source of the slow solar wind remains particularly elusive and has been the subject of long debate, leading to models that are stationary and also reconnection based – such as interchange or so-called S-web based models. Our talk will focus on observational constraints of solar wind sources and their evolution during the solar cycle. In particular, we will point out long-term variations of wind composition and dynamic properties, particularly focused on the abundance of elements with low First Ionization Potential (FIP), which have been routinely measured on both ACE and Ulysses spacecraft. We will use these in situ observations, and remote sensing data where available, to provide constraints for solar wind origin during the solar cycle, and on their correspondence to predictions for models of the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zones are key areas on Earth where material once exposed at the surface is processed: part of the material almost instantaneously finds its way back to the surface in the island arcs but most of it is recycled into the mantle. However, all elements are not transferred in the same way from the surface to the island arc or deep mantle. Most fluid-mobile elements such as B, Li or U escape the subducted slab in arc magmas while others such as Hf and the heavy REE are mainly recycled into the mantle.\nHere I revisit the information provided by elements such as HFSE, REE, Pb and Sr whose isotopic compositions constrain their partitioning between arc magmas and the slab. A compilation of data on arcs around the globe shows that two main processes dominate the arc signature: in some cases subducted sediments contribute significant amounts of both fluid-mobile and immobile elements to arc magmas; in other cases they contribute very little, not even for the fluid-mobile elements. While Sr and Pb are highly enriched in lavas produced in fluid-dominated environments, their average Sr isotopic composition is only about 0.7035 and their average 206Pb/204Pb is about 18.5, values that are similar to those of average depleted mantle. This indicates that the fluids come mainly from the basaltic portion of the subducted slab. It also indicates that fluid-mobile elements in the subducted sediments are quantitatively sent back into the mantle unless the sediment melts, an unlikely situation in present-day subduction zones.",

Therefore, it is imperative that we understand what controls the observed trends and changes in variability of dust emissions. Recently, we have shown that the observed reduction in African dust loading over the Atlantic in recent decades is likely driven by large-scale wind changes over source regions rather than changes in vegetation cover. Using an updated dust emission scheme and information from high resolution (0.25 degree) simulations from the NASA GEOS model, we attribute the uncertainty in modeled dust AOD and expand the analysis to other regions of the world, including Asia and the Middle East.",

            "abstract": "The climate on Mars is strongly controlled by the amount of dust lifted and transported in the atmosphere, which causes fluctuations of air opacity and affects temperatures and winds. Recently, observations of the vertical dust distribution of the Martian atmosphere by the Mars Climate Sounder on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter revealed a phenomenon which is still poorly understood: the formation of detached layers of dust. These detached layers, also confirmed by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer on-board the Mars Global Surveyor, reside above the planetary boundary layer typically at altitudes between 20 and 40 km and have been mostly observed at low latitudes. These detached layers of dust are not reproduced by Global Climate Models (GCM) and different atmospheric processes are discussed and can be combined to explain their origin, such as small-scale lifting, upslope topographic winds, scavenging by water ice clouds, dust storms… Here we use the Martian GCM developed at the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD) to simulate the formation of detached layers of dust. To start, we developed a new implementation of the water cycle, taking into account nucleation on dust particles, ice particle growth, and scavenging of dust particles due to the condensation of ice. However, this method didn’t yield to satisfying results in the GCM. Then, we performed the parameterization in the GCM of the so-called “rocket dust storms”, governed by deep convection and able to inject dust at high altitudes in the Martian troposphere. By coupling this new parameterization with general circulation of the GCM, we succeed to model detached layers of dust. Here we present this parameterization and we discuss about the spatial and temporal variability of the detached layers of dust, in comparison with observations.",

The SMAP instrument suite includes a L-band radiometer and a L-band synthetic aperture radar. This paper will describe the architecture of the Science Data System (SDS) that processes the SMAP raw data into higher-level products. All of the SMAP products appear in the Hierarchical Data Format-5 (HDF5) format. Metadata that conform to the ISO 19115 standard accompany each product. SMAP products range from raw data (Level 0) through parsed and organized telemetry (Level 1A), calibrated signals (Level 1B/1C), retrieved geophysical values (Level 2), daily composite maps (Level 3), to analysis and modeling data (Level 4). This paper will describe an architecture that automates the challenge of delivering multiple products with large data volumes within a few hours to a few days of instrument acquisition. Additional challenges include handling data for a diverse user community as well as rapid data visualization. SMAP faces the additional complexity that the archive and access to the SMAP data processes through two NASA Data Active Archive Centers (DAAC): The Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) hosts and distributes SMAP Radar data, while the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) hosts and distributes all other SMAP products.",

As such, an understanding of what influences fracture permeability is critically important to describing sub-surface flows. Numerous studies have been reported which illustrate the importance of rock fracture geometry on the permeability of fractures, in particular the influence of zero aperture locations within the fracture aperture. increasing the tortuosity of flow through a fracture and subsequently decreasing the fracture permeability.\nFractures and faults can shear due to increased transverse stresses, or an increase of fluid pressure within a fracture reducing the effective forces stopping fracture slippage. This behavior has been widely observed in many seismic events. How small scale shearing events influence the permeability of fracture is not well known though, as few experimental tests have been performed that enable the dynamic change in a fractured rock position while simultaneously measuring the permeability across the fracture.\nThis talk describes resent research at the National Energy Technology Laboratory in Morgantown, West Virginia where fractured rock cores have been experimentally sheared and the permeability through the fracture has been measured. In addition, these fractured cores were imaged with computed tomography scanning to understand what geometric alterations to the fracture structure influence the shearing induced changes to fracture permeability. Both shale and sandstone fractured cores have been evaluated with this unique core flow apparatus, and relationships between the shearing distance, rock type, and initial fracture geometry are being developed to provide guidance on understanding and modeling sheared fracture permeability changes in CO2 sequestration and other sub-surface activities.",

            "abstract": "Depending on initial melt composition, magma volumes, transfer rates, depth of emplacement and tectonic conditions, granite magmas can follow different crystallization paths leading to complex patterns of magmatic fluid/heat release and water-rock interaction in the host rocks at the emplacement level. In the case of multi-pulse magmatic complexes, several contact metamorphic and hydrothermal effects can overlap through time on a relatively small crustal portion. The net result of the described complex evolution is a magmatic system, where magmatic fluid exsolution, heat flow and triggering of meteoric fluid convection cells follow cyclically transient patterns with strong implication on ore forming processes and geothermal field lifespan.\nDetailed field mapping, coupled with petrographic-geochronologic-geochemical-isotopic data on Late Miocene-Pleistocene granite intrusions in Tuscany provided new insights on melting processes occurred in the roots as well as on paleo-hydrothermal circuits triggered at the roof of the intrusive complexes. Tuscan granite intrusions were constructed incrementally by amalgamation (sheeted plutons) and/or multilayer dispersion (sills and laccoliths) of different magma pulses, sequentially produced as the Apennine fold belt was progressively thinned, heated and intruded by mafic magmas. Partial melting was probably triggered by multiple, small-sized mafic intrusions, that allowed temporary overstepping of dehydration melting reactions into the already pre-heated crust. Dilution in time of the magmatic activity prevented melt homogenization at depth, allowing the formation at the emplacement level of multiple, isotopically distinct, intrusive sheets instead of a single, homogeneous, hybrid pluton.\nThis could be also one of the major key factors explaining the prolonged hydrothermal activity recorded in this area by both fossil (Plio-Pleistocene ore deposits) and active (Larderello geothermal field) systems.",

            "abstract": "The strong development of tsunami instrumentation in the last decade now provides observations of tsunami wave propagation in most ocean basins. This evolution has lead to the wide use of tsunami data to image earthquake sources. In particular, the 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku earthquake is the first large event with an almost complete azimuthal coverage of tsunami records. Source studies have taken advantage of these observations to demonstrate the ability of tsunami data to constrain the distribution of coseismic slip, especially in the shallow part of subductions where other standard datasets often lack resolution (e.g. onland geodetic data). This gain in resolution comes with the need to improve tsunami Green’s functions. One source of error in these Green’s functions calculations is the contribution of horizontal motion of the sea-bottom to the tsunami excitation (here referred to as “bathymetry effect”). For the specific case of the Tohoku earthquake, because of the steep bathymetry and relatively flat slab geometry near the surface, we find that the bathymetry effect can double the amplitude of the tsunami. The inversion of tsunami data to image the Tohoku earthquake slip distribution without taking into account the bathymetry effect results in slip over-prediction of 30 to 50 m over a wide area. Because the bathymetry gradient is not as strong and the slab as flat in all subduction zones, the bathymetry effect has often been overlooked in forward simulations and source inversions. In view of the importance of this bathymetry effect for the Tohoku earthquake, we extend our calculations to all the other major subduction zones to evaluate where it is indeed critical. We show that in several subduction zones, the bathymetry effect can locally double the water elevation due to a unit of slip. We discuss the global repartition of this bathymetry effect and what we know about the ability of the concerned subduction zones to generate large earthquakes and tsunami.",

This convergence of fresh water is associated with a strengthening of the anti-cyclonic atmospheric circulation, particularly in the summer time. We also investigate how the changing state of the sea ice pack is influencing the atmosphere-ocean momentum exchange. As well as looking at long-term trends, the altimetry dataset allows us to examine the annual cycle of sea level in the western Arctic Ocean.

            "abstract": "We analyse some climate dynamics from a complex network approach. This leads to an inverse problem: Is there a backbone-like structure underlying the climate system? For this we propose a method to reconstruct and analyze a complex network from data generated by a spatio-temporal dynamical system. This approach enables us to uncover relations to global circulation patterns in oceans and atmosphere. The global scale view on climate networks offers promising new perspectives for detecting dynamical structures based on nonlinear physical processes in the climate system. Moreover, we evaluate different regional climate models from this aspect.\nThis concept is also applied to Monsoon data in order to characterize the regional occurrence of extreme rain events and its impact on predictability. Changing climatic conditions have led to a significant increase in magnitude and frequency of spatially extensive extreme rainfall events in the eastern Central Andes of South America. These events impose substantial natural hazards for population, economy, and ecology by floods and landslides. For example, heavy floods in Bolivia in early 2007 affected more than 133.000 households and produced estimated costs of 443 Mio. USD.\nHere, we develop a general framework to predict extreme events by combining a non-linear synchronization technique with complex networks. We apply our method to real-time satellite-derived rainfall data and are able to predict a large amount of extreme rainfall events. Our study reveals a linkage between polar and subtropical regimes as responsible mechanism: Extreme rainfall in the eastern Central Andes is caused by the interplay of northward migrating frontal systems and a low-level wind channel from the western Amazon to the subtropics, providing additional moisture. Frontal systems from the Antarctic thus play a key role for sub-seasonal variability of the South American Monsoon System.",

Repeated influx of hot magma over 10-20 ka leads to short-amplitude temperature oscillations, which are recorded by resorption/crystallization cycles of zircon. Plotting the number of dated zircons versus their high-precision U-Pb date results in curves that qualitatively relate to the evolution of magma temperature over time [1], [2].\nThe trace elemental, O and Hf isotopic composition of zircon gives indications about the degree of magma homogenization and thermal evolution. Zircons from systems with small volumes and magma fluxes record non-systematic chemical and Hf isotopic heterogeneity, suggesting crystallization in non-homogenized ephemeral magma batches. Such systems typically lead to small, mid-upper crustal plutons [3].\nZircons from large-volume crystal-poor rhyolites record initial heterogeneities and rapid amalgamation of smaller magma batches over 10 ka [4], while zircons from monotonous intermediates record magma evolution over several 100 ka with coherent fractionation trends suggesting homogenization and a coherent thermal evolution [2]. In both cases, volumes and flux rates were sufficient to produce large volumes of eruptible magma on very contrasting time scales.\nZircon is therefore recording cyclic crystallization-rejuvenation processes during temperature fluctuations in intermediate to upper crustal magma reservoirs but may not relate to the physical pluton emplacement or eruption. We can quantify volumes, rates of magma influx, rates of cooling and crystallization, and the degree of convective homogenization from zircon data, and infer reservoir assembly and eruption trigger mechanisms.\nThese parameters largely control the evolution of long-lived, low-flux silicic magmatic system typical for mid-to-upper crustal plutons, monotonous intermediates are characterized by intermediate durations and fluxes while short-lived, high-flux systems preferentially produce crystal-poor rhyolites.\n",

Individual and paired records of groundwater head indicate seasonal recovery and recession of water storage, periodic and episodic ground surface loading, and earth tide responses. Lunar periodicity in groundwater head fluctuation coincident with tide height at one coastal site is consistent with tidal surface loading/unloading. Diurnal tidal fluctuations in the same record change amplitude and shift phase with depth, also indicative of surface loading/unloading. Transience in the surface loading signals with depth is governed by the vertically integrated hydraulic properties of the thick BAS sedimentary sequence. Inland, earth tide responses of smaller amplitude and lacking phase shift with depth are ubiquitous in the background signal. Most records include clearly resolvable episodic deflections in the order of 0.1 m water head and up to 0.5 m water head, near simultaneous with depth, corresponding to individual episodes of rainfall. The episodic head deflections provide a record of change in terrestrial water storage (ΔTWS) comprising undifferentiated surface water flooding, soil moisture and shallow groundwater recharge – a direct land-based equivalent of satellite estimates of ΔTWS. Enigmatic short-term recession from individual deflection peaks may be related to elastic deformation and ground surface lowering under terrestrial water storage loading.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental question concerning magnetic energy release on the Sun is why the release occurs only after substantial stresses have been built up in the field. If reconnection were to occur readily, then the released energy would be much less than the energy required for coronal heating, CMEs, flares, jets, spicules, etc. How can we explain this switch-on property? What is the physical nature of the onset conditions? One idea involves the secondary instability of current sheets, which switches on when the rotation of the magnetic field across a current sheet reaches a critical angle. Such conditions would occur at the boundaries of flux tubes that become tangled and twisted by turbulent photospheric convection, for example. Other ideas focus on a critical thickness for the current sheet. We report here on the preliminary results of our investigation of reconnection onset. Unlike our earlier work on the secondary instability (Dahlburg, Klimchuk, and Antiochos 2005), here we treat the coupled chromosphere-corona system. Using the BATS-R-US MHD code (Toth et al. 2012), we simulate a single current sheet in a sheared magnetic field that extends from the chromosphere into the corona. Driver motions are applied at the base of the model. The configuration and chromosphere are both idealized, but capture the essential physics of the problem. The advantage of this unique approach is that it resolves the current sheet to the greatest extent possible while maintaining a realistic solar atmosphere. It thus bridges the gap between reconnection in a box studies and studies of large-scale systems such as active regions. One question we will address is whether onset conditions are met first in the chromosphere or corona.",

            "abstract": "We have performed aftershocks analysis triggered by 24.05.2014 (Mw=6.5) Gokceada Island (GI) earthquake where occurred at the W of North Anatolian Fault zone. Mainshock was widely felt in Aegean and Marmara regions of Turkey. Major damage in 228 homes was reported. Other 49 residences suffered moderate or light damage. We have well located 699 events over 1041 by at least 5 stations for one month period after the mainshock. Double difference relocation algorithm allowed us to minimize rms values less than 0.39. Initial results show clear unilateral rupture towards Gallipoli Peninsula at the W of Marmara Sea region. Aftershocks show linearity with an extension of ~110 km length, ~25 km width. Largest aftershock (Mw=5.3) was at the NE end of activation zone. Depths are mainly confined from 5 to 25 km ranges. Two locking depths are detected beneath 8 km in Lemnos Basin and Saros Trough. We also constructed focal mechanisms from regional moment tensor solutions. Digital waveform data obtained from AFAD (Turkey) and HT-AUTH (Greece). Focal mechanisms reflect complex tectonic settings. Nevertheless numerous mechanisms show dominant dextral strike-slip motions aligned NE-SW direction with minor reverse component.\nState of stress before the mainshock was pure shear regime. But two principal stress axes are observed as oblique for the aftershocks showing ambiguity between compression and shear. It is likely that the mean stress regime has changed after the GI earthquake. If this is so, we may expect that the strike-slip component would slowly increase later in order to recover the conditions existing before. Coulomb stress values rise at the edges of the fault segment due to accumulation of slip. We observed strong spatial correlation between the static stress change after 2014 GI earthquake and the segment that ruptured during the 1912 Murefte-Ganos (Mw=7.4) earthquake. The analysis showed that the areas of positive static stress changes reach to seismic gap in the Marmara Sea.\nThe 2014 GI, 1999 Izmit (Mw=7.6) and 1912 earthquakes have partially broken NAF. It continues to break along the seismic gap in the Marmara Sea implying with a high seismic risk for Istanbul and its vicinity. It is not certain whether this seismic gap will break as a whole or as smaller segments.",

            "abstract": "An optical fiber Distributed Acoustic Sensor array was deployed in a shallow trench at the site of the Garner Valley Downhole Array (GVDA) in southern California. The site was operated as a collaborator of the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) by UCSB. The fiber-optic cable layout approximated a rectangle whose dimensions were roughly 160 meters by 80 meters. The layout included two subdiagonals to provide a variety of orientations of the cable relative to source locations. The study included different seismic sources deployed at a number of surveyed positions: a 45 kN shear shaker operated at the site by NEES@UCLA, a portable 450 N shaker, a small Vibroseis truck, and hammer blows on a steel plate to map cable locations. Several dozen separate tests were recorded in which each test typically included ten repeats. The data were utilized for several studies. First, the characteristics of the recorded signals were analyzed for directivity and sensitivity of the cable response (Lancelle et al., 2014, this meeting). The DAS system recorded dynamic ground events in the direction of the cable and hence comparisons with geophones required signal processing. The one-meter spacing of DAS traces could be well correlated over distances of a few meters. Second, swept-sine sources were used to obtain surface-wave velocity dispersion to determine near-surface shear-wave velocity distribution using Multispectral Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) (Baldwin et al., 2014, this meeting). The results were in good agreement with previous Vibroseis results at the site (Stokoe et al. 2004). Third, a new method for time-frequency filtering was developed for extracting the surface-wave phase velocities from uncorrelated receiver traces (Lord et al., 2014, this meeting).",

            "abstract": "There is great potential for reconstructing past changes in the hydrologic cycle using the hydrogen isotopic composition of plant-wax biomarkers. However, empirical relationships relating plant-wax hydrogen isotope compositions (δDwax) to source water are almost exclusively based upon modern plants, soils and sediments and a single compound class such as n-alkanes or n-alkanoic acids. Relatively little is known about the relationship between these compound classes and differences in how they record the hydrogen isotopic composition of source water. Here we present new hydrogen isotopic measurements from a suite of modern and late Quaternary lake sediment samples to test the fidelity of δDwaxto source water δD in space and time.\nWe find that within compound class the shared variance between C29 and C31 n-alkane and C28 and C30 n-alkanoic acid δD values is 87% and 86%. Between compound classes there is 53% shared variance between C29 n-alkane and C28 n-acid δD values. The apparent isotopic fractionation between source water and n-alkane δD values is consistent with prior studies from these regions that show the influence of vegetation type and climate. However, the n-alkanoic acid apparent fractionation values cannot be explained by these factors alone. Rather, the data require that for a large proportion of the samples there is a substantial contribution of long-chain n-acids from vegetation that uses lake water as the hydrogen source for lipid synthesis. This is consistent with overlapping n-acid compound distributions in lake sediment, soils, and aquatic and terrestrial plants from many of these regions.\nOur results emphasize the utility of plant-wax δD for reconstructing water δD values and highlight the potential importance of non-terrestrial sources of long-chain n-acids in lake systems.",

            "abstract": "We study the injection and subsequent evolution of a water sill into an ice shell overlying an ocean and examine the resulting successive surface deformations. We assume that water spreads within the elastic part of the ice shell and show that the mechanical properties of ice exert a strong control on the lateral extent of the sill. At shallow depths, water makes room for itself by lifting the overlying ice layer and water weight promotes lateral spreading of the sill. In contrast, a deep sill bends the underlying elastic layer and its weight does not affect its spreading. As a result, the sill lateral extent is limited to about a few to a few tens of kilometers by the fracture toughness of ice. In that case, the sill can thicken substantially, until the feeder dyke closes, since downward flexure of the lower elastic layer provides a way of keeping the pressure high in the water source.\nPits, domes, and small chaos on Europa’s surface are quasi-circular features a few to a few tens of kilometers in diameter whose morphology could be explained by the subsequent evolution of such a thick sill. Indeed, cooling of the sill after emplacement warms the surrounding ice and thins the overlying elastic ice layer. As a result, preexisting stresses in the elastic part of the ice shell increase locally to the point that they may disrupt the ice above the sill (small chaos). Furthermore, disruption of the surface also allows for partial isostatic compensation of water weight, leading to a topographic depression at the surface (pit), of the order of ~102 m. Finally, complete water solidification causes expansion of the initial sill volume and results in an uplifted topography (dome) of ~102 m.",

            "abstract": "Two distinct eruptions occurred in 2014 at Sinabung and Kelud volcanoes in Indonesia. Lava dome-forming eruption started at Sinabung volcano, N Sumatra, in the end of 2013, which was preceded by the phreatic events since 2010 and shallow inflation with high seismicity since 3 months before eruption. The 2010 eruption was the first historic eruption, and the latest eruption geologically recorded occurred in the 9 to 10th Century. The eruption had continued in a nearly constant rate of magma effusion as of the summer of 2014. The lava complex extended on the SE slope (~2.5 km long from the source), frequently generating pyroclastic flows. The volume of erupted magma reached about 0.1 km3 in the 2014 summer. The lava is porphyritic andesite (SiO2 ~57%). The existence of mafic blobs in rocks and plagioclase microlites more calcic than the phenocryst rims, and the absence of breakdown rim on hornblende phenocrysts suggest magma mixing prior to eruption and relatively fast magma ascent. On the other hand, the Plinian eruption began at Kelud volcano, W Java on the evening of February 13, 2014, which had declined almost within about 6 hours. The eruption cloud rose to 18-25 km in altitude, and tephra deposited on extensive areas. The precursory seismic activity started two weeks before eruption and the intensity increased with time. This short but explosive eruption was one of recent large eruptions (VEI 4) at Kelud, which had repeated every ~20 years. A lava dome of 0.035 km3 was accidentally (?) formed within the crater in 2007-2008. The total volume of tephra of the 2014 eruption is 0.2-0.3 km3 in DRE. The magma is crystal-rich basaltic andesite (SiO2 ~56%; phenocryst proportion of ~60%). The petrological characteristics are close to the 2007-2008 dome lava except higher crystallinity in the latter. Mobilization of crystal-rich chamber magma probably was brought by intrusion of new magma. Thus, these recent examples in Indonesia are less-explosive and explosive eruptions, respectively. The eruption rates were 5 m3/s and 2~4x10^4 m3/s for Sinabung and Kelud, respectively. Although magma mixing may have occurred as the trigger of these eruptions in the both, the critical difference between the two is not the magnitude of eruption but the eruption rate (probably magma ascent speed) with the magma viscosity.",

            "abstract": "Mountains are a widespread terrestrial feature, covering from 12 to 24 percent of the world’s terrestrial surface, depending of the definition. Topographic relief is central to the definition of mountains, to the benefits and costs accruing to society and to the cascade of changes expected from climate change. Mountains capture and store water, particularly important in arid regions and in all areas for energy production. In temperate and boreal regions, mountains have a great range in population densities, from empty to urban, while tropical mountains are often densely settled and farmed. Mountain regions contain a wide range of habitats, important for biodiversity, and for primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy. Climate change interacts with this relief and consequent diversity. Elevation itself may accentuate warming (elevationi dependent warming) in some mountain regions. Even average warming starts complex chains of causality that reverberate through the diverse social ecological mountain systems affecting both the highlands and adjacent lowlands. A single feature of climate change such as higher snow lines affect the climate through albedo, the water cycle through changes in timing of release , water quality through the weathering of newly exposed material, geomorphology through enhanced erosion, plant communities through changes in climatic water balance, and animal and human communities through changes in habitat conditions and resource availabilities. Understanding these causal changes presents a particular interdisciplinary challenge to researchers, from assessing the existence and magnitude of elevation dependent warming and monitoring the full suite of changes within the social ecological system to climate change, to understanding how social ecological systems respond through individual and institutional behavior with repercussions on the long-term sustainability of these systems.",

            "abstract": "Deep drilling projects of active faults offer the opportunity to correlate physical and chemical processes identified in core samples with experiments reproducing the seismic cycle in the laboratory and with high‐resolution seismological and geophysical data.\nHere we discuss the constraints about earthquakes source processes at depth gained by fault cores retrieved from the deep drilling projects SAFOD (2.7 km depth, San Andreas Fault), J-FAST (0.9 km depth, following the Mw 9.0 Tohoku 2011 earthquake), TCDP (1.1 km depth, following the Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi 1999 earthquake) and WFSD (1.2 km depth, following the Mw 7.9 Wenchuan 2008 earthquake). Recovered samples were tested at room temperature with the rotary shear apparatus SHIVA installed in Rome (INGV, Italy). All the tested samples were made by clay-rich gouges (usually including smectite/illite), though their bulk mineralogy and modal composition were different (e.g., SAFOD samples included saponite, WFSD carbonaceous materials). The gouges were investigated before and after the experiments with scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-Ray diffraction, micro-Raman spectroscopy, etc.\nA common behavior of all the tested gouges was that their friction coefficient was low (often less than 0.1) under room-humidity and wet conditions when sheared at slip rates of ca. 1 m/s (seismic deformation conditions). Moreover, when the natural fault rocks next to the principal slipping zones were sheared from sub-seismic (few micrometers/s) to seismic slip rates, the experimental products had similar microstructures to those found in the principal slipping zones of the drilled faults. This included the formation of mirror-like surfaces, graphite-rich materials, foliated gouges, nanograins, amorphous materials, etc. In most cases the mechanical data were consistent with several seismological (> 50 m of seismic slip for the fault zone drilled by J-FAST) and geophysical observations (absence of a thermal anomaly in the fault cores of J-FAST and WFSD) which were attributed to an extremely low coseismic fault strength. However, the deformation mechanisms responsible for the measured weakening in the experiments and for the production of the microstructures similar to those found in drilled seismic faults have not been deciphered yet.",

            "abstract": "Decision makers express a strong need to shift the focus of climate projections from changes at global scale to changes at regional to local scale, from the end of the century to the coming decades, from changes multi-decadal mean temperatures to changes in extreme events. This new focus of climate projections implies an increasing contribution of internal variability to projection uncertainties. Understanding and quantifying the role of internal variability is vital to identify the limits of predictability – the irreducible uncertainty in multi-decadal projections – and the limits of model evaluation and bias correction.\nUsing different large initial condition ensembles, we demonstrate that models agree remarkably well on the forced signal of temperature and heavy precipitation extremes, the pattern of change in the absence of internal variability. The disagreement between individual model simulations on local to regional changes in extremes primarily arises from internal variability. Thus, in the coming 3-5 decades trends towards more intense hot and less intense cold extremes may be masked or even reversed in some places even if greenhouse-gas emissions rapidly increase. Likewise, despite a trend to more intense precipitation, opposite trends of multiple decades cannot be excluded over most land points. Despite large irreducible uncertainties at local scale, in an aggregated spatial probability perspective projections are again remarkably consistent already for the coming decades.\nWe argue that it is vital to specify whether model agreement or robustness refers to the forced signal or for individual realization. Likewise, the level of confidence in projections of extremes, often given in assessment reports, depends on whether a statement applies to a single realization of the future, or to the forced signal.\nOur findings demonstrate that within all the complexity of non-linear processes controlling temperature and heavy precipitation extremes, a remarkably simple first-order pattern emerges: as global temperatures increase, the forced hot extremes and heavy precipitation intensification is widespread over most of the land region and consistency across models for these changes is high in particular over Eurasia and North America.",

The DLN captures general information such as title, physical locations, responsible parties, high level issues, and correspondence. When the CDS/DMG processes a data set, IVEN is used to track the processing status while collecting sufficient information to ensure reproducibility.

            "abstract": "Soil organic matter (SOM) transformation rates generally increase with temperature, but whether this is realized depends on soil-specific features. To develop predictive models applicable to all soils, we must understand two key, ubiquitous features of SOM transformation: the temperature sensitivity of myriad enzyme-substrate combinations and temperature responses of microbial physiology and metabolism, in isolation from soil-specific conditions. Predicting temperature responses of production of CO2 vs. biomass is also difficult due to soil-specific features: we cannot know the identity of active microbes nor the substrates they employ. We highlight how recent empirical advances describing SOM decay can help develop theoretical tools relevant across diverse spatial and temporal scales.\nAt a molecular level, temperature effects on purified enzyme kinetics reveal distinct temperature sensitivities of decay of diverse SOM substrates. Such data help quantify the influence of microbial adaptations and edaphic conditions on decay, have permitted computation of the relative availability of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) liberated upon decay, and can be used with recent theoretical advances to predict changes in mass specific respiration rates as microbes maintain biomass C:N with changing temperature. Enhancing system complexity, we can subject microbes to temperature changes while controlling growth rate and without altering substrate availability or identity of the active population, permitting calculation of variables typically inferred in soils: microbial C use efficiency (CUE) and isotopic discrimination during C transformations. Quantified declines in CUE with rising temperature are critical for constraining model CUE estimates, and known changes in δ13C of respired CO2 with temperature is useful for interpreting δ13C-CO2 at diverse scales. We suggest empirical studies important for advancing knowledge of how microbes respond to temperature, and ideas for theoretical work to enhance the relevance of such work to the world’s soils.",

Here, a specific stochastic parameterization will be related to the theory of stochastic differential equations and shown to be affected strongly by the choice of stochastic calculus. From an NWP perspective our focus will be on ameliorating a common trait of the ensemble distributions of tropical cyclone (TC) tracks (or position), namely that they generally contain a bias and an underestimate of the variance. With this trait in mind we present a stochastic track variance inflation parameterization. This parameterization makes use of a properly constructed stochastic advection term that follows a TC and induces its position to undergo Brownian motion. A central characteristic of Brownian motion is that its variance increases with time, which allows for an effective inflation of an ensemble’s TC track variance. Using this stochastic parameterization we present a comparison of the behavior of TCs from the perspective of the stochastic calculi of Itô and Stratonovich within an operational NWP model. The central difference between these two perspectives as pertains to TCs is shown to be properly predicted by the stochastic calculus and the Itô correction. In the cases presented here these differences will manifest as overly intense TCs, which, depending on the strength of the forcing, could lead to problems with numerical stability and physical realism.",

The UVIS High Speed Photometer measures starlight in a bandpass centered at 0.15µm. At this short wavelength the diffraction angle for particles in Saturn’s main rings is small, and the signal from forward-scattered light can only be distinguished from the stellar signal when the star is observed to be outside, but very near to, a sharp ring edge. Observations of bright stars (with a high signal-to-noise ratio) show diffraction signals (photon counts above the unocculted stellar photon flux) extending up to ~20 km from the ring edges that define the Encke Gap, the Keeler Gap, and the outer edge of the A ring indicating the presence of millimeter-sized particles. We model the diffraction signal and compare the results with the observed signal in order to constrain the size distribution of the population of particles in Saturn’s A ring. We model the particle size distribution as a power-law distribution. The shape of the diffraction signal constrains the slope of the power-law and the size of the smallest particles. We find a decrease in the radii of the smallest particles and a steepening of the power-law size distribution in the outermost parts of the A ring. This finding suggests that more energetic interparticle collisions due to satellite perturbations in that region cause larger ring particles to shed smaller particles from their outer layers or otherwise fragment.",

Penetrating from the bow shock through the magnetosheath, they can locally distort the magnetopause upon impact, generating both magnetopause surface waves and/or inner-magnetospheric compressional waves. As such, the effects of the jets have been seen in the magnetosphere all the way to the ground.\nHere we review the recent progress in studying these jets that can couple bow shock and magnetopause dynamics. Large statistical datasets of in situ observations have revealed the HSJ occurrence rates and properties. Most importantly, HSJs are found more often downstream of the quasi-parallel shock, and thus occur on the dayside predominantly during intervals of quasi-radial interplanetary magnetic field. Combining the observational datasets with modeling and large scale kinetic simulations has made it possible to systematically address their formation. The main source of HSJs is not solar wind discontinuities. Instead, mounting evidence points to ripples on the bow shock itself, induced by large scale foreshock processes. Thanks to this joint effort we are moving towards comprehensive understanding of the formation, properties and dynamics of the jets as well as their effects.",

The experimental investigation of heterogeneous freezing of water droplets by carbonaceous particles reveals widespread ice freezing temperatures. The origin of the soot and its oxidation and aging modulate its ice nucleation ability, however, it is not known which structural and chemical characteristics of soot account for the variability in ice nucleation efficiency. We find that atomically flat carbon surfaces promote heterogeneous nucleation of ice, while molecularly rough surfaces with the same hydrophobicity do not. We investigate a large set of graphitic surfaces of various dimensions and radii of curvature consistent with those of soot in experiments, and find that variations in nanostructures alone could account for the spread in the freezing temperatures of ice on soot in experiments. A characterization of the nanostructure of soot is needed to predict its ice nucleation efficiency.\nAtmospheric oxidation and aging of soot modulates its ice nucleation ability. It has been suggested that an increase in the ice nucleation ability of aged soot results from an increase in the hydrophilicity of the surfaces upon oxidation. Oxidation, however, also impacts the nanostructure of soot, making it difficult to assess the separate effects of soot nanostructure and hydrophilicity in experiments. We investigate the effect of changes in hydrophilicity of model graphitic surfaces on the freezing temperature of ice. Our results indicate that the hydrophilicity of the surface is not in general a good predictor of ice nucleation ability. We find a correlation between the ability of a surface to promote nucleation of ice and the layering of liquid water at the surface. The results of this work suggest that ordering of liquid water in contact with the surface plays an important role in the heterogeneous ice nucleation mechanism.\n",

            "abstract": "Tropical biomass burning (BB) emissions are a major global source of particulate matter (PM). However, high temporal and spatial variability in the emissions lead to major challenges for their quantification and representation in models. Previous modelling studies have found a persistent underestimation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) observed in BB regions, requiring fire emissions of PM to be scaled by a factor of ~2-5 to match observations. Here we evaluate a global aerosol microphysics model (GLOMAP) against long-term in-situ observations of PM and black carbon in Amazonia and SE Asia, in addition to AOD, to better understand tropical BB aerosol and improve estimates of the impact of BB on air quality and climate.\nWe performed simulations with GLOMAP for the period 1997–2012 using three different BB emission inventories: GFED3, GFASv1.0 and FINNv1. We find that in N.E. Brazil the model with GFED emissions is unable to capture the magnitude and seasonal variability in observed PM (R2=0.3, bias = -44%), even when emissions are scaled up by a factor of 3.4 (R2=0.3, bias = -26%). This is likely due to an omission of small fires in the GFED3 emissions. Agreement between model and observations in this location is improved by using an active fire based emission inventory (e.g. FINN, R2=0.6, bias = -7%), which better captures emissions from small-scale agricultural fires.\nComparisons with all collected observations in SE Asia and Amazonia show that the model captures the inter-annual and seasonal cycles of monthly mean PM (mean R2 GFED, 0.6; GFAS, 0.7; FINN, 0.6) and AERONET AOD (mean R2 GFED, 0.6; GFAS, 0.7; FINN, 0.8) reasonably well. However, the model is generally negatively biased for both PM and AOD, the smallest bias being with the FINN emission inventory. By scaling FINN emissions up by 50% (much less than found from previous studies using only AOD), we find that we can adequately capture the magnitude of dry season PM across Amazonia and AOD in SE Asia. To capture the magnitude of AOD in Amazonia an additional scaling factor may need to be applied to FINN emissions injected above the surface. To evaluate the vertical profile of modelled BB aerosol we use aircraft observations from the SAMBBA field campaign. Overall, our results could have important implications for quantifying the air quality and climate effects of BB aerosol.",

I will review the relationship between AOD and PM2.5 at the surface. DISCOVER-AQ in Baltimore, the San Joaquin Valley, Houston and Denver revealed quite different conditions for determining this relationship. In each case, the surface reflectivity made determination of aerosol optical depth challenging, but upward looking columns of aerosol optical depth from sunphotometers provided confirmation of the AOD results from space. In Baltimore, AOD fields reflected PM2.5 concentrations well. In California, however, the low boundary layer heights and dominance of nitrate and organic aerosols made the AOD fields less predictive of PM2.5. In California and Colorado, hydration of the aerosol varied dramatically with aerosol type (especially smoke and dust) and revealed that without an understanding of the degree of aerosol hydration with aerosol composition, the relationship between AOD and PM2.5 will continue to be a challenge. Model predictions in the Baltimore-Washington study are relatively disappointing in helping define the needed physics between the optical and microphysical properties. An overview of the measurements from DISCOVER-AQ which will help define the needed information in a more general case in the future will be given.",

            "abstract": "Northern California’s Sierra Nevada and Shasta-Trinity mountains are key to the state’s water supply and can contribute to major floods in the Central Valley (CV). NOAA’s Hydrometeorology Testbed (HMT) program and the CalWater experiment have discovered much about how landfalling atmospheric rivers (AR) and Sierra Barrier Jets (SBJ) modulate orographic precipitation in that region. This presentation provides a review of recent findings, both from case-study and compositing perspectives. Wind-profiler and global-positioning-system (GPS) observations are used with soil moisture probes, stream gauges, and a regional reanalysis dataset. Key results include: Inland-directed ARs override a ~1-km-deep, Sierra-parallel SBJ located above the CV and the western slope of the Sierra. Above the developing SBJ, strengthening southwesterly flow marks the AR. The moistening SBJ reaches maximum intensity during the strongest AR flow aloft, at which time the core of the AR-parallel vapor transport slopes over the SBJ and intersects the Sierra. The SBJ then weakens with the initial cold-frontal passage aloft. A statistical analysis of orographic forcing reveals that both the AR and SBJ are crucial in determining the distribution of precipitation in the northern Sierra and Shasta-Trinity regions due to orographic precipitation enhancement. An open question remains regarding the transport of water vapor near the northern end of the CV. Namely, a portion of the AR-modulated SBJ flow may be transported through a prominent gap in the terrain between Mt. Lassen and Mt. Shasta, near the town of Burney. Recent analyses indicate that this gap allows AR water vapor to penetrate into the western interior (e.g., to Idaho) and thus contribute to heavy precipitation events far inland. The CalWater-2 program of field campaigns has identified diagnosis of the transport through this gap and its impact on northern California precipitation as a priority for future data collection and analysis.",

            "abstract": "\"All water is local.\" For geoscientist researchers and educators, this simple statement underlies potentially powerful ways to engage students around hydrologic and engineering concepts. Education research has given us strong insight into how students learn. Place-based education gives students a personal and geographical context to connect concepts and processes to their everyday lives. Data-driven exercises build inquiry and critical thinking skills. With the ubiquity of water, the critical roles it plays in earth systems, and its influence on ecosystems, climate, geologic processes, economies, and human health, integrating water data and place-based exercises into the classroom is an excellent opportunity to enhance student learning and stimulate interest in the geosciences.\nTHE CUAHSI Water Data Center (WDC), established in 2013, is the culmination of a decade of work to adapt modern web services technology to work on time-series data (such as a gage record or water-quality series), the most common water data type. It provides unprecedented consolidated access to water quantity and quality data across the US (and increasingly across the world). This allows educators to craft learning exercises around key concepts and locations, from rote problem sets to more exploratory investigations. The web services technology used address key limitations - such as difficulty in discovering data, co-locating data, and download options and access- that have been identified as barriers to integrating real data in classroom exercises. This presentation discusses key aspects of the system, provides example exercises, and discusses how we seek to engage the community to effectively chart a path forward for further development of both the technological and education resources.",

The rates at which these processes proceed in a particular cloud element depend on environmental conditions including turbulent air motions and boundary layer properties and the aerosol background. The processes occurring in a particular cloud element do not occur in isolation from other cloud elements both current and previous. Diagnosing the precipitation process rates from remote sensing data require, at a minimum, some simultaneous information on the properties of the cloud droplet and precipitation droplet modes. The remote sensors on the A-Train provide the most comprehensive global measurements of warm marine cumulus. We wish to address in this paper whether and under what conditions sufficient simultaneous information is present in the A-Train measurements to diagnose the precipitation processes of auto conversion and accretion. In particular we will attempt to combine radar reflectivity measured by cloudsat, microwave brightness temperature derived from cloudsat data, and two MODIS reflectance channels. The information content in the combined data will be considered using Bayesian optimal estimation techniques, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms.",

In recent years the role of atmospheric rivers (ARs), narrow regions of intense water vapor transport in the lower troposphere, in mid-latitude flooding has been highlighted. The aim of this study is to (1) show the connection between ARs and extreme European precipitation and floods, and (2) discuss future changes to ARs under projected climate change.\nThe research presented uses satellite and atmospheric reanalysis data, daily observed precipitation and river flows, and climate change projections from five models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive. The results presented will show the strong link between ARs and heavy precipitation and floods in Europe, and will highlight how ARs are projected to change in the future. In particular the five CMIP5 models assessed show an approximate doubling of winter ARs affecting the UK in the period 2073-2099 compared to 1979-2005; this is likely to result in an increased risk of flooding in the future. Finally, an assessment of the predictability of an AR-type diagnostic using output from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction system will be covered.",

This revolution in weather forecasting reflects increases in computer power, improvements in the assimilation of observations, especially satellite data, improvements in model physics, improvements in observations and international cooperation and competition. One important component has been and is the diagnosis, evaluation and reduction of systematic errors. The effect of proposed improvements in the GFS on systematic errors is one component of the thorough testing of such improvements by the Global Climate and Weather Modeling Branch. Examples of reductions in systematic errors in zonal mean temperatures and winds and other fields will be presented.\nOne challenge in evaluating systematic errors is uncertainty in what reality is. Model initial states can be regarded as the best overall depiction of the atmosphere, but can be misleading in areas of few observations or for fields not well observed such as humidity or precipitation over the oceans. Verification of model physics is particularly difficult. The Environmental Modeling Center emphasizes the evaluation of systematic biases against observations.\nRecently EMC has placed greater emphasis on synoptic evaluation and on precipitation, 2-meter temperatures and dew points and 10 meter winds. A weekly EMC map discussion reviews the performance of many models over the United States and has helped diagnose and alleviate significant systematic errors in the GFS, including a near surface summertime evening cold wet bias over the eastern US and a multi-week period when the GFS persistently developed bogus tropical storms off Central America. The GFS exhibits a wet bias for light rain and a dry bias for moderate to heavy rain over the continental United States.\nSignificant changes to the GFS are scheduled to be implemented in the fall of 2014. These include higher resolution, improved physics and improvements to the assimilation. These changes significantly improve the tropospheric flow and reduce a tropical upper tropospheric warm bias. One important error remaining is the failure of the GFS to maintain deep convection over Indonesia and in the tropical west Pacific. This and other current systematic errors will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The Paleoproterozoic Trans-Hudson Orogeny (THO) was a Himalayan-style collision that marked an important stage of assembly of the Canadian Shield. Today, the THO is largely concealed beneath the Hudson Bay intracratonic basin. Regional seismic tomography shows a thick, high-wavespeed cratonic keel beneath the region, but also includes significant local heterogeneity that may be associated with the imprint of the THO, providing clues to Precambrian plate-tectonic processes.\nIn this study, we use multi-observable probabilistic inversions to investigate the thermal and compositional state of the Hudson Bay lithosphere, to explain the seismic wavespeed variations and to constrain in more detail potential signatures of the oldest cratonic cores and the THO collision. Rayleigh wave dispersion curves, surface heatflow, geoid anomalies and topography are jointly inverted to give a pseudo-3D model of the upper mantle beneath the region.\nLow temperatures are pervasive across the region, leading to a thick thermal lithosphere whose base lies at depths of 250 km or greater. The data are best explained by stratification of the lithosphere into (at least) two layers, with the top layer extremely depleted and the bottom layer generally more fertile, though still depleted with respect to the sublithospheric mantle. Across the Bay and Hudson Strait, a narrow zone of lowered depletion is observed in the top layer. The position of this anomaly coincides geographically with the THO and with the wavespeed reduction noted in previous seismic studies. It is likely that this feature represents juvenile material trapped between the cratonic cores in the final stages of the THO.\nWe also find evidence for anomalous mid-lithospheric compositions in certain areas, notably west of Hudson Bay. Additionally, some of the long-period surface wave data requires lower than average seismic wavespeeds below the lithosphere, suggesting localised regions of higher temperature/attenuation in the upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable for surface water and energy budget calculations that can be obtained globally and operationally from satellite observations. LST is used for many applications, including weather forecasting, short-term climate prediction, extreme weather monitoring, and irrigation and water resource management. In order to maximize the usefulness of LST for research and studies it is necessary to know the uncertainty in the LST measurement. Multiple validation methods and activities are necessary to assess LST compliance with the quality specifications of operational users.\nThis work presents four different validation methods that have been widely used to determine the uncertainties in LST products derived from satellite measurements. 1) The temperature based validation method involves comparisons with ground-based measurements of LST. The method is strongly limited by the number and quality of available field stations. 2) Scene-based comparisons involve comparing a new satellite LST product with a heritage LST product. This method is not an absolute validation and satellite LST inter-comparisons alone do not provide an independent validation measurement. 3) The radiance-based validation method does not require ground-based measurements and is usually used for large scale validation effort or for LST products with coarser spatial resolution (> 1km). 4) Time series comparisons are used to detect problems that can occur during the instrument’s life, e.g. calibration drift, or unrealistic outliers due to cloud coverage. This study enumerates the sources of errors associated with each method. The four different approaches are complementary and provide different levels of information about the quality of the retrieved LST. The challenges in retrieving the LST from satellite measurements are discussed using results obtained for MODIS and VIIRS.\nThis work contributes to the objective of the Land Product Validation (LPV) sub-group of the CEOS Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV) that aims to address the challenges associated with the validation of global land products. It is also part of the EarthTemp initiative which main goal is to develop more integrated, collaborative approaches to observing and understanding Earth’s surface temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Parameter estimation–inferring parameter information through history matching and inverse methods–is often the only tenable way to populate properties in a large-scale regional model. In a Bayesian sense, the properties estimated in this way, and later used to make predictions, are conditional upon the data used to calibrate the model and all the assumptions made in the underlying model. This can result in a disconnect between parameters estimated at the laboratory, aquifer-test, and model scales. Additionally, more types of data–each with a different support volumes and level of information–are becoming available with more near-surface geophysical measurements being made on a regional scale. To take advantage of these data, a combination of flexible parameterization through distributed parameters, regularization, and weighting of various observation types can lead to defensible and useful results.\nThe USGS Groundwater Resources Program uses regional models and data assimilation to analyze and predict water availability in major regional aquifer systems in the United States. The inverse modeling process applied in several of these projects provides valuable lessons on the meaning of parameters at the large scale. Inverse modeling is used to estimate model parameters but—more importantly—to improve understanding of the conceptual framework the models are built on.",

            "abstract": "Recent megathrust earthquakes illustrated both their disastrous human and economic impact and our limited physical understanding of their spatial and temporal occurrence. To improve long-term seismic hazard assessment by overcoming the restricted direct observations in both time and space, we developed the new numerical seismo-thermo-mechanical (STM) model presented here.\nThis 2D continuum-mechanics based, viscoelastoplastic model uses an Eulerian-Lagrangian finite difference framework with similar on- and off-fault physics. This typically long-term geodynamic approach is extended to study short-term seismogenesis through a local invariant implementation of strongly slip rate-dependent friction. This approach may help to shed light onto the interaction between long-term subduction dynamics and deformation and associated short-term seismicity. Additional advantages of this STM approach include the physically consistent emergence of rupture paths, both on- and off-megathrust, and the inclusion of three key ingredients for seismic cycling --rate-dependent friction, slow tectonic loading, and visco-elastic relaxation--.\nThe validation of this approach is accomplished through a comparison with an analogue seismic cycle model (van Dinther et al., JGR, 2013a). The applicability, potential, and limitations were further illustrated in a more realistic geometry and physical setup of the Southern Chilean margin (van Dinther et al., JGR, 2013b). Extending these rapid transient slip cycles over time-scales of tens of thousands of years showed that ~5% of cyclic deformation is not recovered and is instead stored as permanent, anelastic deformation within the wedge. Analyzing off-megathrust events specifically showed they influence the megathrust cycle distinctly, while, especially steeply dipping outerrise events, also also increase the tsunami hazard significantly (van Dinther et al., GRL, 2014).\nThe innovative character of this seismo-thermo-mechanical approach opens a world of interdisciplinary research between geodynamics and seismology. To illustrate this approaches perspectives we will give examples illustrating the role of downdip seismogenic zone width for super cycles and the role of a weak viscous lower crust for surface displacements and a secondary zone of uplift.",

            "abstract": "In the United States, a dedicated system of snow measurement stations and snowpack modeling products are available to estimate the snow covered area (SCA) and snow water equivalent (SWE) throughout the winter season. In other regions of the world that depend on snowmelt for water resources, snow data can be scarce, and these regions are vulnerable to drought or flood conditions. Even in the U.S., water resource management is hampered by limited snow observations in certain regions, as evident by the recent Midwest flooding events due in large part to the significant Plains snowpack. This study evaluates the use of satellite data to provide important snow information in water resource applications relative to modeled SNODAS spatially distributed estimates. Results show that the SNODAS product contains greater uncertainty in regions with limited observations or that experience wind redistribution of snow. Here we present a focused evaluation of HUC8 watersheds throughout the United States where AMSR-E and SSM/I satellites show the most promise compared to the SNODAS product, by HUC8 watersheds. These SWE observations are paired with a new relatively cloud-free SCA product based on 16 days of MODIS imagery that provide reliable indicators of ground conditions on any given day. Combined, these products can provide reliable snow data in under-sampled regions for use in water resource modeling. We found that lack of observations in the Central Plains region negatively impacts the modeling results both on magnitude and timing of SWE, and passive microwave data has potential for providing an accurate source of SWE data in this region.",

            "abstract": "The ocean and the atmosphere, and hence the climate, are governed by multi-scale interactions between turbulent eddies and waves. Turbulence in the presence of such waves proves to be richer and more complex than for homogeneous isotropic (HIT) flows, both for fluids and in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD). Several examples will be reviewed in this talk and some cases will be illustrated with concepts using phenomenology, and with results stemming from recent high-resolution direct numerical simulations using the Navier-Stokes or Boussinesq equations. The role of anisotropy will be emphasized, and the context is that of geophysical or astrophysical fluid dynamics.\nFor example, turbulence has been shown to display strong intermittency, with fat wings in the probability distribution function (PDF) of the vertical velocity for stratified flows, when for HIT the PDFs of the velocity are Gaussian. This takes place in the so-called saturated regime where a balance between nonlinearities and waves occur. These localized patches of turbulence lead to enhanced mixing in the atmosphere and the ocean, and such a bursty behavior has also been observed in the planetary boundary layer and in the stratosphere.\nFurthermore, helicity (velocity-vorticity correlation), which is an ideal invariant in HIT, can be generated in rotating stratified flows in which it can lead to the creation of large-scale magnetic fields. Helicity is also used as an indicator of hurricane activity, and it develops at river confluences, inducing mixing and erosion.\nFinally, turbulence allows for an inverse cascade of energy to large scales, and a direct cascade to small scales, either of enstrophy in quasi-two-dimensional fluids, or of helicity in three dimensions, because of the anisotropy which is imposed by the boundaries or due to external agents. It has also been shown to lead to a dual transfer of energy to both large and small scales, each with a constant flux, e.g. for rotating stratified flows, reinforcing large-scale geostrophic balance and small-scale transport and dissipation. This dual cascade, which is also observed in MHD, can be justified on the basis of statistical mechanics of simplified truncated systems and thus it can be seen as corresponding to a broad class of nonlinear phenomena.",

            "abstract": "The McMurdo Dry Valleys magmatic system, Antarctica, forms part of the Ferrar dolerite Large Igneous Province. Comprising a vertical stack of interconnected sills, the complex provides a world-class example of pervasive lateral magma flow on a continental scale. The lowermost intrusion (Basement Sill) offers detailed sections through the now frozen particle macrostructure of a congested magma slurry1. Image-based numerical modelling where the intrusion geometry defines its own unique finite element mesh allows simulations of the flow regime to be made that incorporate realistic magma particle size and flow geometries obtained directly from field measurements. One testable outcome relates to the origin of rhythmic layering where analytical results imply the sheared suspension intersects the phase space for particle Reynolds and Peclet number flow characteristic of macroscopic structures formation2. Another relates to potentially novel crystal-liquid segregation due to the formation of eddies locally at undulating contacts at the floor and roof of the intrusion. The eddies are transient and mechanical in origin, unrelated to well-known fluid dynamical effects around obstacles where flow is turbulent. Numerical particle tracing reveals that these low Re number eddies can both trap (remove) and eject particles back into the magma at a later time according to their mass density. This trapping mechanism has potential to develop local variations in structure (layering) and magma chemistry that may otherwise not occur where the contact between magma and country rock is linear. Simulations indicate that eddy formation is best developed where magma viscosity is in the range 1-102 Pa s. Higher viscosities (> 103 Pa s) tend to dampen the effect implying eddy development is most likely a transient feature. However, it is nice to think that something as simple as a bumpy contact could impart physical and by implication chemical diversity in igneous rocks.\n1Marsh, D.B.

            "abstract": "The verified full carbon assessment of Russian forests (FCA) is based on an Integrated Land Information System (ILIS) that includes a multi-layer and multi-scale GIS with basic resolution of 1 km and corresponding attributive databases. The ILIS aggregates all available information about ecosystems and landscapes, sets of empirical and semi-empirical data and aggregations, data of different inventories and surveys, and multi-sensor remote sensing data. The ILIS serves as an information base for application of the landscape-ecosystem approach (LEA) of the FCA and as a systems design for comparison and mutual constraints with other methods of study of carbon cycling of forest ecosystems (eddy covariance; process models; inverse modeling; and multi-sensor application of remote sensing). The LEA is based on a complimentary use of the flux-based method with some elements of the pool-based method. Introduction of climatic parameters of individual years in the LEA, as well as some process-based elements, allows providing a substantial decrease of the uncertainties of carbon cycling yearly indicators of forest ecosystems. Major carbon pools (live biomass, coarse woody debris, soil organic carbon) are estimated based on data on areas, distribution and major biometric characteristics of Russian forests presented in form of the ILIS for the country. The major fluxes accounted for include Net Primary Production (NPP), Soil Heterotrophic Respiration (SHR), as well as fluxes caused by decomposition of Coarse Woody Debris (CWD), harvest and use of forest products, fluxes caused by natural disturbances (fire, insect outbreaks, impacts of unfavorable environment) and lateral fluxes to hydrosphere and lithosphere. Use of landscape-ecosystem approach resulted in the NECB at 573±140 Tg C yr-1 (CI 0.9). While the total carbon sink is high, large forest areas, particularly on permafrost, serve as a carbon source. The ratio between net primary production and soil heterotrophic respiration, together with natural and human-induced disturbances are major drivers of the magnitude and spatial distribution of the NECB of forest ecosystems. We also present comparison to the recent top-down estimates of the Siberian carbon sink.",

            "abstract": "Emulation methods typically capture patterns of regional mean climate change predicted by a general circulation model (GCM), but impacts assessments depend on changes in variability in addition to changes in mean climate. GCMs do predict future changes in variability, but do not reproduce the means or variability of observed climate. Our work addresses the ensuing need for climate simulations that combine observational data with GCM projections of changes in mean and variability. This work is part of a developing framework for simulating future climates, which includes statistical methods described in Castruccio et al. (2014) for mean emulation of GCMs. Leeds et al. (2014) additionally introduced a spectral-based methodology for modifying existing temperature observations based on GCM projections of changes in means and variability in future equilibrium climates. Here, we extend the methodology in Leeds et al. (2014) to account for GCM projections of transient climates. Other existing methodology can account for changes in mean climate (the “Delta method”) or model-observation discrepancy in marginal probability distributions (quantile-based methods), but a key advantage of the methodology proposed here is that it accounts for changes in temporal dependence, and therefore in different changes in variability at distinct timescales. Our methodology can be combined with emulation to study changes in unmodeled forcing scenarios and impacts under these scenarios, assuming that the changes in covariance structure can be described by a simple function of the forcing scenario. We illustrate our methodology with runs from the NCAR CCSM3 model, comparing daily temperatures under continuously increasing CO2 forcing scenarios with temperatures from a run forced at preindustrial conditions. In most regions, temperature’s overall temporal variability decreases as temperature increases, and furthermore, its temporal dependence structure changes in time.",

            "abstract": "Recent changes to climate and the fire regime have resulted in a number of distinct changes to patterns of post-fire succession in the boreal forest region of western North America. In interior Alaska and Yukon, these responses include a shift from spruce to deciduous dominated forests in black spruce forests that experienced exposure of mineral soils from deep burning of surface organic soils, as well as low seedling recruitment in white spruce forests as a result of moisture stress. In this presentation, we will use a physical geography framework to analyze factors controlling low seedling recruitment in recently burned black spruce forests in Alaska. This approach allows for understanding how changes in the biologic components of black spruce forest ecosystems (e.g., biogeography) are controlled by factors related to geomorphology and climate over multiple spatial and temporal scales. In particular, this framework will be used to examine how the interactions between fire, climate, topography and soil texture influence pre-fire and post-fire permafrost conditions, which interact to have a strong influence on variations in soil moisture. In turn, recent changes to climate combined with variations in soil moisture controlled by differences in permafrost conditions (ground ice content, active layer thickness) can be used to explain variations in post-fire seedling recruitment in black spruce forests, where low recruitment is occurring on the sites with the driest soils. In addition, we will examine the need for further research in other boreal forest regions of western North America where the presence of pine species (jack and lodgepole) that are absent in Alaska, as well as differences in soils and permafrost conditions, are likely resulting in additional patterns of post-fire succession as a result of recent changes to climate and the fire regime.",

            "abstract": "The use of Global Ionosphere-Thermospheres Models to investigate the physics of the upper atmosphere is increasing. These models can provide a large-scale view of the system, and can provide time-varying 3D fields describing all state variables of the system, such as composition, winds and temperatures of both the neutrals and ions, as well as diagnostics such as forces and energies. Simultaneous access to all these fields allows far more complete characterization of postulated physical processes than is possible when limited solely to the quantities that can be observed. The problem with global models, though, is that the behavior of the model may not actually represent reality in all circumstances. In order to understand when and where this may occur, it is crucial that models be validated against a wide variety of spatially separated data. Ten years ago, the only spatially resolved observational data available for model validation came from satellites. However, for local measurements made from low orbit, it is often difficult to separate spatial variations from temporal changes. Now, with more networked ground-stations available, it is becoming more easy to validate models across regions or even across the globe. In this presentation, examples are shown of model comparisons with networked instruments, highlighting the power of these configurations. In addition, it is shown that the models can be used to help determine possible biases in data, given large numbers of stations.",

However, individual model runs often contain large realization-dependent internal variaiblity that can overshadow greenhouse gas (GHG)-induced climate change on decadal and regional scales. Thus, the use of such forcing data may produce misleading results. We propose a new approach to construct representative forcing data from the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble of simulations for downscaling GHG-forced future climate change. The idea is to use the multi-model ensemble mean to smooth out internal variaiblity in the mean state of the foricng data, while keeping the daily variability realistic as it is derived from one selected mode run. Using the WRF-based 4km resolution downscaling of future climate change over the contiguous U.S. as an example, we will discuss the various issues involved in this approach.",

With increasing mass discharge rate ordinary explosive activity (103 kg/s) is repeating every ~ few minutes ejecting hot lava fragments at ~200 m height whereas larger (Mayor) explosions are occurring every year with a mass eruptive rate of 105 kg/s driving progressively higher eruptive clouds at ~500 m above the vent.\nAt the other end of the activity, the paroxysms have a mass discharge rate of 107 kg/s, driving the eruptive column up to few km above the crater and repeating at a rate of one event every ~10 years.

            "abstract": "Volcanic passive margins (VPMs) are distinctive features of Larges Igneous Provinces. They characterize continental breakup associated with the extrusion and intrusion of large volumes of magma, predominantly mafic. In Large Igneous Provinces, regional fissural volcanism predates localized syn-magmatic break-up of the lithosphere, suggesting that mantle melting is a cause of continental break-up, not a consequence. Early melt covers as volcanic traps large cratonic or/and cratonic-edge continental areas. Crustal dilatation through dyking in the upper crust and magma underplating at Moho level is thought to occur massively during this early stage. Lithosphere extension leading to break-up and VPMs development is coeval with a 3D focusing of mantle melting, giving rise to VPMs.\nFrom a combination of deep seismic reflection profiles and onshore observations, we show that the mechanism of continental breakup at volcanic passive margins is very different from the one generally proposed for non-magmatic systems. Crustal extension and coeval extrusion of thick wedges of seaward-dipping basalts are accommodated by continentward-dipping detachment-faults at both conjugate margins. Those faults root on a deformed ductile crust whose composition seems partly magmatic.\nOur numerical modeling show that hardening of deep continental crust during the early magmatic stages provokes a divergent flow of the ductile lithosphere (mantle and lower crust) away from a central continental block which thins through advection with time. Magma-assisted crustal-scale faults dipping continentward root over this flowing material, isolating micro-continents which may be lost in the future oceanic domain.\nThe structure and tectonic evolution of volcanic passive margins cannot therefore be compared to non-volcanic ones, where major detachment faults dip oceanward during the necking-stage and where mantle is finally exhumed during the mechanical breakup. Confusions may exist where ancient hyper-extended rift systems parallel VPMs. In such cases, VPMs develop within a continental lithosphere made harder by previous crust thinning and lithosphere thermal relaxation.",

            "abstract": "Energetic particle injections are critical for supplying particles and energy to the inner magnetosphere. Recent case studies have demonstrated a good correlation between injection signatures (sudden increase in energy flux of 10s-100s keV particles) and transient, narrow, fast flow channels and dipolarization fronts in the magnetotail, but statistical observations outside of geosynchronous orbit (GEO) to verify the findings were lacking. By surveying trans-geosynchronous injections using THEMIS, we show that the earthward-traveling dipolarizing flux bundles (DFBs) generated by reconnection are the likely source of particle acceleration and transport resulting in injection signatures throughout the tail. Like near-Earth reconnection, both ion and electron injections are most probable in the pre-midnight sector. Similar to bursty bulk flows (BBFs), flow speeds observed with injection signatures are faster with increasing distance from Earth. Also similar to BBFs, injection occurrence rate increases with increased geomagnetic activity. With increased activity, spectral hardening occurs, implying the increased number of injections is heating the plasma sheet. The injection occurrence rate increase within the inner magnetosphere suggests that injections populate the radiation belts more effectively under enhanced activity. Our results are inconsistent with the classical concept of an azimuthally wide “injection boundary” moving earthward from ~9-12 RE to GEO under an enhanced cross-tail electric field. Rather, particle acceleration and transport occur along a large range of radial distances due to effects from earthward-penetrating, azimuthally localized, transient, strong electric fields of recently reconnected, dipolarizing flux bundles. Thus, the statistical superposition of individual DFBs is an explanation of the classical “injection boundary”.",

            "abstract": "Snow plays a dominant role in Antarctic sea ice mass balance and its seasonal evolution. It is a primary control on sea ice thickness and the structure of sea ice ecosystems, it dominates the uncertainty in satellite estimates of ice thickness, and it may significantly modulate the response of sea ice to climate change and variability. Here, we provide an overview of recent surveys of snow distribution (both small and large scale), its temporal evolution, and its connection with the processes that drive it – precipitation, accumulation, blowing snow events, flooding, and the role of ice deformation. We present recent 3-D in situ floe-scale measurements of snow surface topography, snow depth, and ice thickness distribution that allow relationships between surface roughness features, snow accumulation, and ice thickness to be examined in unprecedented detail. These data are compared with estimates of snow depth from the NASA IceBridge radar from spring surveys in the Weddell and Amundsen/Bellingshausen Seas. Both airborne and in situ measurements suggest a significant extent of thick ice with a deep snow cover that is underrepresented in prior surveys. Finally, the seasonal evolution of precipitation, snow depth, and accumulation is examined with data from drifting buoy platforms deployed in several regions of the Antarctic. These observations show that precipitation is not necessarily a good estimator for snow accumulation and that treatment of blowing snow must be included for sea ice models to accurately simulate Antarctic snow and sea ice mass balance. The implications of these results for modeling and satellite measurement of the sea ice thickness distribution are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Hydrology as a science has evolved over the last century. The knowledge base has significantly expanded, and there are requirements to meet with the new expectations of a science where the connections between the parts are just as important as the parts themselves. In this new environment, what should we teach, and how should we teach it? Given the limited time we have in an undergraduate (and even graduate) curriculum, what should we include, and what should we leave out? What new material and new methods are essential, as compared to textbooks? Past practices have assumed certain basics as being essential to undergraduate teaching. Depending on the professor's background, these include basic process descriptions (infiltration, runoff generation, evaporation etc.) and basic techniques (unit hydrographs, flood frequency analysis, pumping tests). These are taught using idealized (textbook) examples and examined to test this basic competence. The main idea behind this \"reductionist\" approach to teaching is that the students will do the rest of the learning during practice and apprenticeship in their workplaces. Much of current hydrology teaching follows this paradigm, and the books provide the backdrop to this approach. Our view is that this approach is less than optimum, as it does not prepare the students to face up to the new challenges of the changing world. It is our view that the basics of hydrologic science are not just a collection of individual processes and techniques, but process interactions and underlying concepts or principles, and a collection of techniques that highlights these, combined with student-driven and data-based learning that enables the students to see the manifestations of these process interactions and principles in action in real world situations. While the actual number of items that can be taught in the classroom by this approach in a limited period of time may be lower than in the traditional approach, it will help the students make connections between the understanding gained in this way in solving real world problems. We will illustrate the feasibility of the approach through key examples from our own teaching.",

            "abstract": "The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is one of the most important metrics of climate change. As such, constraining the uncertainties of its magnitude, and the magnitude of its transient counterpart (TCR), is one of the primary goals of global climate science. General circulations models (GCMs) from modelling centres around the world have consistently failed to produce a model with a sensitivity of less than 2 degrees. However, as the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble is an ensemble of opportunity, it is unclear whether this fact is sufficient to rule out climate sensitivity of less than 2 degrees, or is the ensemble simply not diverse enough to sample low values of climate sensitivity? We present analysis based on the observed planetary energy budget and simple energy-balance models. When view in terms of the TCR:ECS ratio (RWF- the Realised Warming Fraction), we find a region of climate response space of low RWF and low TCR that is robust to the structure of the simple climate model and isn't sampled by the CMIP5 ensemble. We show that this region is better sampled by a perturbed physics ensemble of the HadCM3 GCM constrained solely on top of atmosphere radiative fluxes than the CMIP5 ensemble, raising the question of the physical plausibility of low climate sensitivity GCMs. Based on our results above, we have set out to systematically probe the ability to create GCMs with low climate sensitivity in the HadCM3 GCM. We train a statistical emulator on our perturbed physics ensemble and use it to identify regions of HadCM3 parameter space that are consistent with both a low climate sensitivity and a low RWF. We then run this “low sensitivity” ensemble to test our predictions and understand the combination of feedbacks needed to produce a sensible GCM with a sensitivity of less than 2 degrees. Here we hope to demonstrate our results from this systematic probing of the low climate sensitivity uncertainty bound and add further understanding to the physical plausibility of low climate sensitivity as simulated in GCMs.",

Both reduction and oxidation of Fe are microbially catalyzed, and available evidence suggests that microbial Fe redox metabolism takes place across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales natural systems. The coupling of microbial Fe reduction and oxidation has been proposed in various situations where a redox transition zone is observed. This talk will review and synthesize several case studies of the potential for Fe redox cycling in circumneutral pH subsurface environments. Of specific interest are novel pathways and organisms involved in the oxidation of insoluble reduced Fe phases with oxygen or nitrate, and the coupling of Fe oxidation and reduction in field and experimental systems that model potential redox gradients and fluctuations in the subsurface. Recent cultivation studies and physiological experiments indicate that a variety of Proteobacteria are capable of oxidizing Fe-silicate and other insoluble Fe(II)-bearing minerals. These findings set the stage for rapid expansion in our knowledge of the range of extracellular electron transfer mechanisms utilized by subsurface microorganisms. The observation that closely coupled oxidation and reduction of Fe can take place under conditions common to the subsurface motivates this expansion in pursuit of molecular tools for dissecting in situ Fe redox cycling communities.",

            "abstract": "The NCAR-DOE spectral element (SE) dynamical core comes from the HOMME (High-Order Modeling Environment; Dennis et al., 2012) and it is available in CAM. The CAM-SE dynamical core is designed with intrinsic mimetic properties guaranteeing total energy conservation (to time-truncation errors) and mass-conservation, and has demonstrated excellent scalability on massively parallel compute platforms (Taylor, 2011).\nFor applications involving many tracers such as chemistry and biochemistry modeling, CAM-SE has been found to be significantly more computationally costly than the current “workhorse” model CAM-FV (Finite-Volume; Lin 2004). Hence a multi-tracer efficient scheme, called the CSLAM (Conservative Semi-Lagrangian Multi-tracer; Lauritzen et al., 2011) scheme, has been implemented in the HOMME (Erath et al., 2012). The CSLAM scheme has recently been cast in flux-form in HOMME so that it can be coupled to the SE dynamical core through conventional flux-coupling methods where the SE dynamical core provides background air mass fluxes to CSLAM. Since the CSLAM scheme makes use of a finite-volume gnomonic cubed-sphere grid and hence does not operate on the SE quadrature grid, the capability of running tracer advection, the physical parameterization suite and dynamics on separate grids has been implemented in CAM-SE. The default CAM-SE-CSLAM setup is to run physics on the quasi-equal area CSLAM grid. The capability of running physics on a different grid than the SE dynamical core may provide a more consistent coupling since the physics grid option operates with quasi-equal-area cell average values rather than non-equi-distant grid-point (SE quadrature point) values. Preliminary results on the performance of CAM-SE-CSLAM will be presented.",

            "abstract": "We seek a paradigm shift in the approach we take on volcano monitoring where the compromise from high fidelity to large numbers of sensors is used to increase coverage and resolution. Accessibility, danger and the risk of equipment loss requires that we develop systems that are independent and inexpensive. Furthermore, rather than simply record data on hard disk for later analysis we desire a system that will work autonomously, capitalizing on wireless technology and in field network analysis. To this end we are currently producing a low cost seismic array which will incorporate, at the very basic level, seismological tools for first cut analysis of a volcano in crises mode. At the advanced end we expect to perform tomographic inversions in the network in near real time. Geophone (4 Hz) sensors connected to a low cost recording system will be installed on an active volcano where triggering earthquake location and velocity analysis will take place independent of human interaction. Stations are designed to be inexpensive and possibly disposable. In one of the first implementations the seismic nodes consist of an Arduino Due processor board with an attached Seismic Shield. The Arduino Due processor board contains an Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU. This 32 bit 84 MHz processor can filter and perform coarse seismic event detection on a 1600 sample signal in fewer than 200 milliseconds. The Seismic Shield contains a GPS module, 900 MHz high power mesh network radio, SD card, seismic amplifier, and 24 bit ADC. External sensors can be attached to either this 24-bit ADC or to the internal multichannel 12 bit ADC contained on the Arduino Due processor board. This allows the node to support attachment of multiple sensors. By utilizing a high-speed 32 bit processor complex signal processing tasks can be performed simultaneously on multiple sensors. Using a 10 W solar panel, second system being developed can run autonomously and collect data on 3 channels at 100Hz for 6 months with the installed 16Gb SD card. Initial designs and test results will be presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Emergent features of landscape-climate coevolution are evaluated on the basis of the sensitivity of floods to annual precipitation in space and time. For that purpose, a spatiotemporal sensitivity analysis is performed at regional scale using data from 804 catchments in Austria from 1976 to 2008. Results show that flood peaks are more responsive to spatial (regional) than to temporal (decadal) variability. Space-wise a 10% increase in precipitation leads to a 23% increase in flood peaks in Austria, whereas timewise a 10% increase in precipitation leads to an increase of just 6% in flood peaks. Catchments from dry lowlands and high wetlands exhibit similarity between the spatial and temporal sensitivities (spatiotemporal symmetry) and low landscape-climate codependence. This suggests that such regions are not coevolving significantly. However, intermediate regions show differences between those sensitivities (symmetry breaks) and higher landscape-climate codependence, suggesting undergoing coevolution. The break of symmetry is considered an emergent behavior of the coupled system. A new coevolution index is then proposed relating spatiotemporal symmetry with relative characteristic celerities. The descriptive assessment of coevolution is complemented by a simple nonlinear dynamical model of landscape-climate coevolution, in which landform evolution processes take place at the millennial scale (slow dynamics), and climate adjusts in years to decades (fast dynamics). Coevolution is expressed by the interplay between slow and fast dynamics, represented, respectively, by spatial and temporal characteristics. The model captures key features of the joint landscape-climate distribution, supporting the descriptive assessment. This paper ultimately brings to light signatures of coevolution that arise from the nonlinear coupling of the landscape-climate system at slow and fast time scales. The presented work builds on Perdigão and Blöschl (2014).\nPerdigão, R. A. P., and G.

            "abstract": "Spectral algorithms are a popular choice for modeling systems of turbulent, incompressible flow, due in part to their inherent numerical accuracy and also, as in the case of the sphere, geometrical considerations. These advantages must be weighed against the high cost of communication, however, as any time step taken by a spectral method will typically require multiple, global reorganizations (i.e. transposes) of the distributed flow fields and thermal variables. As more processors are employed in the solution of a particular problem, the total computation time decreases, but the number of inter-processor messages initiated increases. It is this property of spectral algorithms that ultimately limits their parallel scalability because, for any given problem size, there exists a sufficiently large process count such that the message initiation time overwhelms any gains in computation time. I will discuss the parallelization of a community-sourced spectral code that has been designed to mitigate this problem by minimizing the number of messages initiated within a single time step. The resulting algorithm possesses efficient strong scalability for problems both small (5123 grid points, 16,000 cores) and large (20483 grid points, 130,000 cores). This code, named Rayleigh, has been designed with the study of planetary and stellar dynamos in mind, and can efficiently simulate anelastic MHD convection within both spherical and Cartesian geometries. Rayleigh is being developed through the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (UC Davis), and will be made publicly available in winter of 2015.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial ecosystem and carbon cycle feedbacks contribute substantial uncertainty to model projections of future climate, but the real controls and sensitivities are poorly constrained by observations, especially at large scales. Local studies provide the most direct information about cause and effect in the terresrial carbon system, but are difficult to scale up. Atmospheric analyses provide the best large-scale information, but inferences from atmospherioc CO2 are so coarse they are difficult to relate to specific mechanisms. Remote sensing is at the appropriate scale but vegetation index-based measures do not correspond directly to specific ecosystem processes and have been of limited success in parameterizing or falsifying models. We analyze extant global data sources for three key terrestrial carbon cycle quantities: ecosystem carbon fluxes, aboveground biomass and plant growth parameters (traits), revealing a sampling pattern far from optimum. Flux measurements are sparse in regions where fluxes are highest and most variable, biomass measurements are limited where biomass is highest, and plant trait data are scarcest where plant diversity is highest. The likely carbon cycle tipping point regions in high and low latitudes are scarcely observed by the standards of the mid-latitudes. Strategic and synergistic use of available in situ and emerging space-based observations can provide critical information needed to detect and forecast change. New remote sensing data products can contribute significantly to filling sampling gaps in the global observing system, as well as potentially addressing sensitivities at appropriate scales for testing global models. Environment and logistics limit extensive deployment of additional in situ observations in challenging tropical and Arctic-Boreal environments, so increasing use of space-based techniques is important for increasing sampling density and reducing uncertainty. Much greater integration between the remote sensing,atmospheric, biodiversity and terrestrial modeling communities is needed to reduce uncertainty and ensure that the critical satellite missions are selected and executed.",

            "abstract": "The formation of Earth’s core has left a compositional imprint on the mantle, depleting and fractionating most of its siderophile (iron-loving) elements. Gallium is a moderately siderophile, hence it should be strongly depleted in the mantle. However, gallium concentration in the mantle matches that of lithophile (silicate-loving) elements having the same volatility. That is to say that either gallium behaves as a lithophile element during core formation, or a large influx of gallium was brought to the Earth after the core had formed. Geochemical evidence does not support the latter hypothesis, as it would require all other lithophile elements with similar volatility to be enriched in the mantle, or for late accretion to be composed of anomalously gallium-rich objects. In order to mitigate this issue, experimental studies have tried to understand how gallium behaves during core segregation by gauging the effects of pressure, temperature and oxygen fugacity on the partitioning of gallium between metal and silicate. None of these parameters provided the first-order change required to match the observation.\nWe investigated the influence of core composition on gallium partitioning. The core in known to contain light-elements (oxygen, silicon sulfur and carbon), and those can change the activity of gallium in the metal, and strongly affect the behavior of gallium during core formation. We performed a series of metal-silicate partitioning experiments (2 GPa, 1673–2073 K) in a piston-cylinder press. We varied the light-element composition of the metal and observed that Si and O have a very strong influence on the activity of gallium, making it more lithophile. We then modeled terrestrial accretion as a continuous process and tested different accretion histories; we can reproduce the mantle concentration of gallium if the core segregates in a deep magma ocean (>40 GPa) and contains large amounts of silicon or oxygen.",

The associated increase in demand for land, water resources and rich foods will deepen the challenge to sustainably feed the population and balance environmental and agricultural policies. In previous work, Inner Mongolia was identified as a target province for trade or agricultural policies aimed at water-use efficiency improvements, due to its large production relying on particularly significant irrigation water use. In addition, water scarcity issues may arises in the greater Beijing area, which represents the largest urban area of arid Northern China. Increasing residential and industrial water demand in this region may lead to fewer available water for irrigation.\nFor these reasons, it is important to estimate the impacts of specific policies aiming at reducing excessive water use for crop production in Inner Mongolia, as well as exploring ways to mitigate pressure on water resources in dry urban areas. In this study, we use socio-economic projections to assess the future state of China's virtual water trade (VWT) network. We then quantify the effects of agricultural policies on the national VWT system and on the efficiency of food trade in terms of water resources.\nThis study addresses the following questions: (1) How future socio-economic changes will affect China's food trade and associated water transfers? (2) To which extent localized reductions of irrigated area can decrease agricultural water use while maintaining national food security? (3) How would these policies affect China's domestic and international VWT network and induced water resources savings (losses)?",

Integrated assessments have simulated large-scale economic response to shifting agricultural productivity caused by climate change, including possible changes in food costs and prices. A small but growing literature has shown how different facets of agricultural production inside the farm gate could be adapted to climate variability and change. Very little research has examined how the full food system (production, processing and storage, transportation and trade, and consumption) is likely to be affected by climate change and how different adaptation approaches will be required by different parts of the food system. This paper will share partial results of a major assessment sponsored by USDA to determine how climate change-induced changes in global food security could affect the US food system. Emphasis is given to understanding how adaptation strategies differ widely across the food system. A common thread, however, is risk management-based decision making. Technologies and management strategies may co-evolve with climate change but a risk management framework for implementing those technologies and strategies may provide a stable foundation.",

            "abstract": "Since the introduction to the academic community of multibeam sonar swath mapping techniques in the late 1970s, the ability to collect high-resolution bathymetry and seafloor imagery has steadily increased. Early systems provided a limited number (e.g., 16) of relatively broad (2-4 degree) beams and swath widths of approximately one times the water depth, whereas current systems offer hundreds of narrower (0.5 to 1 degree) beams over swath widths of five to seven times water depth. Innovations like chirped pulses and high-density beam forming (multiple depth solutions per beam footprint) have also pushed the resolution of modern systems. Despite these improvements, the resolution achievable is fundamentally limited by trade-offs between beam width, bandwidth, transducer size and propagation, resulting in the need for short ranges to the seafloor to achieve the highest levels of resolution. In the deep sea this means delivery of high-frequency, high-resolution mapping systems close to the bottom by means of towed or autonomous vehicles, the trade-off here being limited areal coverage due to narrow swaths and slow mapping speeds. Despite these constraints, we cannot forget that only a small fraction of the deep ocean has been mapped by any sort of swath mapping system (10-20%) and that even a single well-calibrated and properly operated multibeam swath collected at high-speed during a long transit can offer a remarkable amount of insight into seafloor processes. We will illustrate this through the exploration of a single transit by the R/V KILO MOANA (using a Kongsberg EM120 MBES) from Hawaii to Kodiak Alaska. When compared to the best available global bathymetric compilations using both satellite derived bathymetry and existing bathymetric data (e.g., Global Topography of Smith and Sandwell, GMRT, or ETOPO-1), the single swath offers detailed views of deep-sea channels, seamount and guyots, tectonic structure and volcanic processes that are totally absent in the compilations. Given the difference that a single swath can make in interpreting deep-sea processes, imagine what we would learn from complete coverage – even at 100 m pixel resolution - of the deep ocean seafloor.",

            "abstract": "High rates of glacier retreat for the last decades are often reported, and believed to be induced by 20th century climate changes. However, regional glacier fluctuations are complex, and depend on a combination of climate and local topography. Furthermore, in ares such as the Hindu-Kush Himalaya, there are concerns about warming, decreasing monsoon precipitation and their impact on local glacier regimes. Currently, the challenge is in understanding the magnitude of feedbacks between large-scale climate forcing and small-scale glacier behavior. Spatio-temporal patterns of glacier distribution are still llimited in some areas of the high Hindu-Kush Himalaya, but multi-temporal satellite imagery has helped fill spatial and temporal gaps in regional glacier parameters in the last decade.\nHere I present a synopsis of the behavior of glaciers across the Himalaya, following a west to east gradient. In particular, I focus on spatial patterns of glacier parameters in the eastern Himalaya, which I investigate at multi-spatial scales using remote sensing data from declassified Corona, ASTER, Landsat ETM+, Quickbird and Worldview2 sensors. I also present the use of high-resolution imagery, including texture and thermal analysis for mapping glacier features at small scale, which are particularly useful in understanding surface trends of debris-covered glaciers, which are prevalent in the Himalaya. I compare and contrast spatial patterns of glacier area and élévation changes in the monsoon-influenced eastern Himalaya (the Everest region in the Nepal Himalaya and Sikkim in the Indian Himalaya) with other observations from the dry western Indian Himalaya (Ladakh and Lahul-Spiti), both field measurements and remote sensing-based. In the eastern Himalaya, results point to glacier area change of -0.24 % ± 0.08% per year from the 1960’s to the 2006’s, with a higher rate of retreat in the last decade (-0.43% /yr). Debris-covered glacier tongues show thinning trends of -30.8 m± 39 m on average over the last four decades, similar to other studies in the same climatic area. However, at small scales, the behavior of glaciers is highly heterogenous, with contrasting patterns of thickening glacier termini versus retreating nad thinning glacier tongues.",

The data assimilation approach explicitly treats sources of uncertainty from model parameters, meteorological inputs, and observations. The method is comprised of two main components: (1) a coupled land surface model (LSM) and snow depletion curve (SDC) model, which is used to generate an ensemble of predictions of SWE and fractional snow cover area (FSCA) for a given set of prior (uncertain) inputs, and (2) a retrospective reanalysis step, which updates estimation variables to be consistent with the observed fractional snow cover time series. The final posterior SWE estimate is generated from the LSM-SDC using the posterior estimation variables consistently with all postulated sources of uncertainty in the model, inputs, and observations. A reasonable agreement was found between the SWE reanalysis and in situ SWE observations and streamflow data. The data set was studied to evaluate factors controlling SWE spatial and temporal variability. Elevation was found to be the primary control on spatial patterns of peak-SWE and day-of-peak. The easting coordinate had additional explanatory power, which is hypothesized to be related to rain shadow effects due to the prevailing storm track directions. The spatial patterns were found to be interannually inconsistent. However, drier years and lower elevations were found more variable than wetter years and higher elevations, respectively. Only a very small percentage of the Kern River watershed had a significant trend in peak-SWE and day-of-peak. Trends deemed to be significant were found to be positive (peak-SWE is increasing and day-of-peak occurs later) at higher elevations, but negative (peak-SWE is decreasing and day-of-peak occurs earlier) at lower elevations. The reanalysis approach proved to be useful in terms of identifying subwatershed variability and trends, and could be extended to larger regions and areas where in situ data are sparse or unavailable.",

            "abstract": "The surface mass balance (SMB) is the primary steering factor for the evolution of ice sheets. For mountain glaciers, the SMB gradient is largely determined by elevation. However, for ice sheets the relation between elevation and mass balance is more complex, which is only partly due to the nonlinear feedback between snowmelt and albedo. On ice sheets, precipitation is the main cause of the complex relation between elevation and SMB. Most precipitation on an ice sheet is generated through orographic lift, and high precipitation rates are thus found on locations with on average upslope atmospheric circulation. Similarly steep lee slopes receive much less moisture. Therefore, precipitation and elevation are regionally poorly correlated with elevation such that statistical downscaling of accumulation is hardly possible. That is why the resolution of precipitation fields in coupled GCM-ice sheet models remains for now limited by the resolution of the GCM. This resolution matters most along the ice sheet margins where the spatial accumulation gradients are largest.\nIn this presentation, we will focus on southeast Greenland. This rugged region of Greenland has very sharp SMB gradients, ranging from ablation to over 3 m of annul accumulation. We will present results of a new RACMO2 simulation on various resolutions. These results are used to discuss which spatial resolution is required to model the SMB in this region correctly.",

            "abstract": "Cenozoic Libyan volcanic fields are manifestations of tremendous episodic outpourings of basaltic lavas within the East Saharan Craton. The volcanic fields are confined to a NW-SE trend (N140°E) that stretches from the Mediterranean coast in the north to Tibesti (Libya-Chad border) in the south. The four major volcanic fields (Gharyan, As-Sawda, Al-Haruj, and Nuquay) show a systematic decrease in age starting from ~55 Ma in Gharyan (NW) to the Holocene in Nuquay (SE). This apparent trend in ages along with characteristics resembling oceanic island basalts (OIB’s) prompted several authors to attribute their origin to the African plate moving over a hot spot (e.g. Conticelli et al. 1995; Woller and Fediuk 1980; Hegazy 1999).\n In the Gharyan province (GVP), the igneous activity was indeed episodic and lasted for at least 50 Ma. The large span of ages of these volcanic rocks within the same volcanic field makes the hot spot model at least equivocal. Whole rock analyses for the major petrologic and chronologic units suggest that the basaltic and phonolitic suites within the GVP had different primary sources. The basaltic rocks show smooth REE patterns. LREE/HREE fractionations of the eruptive pulses are inconsistent with their ages, suggesting that they represent different melt fractions generated from the same mantle source. Phonolites show very different REE patterns. The patterns are concave-upward with low TbN/YbN ratios (0.6-0.8). The origin of the GVP basaltic rocks is consistent with melts generated from metasomatized lithospheric mantle across the garnet-spinel transition zone. The most primitive (>7 wt % MgO) basalts were used to model mantle melting processes and indicate 3-10% melting of an amphibole-bearing, spinel/garnet mantle source. Rather than being related to a hot spot, the genesis of the Libyan lavas appears to have been caused by reactivation of lithospheric megastructures with asthenospheric upwelling, in relation to the Africa-Europe convergence.",

            "abstract": "The importance of making scientific data more available can’t be overstated. There is a wealth of useful scientific data available and demand for this data is only increasing; however, applying scientific data towards practical uses poses several technical challenges. These challenges can arise from difficulty in handling the data due largely to 1) the complexity, variety and volume of scientific data and 2) applying and operating the techniques and tools needed to visualize and analyze the data. As a result, the combined knowledge required to take advantage of these data requires highly specialized skill sets that in total, limit the ability of scientific data from being used in more practical day-to-day decision making activities.\nWhile these challenges are daunting, information technologies do exist that can help mitigate some of these issues. Many organizations for years have already been enjoying the benefits of modern service oriented architectures (SOAs) for everyday enterprise tasks. We can use this approach to modernize how we share and access our scientific data where much of the specialized tools and techniques needed to handle and present scientific data can be automated and executed by servers and done so in an appropriate way.\nWe will discuss and show an approach for preparing file based scientific data (e.g. GRIB, netCDF) for use in standard based scientific web services. These scientific web services are able to encapsulate the logic needed to handle and describe scientific data through a variety of service types including, image, map, feature, geoprocessing, and their respective service methods. By combining these types of services and leveraging well-documented and modern web development APIs, we can afford to focus our attention on the design and development of user-friendly maps and apps. Our scenario will include developing online maps through these services by integrating various forecast data from the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2).\nThis presentation showcases a collaboration between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Climate.gov portal, Climate Prediction Center and Esri, Inc. on the implementation of the ArcGIS platform, which is aimed at helping modernize scientific data access through a service oriented architecture.",

Although some attempts have been made to test for kinetic effects by lateral sampling such kinetic effects still remain are emphasized by the large departure of the temperatures calculated using the Δ47proxy in speleothems.\nHere we present data from conventional δ18O isotopes in modern and ancient samples from the same cave and compare these with δ18O w analyses from drip water and from fluid inclusions. Finally these data are compared with Δ47 measurements. These data show that it is possible to reconcile all the data using the approach of Wainer et al. (Quaternary Science Reviews, 30, 130-146, 2011) which compares the offset of the Δ47 from the correct value and the difference between the δ18O data and the Kim and O'Neil ( Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, v. 61, 3461-3475, 1997) relationship in the modern samples. Using this slope the kinetic fractionation can be accounted for and a temperature estimated. The relationship can then be applied to ancient stalagmites from the Bahamas to distinguish between temperature and δ18Ow influences during important climatic events such as the Heinrich stadials. These data can then be verified by using the alternate approach of distinguishing temperature and δ18Ow, using the δ18O of water extracted from fluid inclusions to correct the δ18O of the calcite. Such suggested minimal changes in the δ18Ow and larger changes in temperatures during Heinrich events in the sub-tropics.",

            "abstract": "Probability distributions of daily surface temperatures can exhibit marked departures from Gaussianity in the tails of the distribution. Locations exhibiting shorter-than-Gaussian tails are prone to experiencing a relatively greater change in the frequency of extreme temperature exceedances, under a simple shift in the distribution towards warmer temperatures, than are locations with Gaussian or long tails. Under such conditions, places with a short warm tail would see a larger increase in extreme warm events and places with a short cold tail would see a larger decrease in extreme cold events than places with longer tails. The potential impact of this effect is quantified using gridded observations over North America by uniformly shifting the distribution at each grid cell by one standard deviation and assessing the change in frequency of extreme temperature threshold exceedances relative to the current climate. In winter, portions of the Pacific Coast of Canada and southern Alaska, where warm tails are notably short, temperatures that are exceeded 5% of the time in the current climate occur up to 60% of the time under such a shift. In summer, much of Mexico and the central and eastern United States exhibit short warm tails and also experience large increases in the frequency of warm exceedances. Temperatures that are below the 5th percentile of the distribution in the current climate no longer occur over central and eastern Canada and northern Alaska in the winter and throughout much of the Pacific Northwest in summer, due to short cold tails there. While actual changes in temperature may be less uniform across the distribution, these results demonstrate how important it is for climate models to be able to reproduce observed distribution tails and the key physical and dynamical processes that govern distribution shape.",

            "abstract": "Forest hydrology has long debated the influence of forest gap size on the shortwave radiation regime and subsequent snowmelt rates. To address this question, a new ray trace solar transmittance model is presented to evaluate the sensitivity of gap influence on shortwave irradiance patterns to latitude, gap size, and time of year in fragmented forest environments. The ray trace model takes into account solar position, gap and forest geometry, and position within or near the gap, and was tested against measurements of shortwave radiation from 20 pyranometers in and around a gap in a mixed conifer forest and compared to simpler canopy transmittance models that ignored shading or that scaled transmittance according to leaf area index. The ray trace model reduced the large errors obtained by simple canopy transmittance models; at the 20 pyranometer locations, average biases in excess of ~ ±90 W m-2 were reduced to better than 4 W m-2. These results suggest that an accurate description of the spatial variability of solar irradiance in and around a forest gap requires explicit calculation of how gaps modify the canopy transmittance. To examine model sensitivity to key parameters, gap size, latitude, and day of year were varied under clear-sky conditions. The calculated spatial distribution patterns of cumulative daily solar irradiance inform how forest gap sizes might be optimized to minimize (shortwave) snowmelt energy. As gap size was changed for a given latitude and date, the (spatial) coefficient of variation (CV) of cumulative daily irradiance exhibited a distinct maximum that is a function of gap geometry and solar angle; smaller (larger) gaps with more diffuse (direct beam) radiation exhibited reduced spatial variability of irradiance. The results indicate that optimum forest gap sizes to reduce solar radiation while maximizing gap area depend on date and latitude; using mean snowmelt onset dates for a range of latitudes (31°N – 71°N) spanning North American conifer forests, the optimal gap radius relative to forest height H is 0.5H at and below 51°N and 0.8H at and above 61°N. The optimal forest gap size is found to be sensitive to the choice of snowmelt onset date; an earlier snowmelt onset by one-month would increase optimal forest gap radii to 0.7 – 1 H.",

These include both new parameterizations (e.g. volatility basis set) and new formation pathways (e.g. multiphase chemistry, sea spray organic enrichment, primary biological particles, brown carbon). The implementation of such parameterizations in global models follows the research priorities set by the various modeling groups. In addition, the models don’t always track the OA formed due to the new parameterizations, making a robust comparison of OA simulations among models extremely challenging.\nThis study presents in detail the most important inconsistencies that present-day OA models have, and suggests priorities in the implementation of new parameterizations and sources of OA in global models. New parameterizations that need immediate attention will be presented. These include the OA/OC ratio, which depends on OA sources and atmospheric processing and is important for a proper model evaluation against OA and OC observations, and the semi-volatility of OA, both primary and secondary. Multi-model comparisons against measurements will also be presented to demonstrate the need for convergence between models, and highlight the important role of the new processes in the OA global budget.",

            "abstract": "The flow dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and its response to climate change are still incompletely understood. At the same time, a solid understanding of the subglacial drainage system and basal motion is crucial for further ice sheet modeling and sea level rise prediction. Conditions at the ice-bed interface, however, are inherently difficult to investigate due to limited accessibility.\nSeismic signals recorded by a dense local network installed in the ablation zone of the GrIS shed some light on basal sliding and sub- and englacial drainage systems. In the slow flowing part of the GrIS, some 30km north of the calving front of Jakobshavn Isbræ, we detected basal icequakes originating near the interface of ice and underlying bed. The icequake waveform's first motions point towards shear dislocations corresponding to stick-slip motion of the ice sheet, similar to what has been observed in Antarctica. Waveform modeling of direct and critically refracted waves propagating along granitic bedrock constrain source process and bedrock properties and provide an estimate of how much till is present between ice and bedrock.\nWe observe more than 10.000 deep icequakes that can be grouped into more than 30 clusters with up to 2000 events per cluster originating in an area of approximately 1 km in diameter. Nearly identical waveforms in each cluster indicate that repeating source processes and failure mechanisms occur in the same volume. The magnitude and occurrence frequency of events for some clusters show a close temporal correlation with water level measured in a nearby moulin and surface velocity measured by differential GPS. These observations provide quantitative insights into the interplay between sudden seismogenic episodes of basal motion and glacier hydraulics, thus filling a critical data gap in our understanding of ice sheet flow.",

            "abstract": "NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) is a data, supercomputing and knowledge collaboratory that houses NASA satellite, climate and ancillary data where a focused community can come together to address large-scale challenges in Earth sciences. Analytics within NEX occurs at several levels – data, workflows, science and knowledge. At the data level, we are focusing on collecting and analyzing any information that is relevant to efficient acquisition, processing and management of data at the smallest granularity, such as files or collections. This includes processing and analyzing all local and many external metadata that are relevant to data quality, size, provenance, usage and other attributes. This then helps us better understand usage patterns and improve efficiency of data handling within NEX. When large-scale workflows are executed on NEX, we capture information that is relevant to processing and that can be analyzed in order to improve efficiencies in job scheduling, resource optimization, or data partitioning that would improve processing throughput. At this point we also collect data provenance as well as basic statistics of intermediate and final products created during the workflow execution. These statistics and metrics form basic process and data QA that, when combined with analytics algorithms, helps us identify issues early in the production process. We have already seen impact in some petabyte-scale projects, such as global Landsat processing, where we were able to reduce processing times from days to hours and enhance process monitoring and QA. While the focus so far has been mostly on support of NEX operations, we are also building a web-based infrastructure that enables users to perform direct analytics on science data – such as climate predictions or satellite data. Finally, as one of the main goals of NEX is knowledge acquisition and sharing, we began gathering and organizing information that associates users and projects with data, publications, locations and other attributes that can then be analyzed as a part of the NEX knowledge graph and used to greatly improve advanced search capabilities. Overall, we see data analytics at all levels as an important part of NEX as we are continuously seeking improvements in data management, workflow processing, use of resources, usability and science acceleration.",

This labor-intensive process requires meteorologists to venture into the affected area, acquire damage indicators through photos, eyewitness accounts, and other documentation, then aggregation of data in order to make a final determination of the tornado path length, width, maximum intensity, and other characteristics. Earth remote sensing from operational, polar-orbiting satellites can support the damage assessment process by helping to identify portions of damage tracks that are difficult to access due to road limitations or time constraints by applying change detection techniques. In addition, higher resolution commercial imagery can corroborate ground-based surveys by examining higher-resolution commercial imagery.\nAs part of an ongoing collaboration, NASA and NOAA are working to integrate near real-time Earth remote sensing observations into the NOAA/NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit (DAT), a suite of applications used by meteorologists in the survey process. The DAT includes a handheld application used by meteorologists in the survey process. The team has recently developed a more streamlined approach for delivering data via a web mapping service and menu interface, allowing for caching of imagery before field deployment. Near real-time products have been developed using MODIS and VIIRS imagery and change detection for preliminary track identification, along with conduits for higher-resolution Landsat, ASTER, and commercial imagery as they become available. In addition to tornado damage assessments, the team is also investigating the use of near real-time imagery for identifying hail damage to vegetation, which also results in large swaths of damage, particularly in the central United States during the peak growing season months of June, July, and August. This presentation will present an overview of recent activities, challenges and successes, best practices, and opportunities for future work and collaboration.",

            "abstract": "Typically, a given operational or modeling center produces seasonal forecasts using a single model version that represents that center’s current state of model development. By contrast, Environment Canada (EC) has employed multi-model ensembles to produce its dynamical seasonal forecasts since their inception in 1995. Successive versions of this forecasting system have drawn upon “models of opportunity” that were developed for other purposes by EC’s climate and meteorological modeling centers. This talk will describe the origins of this single-center/multi-model approach, and its evolution through configurations consisting of two and subsequently four 2-tier models in the 1990s and 2000s, to the current Canadian Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPS). The latter is based on two global climate models, CanCM3 and CanCM4, that employ common ocean, sea ice and land components coupled to two versions of CCCma’s atmospheric model. Lessons learned concerning the efficacy of this multi-model approach will be discussed, focusing on the relative merits of adding more ensemble members versus adding more models, and on methods for combination and calibration. Current efforts aimed at improving the ensemble of prediction models contributing to CanSIPS and the techniques used to initialize them will then be summarized.",

            "abstract": "Areal coverage and spatial distribution of sea-ice melt ponds are key factors in determining the response of the Arctic Ocean’s ice cover to changes in atmospheric forcing, its importance in enhancing high-latitude warming and its function in polar marine ecosystems. A review of remote-sensing and field observations, in conjunction with process studies in coastal Alaska, highlights the importance of sub-floe scale ice properties and processes in controlling ponding, thereby constraining seasonal evolution and decay of the ice cover. Field observations and model simulations have shown how pond areal extent and hence ice albedo depend on the combination of snow or ice ablation rates, ice permeability and surface topography. Seasonal and short-term variations of these three factors explain much of the observed spatial and temporal variability in the large-scale pond areal fraction. Recent work on Alaska shorefast ice suggests that the snow-cover depth distribution may predetermine ponding patterns months ahead of spring melt. Specifically, through the formation of wind crusts, snow depth variations are locked in place. After onset of melt, formation and deepening of ponds is enhanced in thin-snow areas, with pond spatial patterns replicating snow dune topography. Both deepening of ponds and preferential pond drainage through small-scale flaws and cracks then constrain the eventual break-up of the ice cover. Field observations and aerial photography indicate that with increasing wave action in an ice-diminished Arctic Ocean, ponds and drainage features precondition ice for break-up and fragmentation. Model simulations by Schröder et al. (doi:10.1038/nclimate2203) hint at other, as of yet poorly understood mechanisms that link pond coverage to the degree of seasonal ice retreat. Key measurements and potential datasets that can help improve understanding and prediction of a changing ice cover on seasonal scales will be discussed.",

The network inlet (recharge) and outlet (karst spring) locations may be known, but direct measurements of the conduit network and associated structural properties (volume fraction, sinuosity) are generally limited for the aquifer interior. This study considers the information content of indirect solute tracer data for inferring structural properties of the network. Observations from selected karst aquifers in the USA provide motivation for a numerical investigation that utilizes synthetic models characterized by a branching conduit network surrounded by permeable matrix material, with focused discharge at a single karst spring. The permeable matrix allows for solute exchange between the conduits and diffuse flow domain. Results from physics-based flow and transport simulations demonstrate how variations in conduit network geometry influence solute breakthrough at the outlet. Solute particle arrival time distributions, generated from synthetic tracer tests, are described by the mean, variance, skewness, and early (5th percentile) breakthrough times. The results indicate a clear relationship between these statistical moments and structural properties of the network, highlighting the potential signature of conduit network structure on hydrologic response and solute transport in karst aquifers.",

Studies in less active regions have evidenced the response of the solar atmosphere to the emergence of small-scale magnetic flux. In particular we have detected localized heating and plasma acceleration associated to the interaction of the emerging and ambient magnetic fields.

            "abstract": "Aquifers around the world show troubling signs of irreversible depletion and seawater intrusion as climate change, population growth, and urbanization led to reduced natural recharge rates and overuse. Scientists and engineers have begun to re-investigate the technology of managed aquifer recharge and recovery (MAR) as a means to increase the reliability of the diminishing and increasingly variable groundwater supply. MAR systems offer the possibility of naturally increasing groundwater storage while improving the quality of impaired water used for recharge. Unfortunately, MAR systems remain wrought with operational challenges related to the quality and quantity of recharged and recovered water stemming from a lack of data-driven, real-time control.\nOur project seeks to ease the operational challenges of MAR facilities through the implementation of active sensor networks, adaptively calibrated flow and transport models, and simulation-based meta-heuristic control optimization methods. The developed system works by continually collecting hydraulic and water quality data from a sensor network embedded within the aquifer. The data is fed into an inversion algorithm, which calibrates the parameters and initial conditions of a predictive flow and transport model. The calibrated model is passed to a meta-heuristic control optimization algorithm (e.g. genetic algorithm) to execute the simulations and determine the best course of action, i.e., the optimal pumping policy for current aquifer conditions. The optimal pumping policy is manually or autonomously applied. During operation, sensor data are used to assess the accuracy of the optimal prediction and augment the pumping strategy as needed. At laboratory-scale, a small (18”H x 46”L) and an intermediate (6’H x 16’L) two-dimensional synthetic aquifer were constructed and outfitted with sensor networks. Data collection and model inversion components were developed and sensor data were validated by analytical measurements.",

            "abstract": "Phreato-magmatic vents (esp. maar craters) are rare in the ~40,000 Km2 Plio-Quaternary monogenetic Michoacán-Guanajuato Volcanic Field (MGVF) located in the central part of the Mexican Volcanic Belt. In contrast to >1000 scoria cones, only 2 dozen phreato-magmatic monogenetic vents (e.g. tuff cones, tuff rings, and maars) have been identified. About half of these form a cluster near Valle de Santiago in the Lerma river valley at the northern margin of the MGVF, while the others occur in a rather scattered fashion. Here we discuss the origin of Alberca de Guadalupe maar crater, one of the three phreato-magmatic vents (in addition to El Caracol and Alberca de Los Espinos) that occur within the boundaries of the inter-montane lacustrine Zacapu basin, a tectonic graben bound by an ENE-WSW normal fault system. The maar crater came into existence between 20,000 and 23,000 y BP, forming a 140 m deep hole in the otherwise planar surrounding ground of theearly Pleistocene lava flows of Cerro Pelón.The maar crater has a diameter of ~1 Km and bears a 9 m deep lake. Eruptive products include typical surge deposits that are best exposed around the rim and inner crater walls. They are poorly sorted (Mdø= -1.56 to -3.75, ø= 1.43 to 3.23), rich in accidental lithics (angular andesitic lava and ignimbrite clasts) constituting 51-88% of the deposit with few juveniles (basaltic andesite with phenocrysts of plagioclase, olivine, and pyroxene in a quenched glassy matrix; SiO2=54-58 wt. %). Dry surge units are friable and clast-supported, in contrast the wet surge units are fairly indurated and bear accretionary lapilli. Bedding is frequently distorted by ballistic impact-sag structures. The entire construct is disrupted by an E-W trending regional fault, downthrowing the northern part by ~30 m.\nThe unusual formation of this maar crater in the semi-arid highlands of Zacapu was favored by the local hydrological and topographical conditions. Such conditions still prevail in several parts of the MGVF, making it possible for such an event to occur again, considering the active nature of this region, which is famous for its historic 1943-1952 eruption of Paricutin.",

Such changes have substantially altered energy, water and biogeochemical cycling in these regions, which has important global-scale consequences for climate and society. Recognizing the vulnerability of these ecosystems to change, scientists and decision-makers have identified a critical need for research that employs existing and new remote sensing technologies and methodologies to observe, monitor and understand changes in Arctic ecosystems. The unique capabilities provided by remote sensing imagery and data products have allowed us novel views of ecosystems and their dynamics over multiple scales in time and space across all regions of the globe. Here we offer a synthetic discussion of the recent and emerging science focused on understanding the dynamic landscape processes in Arctic terrestrial ecosystems using a variety of remotely-sensed information collected from passive and active sensors on ground-, aircraft- and satellite- based platforms. To consider the evolution of these technologies, methods and applications over recent decades, we look at key examples from the scientific literature that range from the use of radar sensors for local-scale characterization of active layer dynamics to the circumpolar-scale assessment of changes in vegetation productivity using long-term records of optical satellite imagery. This discussion has a particular focus on the use of remotely sensed data and products to parameterize, drive, evaluate and benchmark the modeling of Arctic ecosystem processes. We use these examples to demonstrate the opportunities for model-data integration, as well as to highlight the challenges of remote sensing studies in northern high latitude regions.",

            "abstract": "Theoretical work suggests that magnetic fields play a fundamental role in the evolution of protoplanetary systems. Efficient radial transport of angular momentum in the protoplanetary disk, an essential requirement for the formation of stars and planets, may be mediated by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) or magnetocentrifugal winds (MCW). Magnetic fields may also generate turbulence in the nebular gas, potentially leading to instabilities that created the first planetesimals. Finally, magnetic reconnection events may lead to the formation of chondrules, which are millimeter-sized meteoritic inclusions that likely constituted a major building block of terrestrial planets in the solar system.\nDirect measurements of the magnetic field in the planet-forming region of a protoplanetary disk, which have remained hitherto elusive to astronomical observations, are necessary to test the theoretical models discussed above. Because chondrules were heated and cooled in the nebula, they potentially carry a record of nebular magnetic fields. Newly developed microsampling and magnetic field mapping techniques based on the SQUID microscope can measure very weak moments (<10-13 Am2) from oriented small (~100 µm) samples, enabling the recovery of detailed paleomagnetic data from single chondrules.\nWe performed paleomagnetic experiments on 13 chondrules from the primitive LL3.0 chondrite Semarkona. We showed that dusty olivine-bearing chondrules (Fig. 1) were magnetized prior to the assembly of the meteorite in a magnetic field of 54±21 µT. This field strength provides evidence against chondrule formation near the sun as predicted by the x-wind model while favoring weak-field processes such as nebular shocks or planetesimal collisions. Furthermore, such fields are sufficient to redistribute angular momentum efficiently via either the MRI or MCW, strongly suggesting that magnetic fields are the primary driver of mass accretion in protoplanetary disks.\nOngoing paleomagnetic work focuses on other chondrite classes, potentially constraining magnetic fields for a range of ages and locations in the protoplanetary disk. Together, these efforts highlight the promise of new techniques to expand the relevance of paleomagnetism to non-planetary fields and astrophysical questions.",

            "abstract": "In urban areas leaf area index (LAI) is a key ecosystem structural attribute with implications for energy and water balance, gas exchange, and anthropogenic energy use. Typically, citywide LAI estimates are extrapolated from those made on forest inventory sample plots through intensive crown measurement and allometric scaling. This is a time- and labor-intensive process yielding coarse spatial resolution results. In this study we generate spatially explicit estimates of LAI using high-point density airborne lidar throughout our study area in downtown Santa Barbara, CA. We implement two theoretically distinct modeling approaches. First, based on hemispherical photography at our 71 field plots, we estimate effective LAI using scan-angle corrected lidar laser penetration metrics (LPM). For our second approach, we adapt existing allometric equations for use with a suite of crown structural metrics (e.g., tree height, crown base height) measured with lidar. This approach allows for estimates of LAI to be made at the individual tree crown scale (ITC). This is important for evaluating fine-scale interactions between canopy and urban surfaces.\nThe LPM method resulted in good agreement with field estimates (r2 = 0.80) and a slope of near unity (β = 0.998) using a model that assumed a spherical leaf angle distribution. Within ITC segments that were automatically delineated using watershed segmentation, lidar estimates of crown structure closely paralleled field measurements (r2=0.87 for crown length). LAI estimates based on the lidar structural variables corresponded well with estimates from field measurements (r2 = 0.84). Agreement between the LPM and allometric lidar methods was also strong across the 71 validation plots (r2 = 0.88) and among 450 sample points (r2 = 0.72) randomly distributed throughout the citywide maps. This is notably higher than the agreement between the hemiphoto and allometric ground-based estimates (r2 = 0.56). The allometric approach generally yielded higher estimates except for under closed, broadleaf canopy. The first-order agreement between these two disparate methods may indicate that the error bounds for mapping LAI in cities are small enough to pursue large scale spatially explicit estimation.",

            "abstract": "In Earth’s mountainous regions, melt from both seasonal snow and glacier ice contributes to streamflow. Few in-situ observations exist that can help distinguish between the two components of melt, particularly across large mountain ranges. In this study, we analyze daily time series of MODIS data products to distinguish ice from snow as the seasonal snowpack recedes revealing firn and glacier ice surfaces. We run a temperature index melt model for the Hunza, a sub-basin of the Upper Indus basin using the MODIS data to discriminate between glacier ice and snow and partition the corresponding streamflow.\n During the ablation period, this high elevation mid-latitude snowpack receives intense incoming solar radiation resulting in snow grain growth and surface albedo decreases. To explore snow grain growth, we use estimates of grain size from both the MODIS Snow Covered Area and Grain Size Model (MODSCAG) and MODIS Dust Radiative Forcing in Snow (MODDRFS). To explore albedo reduction we use 2 standard albedo products from MODIS, the Terra Daily Snow Cover algorithm (MOD10A1) and Surface Reflectance BRDF/Albedo (MOD43). We use a threshold on the grain size and albedo products to discriminate ice from snow.\nWe test the ability of the 4 MODIS products to discriminate snow from glacier ice using higher resolution data from the Landsat 8 sensor from July 5th and July 21st, 2013 for a subset of the study area in the Karakoram region of the Himalaya that includes the Yazghil and Hopper Glaciers that drain north and northeast in the Shimshall Valley, part of the Hunza River basin. Snow and glacier ice are mapped using band ratio techniques, and are then separated on the basis of broadband albedo values calculated from Landsat bands for comparison with MODIS-derived snow and glacier ice pixels.\nWe run a temperature index melt model that uses gap filled snow covered area from MODSCAG and interpolated station temperature data for the Hunza River basin. The model outputs daily melt volume from three surface classifications: area of snow over land, snow over glacier ice, and exposed glacier ice. The partitioning is done using a combination of MODICE and 1 of 4 MODIS products. Melt from glacier ice accounts for 25% of the combined melt on average across the 4 MODIS products for the Hunza basin, with fluctuations based on the seasonal variability of snowfall.",

Ideally, this mandate is achieved by scientists and educators working together to translate research findings into common knowledge.\nThe Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) is the largest research institute at the University of Colorado and home institute to over 500 scientists. CIRES provides an effective organizational infrastructure to support its scientists in broadening their research impact. Education specialists provide the necessary experience, connections, logistical support, and evaluation expertise to develop and conduct impactful education and outreach efforts.\nOutreach efforts are tailored to the project needs and the scientists’ interests. They span from deep engagement efforts with a high time commitment by the scientist thus a high dosage to short presentations by the scientists that reach many people without stimulating a deep engagement and have therefore a low dosage. We use three examples of current successful programs to showcase these different engagement levels and report on their impact: i) deep transformative and time-intensive engagement through a Research Experience for Community College students program, ii) direct engagement during a teacher professional development workshop centered around a newly developed curriculum bringing authentic climate data into secondary classrooms, iii) short-time engagement through a virtual panel discussion about the state of recent climate science topics, the recordings of which were repurposed in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC).\nIn this presentation, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of broader impacts work. We discuss successful strategies that we developed, stress the importance of robust impact evaluation, and summarize different avenues of funding outreach efforts.",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal circulation in the igneous ocean crust on ridge flanks (far from spreading centers) is limited by thick accumulations of low-permeability sediment, except where basement outcrops that penetrate through the sediment provide high-permeability conduits for flows of fluid, heat and solutes. Hydrothermal siphons can form between recharging and discharging outcrops, driven by density differences between cooler and warmer fluids, although the physics controlling the pattern, magnitude, and direction of flow in these systems are not well understood. We present the first three-dimensional coupled flow models of a self-sustaining, outcrop-to-outcrop hydrothermal siphon that operate between seamounts separated by tens of kilometers. Parametric tests of these models show how physical properties determine flow behavior and control the sustainability and flow rates of hydrothermal siphons. Model construction was guided by physical characteristics, and subseafloor geochemical, thermal, and pressure data, from 3.5 M.y. old seafloor on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, one of the best-studied examples of a hydrothermal siphon. One set of models generated results that were consistent with field observations from this area, including little to no regional heat flow suppression and siphon throughflow across a distance of 50 km of ≤17 kg/s. Model results suggest that bulk permeability (k) and the area of seafloor exposure (Aoc) of an outcrop have similar effects on siphon sustainability, and that sustaining a siphon requires that the product of these two terms (Toc=k x Aoc; outcrop transmittance) must differ by two orders of magnitude at sites of recharge and discharge. In addition, models that include a good match to observations include basement permeability that is consistent with direct measurements made with a borehole packer, but is one to two orders of magnitude lower than inferred from earlier studies (based on two dimensional models and tidal analyses). Finally, model results suggest that siphon flow is only sustainable in one direction: recharging through outcrops with higher Toc, and discharging at those with lower Toc. This finding is consistent with field observations that generally favor discharge at smaller outcrops.",

            "abstract": "The oxidation of isoprene by OH and NO3 has a large but uncertain impact on the budget of NOx (and hence O3) through the formation and photochemical transformation of organic nitrates. Recent laboratory work have put strong constraints on the chemical lifetimes of the primary hydroxynitrates formed from isoprene+OH. We show that the carbonyl nitrates formed in the subsequent oxidation of the primary nitrates by OH photolyze much more more rapidly than previously believed, due to absorption cross section enhancement effects and a quantum yield likely of the order of unity. New recommendations for the photolysis parameters are provided, and the resulting photorates are validated using the temporal profiles of different compounds abserved in the isoprene oxidation laboratory experiment of Paulot et al. (209).\nNext, a detailed isoprene oxidation mechanism based on the recently published Leuven Isoprene Mechanism version 1 (LIM1) (Peeters et al., 2014) and on the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCMv32) has been developed. The impact of the fast photolysis of carbonyl nitrates is investigated by box model simulations. A reduced version of this explicit mechanism is constructed, which is shown to provide essentially the same results as the explicit mechanism for key compounds. The reduced mechanism is incorporated in a global chemistry-transport model, IMAGES (Stavrakou et al., 2013). We investigate the budget of organic nitrates, considering contributions from isoprene, monoterpenes, small alkenes and other precursors. The model predictions are tested against aircraft campaigns such as INTEX-A and ARCTAS. The predicted organic nitrate concentrations are in very reasonable agreement with the data in the boundary layer over isoprene-rich areas. Examination of the discrepancies in other areas (boreal forests, N-E United States, also the free troposphere) provide clues regarding missing pathways in the model.",

            "abstract": "As the world's water resources come under increasing tension due to the dual stressors of climate change and population growth, accurate knowledge of water consumption through evapotranspiration (ET) over a range in spatial scales will be critical in developing adaptation strategies. However, direct validation of ET models is challenging due to lack of available observations that are sufficiently representative at the model grid scale (10-100 km). Prognostic land-surface models require accurate information about observed precipitation, soil moisture storage, groundwater, and artificial controls on water supply (e.g., irrigation, dams, etc.) to reliably link rainfall to evaporative fluxes. In contrast, diagnostic estimates of ET can be generated, with no prior knowledge of the surface moisture state, by energy balance models using thermal-infrared remote sensing of land-surface temperature (LST) as a boundary condition. One such method, the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model provides estimates of surface energy fluxes through the use of mid-morning change in LST and radiation inputs. The LST inputs carry valuable proxy information regarding soil moisture and its effect on soil evaporation and canopy transpiration. Additionally, the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) representing anomalies in the ratio of actual-to-potential ET has shown to be a reliable indicator of drought. ESI maps over the continental US show good correspondence with standard drought metrics and with patterns of precipitation, but can be generated at significantly higher spatial resolution due to a limited reliance on ground observations. Furthermore, ESI is a measure of actual stress rather than potential for stress, and has physical relevance to projected crop development. Because precipitation is not used in construction of the ESI, it provides an independent assessment of drought conditions and has particular utility for real-time monitoring in regions with sparse rainfall data or significant delays in meteorological reporting. An initial analysis of a new prototype global ALEXI system using twice-daily observations of MODIS LST will be presented. The newly generated global ET and ESI datasets will be compared to other globally available ET and drought products during a multi-year evaluation period (2000-2013).",

            "abstract": "Describing and understanding the daily variability of Equatorial Plasma Bubble (EPB) occurrence has remained a significant challenge over recent decades. In this study we use the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM), which is driven by solar (F10.7) and geomagnetic (Kp) activity indices, to study daily variations of the linear Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability growth rate in relation to the measured scintillation strength at five longitudinally distributed stations. For locations characterized by generally favorable conditions for EPB growth (i.e., within the scintillation season for that location) we find that the TIEGCM is capable of identifying days when EPB development, determined from the calculated R-T growth rate, is suppressed as a result of geomagnetic activity. Both observed and modeled upward plasma drift indicate that the pre-reversal enhancement scales linearly with Kp from several hours prior, from which it is concluded that even small Kp changes cause significant variations in daily EPB growth. This control of Kp variations on EPB growth prompted an investigation into the use of predicted Kp values from the Wing Kp model over a 2-month equinoctial campaign in 2014. It is found that both the 1-hr and 4-hr predicted Kp values can be reliably used as inputs into the TIEGCM to forecast the EPB growth conditions during scintillation season, when daily EPB variability is governed by the suppression of EPBs on days with increased, but not necessarily high, geomagnetic activity.",

            "abstract": "A reduced-order modeling procedure applicable for compositional subsurface flow simulation will be described and applied. The technique combines trajectory piecewise linearization (TPWL) and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to provide highly efficient surrogate models. The method is based on a molar formulation (which uses pressure and overall component mole fractions as the primary variables) and is applicable for two-phase, multicomponent systems. The POD-TPWL procedure expresses new solutions in terms of linearizations around solution states generated and saved during previously simulated ‘training’ runs. High-dimensional states are projected into a low-dimensional subspace using POD. Thus, at each time step, only a low-dimensional linear system needs to be solved. Results will be presented for heterogeneous three-dimensional simulation models involving CO2 injection. Both enhanced oil recovery and carbon storage applications (with horizontal CO2 injectors) will be considered. Reasonably close agreement between full-order reference solutions and compositional POD-TPWL simulations will be demonstrated for ‘test’ runs in which the well controls differ from those used for training. Construction of the POD-TPWL model requires preprocessing overhead computations equivalent to about 3–4 full-order runs. Runtime speedups using POD-TPWL are, however, very significant – typically O(100–1000). The use of POD-TPWL for well control optimization will also be illustrated. For this application, some amount of retraining during the course of the optimization is required, which leads to smaller, but still significant, speedup factors.",

            "abstract": "In situ observations and remote measurements of the solar wind show strong preferential heating of ions along the ambient magnetic field. Understanding the mechanism for this heating process is an open problem. The observed broad-band spectrum of Alfven waves permeating the fast solar wind provide a candidate mechanism for this preferential heating through wave-particle interactions on ion kinetic scales. Previous analytical and numerical studies have considered a single pump wave [1, 2] or a turbulent, broad-band spectra of Alfven waves [3, 4, 5] to drive the ion heating. The latter studies investigated the effects on ion heating due to different initial 1/fγpower spectral exponents and number of modes and the signals were random phase. However, the observed solar wind fluctuations are intermittent so that the phases of the modes comprising the power spectrum are not random. Non-Gaussian fluctuations are seen both on scales identified with the inertial range of Alfvenic turbulence [6], and on longer scales typified by ‘1/f’ spectra [7].\nWe present results of the first parametric numerical simulations on the effects of different levels of intermittency of the broad-band spectra of Alfven waves on the preferential heating of ions in the solar wind. We performed hybrid simulations for the local heating of the solar wind, which resolves the full kinetic physics of the ions and treats the electrons as a charge-neutralizing fluid. Our simulations evolve the full vector velocities and electromagnetic fields in one configuration space coordinate and in time.We compare the efficiency of different levels of intermittency of the initial turbulent fields and their effect on the efficiency of the wave-particle interactions which are a mechanism for driving preferential ion heating in the solar wind.\n[1] J.

            "abstract": "The shear stress at the bed of a channel influences important benthic processes such as sediment transport. Several methods exist to estimate the bed shear stress in open channel flow, but most of these are not appropriate for vegetated channels due to the impact of vegetation on the velocity profile and turbulence production. This study proposes a new model to estimate the bed shear stress in both vegetated and bare channels. The model is based on the observation that, for both bare and vegetated channels, within a viscous sub-layer at the bed, the viscous stress decreases linearly with increasing distance from the bed, resulting in a parabolic velocity profile at the bed. For emergent canopies of sufficient density, the thickness of this linear-stress layer is set by the stem diameter, leading to a simple estimate for bed shear stress. For bare channels, the model describes the velocity profile in the overlap region of the Law of the Wall. The model is supported by high-resolution experiments. Furthermore, the changes in turbulence isotropy and integral length across a range of vegetation density, from bare bed to dense canopy, have been explored.",

            "abstract": "Chemical reactions in the aqueous phase are thought to significantly contribute to ambient aerosol mass under specific conditions. Results from many laboratory studies suggest that these reactions are efficiently initiated by the OH radical and lead to high molecular weight compounds (oligomers). Recent laboratory experiments have shown that methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) can form oligomers in high yield in aqueous solutions similar to aerosol water. Additional experiments have shown that the direct photolysis of pyruvic acid can generate organic radicals that initiate similar oligomer products upon oxidation of MVK (Renard et al., submitted).\nSources of the OH radical in the aerosol aqueous phase include the direct uptake from the gas phase, Fenton reactions and, to a smaller extent, direct photolyses of hydrogen peroxide and nitrate. Recent model studies imply that under many conditions, aqSOA formation might be oxidant-limited since these OH(aq) sources are not sufficient to provide a continuous OH supply. This limitation can be (partially) removed if additional radical sources in the multiphase system are considered. Exemplary, we include the direct photolysis of aqueous pyruvic acid as a proxy for possible other radical sources. Model results will be shown and consequences for aqSOA formation and processing under ambient conditions will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Legacy sediments are those that are altered by human activities. Alterations include (i) human-caused aggradation (and subsequent erosion), such as sediment accumulating upstream from relict or contemporary dams, (ii) human-caused lack of continuing deposition that results in changing moisture and nutrient levels within existing sediments, such as on floodplains that no longer receive lateral or vertical accretion deposits because of levees, bank stabilization, and other channel engineering, and (iii) human-generated contaminants such as PCBs and pesticides that adsorb to fine sediment. Existing estimates of human alterations of river systems suggest that legacy sediments are ubiquitous. Only an estimated 2% of river miles in the United States are not affected by flow regulation that alters sediment transport, for example, and less than half of major river basins around the world are minimally altered by flow regulation. Combined with extensive but poorly documented reduction in floodplain sedimentation, as well as sediment contamination by diverse synthetic compounds, excess nutrients, and heavy metals, these national and global estimates suggest that legacy sediments now likely constitute a very abundant type of fluvial sediment. Because legacy sediments can alter river form and function for decades to centuries after the cessation of the human activity that created the legacy sediments, river management and restoration must be informed by accurate knowledge of the distribution and characteristics of legacy sediments. Geomorphologists can contribute understanding of sediment dynamics, including: the magnitude, frequency, and duration of flows that mobilize sediments with adsorbed contaminants; sites where erosion and deposition are most likely to occur under specified flow and sediment supply; residence time of sediments; and the influence of surface and subsurface water fluxes on sediment stability and geochemistry.",

This dominant mode of nonseasonal variability is partly related to the North Atlantic Oscillation and is associated with net flows into and out of the Canadian Inland Seas; the anomalous inflows and outflows, which are reflected in mean sea surface height and ocean bottom pressure changes, are driven by wind stress anomalies over Hudson Strait, probably by means of a wind setup, and over the northern North Atlantic, possibly mediated by continental shelf waves. The mode is also associated with mass redistribution within the Canadian Inland Seas; the anomalous internal mass redistribution, which relates to changes in the depth-mean ocean circulation, reflects linear ocean response to local wind stress variations under the combined influences of rotation, gravity, and variable bottom topography. Results have implications for interpreting the multidecadal tide-gauge record as well as inferring ocean circulation and climate changes from the GRACE retrievals.",

However, it is not well understood under what conditions and in which basins forecasters need to be concerned about the contribution of snowmelt to runoff. In this study, we use a generalized approach to identify the main controls on the importance of snowmelt for flooding across a range of idealized basins and rain-on-snow (ROS) events.\nResults show that the simulated snowmelt ranges from 0 to 23% of total basin input (snowmelt + rainfall) over the largest 10 storms within each study basin. The largest contributions from snowmelt occur when: 1) low-elevation snowfall provided high initial snow water equivalent (SWE) prior to a ROS event; 2) the basin fraction of forest was low, which allowed higher wind speed and large positive sensible and latent heat fluxes into the snowpack; and 3) when a large fraction of a basin’s area coincides with the elevations of greatest snowmelt. Sensitivity experiments show that perturbations to the meteorological forcing data have different impacts in mass-limited and energy-limited regimes. This study illustrates the importance of the basin contribution from snowmelt during extreme ROS events and demonstrates the relative importance of the processes controlling basin-average snowmelt.",

Reliable forecast of crop yields response to those ECEs is a prerequisite for developing strategies on agricultural risk management. However, the progress of quantifying such responses with ecosystem models has been slow. In this study, we first review existing algorithms of yields response to ECEs among major crops (i.e., Corn, Wheat and Soybean) for the United States from a set of process-based crop models. These algorithms are aggregated into four categories of ECEs: drought, heavy precipitation, extreme heat, and frost. Species-specific ECEs thresholds as tipping point of crop yield response curve are examined. Four constraint scalar functions derived for each category of ECEs are then added to an agricultural ecosystem model, CLM-AG, respectively. The revised model is driven by NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data from 1948 to 2013 to estimate the US major crop yields, and then evaluated with county-level yield statistics from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). We also include MODIS NPP product as a reference for the period 2001-2013. Our study will help to identify gaps in capturing yield response to ECEs with contemporary crop models, and provide a guide on developing the new generation of crop models to account for the effects of more future extreme climate events.",

            "abstract": "Unprecedented age control on many last glacial stratigraphic units and morainal ice-margin positions are interpreted from AMS radiocarbon ages of tundra plant macrofossils archived in low-relief ice-walled lake plain (IWLP) deposits the Lake Michigan Lobe (south-central Laurentide Ice Sheet). IWLPs are periglacial features that formed on morainal dead-ice permafrost. Lacustrine sediment, and the fossils contained therein, had physical and temporal proximity to the glacier which formed the underlying moraine. In modern ice-walled lakes, as the lake’s ice cover begins to melt, moats form which allows access of sloughing tundra-mantled active layer sediment (soil) into the lakes. Multiple AMS ages from two sites with proglacial sediment buried by glacial max LIS diamicton, and IWLPs reveal evidence of episodic plant growth and sedimentation including ca. 24.0 to 24.4 ka (post Shelby Phase), 22.5 to 21.1 ka (post Livingston Phase), 18.1 to 17.4 ka (post Woodstock Phase). Although presently based on negative evidence, the associated nonconformities (listed in title) indicate periods when cold conditions did not promote development of the estival moat. Although the evidence does not preclude tundra growth during the cold summers, there was little landscape modification due to limited thawing of the active layer.\nAt approximately the onset of the 19.2-18.5 “warm” period, at least two large deglacial discharge events flooded the Fox and Kankakee tributary valleys of the Illinois River. The latter, known as the Kankakee Torrent, occurred at 19.05 – 18.85 ka (σ1 range) at the Oswego channel complex. The temporal coincidence of the torrents and sedimentation in ice-walled lakes suggests that the post-Livingston Phase nonconformity (21.1 – 19.2 ka) was a period of lessened meltwater discharge through subglacial conduits (tunnel valleys) as the frozen toe promoted formation of subglacial lakes, buildup of pore-water pressures, and the release of subglacial water as “torrents”. In the case of the Fox and Kankakee torrents, ice-marginal discharge first flowed into proglacial lakes which ultimately breached moraines, resulting in catastrophic “torrents”. Hence, present knowledge does not allow determination of the nature of the subglacial release (catastrophic vs. large, steady discharge).",

            "abstract": "Estimates of how our climate is changing are needed locally in order to inform adaptation planning decisions. This requires quantifying the geographical patterns in changes at specific quantiles or thresholds in distributions of variables such as daily temperature or precipitation. We develop a method[1] for analysing local climatic timeseries to assess which quantiles of the local climatic distribution show the greatest and most robust changes, to specifically address the challenges presented by ‘heavy tailed’ distributed variables such as daily precipitation. We extract from the data quantities that characterize the changes in time of the likelihood of daily precipitation above a threshold and of the relative amount of precipitation in those extreme precipitation days. Our method is a simple mathematical deconstruction of how the difference between two observations from two different time periods can be assigned to the combination of natural statistical variability and/or the consequences of secular climate change. This deconstruction facilitates an assessment of how fast different quantiles of precipitation distributions are changing. This involves both determining which quantiles and geographical locations show the greatest change but also, those at which any change is highly uncertain. We demonstrate this approach using E-OBS gridded data[2] timeseries of local daily precipitation from specific locations across Europe over the last 60 years.\nWe treat geographical location and precipitation as independent variables and thus obtain as outputs the pattern of change at a given threshold of precipitation and with geographical location. This is model- independent, thus providing data of direct value in model calibration and assessment. Our results identify regionally consistent patterns which, dependent on location, show systematic increase in precipitation on the wettest days, shifts in precipitation patterns to less moderate days and more heavy days, and drying across all days which is of potential value in adaptation planning.\n[1] S C Chapman, D A Stainforth, N W Watkins, 2013 Phil.

            "abstract": "Carbon is a key element for evolution of terrestrial planets as it has influence on the chemistry and habitability of surficial environment as well as impact on mantle processes such as partial melting and element mobility. Because mantle is arguably the largest reservoir of extractable carbon, the stable form of carbon in various mantle domains needs to be constrained. In the reduced, mid- to deep- upper mantle, the host of deep carbon is graphite/diamond and/or Fe-Ni-bearing alloy melt [1]. However, high solubility of carbon in Fe-Ni alloy melt [2] suggests that diamond saturation may be restricted only to C-rich mantle domains. But such suggestions do not take into account the role of sulfides, which must interact with alloy-carbon mantle subsystems. In order to constrain the stable forms of carbon in the reduced mantle where Ni-rich alloy is likely present [3], we explore the phase relations and C solubility in Ni-rich portion of the Fe-Ni-±Cu-C-S systems.\nExperiments were performed in a MgO capsule using a multi-anvil with six starting mixes (Ni/(Fe+Ni) wt. ratio of 0.50-0.61, 8-16 % wt.% S, 2.0-2.5 wt.% C, and 0-0.7 wt.% Cu) at 6-8 GPa and 800-1400 °C. Low-temperature runs for all starting mixes contain C-bearing, solid Fe-Ni alloy + alloy melt + graphite, and solid alloy-out boundary is constrained, for example, at 1000-1050 °C at 6 GPa and 900-1000 °C at 8 GPa for the S-rich starting mix. The carbon solubility in the alloy melt (0.8~2.1 wt.% at 8 GPa and 1400 °C) decreases with increasing S content from 8 to 24 wt.%, increasing pressure for S-rich (18-24 wt.%) melt, and decreasing Ni/(Fe+Ni) from 0.65 to 0.53.\nFor a mantle with ~0.1 wt.% alloy (~250 km depth) [3], diamond is likely stable coexisting with an S-rich alloy melt for ≥10 ppm bulk C. This is owing to the influence of S, which suppresses the incorporation of C in the alloy melt to stabilize diamond. Our results thus imply that diamond is a stable form of carbon even in depleted mantle domains similar to that of MORB source, i.e., without the necessity of excess C from derived from deeply subducted oceanic crust [4].

            "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are important contributors to cool season precipitation in the Southwestern US, and in some cases can lead to extreme hydrometeorological events in the region. We performed a climatological analysis and identified two predominant types of ARs that affect the Southwest: Type 1 ARs originate in the tropics near Hawaii (central Pacific) and enhance their moisture in the midlatitudes, with maximum moisture transport over the ocean at low-levels of the troposphere. On the other hand, moisture in Type 2 ARs has a more direct tropical origin and meridional orientation with maximum moisture transfer at mid-levels.\nWe then analyze future projections of Southwest ARs in a suite of global and regional climate models (from NARCCAP), to evaluate projected future changes in the frequency and intensity of ARs under warmer global climate conditions. We find a consistent and clear intensification of the water vapor transport associated with the ARs that impinge upon Arizona and adjacent regions, however, the response of AR-related precipitation intensity to increased moisture flux and column-integrated water vapor is weak and no robust variations are projected either by the GCMs or the NARCCAP models.\nTo evaluate the effect of horizontal resolution and improve our physical understanding of these results, we numerically simulated a historical AR event using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at a 3km resolution. We then performed a pseudo-global warming experiment by modifying the lateral and lower boundary conditions to reflect possible changes in future ARs (as projected by the ensemble of GCM simulations used for NARCCAP). Interestingly we find that despite higher specific humidity, some regions still receive less rainfall in the warming climate experiments – partially due to changes in thermodynamics, but primarily due to AR dynamics. Therefore, we conclude from this analysis that overall future increase in atmospheric temperature and water content as projected by GCMs will not necessarily translate into generalized heavier AR-related precipitation in the Southwestern US.",

Currently, we use a surface flux transport model to construct synchronic maps every 15 minutes with a resolution of 1024 by 512 in longitude-latitude. This model assimilates magnetic data from SDO/HMI full-disk line-of-sight magnetograms and advects the magnetic field with differential rotation and meridional flow profiles taken directly from the motions of the magnetic elements. Rather than using a diffusivity coefficient, this model explicitly incorporates well-resolved cellular convective flows with spatial and temporal characteristics that match observations, thus retaining the magnetic network structure observed on the Sun.\nWhile this model accurately transports the active regions that are observed on the near-side of the Sun, active regions that emerge on the far-side are neglected until they appear in the observations. Far-side active regions will obviously have a substantial impact on the global coronal field configuration and must be included in useful synchronic maps. We will discuss our attempts to incorporate far-side active region emergence into our flux transport model. We will also illustrate the impact of these improvements.",

            "abstract": "Sensitive Arctic ecosystems are vulnerable to change as warming climate impacts the hydrological, thermal, biogeochemical and plant physiological processes on the landscape, leading to geomorphic, biophysical and biogeochemical changes. In particular, Arctic vegetation is expected to exhibit significant shifts in community composition, phenology, distribution and productivity under a changing climate. Modeling of vegetation communities, often represented as Plant Functional Types (PFTs) in Earth System Models (ESMs), requires accurate characterization of their distributions on the landscape as input to ESMs. The unique spectral characteristics exhibited by vegetation can be sensed by remote sensing platforms and used to characterize and distinguish different vegetation types. In this study we employ multi-spectral remote sensing from WorldView--2 and LIDAR--derived digital elevation models to characterize the Arctic tundra vegetation communities near Barrow, Alaska. Using field vegetation surveys at a number of sites, we derived statistical relationships between vegetation distributions and spectral data, which were then employed to estimate the distributions of evergreen shrub, deciduous shrub, grass, sedge, forb, moss and lichen PFTs for the Barrow Environmental Observatory. Plant physiological parameters for these tundra-specific PFTs were implemented in the Community Land Model (CLM). We will present CLM results from simulations employing different distributions of these new PFTs, created using different subsets of remote sensing and in situ vegetation data, to test the sensitivity of the model to a range of predicted distributions.",

The sediments recovered during IODP Expedition 339 allow studying MOW’s history throughout the Pleistocene and Pliocene and thus under varying climate forcing. Here we present centennial-to-millennial scale proxy records for surface water and MOW variations as recorded at IODP Site U1387, drilled into the Faro Drift, which is formed by the upper MOW core. We focus our study on the early to middle Pleistocene with special attention on the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) when the dominant climate cyclicity changed from 41 kyr to 100 kyr. Surface water and MOW proxy records show millennial-scale stadial/ interstadial oscillations on top of the glacial/ interglacial cycles. Planktonic and benthic δ18O records are tightly coupled highlighting the constant exchange between the (sub)surface waters and the MOW. Low benthic δ13C values during deglacial and peak interglacial periods, coinciding with insolation maxima, reveal a poorly ventilated upper MOW core and a causal link between MOW ventilation and sapropel formation in the Mediterranean Sea. Better ventilation was recorded during glacial and stadial intervals, often in association with the formation of contourites. During the warmer MIS contourites, often more pronounced than their glacial counterparts, were formed during the stadial(s) following the peak interglacial period when northern hemisphere summer insolation was low. Thus, changes in the upper MOW core are tightly coupled to summer insolation with poor ventilation occurring during insolation maxima and higher current velocity marking insolation minima. This insolation forcing reveals a close link between MOW and Mediterranean Sea climate conditions.",

            "abstract": "When implementing computer vision codes, a common reaction to the high angular resolution and the high cadence of SDO’s image products has been to reduce the resolution and cadence of the data so that it “looks like” SOHO data. This can be partially justified on physical grounds: if the phenomenon that a computer vision code is trying to detect was characterized in low-resolution, low cadence data, then the higher quality data may not be needed. But sacrificing at least two, and sometimes all four main advantages of SDO’s imaging data (the other two being a higher duty cycle and additional data products) threatens to also discard the perhaps more subtle discoveries waiting to be made: a classic baby-with-the-bath-water situation. In this presentation, we discuss some of the sacrifices made in implementing SWAMIS-EF, an automatic emerging magnetic flux region detection code for SDO/HMI, and how those sacrifices simultaneously simplified and complicated development of the code. SWAMIS-EF is a feature-finding code, and we will describe some situations and analyses in which a feature-finding code excels, and some in which a different type of algorithm may produce more favorable results. In particular, because the solar magnetic field is irreducibly complex at the currently observed spatial scales, searching for phenomena such as flux emergence using even semi-strict physical criteria often leads to large numbers of false or missed detections. This undesirable behavior can be mitigated by relaxing the imposed physical criteria, but here too there are tradeoffs: decreased numbers of missed detections may increase the number of false detections if the selection criteria are not both sensitive and specific to the searched-for phenomenon. Finally, we describe some recent steps we have taken to overcome these obstacles, by fully embracing the high resolution, high cadence SDO data, optimizing and partially parallelizing our existing code as a first step to allow fast magnetic feature tracking of full resolution HMI magnetograms. Even with the above caveats, if used correctly such a tool can provide a wealth of information on the positions, motions, and patterns of features, enabling large, cross-scale analyses that can answer important questions related to the solar dynamo and to coronal heating.",

            "abstract": "Flooding and flash flooding are the most costly weather-related natural hazards in the United States and world. Heavy rainfall-triggered landslides are often associated with flash flood events and cause additional loss of life and property. Therefore, it is important to understand the linkage and interaction between flash flood events and landslides. It is also pertinent to build a robust coupled flash flood and landslide disaster early warning system for disaster preparedness and hazard management. In this study, we built a coupled flash flood and landslide disaster early warning system, which is aimed for operational use by the US National Weather Service, based on an existing ensemble framework by extending the model ensemble and coupling a set of distributed hydrologic models, the Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST) model and the SACramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model, with two physically based landslide prediction models, the SLope-Infiltration-Distributed Equilibrium (SLIDE) model and the Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability (TRIGRS) model. We tested this prototype warning system by conducting multi-year simulations driven by the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) rainfall estimates at selected basins across the United States. We then comprehensively evaluated the predictive capabilities of this system against observed and reported flood and landslides events. Our results show that the system is generally capable of making accurate predictions of flash flood and landslide events in terms of their locations and time of occurrence. The recently developed ensemble framework also enables us to quantify the uncertainty of the predictions and the probabilities of anticipated disaster events.",

We used a multi-method acquisition and analysis approach, where active-source horizontal shear (SH)-wave reflection/refraction as well as active-source multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) and passive-source refraction microtremor (ReMi) Rayleigh wave dispersion were interpreted separately. The time-averaged shear-wave velocity to a depth of 30 m (Vs30), interpreted bedrock depth and site resonant frequency were estimated from the best-fit Vs profile of each method at each location for analysis. Using the median Vs30 value (which range from 270 m/s to 715 m/s) as representative of a given site, we estimate that all 16 sites are NEHRP site class C or D. Based on a comparison of simplified mapped surface geology to median Vs30 at our sites we do not see clear evidence for using surface geologic units as a proxy for Vs30 in the epicentral region, although this primarily may be because the units are similar in age (Paleozoic) and may have similar bulk seismic properties. We compare resonant frequencies calculated from ambient noise horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios (HVSR) at available sites to predicted site frequencies (generally between 1.9 Hz and 7.6 Hz) derived from the median bedrock depth and average Vs to bedrock. Robust linear regression of HVSR to both site frequency and Vs30 demonstrate moderate correlation to each, and thus both appear to be generally representative of site response in this region. Based on Kendall tau rank correlation testing, we find that Vs30 and the site frequency calculated from average Vs to median interpreted bedrock depth can both be considered reliable predictors of weak-motion site effects in the epicentral region.",

            "abstract": "In July 2014, the U. S. Geological Survey released an update of the 2008 National Seismic Hazard Map for the coterminous U. S. The Map provides guidance for the seismic provisions of the building codes and portrays ground motions with a 2% chance of being exceeded in an exposure time of 50 years. Over most of the midcontinent the hazard model is derived by projecting the long-term historic, declustered earthquake rate forward in time. However, parts of the midcontinent have experienced increased seismicity levels since 2009 – locally by 2 orders of magnitude – which is incompatible with the underlying assumption of a constant-rate Poisson process. The 2014 Map acknowledged this problem, and for its intended purpose of underpinning seismic design used seismicity rates that are consistent with the entire historic record. Both the developers of the Map and its critics acknowledge that the remarkable rise of seismicity in Oklahoma and nearby states must be addressed if we are to fully capture the hazard in both space and time. The nature of the space/time distribution of the increased seismicity, as well as numerous published case studies strongly suggest that much of the increase is of anthropogenic origin. If so, the assumptions and procedures used to forecast natural earthquake rates from past rates may not be appropriate. Here we discuss key issues that must be resolved include: the geographic location of areas with elevated seismicity, either active now or potentially active in the future; local geologic conditions including faults and the state of stress; the spatial smoothing of catalog seismicity; the temporal evolution of the earthquake rate change; earthquake sequence statistics including clustering behavior; the magnitude-frequency distribution of the excess earthquakes, particularly to higher and yet unobserved magnitudes; possible source process differences between natural and induced earthquakes; and the appropriate ground motion prediction equations.",

This storm was part of a cluster of severe storms and produced 5” hail, an EF-1 tornado, and copious lightning over the course of a few hours. During a period in which flash rates were increasing rapidly, observations were obtained from mobile polarimetric radars and a balloon-borne electric field meter (EFM) and particle imager, while aircraft sampled the chemistry of the inflow and anvil. In addition, the storm was within the domain of the 3-dimensional Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) and the S-band KTLX WSR-88D radar.\nThe focus of this paper is the evolution of flash rates, the location of flash initiations, and the distribution of flash size and flash extent density as they relate to the evolving kinematics and microphysics of the storm for the approximately 30-minute period in which triple-Doppler coverage was available. Besides analyzing reflectivity structure and three-dimensional winds for the entire period, we examine mixing ratios of cloud water, cloud ice, rain, and graupel/hail that have been retrieved by a Lagrangian analysis for three select times, one each at the beginning, middle, and end of the period. Flashes in an around the updraft of this storm were typically small. Flash size tended to increase, and flash rates tended to decrease as distance from the updraft increased. Although flash initiations were most frequent near the updraft, some flashes were initiated near the edge of 30 dBZ cores and propagated into the anvil. Later, some flashes were initiated in the anvil itself, in vertical cells that formed and became electrified tens of kilometers downshear of the main body of the storm. Considerable lightning structure was inferred to be in regions dominated by cloud ice in the upper part of the storm. The continual small discharges in the overshooting top of the storm tended to be near or within 15 dBZ contours, although occasional discharges appeared to extend above the storm.",

            "abstract": "Baseline ozone (O3) has been defined as the mixing ratio of O3 measured at sites not influenced by recent, local emissions. Measurements of O3 at relatively remote monitoring sites, particularly in the western US, are useful for quantifying baseline O3 and subsequently the magnitude of O3 not controllable by local regulations. As the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for O3 becomes more stringent, there is an increased need to quantify baseline O3 particularly in the western US where regional and global sources can significantly enhance O3 measured at surface sites yielding baseline mixing ratios approaching or exceeding the NAAQS threshold. With the pending reduction in O3 NAAQS, there is a growing need to develop tools to quantify baseline O3 that are readily comprehensible to a wide range of stakeholders. Past work has indicated that meteorological conditions as well as site specific spatial characteristics (e.g. elevation, basin size, gradient) were significantly correlated with O3 intercepted at rural monitoring sites. Here, we used 2 years of data measured at sites throughout rural Nevada to develop a readily comprehensible Categorical And Regression Tree (CART) model to identify spatial and meteorological characteristics that lead to elevated baseline O3. A third year of data from rural Nevada sites was used to test the model and its applicability to the state of Nevada. Data from other sites in the intermountain west were used to test the representativeness of the model for sites throughout the region.",

            "abstract": "The Lower Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiment (LABLE) included two measurement campaigns at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains site in Oklahoma in 2012 and 2013. Its main objective was to study turbulent phenomena in the lowest 2-km of the atmosphere using a variety of novel atmospheric profiling techniques including a sodar, multiple Doppler wind lidars (DWL), a Raman lidar and an atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer (AERI). Several instruments from the University of Oklahoma and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory were deployed to augment the suite of in-situ and remote sensing instruments at the ARM site. The complementary nature of the deployed instruments with respect to resolution and height coverage provides for a near-complete picture of the dynamic and thermodynamic structure of the atmospheric boundary layer. LABLE can be considered unique in that it was designed as a multi-phase, low-cost, and multi-agency collaboration. Graduate students served as principal investigators who took the lead in designing and conducting experiments aimed at examining boundary-layer processes.\nThis presentation provides an overview of the LABLE experiments and a summary of important results. One focus area will be the dynamic and thermodynamic structure of the nocturnal boundary layer and the formation of nocturnal low-level jets. Such low-level jets were frequently observed during both LABLE campaigns and often interacted with mesoscale atmospheric disturbances such as frontal passages. The combination of high-resolution AERI temperature profiles with DWL mean wind and turbulence profiles provided new insights about the structure and evolution of low-level jets.",

We present numerical tests that verify the preservation of free-stream solution and high-order accuracy as well as robust oscillation-free behavior near discontinuities.\nWe apply the new high order accurate schemes to both heliospheric and magnetospheric simulations and show that it is robust and can achieve the same accuracy as the second order scheme with much less computational resources.

            "abstract": "Turbulence heats the solar wind as it expands away from the Sun, but where and how does heating of ions and electrons occur? In order to understand this we must first look at the fluctuations making up the cascade, the properties and anisotropies of which will determine whether ions or electrons are heated and whether field-parallel or -perpendicular heating will occur, all of which amounts to a lot of different anisotropies! With this in mind, we present a review of recent advances in the observation of plasma turbulence in the solar wind and comparison with simulations; which features of solar wind turbulence are well reproduced and which need to be captured better?\nThe first anisotropy is that of the fluctuations making up the turbulent cascade itself, fluctuations are known to be highly transverse, meaning that the perpendicular magnetic field components are dominant over the field-parallel component. The second anisotropy is that of the scaling of amplitude towards smaller scales with steeper spectra parallel to the local magnetic field direction. Observations of the anisotropy of the full power spectral tensor will be discussed, in particular with reference to Alfvenic and pseudo-Alfvenic fluctuations (effectively two different polarizations of Alfven waves), the next step beyond the traditional \"slab + 2D\" approach to incompressible MHD turbulence. The third anisotropy is that of the ion and electron distributions. Both sets of charged particles frequently show non-Maxwellian distributions with higher temperatures found either perpendicular to or parallel to the magnetic field direction. Proton distributions often show beams and the heavier alpha particles are often hotter than the protons. Localized structures such as current sheets and magnetic discontinuities are shown to be sites of intense and anisotropic heating. Small scale fluctuations filling the space between such discontinuities may also dissipate energy into ions and electrons, either through electric fields intrinsic to the modes generated by the turbulence or through resonant or stochastic processes. Observations show that kinetic Alfven waves are the dominant mode.",

Native American influences, comstock-era logging, fire suppression, development, and recreation have all shaped the natural environment into what it is today. Like much of our national forests in California, forest conditions that have developed are generally much more homogenous and less resistant to disturbance from fire, insect, and disease than they might have been without the myriad of human influences. However, in order to improve the resiliency of our forests to stand replacing disturbances like high severity fire, while managing for integrated anthropomorphic values, it is imperative that management evolve to meet those dynamic needs. Recent advances in remote sensing and GIS allow land managers more access to forest information and can inform site specific prescriptions to change site specific undesirable conditions. It is ecologically and politically complex, yet our forests deserve that microscope. This particular presentation will focus on how the Truckee Ranger District began this process of incorporating several values, generated from stakeholder collaboration, into one project's goals and how those lessons learned informed their most recent project.",

Most of the climate change studies primarily focus on either projection of climate variables or sources of uncertainty associated with hydro-climatic variables. This study evaluates the sources of errors in developing near-term hydro-climatic projections for four watersheds across the Sunbelt. Common sources of error in obtaining hydro-climatic projections are decomposed into GCM/downscaling from CMIP5, temporal disaggregation, and hydrologic model error.. For this purpose, a fully coupled surface water and groundwater model, PIHM (Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model) was used in order to simulate streamflow and groundwater depth simultaneously over the selected four watersheds from different hydro-climatic regimes. Study reveals that smaller watersheds have larger error due to GCM and low flow season shows larger hydrologic model error. Further, temporal disaggregation error is the primary source of error in projecting hydrologic extremes. The study also quantifies the ability of GCMs in capturing the observed changes in hydro-climatic attributes through retrospective analyses and also the different sources of errors that contribute to the inability in explaining the observed change.",

We have created the Data Access and Interoperability project to design a web-based platform, where interoperability between systems can be leveraged to allow greater data discovery, access, visualization and delivery. In the interoperable data platform, systems can integrate with each other to support the synthesis of climate and weather data. Interoperability is the ability for users to discover the available climate and weather data, preview and interact with the data, and acquire the data in common digital formats through a simple web-based interface.\nThe goal of the interoperable data platform is to leverage existing web services, implement the established standards and integrate with existing solutions across the earth sciences domain instead of creating new technologies.\nTowards this effort to improve the interoperability of the platform, we are collaborating with ESRI Inc. to provide climate and weather data via web services. In this presentation, we will discuss and demonstrate how to use ArcGIS to author RESTful based scientific web services using open standards. These web services are able to encapsulate the logic required to handle and describe scientific data through a variety of service types including, image, map, feature, geoprocessing, and their respective service methods. Combining these types of services and leveraging well-documented APIs, including the ArcGIS JavaScript API, we can afford to focus our attention on the design and development of user-friendly maps and apps. As a use case scenario, we will demonstrate the maps and apps that we developed as prototypes for CPC Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) products including Total Monthly Sea Ice Concentration that were built to improve the user’s overall experience.",

            "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter in investigating environmental, ecological processes and climate change at various scales, and is also valuable in the studies of evapotranspiration, soil moisture conditions, surface energy balance, and urban heat islands. These studies require thermal infrared (TIR) images at both high temporal and spatial resolution to retrieve LST. However, currently, no single satellite sensors can deliver TIR data at both high temporal and spatial resolution. Thus, various algorithms/models have been developed to enhance the spatial or the temporal resolution of TIR data, but rare of those can enhance both spatial and temporal details. This paper presents a new data fusion algorithm for producing Landsat-like LST data by blending daily MODIS and periodic Landsat TM datasets. The original Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) was improved and modified for predicting thermal radiance and LST data by considering annual temperature cycle (ATC) and urban thermal landscape heterogeneity. The technique of linear spectral mixture analysis was employed to relate the Landsat radiance with the MODIS one, so that the temporal changes in radiance can be incorporated in the fusion model. This paper details the theoretical basis and the implementation procedures of the proposed data fusion algorithm, Spatio-temporal Adaptive Data Fusion Algorithm for Temperature mapping (SADFAT). A case study was conducted that predicted LSTs of five dates in 2005 from July to October in Los Angeles County, California. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy for the whole study area ranged from 1.3 K to 2 K. Like existing spatio-temporal data fusion models, the SADFAT method has a limitation in predicting LST changes that were not recorded in the MODIS and/or Landsat pixels due to the model assumption.",

            "abstract": "The Tibetan Plateau is one of the world’s most vulnerable areas to global warming, and is home of the world’s largest group of mountain glaciers and high-altitude lakes. These lakes in general have shrunk significantly since the late Pleistocene, and are currently continuing to experience changes in their distribution and inundation area. In the meantime, Tibetan glaciers have also gone through dramatic changes as evidenced by paleo glacial relics and recent accelerated melting. The paper provides a regional-scale systematic assessment of both paleo and contemporary lake changes across the plateau using geo-spatial information and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating technologies. Using high-resolution satellite imagery of the plateau together with topographic data, this research recovered paleo lake extents for hundreds of contemporary lakes with visible paleo shore relics and estimated the amount of paleo lake shrinkage at regional scales. Both the basin-based water mass balance analysis using glacier/lake sizes and OSL dating of paleo shores suggest that paleo glaciers played a crucial role in the observed paleo lake shrinkage. Recent ~40 year lake dynamics was monitored by tracking thousands of Tibetan lakes using hundreds of satellite images. The results reveal that the overall total lake area has increased by ~26% between 1976 and 2009. The detected lake dynamics exhibit a strong spatial pattern generally but with local variations. The climate change and its regional glacier variations explain the general trend and the regional patterns of lake dynamics, respectively. The glacier mass monitored by GRACE satellites suggests a thinning trend over the past 12 years in the south while a gaining along the northern rim of the plateau. Basin-based analysis identifies glacial impacts on lake dynamics and explains many local variations. It can be concluded that glaciers play an important role in detected paleo as well as recent lake changes, and will continue to play a critical role in Tibetan lake dynamics in near future.",

            "abstract": "Optically-detected magnetometry using quantum defects in diamond, known as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers, is an emerging technology that allows high sensitivity and high resolution mapping of magnetic fields. Recent measurements of live magnetotactic bacteria demonstrate that such a “quantum diamond microscope” can image individual magnetic sources with <500 nm resolution, >1 mm field-of-view, and magnetic moment sensitivity <10-16 A m2 under ambient temperatures and pressures.\nThe unprecedented combination of spatial resolution and magnetic sensitivity of the quantum diamond microscope permits magnetic analyses of previously inaccessible geologic samples in which the regions of interest are mixed with undesirable magnetic field sources at the <<100 µm scale. Here we apply this technique to chondritic meteorites, primordial aggregates formed during the accretional phase of the solar system. These meteorites consist of fine-grained matrix mixed with chondrules and other inclusions with characteristic sizes of 0.1 - 1 mm. Each chondrule records a unique magnetic history and potentially constrains nebular magnetic fields, which likely played a key role in accretion disk dynamics. The quantum diamond microscope is unique in its ability to resolve the magnetic signal of single inclusions from surrounding material.\nWe applied the quantum diamond microscope to a variety of natural and artificial samples. Magnetic field maps of a single chondrule from the Allende CV carbonaceous chondrite (Fig. 1) show that the strongest magnetic sources are located in its 20 µm thick rim. Magnetic field sources in the chondrule interior occur in the mesostasis as isolated 10-100 µm patches that generate magnetic fields ~10 times weaker than the rim. These maps highlight the importance of spatial resolution for paleomagnetic measurements of chondrites; lower resolution measurements would permit the nearby rim material to dominate the magnetic signal, precluding accurate recovery of paleomagnetic data from chondrule interiors. In addition to these results we will report NV-diamond maps of other meteorites, including Antarctic finds, that contain secondary weathering veins. These maps will enable the exclusion of terrestrial magnetic signals in paleomagnetic analyses of these samples.",

            "abstract": "We integrate recent seismic reflection, geochemical and radiometric age data from basalts and sedimentary rocks along the Mendocino Transform (MT) and Gorda Escarpment, with basalt ages and biostratigraphy from the Miocene King Range terrane (KRT) of the Franciscan Complex, to better link the onshore and offshore geology and clarify how the northernmost San Andreas Fault (SAF) evolved. The MT extends eastward from the Gorda Ridge spreading center, along the S side of the Gorda Plate, to the edge of the North American plate (NAP) and separates the Cascadia subduction zone to the north, from the modern SAF to the south. Between 127.5º W and the shoreline, the MT and Mendocino Ridge (MR) align with the N side of the S-tilted Vizcaino structural block (VB), a remnant of NAP captured by the Pacific plate ~12 Ma, when the MT was 480 km S of its present location. The modern SAF bounds the NE-side of the VB. The SW side of the VB is bounded at the base of the continental slope by the proto-San Andreas fault (PSAF), where extinct remnants of the Pacific-Farallon ridge (PFR) interacted with the paleosubduction margin to form an incipient transform and several microplates, now part of the Pacific plate. Capture of the VB resulted from inboard breaking of the MT with a jump of the PSAF to the modern SAF. Dated ~20-12 Ma basaltic rocks from the MR between ~125º-128º W may be partly exhumed slab window underplating that formed beneath the VB during breakup of the PFR along the PSAF. High Fe and Ti relative to Mg in MR and KRT basalts, suggest eruption near ridge-transform intersections and perhaps, intratransform spreading.\nOnshore, high KRT relief aligns with the MR offshore. The KRT was assembled ~16-15 Ma (basalt K-Ar age; biostratigraphy); followed by its complex deformation and zeolitic metamorphism, indicating subduction to 5-8 km depth ~15-14 Ma and thermal metamorphism ~13.8 Ma (K-Ar age; vitrinite reflectance). The thermal overprint sets the KRT apart from adjacent accreted rocks. Similar MR and KRT age relations and ridge-transform intersection-related chemistry is consistent with collision of the PFR with the PSAF margin and development of a slab window beneath the VB and subducted KRT. This leads us to propose that the KRT is the NE corner of the VB, recently obducted onto the continental margin after northward translation with the Pacific plate.",

            "abstract": "Storm activity strongly influences coastal zones in both environmental/physical and socio-economical ways. Of particular concern are damages and major local impacts, including inundation and coastal erosion, that are caused by storm interaction with the ocean. Canada’s east coast is particularly influenced by winter storms which track along two favoured routes: the St. Lawrence Valley and the Eastern Seaboard, while the west coast is influenced by the North Pacific storm track and by \"atmospheric river\" events. Reanalysis provides an invaluable tool for studying the characteristics of storm events that are identified as causing the most severe impacts. However, the accurate depiction of storm activity using reanalysis products is not straightforward, given differences in spatial resolution and model physics. This study evaluates the representation of storm activity along the east and west Canadian coastlines by commonly used global reanalyses distributed by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (including NCEP-1, NCEP-2, and Twentieth Century Reanalysis) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (including ERA-Interim). Reanalysis datasets are evaluated using selected stations along each coastline and pressure tendency as a proxy for storm activity. Station selection criteria considered record length (~40 years or longer), reporting frequency (daily or shorter), proximity to coastline, and a relatively uniform spatial distribution. Comparisons are made using data extracted from the reanalysis grid point that is closest to each selected station. Preliminary results for reanalysis storm activity representations (proxies calculated annually) were presented at the 2013 AGU Fall Meeting (A53B-0161). Seasonal representations (JFM, AMJ, JAS, OND, and “extended winter” ONDJFM) have since been investigated to obtain a more detailed understanding of the Canadian coastal storm activity representations by these commonly used global reanalyses.",

            "abstract": "The Biomass Burn Observation Project (BBOP) was conducted between the beginning of July, 2013 and the end of October, 2013. This period overlapped the wildland fire season in the Pacific Northwest from July to mid September, and in October, prescribed agricultural burns in the lower Mississippi River Valley. Urban plumes from 7 cities in the NW and SE U.S. provided a contrasting set of observations. An extended aircraft deployment using the DOE G-1 was made possible by the fortuitous citing of the planes home base within 2 hours flight time of regions with a high incidence of wildland fires. In this presentation we concentrate on wildland fires and the time development of aerosol concentration, size distributions, and optical and physical properties as a function of plume age. Our focus is on physical properties of organic aerosols, a category that often exceeded 95% of total aerosol mass. Other BBOP presentations will highlight carbonaceous particle chemical composition and morphology as revealed by an SP-AMS, an SP2, and electron microscopy. Flight patterns were designed so as to sample plumes as close to a fire as allowed by aviation rules, followed by one or two sets of three to six transects covering a transport time of two to four hours. Average values of aerosol parameters are calculated for each plume transect with CO used as an inert tracer to account for dilution. It is found that OA increases by ~ 50% to 100%, with much of the increase occurring within the first hour. There is a corresponding increase in scattering which causes single scattering albedo to increase. At 2 to 4 hours downwind, plumes have evolved to yield net cooling, an effect that is much more pronounced if one takes into account known artifacts in PSAP measurements or uses the photothermal interferometer (PTI) to measure light absorption. The fires sampled have a relatively narrow range of modified combustion efficiencies, but it is centered on 0.9, at which point there are emission changes associated with smoldering vs. flaming combustion. Oxidant and nitrate production is a prominent feature of some plumes but absent in others.",

For large features (e.g., floodplain channels and ponds) historical data and maps are generally reliable. For smaller features (e.g., pools and riffles in small tributaries), field data from contemporary reference sites are a reasonable surrogate for historical data. Models are generally used for features that have no historical information or present day reference sites (e.g., beaver pond habitat). Each of these approaches contributes to a watershed-wide understanding of current biophysical conditions relative to potential conditions, which helps create not only a guiding vision for restoration, but also helps quantify and locate the largest or most important restoration opportunities. Common uses of geomorphic and biological reference conditions include identifying key areas for habitat protection or restoration, and informing the choice of restoration targets. Examples of use of each of these three approaches to define reference regimes in western USA illustrate how historical information and current research highlight key restoration opportunities, focus restoration effort in areas that can produce the largest ecological benefit, and contribute to estimating restoration potential and assessing likelihood of achieving restoration goals.",

            "abstract": "The process of evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the earth system, driving key land-surface processes in the energy, water and carbon cycles. Land-cover (LC) exerts multiple controls on ET, yet the global distribution of ET by LC and the related physical variables are poorly understood. The lack of quantitative understanding of global ET variation with LC begets considerable uncertainties regarding how ET and key land-surface processes will change alongside ongoing anthropogenic LC transformations.\nHere we apply statistical analysis and models to a new global ET database to advance our understanding of how annual actual ET varies with LC type. We derive global fields for each LC using linear mixed effect models (LMM) that use geographical and meteorological variables as possible independent regression variables.\nOur analysis of the new database provides new insights into how ET varies globally, providing more robust estimates of global ET rates for a broad range of LC types. Results from this study indicate two major advancements are required to improve our ability to predict how ET will vary with global change. First, further collection of ground truth observations of ET is needed to fill gaps in LC type and spatial location identified in this paper. Second, LC types need to be de-aggregated into finer categories to better characterize ET, to reduce uncertainty and weakened strength to predictor variables, associated by aggregation of heterogeneous LC types into one group; this will require the development of higher-resolution LC databases.",

            "abstract": "The geologic record holds a rich history of abrupt ecological and climate change events but our understanding of the ocean-atmosphere dynamics involved is not well developed, particularly for high CO2 warm climate states of the pre-Quaternary because the deep-sea records available typically come from low sedimentation rate (of 1-2 cm/kyr) sites that do not permit studies on times scales similar to or shorter than the ~1500 year mixing time of the ocean.\nThe principle objective of IODP Expedition 342 (drilled summer, 2012) was to target sediment drifts off Newfoundland with unusually high rates of sedimentation in order to investigate, for the first time, the stability of the Cenozoic greenhouse and icehouse climate states on sub-orbital timescales. The sedimentary sequences drilled accumulated directly under the flow path of the Deep Western Boundary Current and are well-situated to provide an archive of changes in chemistry, flow history, and depth structure of waters exiting the Nordic seas and Arctic Ocean during the transition from ice-free peak Cenozoic warmth in the early Eocene to the onset of Arctic sea ice formation and the growth of major ice sheets on Antarctica. The sediment drift deposits drilled are characterized by high sedimentation rates and clay-rich lithologies hosting spectacularly well-preserved calcareous microfossils (benthic and planktic) and sand-sized lithic fragments. These remarkable archives present an exciting opportunity to address some long-standing questions of relevance to this session. For example: (1) How stable was the Eocene greenhouse climate state? (2) Is large amplitude suborbital variability in Earth’s climate restricted to the late Pleistocene? (3) When and why did Earth shift to its present climate state with large ice sheets in both hemispheres? (4) How valid are suggestions of Eocene bipolar glaciation? (5) How and why did the carbonate chemistry (CCD) and circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean change in association with these shifts in global climate?",

Archaeologists have interpreted these movements as resulting from many factors, however the effects of climate change are often hypothesized as primary drivers that can “push” human groups to leave some regions, or “pull” them to move to others. In this paper, we will examine climate change over the past millennium-and-a-half, and in particular at the two widespread, though variable, climate change events known as the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age. We synthesize the latest paleoclimatological information on the timing and magnitude of these periods across the eastern Arctic, and assess the degree to which they coincide with current understanding of major population movements. In particular, we assess climate’s potential impact on 1) the expansion of Late Dorset Paleo-Inuit to the High Arctic; 2) the migration of Thule Inuit from Alaska to the eastern Arctic; and 3) the abandonment of northern regions and new settlement of southern regions by Inuit in the mid-second millennium AD.",

            "abstract": "The transport of carbon to the deep mantle via subduction zones is interrupted by outputs via the fore-arc, volcanic front, and back-arc regions. Whereas output fluxes for the front and back-arc locales are well constrained for Central America (CA) [1], the fore-arc flux via cold seeps and groundwaters is virtually unknown. We present new He and CO2 data for the inner fore-arc of Costa Rica and western Panama to complement our study [2] of offshore CO2fluxes on the outer-forearc.\nOn the Nicoya Peninsula, the Costa Rica Pacific coastline (including the Oso Peninsula) and the Talamanca Mountain Range, as well as coastal seeps in Panama, coupled CO2-He studies allow recognition of mantle (3He/4He up to 6RA) and crustal inputs to the volatile inventory. We associate the crustal component with CO2 derived from limestone (L) and organic sediments (S) on the subducting slab, and see a decrease in the L/S ratio trench-ward with the lowest values akin to those of diatomaceous ooze in the uppermost sequence of the subducting sediment package. This observation is consistent with the removal of the uppermost organic-rich sediment from deep subduction by under-plating. As the input carbon fluxes of the individual sedimentary layers are well constrained [3], we can limit the potential steady-state flux of carbon loss at the subaerial fore-arc to ~ 6 × 107 gCkm-1yr-1, equivalent to ~88% of the input flux of C associated with the ooze, or <4% of the total incoming sedimentary C.\nThis study confirms that the greatest loss of slab-derived carbon at the CA margin occurs at the volcanic front with recycling efficiencies between 12% (Costa Rica) and 29% (El Salvador) of the sedimentary input [1]. It also demonstrates the utility of the coupled He-CO2approach for mass balance studies at subduction zones.\n[1] De Leeuw et al., EPSL, 2007; [2] Furi et al., G-cubed, 2010; [3] Li and Bebout, JGR, 2005.",

This feature is primarily a consequence of the CO2 forcing alone (no feedbacks), which causes longwave (LW) radiative cooling in the stratosphere. In this study, we first separately diagnose upward and downward LW radiative flux perturbations caused by an increase of CO2 alone. We find the following: 1) The change in downward LW flux contributes at least as much to the CO2 radiative cooling in the upper stratosphere as the change in upward LW flux; 2) the increasing with height temperature profile of the stratosphere results in a cooling due to the change in upward LW flux and a warming in the lower stratosphere due to the change in downward LW flux, which can offset or even overturn the cooling due to changes in upward LW flux.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to investigate meso-scale equivalent temperatures (TE) in Kentucky and potential land cover influences. There is a unique opportunity to perform a study of this kind in Kentucky because of the observational infrastructure provided by the Kentucky Mesonet (www.kymesonet.org). This network maintains 65 research grade in situ weather and climate observing stations across the commonwealth. Equivalent temperatures were calculated utilizing high quality observations from 34 of these stations. In addition, the Kentucky Mesonet also offers higher spatial and temporal resolution than any of the previous research on this topic. As expected, the differences (TE-T) were greatest in summer, with averages of 40ºC, and smallest in winter, with averages of 10ºC. The higher TE values in the summer are attributed to increased atmospheric moisture content. Spatial patterns of these differences were also analyzed by season. In general, the differences were found to be larger in the Loess Plains (far western KY), Crawford-Mammoth Cave Uplands (western and south central KY), Western Highland Rim (western KY), and Eastern Highland Rim (south central KY). These differences are smaller during periods of drought, signifying less influence of moisture. Results of this research will improve understanding of how land use/land cover potentially affects meso-scale atmospheric heat content. Additionally, these results can be applied to areas located in similar climate zones, with comparable land cover attributes that do not have a comprehensive mesonet to conduct this type of research.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic Dark Earths are soils generated through long-term human inputs of organic and pyrogenic materials. These soils were originally discovered in the Amazon, and have since been found in Australia and in this case in Africa. While tropical soils are typically characterized by low soil organic matter (SOM) concentrations, African Dark Earths (AfDE) are black, highly fertile and carbon-rich soils formed through an extant but ancient soil management system. The objective of this study was to characterize the organic matter accumulated in AfDE and contrast it with non-AfDE soils. Characterization of bulk soil organic matter of several (n=11) AfDE and non-AfDE pairs of surface (0-15 cm) soils using thermal analysis techniques (TG-DSC-EGA) resulted in substantial differences in SOM composition and the presence of pyrogenic C. Such pyrogenic organic matter is generally considered recalcitrant, but the fertility gains in AfDE are generated by labile, more rapidly cycling pools of SOM. As a result, we characterized hot water- and pyrophosphate-extractable pools of SOM using fluorescence (EEM/PARAFAC) and high resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). EEM/PARAFAC data suggests that AfDE samples had a greater fraction of their DOM that was more humic-like than the paired non-AfDE samples. Similarly, FT-ICR-MS analyses of extracts suggest that differences among the sites analyzed were larger than between the paired AfDE and non-AfDE extracts. Overall, in spite of substantial differences in the composition of bulk SOM, the extractable fractions appear to be relatively similar between the AfDE and non-AfDE soils.",

            "abstract": "The San Juan Bautista (SJB) segment of the San Andreas fault is an area of complex faulting; it experiences steady creep and produces slow slip events (SSEs) and earthquakes. While the historic record indicates as many as seven M>6 events in the 19th century, the largest earthquake in the last 100 years was the 1998 M5.1 San Juan Bautista earthquake. This earthquake occurred within an area of heterogeneously distributed creep and subsequently creepmeters and strainmeters detected a triggered SSE equivalent to a M5 that evolved over a week. Here, we present the results of a multi-pronged investigation into slip throughout the earthquake cycle on the San Juan Bautista segment. This includes a re-examination of the aftershock sequence of the 1998 M5.1 earthquake, which more clearly defines the fault area ruptured in the event. A new set of characteristically repeating earthquakes (CREs) provides insight into the decay of the triggered SSE and the distribution of interseismic creep, which compares favorably with a model from geodetic data. The analysis indicates that at seismogenic depths, the time period of enhanced creep was as much as six years, rather than one week. CREs also reveal pulses of aseismic slip in the Northern portion of the Creeping Section of the San Andreas fault near SJB. We further use 20 years of InSAR data over the San Juan Bautista region to investigate the variability of surface creep within this time span; using the Small Baseline Subset approach to generate an ordered time series from a set of interferometric pairs. While distinguishing annual variations due to groundwater changes from tectonic motions is difficult, we use principle component analysis to isolate creep variations due to the 1998 earthquake and SSE.\nThese diverse data sets provide valuable information on the interactions between earthquakes and aseismic slip that occurs in various depth ranges in the fault zone. Results from this work provide insight into the role of aseismic fault slip transients in earthquake occurrence and clustering.",

            "abstract": "In 1960 Lorenz identified the chaotic nature of atmospheric dynamics, thus highlighting the importance of the discovery of chaos by Poincare, 70 years earlier, in the motion of three bodies. Chaos in the macroscopic world offered a natural way to explain unpredictability, that is, randomness. Concurrently with Poincare’s discovery, Boltzmann introduced statistical physics, while soon after Borel and Lebesgue laid the foundation of measure theory, later (in 1930s) used by Kolmogorov as the formal foundation of probability theory. Subsequently, Kolmogorov and Khinchin introduced the concepts of stochastic processes and stationarity, and advanced the concept of ergodicity. All these areas are now collectively described by the term “stochastics”, which includes probability theory, stochastic processes and statistics.\nAs paradoxical as it may seem, stochastics offers the tools to deal with chaos, even if it results from deterministic dynamics. As chaos entails uncertainty, it is more informative and effective to replace the study of exact system trajectories with that of probability densities. Also, as the exact laws of complex systems can hardly be deduced by synthesis of the detailed interactions of system components, these laws should inevitably be inferred by induction, based on observational data and using statistics.\nThe arithmetic of stochastics is quite different from that of regular numbers. Accordingly, it needs the development of intuition and interpretations which differ from those built upon deterministic considerations. Using stochastic tools in a deterministic context may result in mistaken conclusions. In an attempt to contribute to a more correct interpretation and use of stochastic concepts in typical tasks of nonlinear systems, several examples are studied, which aim (a) to clarify the difference in the meaning of linearity in deterministic and stochastic context; (b) to contribute to a more attentive use of stochastic concepts (entropy, statistical moments, autocorrelation, power spectrum), in model identification and parameter estimation from data; and (c) to provide interpretations to scaling laws based on maximization of entropy or entropy production, or else natural amplification of uncertainty, which are alternative to more common ones, like self-organization.",

Remarkably, this feature was totally unexpected and unpredicted by any prior theory or model. Since its discovery, over a dozen theories have been proposed to explain what physical phenomena might cause this remarkable feature. These possible explanations span from sources inside the termination shock at less than 100 AU to others some 1000 AU away - outside the heliosphere in the local interstellar medium. Here we 1) summarize the observational aspects of the Ribbon as established over IBEX’s first five full years of observations, 2) summarize the primary current ideas of what physical phenomena may be producing this feature, and 3) briefly examine the respective strengths and weaknesses of the various interpretations.",

            "abstract": "The influence of Gravitational Slope Deformations (GSD) on mountain belts’ erosion rate has been identified worldwide and more particularly in valleys that were affected by quaternary glacial retreat. However, owing to the lack of comprehensive identification of the predisposing factor influencing their spatial distribution, size and failure mechanisms, their effective impact on the landscape evolution remain difficult to quantify. In this contribution, we present the first regional-scale detailed GSD inventory of the entire upper Rhone catchment (Western Switzerland). The detection and mapping of GSD are performed by combining different remote sensing approaches. Moreover, a detailed characterization of the different inventoried events is proposed, taking into account their geometry, morphology and failure mechanism. Based on these analyses, more than 300 GSDs, corresponding to 11% of the entire study area, are identified. Spatial and statistical analyses highlight that GSDs are not uniformly distributed within the study area but that six clusters, encompassing more than 80% of the detected instabilities, can be highlighted. Our investigations demonstrate that the GSD clusters are mainly related to the coexistence of active tectonic processes (including high uplift gradients and seismic activity), large scale brittle tectonic weakness zones and high local relief. In addition, climate forcing is also identified to influence the distribution of GSD, via relief creation and in particular by the formation of overdeepened areas operated by glaciers during LGM. Conversely, lithological and structural conditions appear to primarily control the failure mechanism and the size of the detected GSDs but do not influence their spatial distribution. The strong impact of active tectonic processes on GSD distribution suggests that its effective role needs to be revaluated in order to better understand and quantify post-glacial erosion rate.",

            "abstract": "Temperature, food availability, and predation risk form vertical gradients determining growth and survival for fish in lakes and reservoirs. These gradients change on inter-annual, seasonal, and diel temporal scales and are strongly influenced by climatic variability, conflicting water demands and management. Temperatures associated with optimal growth and energy loss vary both among life stages and species of fish, but the quantity and quality of available food resources can significantly alter these thermal responses. Greater understanding of how water management affects the timing, magnitude, and duration of thermal stratification, and how key species and their supporting aquatic resources respond can improve strategies for development and operation of water storage facilities within the context of localized environmental and ecological constraints.\nAn emerging trend for coldwater reservoirs in the Pacific Northwest has been to re-introduce anadromous salmon above historically impassable dams. Thermal regimes and the existing ecological communities in the reservoirs and tributary habitats above these dams will determine the seasonal importance of lotic and lentic habitats for rearing or migration corridors. The feasibility of reservoir rearing and migration can be evaluated by combining mass- and species-specific thermal growth response curves with temporal dynamics in the vertical and longitudinal thermal structure of reservoirs and associated distribution of food resources (primarily zooplankton). The value of reservoirs as rearing habitats or migration corridors could be compared with coincident tributary conditions to predict the likely temporal-spatial distribution of optimal conditions for growth and survival of different species or life stages of salmonids within the watershed and how these conditions might change under different climatic or water management scenarios.",

Furthermore, these fluctuations have a turbulent, sporadic and intermittent character. This is particularly true for the well-known current disruption (CD) process, occurring at the substorm onset. Here, the features of the turbulence observed during a CD phenomenon are investigated, with a particular attention to the genereation of a 1/f spectrum in the MHD domain and its connection with a competing direct and inverse cascading process.

            "abstract": "Rapid disintegration of ice shelves (the floating extensions of marine-terminating glaciers) can lead to increasing ice discharge, thinning upstream ice sheets, rising sea level. Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, and Jacobshavn Isbrae, Greenland, provide prominent examples of these processes which evolve at decadal time scales. We here focus on three glacier systems north of 78 N in Greenland, each of which discharges more than 10 Gt per year of ice and had an extensive ice shelf a decade ago; Petermann Gletscher (PG), Niogshalvfjerdsfjorden (79N), and Zachariae Isstrom (ZI).\nWe summarize and discuss direct observations of ocean and glacier properties for these systems as they have evolved in the northwest (PG) and northeast (79N and ZI) of Greenland over the last two decades. We use a combination of modern and historical snapshots of ocean temperature and salinity (PG, 79N, ZI), moored observations in Nares Strait (PG), and snapshots of temperature and velocity fields on the broad continental shelf off northeast Greenland (79N, ZI) collected between 1993 and 2014.\nOcean warming adjacent to PG has been small relative to the ocean warming adjacent to 79N and ZI; however, ZI lost its entire ice shelf during the last decade while 79N, less than 70 km to the north of ZI, remained stable. In contrast, PG has thinned by about 10 m/y just prior to shedding two ice islands representing almost half its ice shelf area or a fifth by volume. At PG advective ice flux divergence explains about half of the dominantly basal melting while response to non-steady external forcing explains the other half. The observations at PG,79N, and ZI suggest that remotely sensed ambient surface ocean temperatures are poor proxies to explain ice shelf thinning and retreat. We posit that local dynamics of the subsurface ocean heat flux matters most. Ocean heat must first be delivered over the sill into the fjord and then within the ice shelf cavity to the base of the shelf near the grounding line. Models of glacier-ocean interaction must represent both bottom topography and closely related ocean dynamics and mixing at their dynamically relevant scales within a density stratified water column. Projects for such integrated ocean-glacier observations are in the planning stages for 79N and PG.",

            "abstract": "Transport of air from the troposphere to the stratosphere takes place through a variety of routes, including slow ascent through the Tropical Tropopause Layer, extra-tropical mixing in the \"middleworld\" and rapid lofting by deep convection (including pyro-convection) in mid and high latitudes. These transport processes determine the entry composition and humidity of the stratosphere, and thus play an important role in ozone layer stability and climate. This paper reviews the insights into these processes obtained through satellite profile measurements of atmospheric composition, humidity and clouds, in particular the measurements from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Aura satellite launched in 2004. We describe the available satellite observations and review findings from previous studies using these observations to investigate troposphere-to-stratosphere transport. In addition, we discuss the applicability of Lagrangian-based analysis approaches (including the \"Match\" technique) to quantifying the lofting of tropospheric air into the stratosphere by midlatitude deep convection.",

            "abstract": "The shift in funding is forcing scientists to promise transformative research for a pittance. To accomplish this, researchers need to transform their methodology to include societal buy-in, use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology, and cross-discipline platform usage. As the cutting edge of research expands to view the system on the global scale with extremely fine resolution, fiscally reasonable budgets present a challenge to be met. Consider how do we measure a specific variable over 45-degrees of latitude in an isolated and hostile region of Earth – the total electron count over the South Pole? This work examines this transformative research using hosted payloads on buoys, balloons, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We will show cutting edge research occurring simultaneous with education and public outreach, offering societal buy-in through interactive websites and student-built hosted payloads. These interactions provide a vision to the public and a new database to the scientists. The use of COTS technology and cross-discipline (oceanography and space) platforms keep the cost low. We will discuss a general methodology for accomplishing transformative research in a challenging fiscal environment through integration of COTS technology, assimilative and first principle models, and observing systems simulation experiments (OSSEs).",

            "abstract": "This presentation describes the results of in-flight characterization of the S-NPP Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS) charge-coupled device (CCD) performance during the first nearly three years of the OMPS mission in orbit. Data from OMPS’s three two-dimension CCD arrays have been collected to characterize in-flight detector behaviors. Our results show that offset, gain, and dark current rate trends remain within sensor requirement limits. System linearity performance trends are stable. The distribution of individual pixel dark rates is slowly growing as expected from pre-launch analyses. The current in-flight dark and linearity calibration corrections provide Sensor Data Records (SDRs) with insignificant error after correction of less than an average of ~0.1% in the Earth radiance retrieval. The instrument optics is less stable than predicted leading to intra-orbit wavelength scale variations as the temperature gradients vary across the instrument. Measurement-based estimates of these effects are as large a ±0.02 nm and are used to make corrections to within +-0.005 nm on a granule by granule basis. Examination of reflectivity, aerosol and ozone EDRs provide evidence of absolute calibration errors with a significant cross track variation. A soft calibration adjustment is under development to remove them.",

            "abstract": "The availability of multi-point observations through the ion diffusion region has provided a wealth of information on the workings of magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause and at the nightside plasma sheet. Ion inertia and finite gyroradius result in clear Hall effects on ion inertial length scales that have been observed by single and multi-point spacecraft resulting in a fairly detailed understanding of that physics. The role of Hall dynamics on establishing the reconnection rate, and the outflow conditions is well understood. Electron violation of the frozen-in condition is much more subtle and rarely observed at the X-point; indirect evidence has been more frequently observed in parallel electric fields. The waves responsible for this violation and for resultant energy conversion are at the forefront of observational studies. The contraction of islands centered at multiple O-points could provide for rapid energy conversion. However, observations of in vivo FTEs at the dayside and classical plasmoids at the nightside, are rare even near the expected most probable location of reconnection. Rather, asymmetric proto-plasmoids and dipolarization (a.k.a reconnection) fronts at the nightside signify distinctly different evolution of the reconnection geometry from that of X and O points. Operating within meso-scale (1-3Re) flows the inherently kinetic (at electron inertial scales embeded in ion inertial scale current systems) processes at such fronts play a significant role in the dynamics and drive global magnetospheric energy conversion and flux transport. Recent studies suggest that the entire magnetosphere is, in fact, connected front-to-back by reconnection pulses resulting in meso-scale flows. The upcoming Heliophysics System Observatory, motivated by the launch of MMS and the coordinated observations of THEMIS, ARTEMIS, Van Allen probes and other space and ground assets will answer key questions on this subject locally, regionally and globally.",

            "abstract": "The onset time for modern-style plate tectonics is still heavily debated among geoscientists. Proposed timings range from the Phanerozoic to the Hadean. Here I present a new theoretical approach to tackle this question. I combine ideas of nuclear astrophysics and geochronology and apply the concept of sudden nucleosynthesis to calculate so-called nucleogeochronometric Rhenium-Osmium model ages. Sudden nucleosynthesis has been suggested by nuclear theory [1-2] as a possible mechanism for the creation of the heavy isotopes. Hence, this concept may generally be used to identify rapid (r-) neutron-capture process events. For Earth, nucleogeochronometric model age calculations based upon published pyroxenite and komatiite data [3-5] point to an r-process event around 3 Ga. Since the r-process requires high neutron densities and temperatures within seconds, a gravitational core collapse forming at least a part of the inner core is discussed as a possible cause, thus initiating modern-style plate tectonics at that time. This age is in line with an earlier proposed value of 2.7 Ga for an inner core forming event [6], pronounced changes in the magnitude of the geomagnetic field and geological evidence like the onset of extensive plutonism and crust formation starting around the Archean-Proterozoic transition. Besides, results from nucleogeochronometric age calculations for published peridotitic pentlandites [7] lead to corrections as to their previously inconsistent model ages: These are now in good agreement with their Proterozoic 1.43 Ga isochronous regression line, supporting the model.\n[1] Burbidge et al.

In this study, we survey the DC3 storms showing evidence of trace gas convective transport, scavenging, and production of nitrogen oxides from lightning by examining vertical profiles of carbon monoxide (a marker of convective transport), volatile organic compounds with a range of solubilities, nitrogen oxides, and soluble trace gases such as nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide, and sulfur dioxide. These results are placed in context of other field campaigns (e.g. STERAO) to determine how typical the DC3 observations are to other time periods and locations. The measurements also allow us to evaluate the capabilities of chemistry transport models in representing deep convection and chemistry. While convection-resolving simulations give more explicit information on the storm processes affecting the composition of the troposphere, air quality and chemistry climate models rely on convective parameterizations to represent these convective processes. Thus, we analyze results from the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), which are conducted at 15 km grid spacing requiring a convective parameterization. The capability of WRF-Chem to represent the DC3 storms is evaluated by examining the timing, location, and convective strength using radar and lightning data. By producing profiles similar to those constructed from the measurements, the comparison between model and observations should identify gaps in our understanding of convective processing of different trace gases.",

Trade is particularly important for understanding human impacts on the phosphorus (P) cycle, as mineral P reserves are geopolitically concentrated. Yet, P use is only one component of the broader agro-environmental dimensions of globalized agriculture. Understanding complex interactions among multiple components of land use and resource management in trade networks is needed. We fuse comprehensive global agricultural datasets illustrating key facets of land use and management with bilateral trade statistics to explore phosphorus-use efficiency in relation to other agro-environmental indicators. Our findings illustrate tradeoffs among phosphorus-use efficiency, nitrogen-use efficiency, crop-water productivity, and overall crop yields embodied within trade networks. Disparities in the land-use intensity of different exporting countries reflect the types of commodities produced, the degree of export-orientation, and the biophysical context of production. Phosphorus inefficiencies could compound other problems, such as water scarcity, but our findings also reveal places with relatively high efficiency across multiple indicators—offering insight on how overall resource management can be balanced for export production. Using the prevailing agricultural systems of key exporting regions as a backdrop, we highlight opportunities to leverage agricultural efficiencies embodied in global trade networks to conserve multiple resources.",

Clearly the most robust and best informed inversions for modern ice mass changes will utilize the GNET displacement history, GRACE's mass fields, and ice surface height changes derived from repeat altimetry and repeat optical DEMs. These inversions will also be guided by measured changes in ice flow rates, surface mass balance estimates from numerical weather models, and models of glacial isostatic adjustment. Designing an optimal inverse method requires us to asses and exploit the strengths of each class of observation in order to offset the main weaknesses in the others. GPS and GRACE are the only techniques that directly sense ice mass changes, and we present an analysis of accerations in both time series which demonstrates that GNET senses the lateral variability of ice mass accelerations in SE Greenland with much better resolution than does GRACE. When an optimal model for modern ice mass changes is achieved, and the associated elastic adjustments are subtracted from the GPS displacements, the residual displacements can be used to characterize visoelastic adjusments. These should promote an improved 'PGR correction' for GRACE.",

            "abstract": "In 2000, while visiting Arches National Park in Utah, I had my first encounter with my science in the context of interpretation. During a ranger walk, a student intern at the park explained the concept of the radiation budget (for the desert surface, in her case) to the group of visitors. As a NASA scientist on the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) science team, a team whose entire focus is on understanding Earth’s energy budget, that visit made quite an impression on me: here was my science connected to the immediate and personal experience of that desert environment in a way that even my then 4-year-old daughter could take something from.\nSome years later, when I was invited to speak to a group of interpreters through the NASA/National Park Service “Earth to Sky” project, I jumped at the chance. Since then, I have had several opportunities to interact with interpreters, through additional “Earth to Sky” workshops as well as during a meeting of the National Association for Interpretation in my hometown. While I was invited to speak to these groups as a subject matter expert, I always learned at least as much as they did from the interaction. The standard practice for Earth to Sky is to pair presenters with an interpreter coach to help fine-tune the presentation for the audience – a valuable practice for presentations to any audience, if one can find an appropriate coach. The mere idea that interpretation is a profession, with research and guidelines and best practices, was completely eye opening to me at one of my first Earth to Sky events.\nSo how to leverage interpretation for science communication? Rather than expecting busy scientists to learn everything about interpretation, a more effective approach is likely the one taken in the Earth to Sky workshop series, where scientists and interpreters work together for an intensive period to share information and approaches, and the interpreters are then able to take appropriate science elements to weave into their own interpretative practices in their local settings. This presentation will share experiences and lessons learned from these interactions, will further explain the Earth to Sky model, and will suggest ways that scientists can make connections with interpreters who may be able to communicate their science in unique and personal ways.",

While many studies have examined changes in student engagement and interest in the STEM fields as a result of participating in interdisciplinary activities such as this one, relatively fewer have focused on quantifying changes in student content knowledge. The primary purposes of this paper are to (1) describe our interdisciplinary STEM module in detail, and (2) report immediate changes in students’ knowledge of basic meteorological and engineering content as a result of their participation in the module. Results from a quick, easy-to-administer assessment instrument given to students immediately before and after their participation in the 1-hour module indicated that they learned basic content in both meteorology and engineering. Mean improvement of scores on the assessment questions was 40.2%, a change that was statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Future studies of student learning could gain additional insight into the value of the module by lengthening the time between student participation in the module and the administration of the post-module assessment.",

On alpine climbing expeditions in the Greater Ranges of Asia during 2012-14, I had the opportunity to contribute to the scientific understanding and stewardship of the places I visit for personal fulfillment. Using the “matchmaking” services of Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation, I was connected with researchers to conduct field studies in some of the world’s highest and most remote mountains. Here, I present work from two projects: 1) Assessing the role of biological weathering in shaping high altitude landscapes in the Pamir Mountains of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and 2) Understanding the effects of anthropogenic biomass burning on glacial thinning in the Everest Region, Nepal. Both collaborative efforts succeeded in collecting valuable data from challenging environments using a small research budget. As a scientist with expertise in terrestrial paleoclimate and stable isotope geochemistry, these projects served to expand my research horizons and areas of professional interest. Citizen science can not only add a sense of value to otherwise selfish endeavors such as high altitude climbing, but also serve to connect scientists with the communities who appreciate their efforts most.",

There is also increasing evidence that exogenous environmental drivers, such as climate, induce spatial and temporal synchrony in a wide range of ecological variables. Using Moran’s I and Pearson’s correlation, we quantified the synchrony of dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC) and quality (DOM; e.g., specific UV absorbance, Fluorescence Index, PARAFAC), nutrients, discharge and temperature in 40 streams that span an agriculture gradient (0 to >70% cropland), over 10 years. We then used breakpoint regression, 2D-Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and significant zero crossings (SiZer) analyses to quantify the prevalence of nonlinearity and ecological thresholds (breakpoints) where applicable. There was a high degree of synchrony in DOM quality (r > 0.7) but not DOC (r < 0.4). The degree of synchrony was driven in part by the catchment’s land use. With respect to the nonlinear analyses we found non-linearity in ~50% of bivariate datasets analyzed. Non-linearity was also driven in part by the catchment’s land use. Breakpoints defined different DOM properties. Nonlinearity and synchronous behaviour in DOM are intimately linked to land use.",

            "abstract": "In order to infer mesospheric wind velocities, polar mesospheric cloud (PMC) pattern variations are investigated using images from consecutive orbits taken by the Cloud Imaging and Particle Size instrument (CIPS) aboard the AIM satellite. CIPS measurements are analyzed to detect patterns that repeat from one orbit to the next, but are displaced in location; the displacement provides a measure of the wind velocity. Pattern matching is achieved by re-sampling the CIPS data to a standard geographic grid with a horizontal resolution of 0.2° longitude × 0.05° latitude (~25 km2), and correlating patterns within geographic frames of size 24° longitude × 3.6° latitude. Such a frame size is arbitrarily chosen, but it covers a hierarchy of cloud structures including scales as large as several hundred kilometers. A relatively larger frame is required because after ~90 minutes, the time of one orbit, the smaller scale features are no longer conserved. Several thousand pairs, taken from 10-14 July 2007, are matched to derive the statistics. These pairs are mostly evenly distributed at longitudes and latitudes north of 70⁰N for each given day. The results suggest that the zonal velocity probability distribution during this 5-day period was peaked at around -40m/s with a 1-σ scatter of ~35m/s. The meridional velocity distribution peaked at 0 m/s with a 1-σ scatter of ~25m/s. These prevailing velocities can be determined with high precision because the corresponding patterns are shifted by at least half of the frame size from one orbit to the next.\nThe CIPS cloud albedo on consecutive orbits is also examined for variations at fixed locations. The statistical results suggest that the mean cloud albedo within a given frame will most likely be weakened or strengthened by < 30% on consecutive orbits, although larger variations can occur with lower probability. Such a conclusion applies to both bright and dim clouds. This indicates that within 90 minutes the cloud brightness for a given location changes moderately rather than drastically in the next orbit. However, it is also found that the correlation of the two frames at a fixed location is generally poor. These findings suggest that cloud patterns are subject to wind advection, but the bright patch or (dim) cloud voids are more extended in size than the movement that occurs within 90 minutes.",

            "abstract": "Arguments against Pangea B are that the Intra-Pangean Paleomagnetic anomaly was based on poor data, and that there is no geological evidence for the megashear required to bring about Pangea A prior to the Triassic. I address the implications of map-view bends (oroclines) of the Carboniferous Variscan orogen, the orogen inferred to record the Pangea-forming Gondwana – Laurussia continental collision upon closure of an intervening Rheic ocean.\nThe Variscan orogen of Iberia has been depicted as a convex to the west arcuate feature (the Ibero-Armorican Arc). The IAA assumes continuity of geological belts of southern Great Britain, and is cored by the Cantabrian orocline, an isoclinal orocline affecting the Gondwana foreland fold and thrust belt. We demonstrated that the Cantabrian orocline is coupled to a more southerly convex to the west Central Iberian Orocline. Together these coupled oroclines (1) define a continental scale S-shaped fold of the Variscan orogen; and (2) require that the continuation of the Rheic suture and Variscan geological belts lies to the west and south. Palinspastic restoration of the oroclines yields a 2300 km long previously linear orogen. Paleomagnetic, structural and stratigraphic data constrain orocline formation to a 10 Ma interval starting at ~ 300 Ma, involving 1100 km of relative translation. The Rheic suture and geological belts in southeastern England similarly define a convex to the west ‘Welsh’ orocline: a NNE-striking serpentinite belt in SE Ireland is a continuation of the Lizard ophiolite around the orocline. This geometry implies that the Rheic suture and more internal geological belts cross back into Britain to the north, and explains paleomagnetic data that suggest 180° of rotation of southern Britain. Orocline formation is probably coeval with Cornubian magmatism and requires subduction and large-scale translations as late as 270 Ma.\nThe Iberian and Welsh oroclines require thousands of kms of translation between 310 and 270 Ma at rates of as high as 10 cm/a. The creation of large-scale oroclines, the implied rates of translation, and the voluminous syn-kinematic magmatism all points to the need for subduction of oceanic lithosphere within the heart of Pangea well into the Permian and suggests that the ‘megashear’ may have consisted of one or more subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "Our piece of cosmic real-estate, the heliosphere, is the domain of all human existence -- an astrophysical case-history of the successful evolution of life in a habitable system. By exploring our global heliosphere and its myriad interactions, we develop key physical knowledge of the interstellar interactions that influence exoplanetary habitability as well as the distant history and destiny of our solar system and world. IBEX was the first mission to explore the global heliosphere and in concert with Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 is discovering a fundamentally new and uncharted physical domain of the outer heliosphere. The enigmatic IBEX ribbon is an unanticipated discovery demonstrating that much of what we know or think we understand about the outer heliosphere needs to be revised. The next quantum leap enabled by IMAP will open new windows on the frontier of Heliophysics at a time when the space environment is rapidly evolving. IMAP with 100 times the combined resolution and sensitivity of IBEX will discover the substructure of the IBEX ribbon and will reveal in unprecedented resolution global maps of our heliosphere. The remarkable synergy between IMAP, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 will remain for at least the next decade as Voyager 1 pushes further into the interstellar domain and Voyager 2 moves through the heliosheath. Voyager 2 moves outward in the vicinity of the IBEX ribbon and its plasma measurements will create singular opportunities for discovery in the context of IMAP’s global measurements. IMAP, like ACE before it, will be a keystone of the Heliophysics System Observatory by providing comprehensive cosmic ray, energetic particle, pickup ion, suprathermal ion, neutral atom, solar wind, solar wind heavy ion, and magnetic field observations to diagnose the changing space environment and understand the fundamental origins of particle acceleration. Thus, IMAP is a mission whose time has come. IMAP is the highest ranked next Solar Terrestrial Probe in the Decadal Survey, is ready to be implemented and explores fundamental outstanding problems in Heliophysics concerning the outer boundaries of our solar system, the physics of interstellar interactions with the solar wind, the origin and physics of the IBEX ribbon, and the fundamental origins particle acceleration throughout the heliosphere.",

Our society’s heavy reliance on technologies affected by the space environment, an enormous number of airline customers, interest in space tourism, and the developing plans for long-duration human exploration space missions are clear examples that demonstrate urgent needs for space weather models and detailed understanding of space weather effects and risks. Since its inception, the LWS program has provided a vehicle to innovate new mechanisms for conducting research, building highly effective interdisciplinary teams, and ultimately in developing the scientific understanding needed to transition research tools into operational models that support the predictive needs of our increasingly space-reliant society. The advances needed require broad-based observations that cannot be obtained by large missions alone. The Decadal Survey (HDS, 2012) outlines the nation’s needs for scientific development that will build the foundation for tomorrow’s space weather services. Addressing these goals, LWS must develop flexible pathways to space utilizing smaller, more diverse and rapid development of observational platforms. Expanding utilization of ground-based assets and shared launches will also significantly enhance opportunities to fulfill the growing LWS data needs. Partnerships between NASA divisions, national/international agencies, and with industry will be essential for leveraging resources to address increasing societal demand for space weather advances. Strengthened connections to user communities will enhance the quality and impact of deliverables from LWS programs. Thus, we outline the developing vision for the future of LWS, stressing the need for deeper scientific understanding to improve forecasting capabilities, for more diverse data resources, and for project deliverables that address the growing needs of user communities.",

            "abstract": "While a major source of uncertainty in global climate model predictions is due to the coarseness of their resolution, a significant amount of error is also generated due to the lack of information regarding the interactions between atmospheric and land parameters over time. When the behavior of a certain parameter is not clearly understood it is frequently estimated as one specific value while in reality it may vary with time and space. Remote sensing is allowing researchers to better estimate each of these parameters so one can see how they change with time.\nThis study is an effort to improve our knowledge of the inter-annual and seasonal variability in radiation, water and the carbon cycle using remote sensing products on a global scale. By examining monthly data over a multi-year period (data parameter and source are listed in Table 1) for fluorescence, groundwater, net radiation, vegetation indices, precipitation, soil moisture and evapotranspiration, we should be able to determine the behavior and interactions between these parameters and better understand how they vary together seasonally, annually and year to year. With this information it is our hope that global climate models can be improved to better understand what is occurring climatologically in the present as well as more accurately make predictions about future conditions.\nTable 1.

            "abstract": "Major, trace element and isotopic data along the SW Indian Ridge identify two major geochemical provinces centered on the Marion and Bouvet Hotspots with prominent correlations between the isotopic and major element composition of basalts, ridge depth, and mineralogy of spatially associated mantle peridotites. Both consist of axial rises with elevated ridge topography. Both the Bouvet and Marion Hotspots have small volcanic fluxes, while the associated axial-rises contrast sharply in size and geochemistry. The Bouvet Rise is small, proportional to the size of the hotspot, while the Marion, with Iceland, is one of the two largest oceanic rises. A mantle plume associated with the Marion Hotspot is incapable of supporting the rise; rather it appears to be supported by a large region of anomalously depleted mantle1. The Bouvet Plume, which likely originates above the mantle transition zone, appears to have had a direct control on the geometry of the western SWIR through time and thus likely does support the short Bouvet Rise. The bathymetric contrast between these two rises corresponds to notable differences in isotopic geochemistry: while the Marion Rise basalts exhibit a complex pattern of variability – it is a region where the classic ‘Dupal’ anomaly is well expressed, consistent with a major Archean mantle source that likely represents delaminated metasomatized sub-continental lithosphere entrained in the shallow mantle beneath the Ridge during formation of the central and SW Indian Ridges with the breakup of Gondwana. This is supported by a similar isotopic anomaly along the Rodriguez Rise on the Central Indian Ridge that also appears related to Gondwana breakup. By contrast, the mantle beneath the Bouvet Rise appears to represent largely post-Archean asthenosphere pulled from beneath the Gondwana lithosphere, interacting with a local small plume reflecting a local heterogeneity in the upper mantle.\n1.

            "abstract": "The nominal equilibrium climate sensitivity of about 3°C for doubled CO2 is obtained from direct climate model calculations and from simulations of the historical surface temperature record. A similar value of equilibrium climate sensitivity has been inferred from the geological ice core record. A further independent estimate of climate sensitivity can be derived directly from the atmospheric temperature, cloud, and absorbing gas structure. Attribution of individual contributions to the terrestrial greenhouse effect by individual atmospheric constituents shows that water vapor and clouds account for about 75% of the total greenhouse effect, while CO2 and the other minor non-condensing green house gases account for the remaining 25%. It is generally understood that water vapor and cloud contributions to the greenhouse effect arise as feedback effects, and that the non-condensing greenhouse gas contribution can be identified as the radiative forcing component. From this alone, a climate feedback sensitivity of f = 4, or about 5°C for doubled CO2 can be inferred. Accounting further for the negative temperature lapse rate feedback that is not directly included in the attribution analysis, and allowing for a residual non-condensing component of the water vapor feedback, brings the equilibrium climate sensitivity that is inferred from atmospheric structural analysis to the 3°C range for doubled CO2, in good agreement with the equilibrium climate sensitivity that is obtained from comparisons to historical and geological global temperature changes.",

            "abstract": "Model predictions are uncertain because of errors in model parameters, future forcing terms, and model concepts. The latter remain the largest and most difficult to assess source of uncertainty in long term model predictions. We first review existing methods to evaluate conceptual model uncertainty. We argue that they are highly sensitive to the ingenuity of the modeler, in the sense that they rely on the modeler’s ability to propose alternative model concepts. Worse, we find that the standard practice of stochastic methods leads to poor, potentially biased and often too optimistic, estimation of actual model errors. This is bad news because stochastic methods are purported to properly represent uncertainty. We contend that the problem does not lie on the stochastic approach itself, but on the way it is applied. Specifically, stochastic inversion methodologies, which demand quantitative information, tend to ignore geological understanding, which is conceptually rich. We illustrate some of these problems with the application to Mar del Plata aquifer, where extensive data are available for nearly a century. Geologically based models, where spatial variability is handled through zonation, yield calibration fits similar to geostatiscally based models, but much better predictions. In fact, the appearance of the stochastic T fields is similar to the geologically based models only in areas with high density of data. We take this finding to illustrate the ability of stochastic models to accommodate many data, but also, ironically, their inability to address conceptual model uncertainty. In fact, stochastic model realizations tend to be too close to the “most likely” one (i.e., they do not really realize the full conceptualuncertainty). The second part of the presentation is devoted to argue that acknowledging model uncertainty may lead to qualitatively different decisions than just working with “most likely” model predictions. Therefore, efforts should concentrate on devising alternative conceptual models. As a result, the traditional scientific method of validation and peer review may turn out to be a much more effective method for assessing uncertainty than purely statistics based methods.",

            "abstract": "Because of a marked influence of warm Atlantic water to primary productivity in the Barents Sea, the marine ecosystem in northernmost Fennoscandia is sensitive to disturbances in the North Atlantic oceanographic system. The 8.2 ka climate event, according to current knowledge, was triggered by a disturbance in the North Atlantic Thermohaline circulation. This suggests concurrent and strong climatic and marine cooling in the area covering the northernmost parts of Finland, Norway, and Sweden during the climate event. In this area ecosystem response to the 8.2 ka event can therefore be expected to have been prominent, which in turn should be reflected in the contemporary human socio-economic systems.\nA study that employs lithic technological, statistical, and spatial analyses of Late Mesolithic (ca. 8450–6850 cal BP) lithic technology and settlement configuration in the area indicates that lithic technology and settlement patterns were reorganised following the climatic and marine cooling. The studied groups changed their lithic technology as a result of developments that led to increased use of terrestrial resources and an accompanying long-distance coast/inland residential mobility pattern. Besides lithic technological changes and long-distance mobility on land, decreased marine productivity probably also explains the disappearance of semi-subterranean houses from the coast at ca. 8200 cal BP, while their reappearance after ca. 7500 cal BP can be linked to a increased influx of warm salty water into the Barents Sea.\nThe results suggest that in the past a long period of decreased influx of Atlantic water into the Barents Sea has had disastrous consequences for the marine ecosystem. At present the Barents Sea fisheries have notable economic importance and produce, for example, over 90% of the Norwegian Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) catch.",

            "abstract": "It is generally accepted that the Advection-Dispersion Equation (ADE) is a poor representation of transport for problems beyond assessing the extent of a solute plume. Specifically, mixing must be honored for proper assessment of chemical reactions. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a transport approach that acknowledges dispersion (for adequate representation of solute spreading) and mixing (for adequate representation of chemical reactions). Non-local in time solute transport formulations have been considered a hopeful alternative to the ADE because they overcome many of its limitations. We have computed the deviation from gaussian mixing obtained in transport through highly heterogeneous media and compared it with that of non-local in time formulations. We find that these underestimate such deviation. Therefore, they are not sufficient; more sophisticated approaches are needed. An appealing option is to extend non-locality also to space, but this opens a broad range of possibilities. We explore some non-local in space and time formulations, so as to define the constraints that these must meet in order to be valid representations (valid in the sense of reproducing the actual spreading and mixing rates) of solute transport through heterogeneous media.",

            "abstract": "Protein stable isotope fingerprinting (P-SIF) is a method to measure the carbon isotope ratios of whole proteins separated from complex mixtures, including cultures and environmental samples. The goal of P-SIF is to expose the links between identity and function in microbial ecosystems by (i) determining the ratios of 13C/12C (values of δ13C) for different taxonomic divisions, and (ii) using those values as clues to the metabolic pathways employed by the respective organisms, while (iii) not perturbing the system, i.e., not adding exogenous substrates or isotope labels. To accomplish this, we employ two-dimensional HPLC to resolve a sample containing ca. 5-10 mg of mixed proteins into 960-1440 fractions. Each fraction then is split in two aliquots: The first is digested with trypsin for peptide sequencing, while the second is measured in triplicate using an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer interfaced with a spooling wire microcombustion device. Data from pure cultures show that bacteria have a narrow distribution of protein δ13C values within individual taxa (±0.7-1.2‰, 1σ). This is moderately larger than the mean precision of the triplicate isotope measurements (±0.5‰, 1σ) and may reflect heterogeneous distribution of 13C among the amino acids. When cells from different species are mixed together prior to protein extraction and separation, the results can predict accurately (to within ±1σ) the δ13C values of the original taxa. The number of data points required for this endmember prediction is ≥20/taxon, yielding a theoretical resolution of ca. 10 taxonomic units/sample. Initial tests on environmental samples suggest the approach will be useful to determine the overall trophic breadth of mixed microbial ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Evaluation of volcanic hazard is often difficult, particularly at those areas, where no volcanic events have been documented in the historical time or even longer. Here, we present new geochronological data to demonstrate that relatively young volcanism occurred in eastern-central Europe, at the Ciomadul volcano (southeast Carpathians, Romania) and there is a potential for future rejuvenation. The eruption ages of the Ciomadul are constrained by (U-Th)/He zircon dating corrected for U-series disequilibrium and this suggests that the volcanic activity occurred from 150 ka to 32 ka. Following a lava dome building stage, a more explosive eruption phase took place at 50-32 ka. Subplinian to plinian eruptions produced volcanic ash clouds that blanketed extended areas. The U-Th and U-Pb age spectra of the zircons from the 50-32 ka volcanic rocks ranges over 300 ka and is thus indicative of a long-lasting intrusive body beneath the volcano. Interior-rim age difference within individual zircons is as much as 340-88 ka. Thus, a subterraneous magma system was already under construction ca. 150-200 ka before the onset of volcanic eruptions. The peak zircon crystallization age falls between 220-100 ka, and there are only sparse age data <100 ka indicating that conditions became unfavourable for zircon crystallization, possibly due to sluggish precipitation at low temperatures or complete solidification within some parts of the magma system. Nevertheless, rim-analysis (outer 4 μm) of the youngest, 32 ka zircons shows that crystallization occurred also at 60-80 ka, but this still precedes the eruption age by about 30-40 ka. All samples contain zircons with widely differing ages which cover the entire 300 ka period of magma evolution at Ciomadul. These data reflect that a melt-bearing crystal mush body could have continuously existed beneath the volcano. Intermittent injections of hotter magma into the cold crystal mush could help to maintain the magma system over 100’s ka. Magnetotelluric data indicates that melt-bearing crystal mush body could still be present beneath Ciomadul. Although 32 ka has elapsed since the last eruption, the prolonged lifetime of the magma system and the presence of partial melt still beneath the volcano suggests that rejuvenation of volcanic activity cannot be dismissed.",

It is a highly vulnerable arid region whose freshwater system is at a tipping point due to the confluence of severely limited water supplies, rapid population growth, refugee influxes, climate change and variability, internal and transboundary competition for shared freshwater resources, and institutional impediments. Our team is engaged in an interdisciplinary effort aimed at developing a new approach to evaluate policies that enhance sustainability of freshwater resource systems. Our work adopts a multi-agent modeling framework that incorporates institutional complexity to evaluate policy instruments for improving water security in Jordan. We are developing this model using a modular approach, integrating biophysical modules that simulate natural and engineered phenomena (e.g., groundwater-surface water flow, reservoir storage, network routing, salt balance, and crop yield) with human modules that represent behavior at multiple scales of decision making. The human modules adopt a multi-agent simulation approach, defining agents as autonomous decision-makers at the government, administrative, organizational, and user levels. Our goal is to construct a suite of policy intervention scenarios that will form the basis for analysis of freshwater sustainability. This work has benefitted from a strong working relationship with leaders of the water sector in Jordan. Our approach and the merit of the policy interventions should have significant transfer value to other water-stressed regions.",

Recently, the detection of dust emission from \"main-belt comets\" and of hydration features and possible water ice absorption on some main-belt asteroids together with theories of migration of small bodies in the solar system cast some doubts on the classical picture.\nCeres, contributing about 30 % of the mass of the asteroid belt, is thought to be differentiated into an icy core and a silicate mantle and hydrated minerals were found on infrared spectra of its surface. A marginal detection of OH, a photodissociation product of water was reported in 1991, but questioned by later, more sensitive observations.. Observations of Ceres with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI) on the Herschel Space Observatory in the context of the MACH 11 guaranteed time program and with a follow up DDT program detected water vapour from Ceres on 3 occasions in 2012 and 2013. The production rate of water on Ceres is a few times 1026 s−1.\nThe signal from the water vapour from Ceres was found to be linearly polarized during some of the observations, with the absorption being stronger in the horizontal branch. The measured line area ratio of up to 2.5 between H and V polarizations is so far unexplained.\nThe water signal varies on time scales of hours. Those variations are interpreted as localized sources on Ceres surface rotating into and out of the hemisphere visible by Herschel. The time variability is consistent with those sources being dark features known from ground-based adaptive optics observations.\nThe water vapour on Ceres may be either produced by near surface ice heated by sunlight (cometary activity) or by cryovolcanoes or geysers getting their energy from Ceres’ interior. In the first case the production rate is expected to peak around perihelion, while for volcanic the time variations are expected to be more stochastic. The existing observations appear consistent with the cometary hypothesis, but do not allow to clearly distinguish between those possibilities. Upon its arrival at Ceres in 2015, the DAWN spacecraft may provide insight into the sources and mechanisms of water production at Ceres.",

We show that this extreme SLR event is a combined effect of two factors: an observed 30% downturn of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) from April 2009 to March 2010, and an onshore/alongshore wind stress anomaly associated with the significant negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index.\nDuring the 21st century, state-of-the-art climate models project an increase in magnitude and frequency of extreme SLR events on the interannual time scale along this densely populated coast. An ensemble of 24 climate models demonstrates that AMOC strength is likely to decrease and extreme negative NAO indices are likely to increase over the next century. Our 2009-10 case study suggests that the combination of these two extreme dynamics causes exceptionally high sea levels from Cape Hatteras to the Southeast Coast of Canada.",

Bioenergetics models for these species have been developed by the federal agencies that operate the Federal Columbia River Power System. These models simulate the impacts on anadromous fishes as they move through the power system both upstream as adults and downstream as juveniles. Water temperature simulations required for input to the bioenergetics models were made for two different segments of the Columbia River system; one being the portions from the Canadian border to Bonneville Dam and the Snake River from Brownlee Dam in Idaho to its confluence and the other, the Salmon River basin in Idaho. Simulations were performed for the period 1928-1998 with the semi-Lagrangian stream temperature model, RBM, for existing conditions and for a two 2040 climate scenarios, a cool, dry condition (ECHO_g model) and a warm, wet condition (MIROC_3.2 model). Natural flows were simulated with the variable infiltration capacity model, VIC, and modified for Columbia River project operations using HYDSIM, a hydro system regulation model that simulates month-to-month operation of the Pacific Northwest hydropower system.",

            "abstract": "The main objective of this research is to investigate the applicability of expandable casing technology as a remediation technique for leaky wells resulting in gas migration problems. Micro annulus is usually created at the cement-formation/cement-casing interface or within the cement matrix either due to poor primary cementing or as a result of activities such as temperature and pressure variation or fracturing operations. Recent reports on gas migration in hydraulically fractured wellbores, has raised concerns on the contamination of fresh water aquifers resulting from fluid migration though this flow path. A unique bench-scale physical model which utilizes expandable tubulars in the remediation of micro annular gas flow has been used to simulate expansion of a previously-cemented casing under field-like conditions. Three different designs of cement slurry: regular 16.4 lb. /gal, 16.4 lb. /gal base slurry foamed to 13 lb. /gal and 16.4 lb. /gal cement slurry with 10% salt concentration. Gas flow path (microannulus) was artificially created at the pipe-cement interface by rotating the inner pipe in a pipe inside pipe assembly with cement in the annulus within the first few hours of hydration to create debonding at the cement-casing interface. Nitrogen gas flow-through experiments were performed before and after the expansion to confirm the sealing of the microannulus. The results obtained confirmed the effectiveness of this technique in the complete closure of gas leakage path, providing seal-tight cement-formation interface free of microannulus. The manipulation of the cement sheath during the casing expansion resulted in improved porosity, permeability and the strength of the cement sheath. SEM micrographs revealed decrease in pore size and fracturing of unhydrated cement grains within the cement matrix. This technology has great potential to become one of the leading cement remediation techniques for leaks behind the casing if implemented.\nKeywords: Wellbore Integrity, Casing Expansion, Well Gas Leaks, CSH, Pore Collapse, Cement Pore Water.",

            "abstract": "Current levels of nitrogen removal by onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) are inadequate, with release of N from OWTS contributing to environmental N pollution, especially in coastal zones where aquatic ecosystems are sensitive to eutrophication. Current mechanistic understand of N removal are limited and mainly attributed to denitrification in the drainfield. Loss of N from N2O production during nitrification, a sparsely researched topic, may be a significant mechanism in advanced OWTS systems that enhance O2 diffusion by sand filter pre-treatment, shallow placement of infiltrative areas and timed dosing controls to prevent drainfield saturation. Replicate (n=3) intact soil mesocosms were used with 15N isotope to evaluate the effectiveness and mechanisms of N removal in drainfields with a conventional wastewater delivery (pipe-and-stone, P&S) compared to two advanced types of drainfields, pressurized shallow narrow drainfield (SND) and Geomat (GEO), a variation of a SND drainfield. Over the 11 day experiment, dissolved O2 was 1.6 mg/L for P&S and 3.0 mg/L for SND and GEO. Removal of total N was 13.5% for P&S, 4.8% for SND and 5.4% for GEO. 15NH4 labeled nitrogen inputs to drainfields were transformed primarily to 15NO3 in all outputs. Consistent low 15N2O levels were present in P&S, with increasing levels of N2 peaking 48h after 15NH4 injection, suggesting denitrification dominated N removal. By contrast, SND and GEO 15N2O levels rose quickly, peaking 8h after 15NH4 injection, suggesting N loss by nitrification. When the whole system is considered, including sand filter removal, 26 – 27% of total N was removed by the SND and GEO systems, whereas 14% of total N was removed in the P&S system. Our results suggest the SND and GEO systems as a whole are capable of removing a greater mass of N than the P&S system.",

            "abstract": "Changes in global population, food consumption and climate lead to a food security challenge for the future. Water resources, agricultural productivity and the relationships between them will to a large extent dictate how we address this challenge. Although food security is a global issue, impacts of climate change on water resources and agricultural productivity, as well as viability of adaptation strategies, are location specific; e.g., it is important to consider the regional regulatory environment.\nOur work focuses on the Columbia River basin (CRB) of the Pacific Northwest US. The water resources of the CRB are heavily managed to meet competing demands. There also exists a legal system for individuals/groups to obtain rights to use the publicly owned water resources, and the possibility of curtailing (i.e., restricting) some of these water rights in times of shortage. It is important to include an approximation of this water resource regulation and water rights curtailment process in modeling water availability and impacts of water shortages on agricultural production. The overarching objective of this work is to apply an integrated hydrologic-crop-water management modeling framework over the CRB to characterize the impacts of climate change on irrigation water demands, irrigation water availability, water shortages, and associated impacts in the 2030s.\nResults indicate that climate change has both positive and negative effects on agricultural production in the CRB and this varies by region and crop type. Certain watersheds that are already water stressed are projected to experience increasing stress in the future. Although, climate change results in increased water shortages and water rights curtailment in the region, this does not necessarily translate into an increased negative effect on yields; some crops are projected to increase in yield despite curtailment. This could be attributed to higher water use efficiency under elevated CO2 levels as well crops moving through growth stages earlier in the season with wetter and warmer spring conditions. Incorporating regulations into integrated modeling framework results in a more realistic assessment of climate change impacts.",

            "abstract": "With a focus on the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW), BioEarth is an Earth System Model (EaSM) currently in development that explores the interactions between coupled C:N:H2O dynamics and resource management actions at the regional scale. Capturing coupled biogeochemical processes within EaSMs like BioEarth is important for exploring the response of the land surface to changes in climate and resource management actions; information that is important for shaping decisions that promote sustainable use of our natural resources. However, many EaSM frameworks do not adequately represent landscape-scale (< 1 km) spatial heterogeneity that influences land surface response, as relatively coarse resolution simulations (> 10 km) are necessitated by computational limitations. Spatial heterogeneity in a landscape arises due to spatial differences in underlying soil and vegetation properties that control moisture, energy and nutrient fluxes; as well as differences that arise due to spatially-organized connections that may drive an ecohydrologic response by the land surface. While many land surface models used in EaSM frameworks capture the first type of heterogeneity, few account for the influence of lateral connectivity on land surface processes. This type of connectivity can be important when considering soil moisture and nutrient redistribution. The RHESSys model is utilized by BioEarth to enable a “bottom-up” approach that preserves fine spatial-scale sensitivities and lateral connectivity that may be important for coupled C:N:H2O dynamics over larger scales. RHESSys is a distributed eco-hydrologic model that was originally developed to run at relatively fine but computationally intensive spatial resolutions over small catchments. The objective of this presentation is to describe two developments to enable implementation of RHESSys over the PNW. 1) RHESSys is being adapted for BioEarth to allow for moderately coarser resolutions and the flexibility to capture both types of heterogeneity at biome-specific spatial scales. 2) A Kepler workflow is utilized to enable RHESSys implementation over the PNW and to provide linkages to other models in the BioEarth framework.",

Spatial density estimates have been used in a number of monogenetic volcanic fields for hazard map generation and utilize the age, location and volumes of previous eruptions to calculate the probability of a new event occurring at a given location within this field. In a previously unpublished study, spatial density estimates of the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc showed the island of Dominica to have the highest likelihood of future vent formation. In this current study, this technique was used in combination with relocated seismic events occurring beneath Dominica within the last ~ 20 years as well as InSAR images of ground deformation to generate a hazard map which not only takes into consideration the past events but also the current state of unrest. Here, geophysical data serve as a weighting factor in the estimates with those centers showing more vigorous activity receiving stronger favorability in the assessment for future activity. In addition to this weighting, the bandwidth utilized in the 2D-radially symmetric kernel density function was optimized using the SAMSE method so as to find the value which best minimizes the error in the estimate. The end results of this study are dynamic volcanic hazards maps which will be readily updatable as changes in volcanic unrest occurs within the system.",

The primary goal was to map the predictability of each Phenological Milestone, and to rank and map the most important driver variables each year, but the potential for predicting season DOY from prognostic GCM outputs was also evaluated.\nFive pre-defined percent-completion milestones were established in terms of threshold percentages of maximum annual NDVI to gauge seasonal phenological progression. Unlike other Start-of-Season metrics, these Phenological Completion Milestones do not attempt to correspond with particular observable events on the ground. Nor are they species-specific, but instead describe emergent ecosystem characteristics of Land Surface Phenology. While arbitrary, they can be readily applied at national scales. The Day-of-Year (DOY) when the 20%, 80%, maximum, 80% and 20% Phenological Milestones are reached in each MODIS cell correspond roughly to start of spring, summer, peak, fall and winter, respectively.\nWe used Daymet (daymet.ornl.gov) to obtain interpolated daily 1km2 values from 2000 - 2013 for daily minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, day length, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). We accumulated annual heat sum above 5 C and cold sum below 5 C since Jan 1, and precip totals after Mar 1. Daily values were used for day length and VPD.\nA set of statistically-defined national phenological ecoregions, or \"phenoregions,\" were created at multiple levels of division using a parallel clustering algorithm to group cells having a similar annual phenological profile of MODIS NDVI. Each resultant phenoregion contains vegetation that showed similar phenological timing in each year. A multiple linear regression based on values accumulated up to that DOY was developed to predict DOY when a particular Phenological Milestone was achieved within each phenoregion. Resulting maps of R-squared, primary driver, and residuals were coherent and interpretable. The desert southwest \"spring\" was highly predictable, and was controlled predominantly by accumulated precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The timing of the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau has occupied the tectonics community for much of the past quarter century. The effort to elucidate the paleoelevation history has refined a more precise method of estimating paleoaltimetry—coupling stable isotopes (oxygen and deuterium; Rowley et al., 2001) with paleotemperatures derived from Δ47 clumped isotope paleothermometry. However, geologists using this method on the Tibetan Plateau are correctly concerned with the preservation of a primary δ18Ow signal in the thermally altered rocks commonly inherent to collisional zones. Burial by both overlying strata and tectonics can lead to thermal alteration and isotopic resetting, eliminating the possibility of constraining the elevation history using the stable isotope record.\nLin et al. (2014) suggest preservation of a primary depleted oxygen signal in the 55 My carbonates of the Nianbo Fm. and argue against the previously accepted diagenetic resetting of lacustrine and paleosol carbonates found in the Linzhou (Penbo) Basin. The Lin et al. study reports recovery of seasonal isotopic variation in an ostracode using in situ analysis by NanoSIMS, which suggests the host carbonates have not reached sufficiently high temperatures for resetting of the primary δ18O signal. This result prompted further Δ47 analyses at Chicago of Penbo carbonates initially determined to have high paleotemperatures (>60°C) using older, less-refined clumped isotope techniques five years ago. Results of our clumped isotope study will examine whether or not seasonal δ18Oc variations are preserved in the Nianbo Fm. Δ47-derived paleotemperatures will reveal whether the ostracodes preserve an original oxygen signal or are thermally overprinted. The combination of paleotemperatures and δ18Ow will allow for the paleoelevation history of the Tibetan Plateau to be extended to the Eocene using the robust Δ47-derived paleotemperature proxy.",

            "abstract": "The two dimensional bias correction methodology for temperature and precipitation, developed by Piani et al. (2012) for station data, was applied to the CCSM4 (NCAR) model gridded output from the CMIP5 dataset and a 40 year gridded dataset over Southeastern South America (Tencer et al., 2011; Jones et al., 2012). Copula density functions of observed temperature and precipitation showed significant structure when subsets of sixteen gridpoints were pooled together. By contrast no structure is detectable in copulas of GCM data. By construction, independent one dimensional bias correction of temperature and precipitation cannot correct copula density distributions hence, the 2D method is applied. The method is validated, as customary, by calibrating and subsequently validating the methodology with non-overlapping 20 year time periods. Visual inspection of single copula density functions for all grid points is unfeasible. Hence the bias correction method is validated by calculating a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) type statistic measuring the distance between observed and simulated and between observed and corrected copulas at each grid point. Results for the KS statistic are plotted in the figure shown. The methodology clearly shows great potential for application to climate impact modeling.\n",

            "abstract": "In spite of pleas for uncertainty analysis - such as Beven’s (2006) “Should it not be required that every paper in both field and modeling studies attempt to evaluate the uncertainty in the results?” - the uncertainty associated with hydrology and water quality data is rarely quantified and rarely considered in model evaluation. This oversight, justified in the past by mainly tenuous philosophical concerns, diminishes the value of measured data and ignores the environmental and socio-economic benefits of improved decisions and policies based on data with estimated uncertainty. This oversight extends to researchers, who typically fail to estimate uncertainty in measured discharge and water quality data because of additional effort required, lack of adequate scientific understanding on the subject, and fear of negative perception if data with “high” uncertainty are reported; however, the benefits are certain. Furthermore, researchers have a responsibility for scientific integrity in reporting what is known and what is unknown, including the quality of measured data.\nIn response we produced an uncertainty estimation framework and the first cumulative uncertainty estimates for measured water quality data (Harmel et al., 2006). From that framework, DUET-H/WQ was developed (Harmel et al., 2009). Application to several real-world data sets indicated that substantial uncertainty can be contributed by each data collection procedural category and that uncertainties typically occur in order discharge < sediment < dissolved N and P < total N and P.\nSimilarly, modelers address certain aspects of model uncertainty but ignore others, such as the impact of uncertainty in discharge and water quality data. Thus, we developed methods to incorporate prediction uncertainty as well as calibration/validation data uncertainty into model goodness-of-fit evaluation (Harmel and Smith, 2007; Harmel et al., 2010). These enhance model evaluation by: appropriately sharing burden with “data providers”; facilitating more realistic model performance evaluation; better determining model deficiencies (e.g., where simulations do not fall within the uncertainty range of measured data); and more accurately communicating model performance.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between the atmosphere and ocean consists of intense and episodic exchanges of heat, momentum, and moisture. However, the way in which these episodic events, and higher-scale frequency events in general, influence the coupled atmosphere/ocean system on longer time scales is not well understood. Models have predicted anthropogenic changes in the mean state and variability of various aspects of the climate which are closely tied to surface turbulent fluxes, but disagree on the nature of the changes. The competing influences of increased humidity, which should reduce fluxes, and increased wind speed and variability, which should increase fluxes, in determining the overall flux under a warming climate is not known. One motivating factor for this research is that there are enormous difficulties in understanding the coupled atmosphere-ocean system, given the complexity of two fluids with large-scale circulations that differ in time/space scales and are coupled through relatively small-scale surface fluxes and cloud processes. In order to make a tractable problem, such statistical techniques as joint distribution analysis, clustering, and variabilities of extremes in time and space must be used to simplify these complex relationships. In order to understand how the climate responds to variations in forcing, one necessary component is to understand the full distribution of variability of exchanges of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and ocean. A number of studies recognize the important role of surface heat and moisture fluxes in the generation and decay of important coupled air-sea phenomena. These mechanisms operate across a number of scales and contain significant contributions from interactions between the anomalous (i.e. non-mean), often extreme-valued, flux components. It is important to have a characterization and understanding of these processes for the development of accurate modeling efforts. In this talk I will make comparisons of some of these analyses between satellite data sets, reanalysis products, and CMIP5 models. By focusing to a large extent on distributional characteristics, and particularly to extremes, comparisons of in situ observations and satellite data sets with distributions from coupled models (e.g. CMIP5) can be made directly.",

We present the analysis of new in situ and satellite observations to highlight previously unobserved features of regional-to-global PAN distributions. Our latest in situ data were collected as part of the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Éxperiment (FRAPPÉ), which took place in the Colorado Front Range during July and August 2014. This data set serves as a case study of PAN formation where significant oil and gas production intersects a major urban-suburban region. Preliminary data, analyzed in conjunction with concurrent observations of other trace species, show extremely elevated PAN and other organic nitrogen compounds in plumes with strong oil and gas source signatures. These plumes have been observed at both suburban and remote (Rocky Mountain National Park) measurement sites. In addition, new PAN retrievals from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), flying on the NASA Aura satellite, can provide a more global picture of PAN. We present TES retrievals of PAN from the Northern Hemisphere over the ten-year lifetime of the Aura mission. The TES PAN dataset offers unprecedented observations of the inter-annual variability of PAN, the transpacific transport of reactive nitrogen species, and the role of biomass burning in the generation of extreme PAN abundances.",

            "abstract": "As the world gets warmer and wetter, it is important to identify sentinel systems to resolve the response of ecosystems to climate change across drivers and complex landscapes. Recently developed climate forcing optical indices (CFOI) related to the quality and quantity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have been shown to be scalable from short-term storm events to interdecadal periods in diverse lakes in lowland landscapes. Are these CFOI metrics effective in alpine ecosystems, which are often viewed as more responsive sentinels of climate change than lowland ecosystems? DOC-related optical data from a series of alpine lakes in North America are used here to address this question. The response of these CFOI metrics followed the same tight relationship in alpine lakes as in lowland lakes, with a seasonal increase in spectral slope between 275 and 295 nm (S275-295) and a decrease in DOC-specific absorbance at 320 nm (a*320) as well as in the ratio of these two indices (a*320/S275-295, a composite climate forcing index, CF). These changes are likely driven largely by photobleaching of terrestrial DOC during the ice-free season. Closer analysis of five years of data for Lake Oesa in the Canadian Rockies revealed marginally significant relationships between precipitation and the CFOI metrics. Specifically, S275-295 decreased with increasing cumulative precipitation for the 15 day period preceding water sample collection. a*320 increased with cumulative precipitation for the 45 day period preceding water sample collection. Relationships between CFOI metrics and precipitation at other time scales were not significant. While the DOC-quality related CFOI metrics were responsive to precipitation, DOC concentration alone was not. The time scale of precipitation effects on CFOI metrics in Lake Oesa was shorter than those previously observed for lowland lakes. This contrasting response is likely related to differences in the characteristics of the hydrology and catchments of lowland lakes vs. that of Oesa which is largely covered by ice, rock, and glacial till rather than the extensive vegetation found at lower elevations. These optical changes in alpine lakes in response to precipitation may have important ecological implications for the differences in how alpine vs. lower elevation systems respond to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Running large ensembles of fully coupled climate models is computationally expensive. This is exactly where climate emulators – among which pattern scaling is perhaps the most popular one – come into play.\nThe traditional pattern scaling technique assumes that a normalized fixed spatial pattern of a certain variable of interest can be scaled by the trajectory of the global mean temperature change.\nInstead of scaling a pattern at a certain period of time from a higher/lower emission scenario, we propose to consider a scaling in time. With this approach, one needs to find a time period with matching global mean surface temperature on an already existing emission pathway. We expect to find the following advantages as compared to the traditional technique:\nConsistency between variables (e.g. physical relationship between temperature and precipitation) and correlation in space and time is preserved. Variability does not have to be scaled in magnitude, and is consistent with the global temperature change. And finally, physical limits are preserved (e.g. sea ice loss) to the degree that they depend on global temperature.\nIt is currently unknown whether different forcing agents (aerosols, land use change) which differ in magnitude across scenarios might cause a problem with the proposed approach, but the same problems arise with scaling patterns between scenarios at a fixed time.\nWe first test this new approach with one model (CESM) and then with a multi-model ensemble (CMIP5). Due to the interdependency in a multi-model ensemble, we test the sensitivity of our results on the manner the individual models are weighted. In a last step, we aim to consider the effect of forcing, variables (such as climate extreme indices) and model resolution on the viability of the traditional and proposed pattern scaling approaches.",

            "abstract": "NASA’s Aquarius/SAC-D and ESA’s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) missions have the objective of mapping global sea surface salinity (SSS) with an accuracy of 0.2 psu. They use L-band radiometers, fly on a 6 AM/PM sun synchronous orbit, and cover the globe in about a week. SMOS radiometers are calibrated against an internal warm target and deep space measurements at the cold end. Aquarius is calibrated against an internal warm target and a forward radiative transfer model (RTM) averaged over the global ocean weekly. Aquarius data are also validated looking at deep space once a month. Because large biases have been observed in the SMOS data over oceans, an additional correction (Ocean Target Transformation, OTT) is applied to radiometric measurements by comparison with an RTM similar to the one used for Aquarius. RTMs are therefore critical to both missions’ scientific objectives. There are some significant differences in the RTM used by SMOS and Aquarius, and this can lead to discrepancies in calibration between both instruments. Because it is desirable to use both datasets together to study salinity, and to use the brightness temperatures (TB) to study land and the cryosphere, the differences in calibration need to be identified. Also, in the very near future (in 2015), one expects to have an additional L-band dataset from NASA’s Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission.\nWe assess the impact of differences in the RTM and the way it is applied. We find that differences in sea water dielectric constant models result in differences in TB of the order of 0.2 K. Matching the dielectric constant models for both missions reduces differences in SSS by up to 0.4 psu, with most improvements in the range of temperatures 6°C to 17°C. Differences in the ancillary data used in the RTM differ can also be important. For example, Aquarius uses ancillary SSS from a model (HYCOM) and SMOS uses a climatology, leading to differences up to 0.1 psu over the area of the south Pacific Ocean used by SMOS for its calibration. The ancillary SST is also different. The differences are small globally, but exhibit localized differences of a few degrees. Because TB sensitivity to SST is usually small, most of the SST differences have a very small impact. However, in the cold waters of the high latitudes, SST differences lead to noticeable local SSS discrepancies.",

The inherent assumption is that there are no significant differences between measurements made at magnetically conjugate points in the two hemispheres.\nIn this paper we show that this assumption is often violated. We have identified 477 events (magnetic bays) for which the ground perturbations measured at the northern and the southern stations are highly uncorrelated. The events have durations of 30-400 minutes and typical magnitudes of 250 nT. We have determined the dependence on solar induced conductance, tilt angle, location (magnetic local time and magnetic latitude) and IMF conditions. To determine cause and effect we have tested four published hypothesis claiming to explain our observations. We find that while the solar induced conductivity plays a key role it does not tell the entire story. Neither, tilt angle or IMF conditions provide complete explanations and we interpret this as indicative that the electrojet system is not completely externally controlled or reversely that internal magnetospheric processes play a key role.",

In this contribution, I will describe the skillsets and expertise data scientist candidates should have when searching for a position. I will also discuss how educators should foster these skillsets and expertise in their students.",

            "abstract": "The Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Satellite (S-NPP) is a Fourier transform spectrometer. It provides a total of 1305 channels in the normal mode for sounding the atmosphere. CrIS can also be operated in the full spectral resolution (FSR) mode, in which the MWIR and SWIR band interferograms are recorded with the same maximum path difference as the LWIR band and with spectral resolution of 0.625 cm-1 for all three bands (total 2211 channels). NOAA will operate CrIS in FSR mode in December 2014 and the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). Up to date, the FSR mode has been commanded three times in-orbit (02/23/2012, 03/12/2013, and 08/27/2013). Based on CrIS Algorithm Development Library (ADL), CrIS full resolution Processing System (CRPS) has developed to generate the FSR Sensor Data Record (SDR). This code can also be run for normal mode and truncation mode SDRs with recompiling. Different calibration approaches are implemented in the code in order to study the ringing effect observed in CrIS normal mode SDR and to support to select the best calibration algorithm for J1.\nWe develop the CrIS FSR SDR Validation System to quantify the CrIS radiometric and spectral accuracy, since they are crucial for improving its data assimilation in the numerical weather prediction, and for retrieving atmospheric trace gases. In this study, CrIS full resolution SDRs are generated from CRPS using the data collected from FSR mode of S-NPP, and the radiometric and spectral accuracy are assessed by using the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) forecast fields. The biases between observation and simulations are evaluated to estimate the FOV-2-FOV variability and bias under clear sky over ocean. Double difference method and Simultaneous Nadir Overpass (SNO) method are also used to assess the CrIS radiance consistency with well-validated IASI. Two basic frequency validation methods (absolute and relative spectral validations) are used to assess the CrIS spectral accuracy. Results show that CrIS SDRs from FSR have similar radiometric and spectral accuracy as those from normal mode.",

Starlight polarized by aligned charged interstellar dust grains provided the first evidence of a magnetic field in the solar galactic environment. The IBEX Ribbon of energetic neutral atoms traces the interstellar magnetic field draping over the heliosphere. Magnetic fields thread nearby interstellar clouds, which include both partially-ionized low-density gas, as well as dense gas. Rudimentary maps of the interstellar magnetic field direction in the solar vicinity, based on polarized starlight, show that multiple field directions are found locally. The dominant local magnetic structure has a direction matching that of the magnetic field traced by the IBEX Ribbon. This magnetic structure, and the kinematics of nearby interstellar gas, suggest that the Loop I superbubble extends to the solar vicinity. A separate magnetic filament with intriguing properties has been identified. The structure of the magnetic field within 40 pc is related to the distribution and kinematics of local clouds that are observed through the absorption lines they form in stellar spectra.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater is an important component of the hydrologic cycle yet its importance is often overlooked. Aquifers are a critical water resource, particularly in irrigation, but also participates in moderating the land-energy balance over the so-called critical zone of 2-10m in water table depth. Yet, the scaling behavior of groundwater is not well known. Here we present the results of a parallel, integrated hydrologic model simulating surface and subsurface flow and conservative transport at high spatial resolution (1km) over much of continental North America (~6,300,000 or 6.3M km2), which is considered a grand challenge in hydrology. In addition to simulating coupled groundwater, surface-water and unsaturated flow, we incorporate a Lagrangian transport component that provides an estimate of both mean travel time and distribution of water recharged at the ground surface over North America, an open question in hydrology. Results show power-law scaling of flow and water table depth and a complex, non-Gaussian residence time distribution indicating that temporal scaling of flow paths observed in small catchments (1-3.5 km2) may persist to continental scales (6.3M km2). These results provide mechanistic insight into several important questions in earth science such as the paradox of old carbon in streams or hydrologic controls on chemical weathering and land formation. Furthermore, results are used to understand the scaling behavior of groundwater over the continent at high resolution. Implications for understanding dominant hydrological processes at large scales will be discussed.",

These hydrologic elements are essential in assessing the response of the Nation’s watersheds and ecosystems to climate and land use changes at local, regional, and national scales.\nThe NHM structure includes (1) a consistent geospatial fabric for modeling; (2) daily and monthly time-step models (e.g. the Precipitation Runoff-Modeling System and the Monthly Water Balance Model); (3) the ability to subset and aggregate models (nested models); and (4) multi-basin, multi-step, multi-objective model calibration procedures.

            "abstract": "Changing climate, including warmer temperatures and drought conditions, has intensified mountain pine beetle infestation in the Rocky Mountains of North America, resulting in tree death over the last decade that is unprecedented in recorded history. The subsequent perturbation to tree-scale water budget processes such as interception, transpiration, and evaporation often combine non-uniformly and produce variable catchment-scale responses. Potentially offsetting perturbations such as decreased transpiration with tree death and increased exposure and evaporation with needle fall can produce changes in peak streamflow and water yield that are undetectable above typical interannual variability. These combined perturbations, however, may change streamflow generating processes and water sources that impact water quality in important mountain headwater streams. To determine the potential impact of widespread land cover change on catchment contributions to streamflow, this study combines a chemical and isotopic separation analysis using paired watersheds and pre-infestation controls with a multi-scale modeling approach (from hillslope to headwaters systems) that determines changes in water stores and fluxes between canopy, land-surface, groundwater and streamflow. Field observations and chemical hydrograph separation analysis suggest that groundwater contributions to streamflow increase with recent insect infestation, as transpiration ceases to remove water from the subsurface but potentially increased ground evaporation removes water from the land and subsurface with relative uniformity. Comparing these field observations to hillslope models provides additional spatial and temporal controls on inherently challenging field heterogeneities as well as a way of testing the influence of natural properties such as precipitation and topography on perturbations to streamflow partitioning from insect infestation. At larger scales, watershed models demonstrate how other factors may compensate to mute these responses between stand, hillslope and watershed scale. Ultimately, identifying these changes in stream water sources provides needed insight for water resource management in MPB-infested watersheds and for changing forested landscapes throughout the region.",

            "abstract": "Phenology, the timing of recurring life cycle events, controls numerous land surface feedbacks to the climate system through the regulation of exchanges of carbon, water and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. Vegetation phenology is affected by climate change and weather variability. It is widely established that warmer temperatures lead to earlier spring onset and might lead to delayed autumn senescence in temperate and boreal ecosystems, while water controls the phenology patterns in arid and Mediterranean ecosystems.\nDespite increasing understanding of the main drivers of phenological events, terrestrial biosphere models are known to have systematic errors in the simulation of spring phenology, which potentially could propagate to uncertainty in modeled responses to future climate change.\nThis is mainly due to misparameterization, model structural errors, and missing processes in phenology models..\nHere, we use different data streams collected over spatial gradients in North America and Europe to investigate and characterize the sources of model uncertainty. By using a model-data fusion approach, we combined information from phenological observations of different woody species, with 12 leaf bud-burst models that varied in complexity.\nWe discuss the uncertainty associated with model parameterization and with the climate drivers used to forecast phenology. Moreover, we discuss the differences in model selection (forcing, chilling, and photoperiod) and parameterizations when the models are applied to the same woody species along the gradients.\nFinally we evaluate other potential biological controls (e.g. foliar stoichiometry, maximum rates of photosynthesis at saturating irradiance at ecosystem level) on plant phenology by evaluating the model residuals against a variety of plant traits.",

            "abstract": "Chemistry-climate models predict an intensification of the stratospheric circulation over the next century in response to greenhouse gas forcing, with uncertain consequences for tropospheric ozone and climate. We examine the role of the stratosphere in present-day tropospheric ozone variability and trends as measured by the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) onboard NASA’s Aura satellite. Using six years of observations, we find that interannual variability in the stratospheric circulation (diagnosed from measurements of the water vapor tape recorder) of ±40%, which is driven by El Niño /Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), leads to changes of ±25 in northern midlatitude lower stratospheric ozone and ±2% in northern midlatitude tropospheric ozone. The stratosphere thus accounts for ~1/2 of the interannual variability in ozone in the mid-troposphere of the northern midlatitudes. While the MLS measurements do not suggest any trend in the stratospheric circulation or zonally averaged lower stratospheric ozone for the 2005-2010 time period, recent modeling work using TES ozone and OMI NO2 measurements suggests a large trend in the stratospheric contribution to tropospheric ozone over Asia and the Western United States that confounds quantification of emissions-driven changes over these regions. We present the results of these two studies and, more generally, assess the role of the stratosphere in both the variability and trends in tropospheric ozone throughout the extratropics as constrained by the Aura observations and as represented in chemistry-climate models. We also discuss the implications of our work for reducing uncertainties in long-term projections of tropospheric ozone.",

            "abstract": "The effective elastic thickness (Te) of the lithosphere controls the flexural response to transverse loading and can be used in conjunction with rheological models to remotely estimate surface density and heat flux of terrestrial planets. In the vast majority of studies, Te estimation is carried out in a two-step process: (1) the joint spectra (admittance and/or coherency) of gravity anomalies (free air and/or Bouguer) and topography are calculated within finite-size windows, and (2) the spectra are inverted using a model for the loading of an infinite elastic plate or shell. In recent years, research in the spatio-spectral analysis of Cartesian grids and improvements in lithospheric loading models have allowed the mapping of Te on the Earth at unprecedented resolution. Nevertheless, the limitations imposed by working with Cartesian data and models are hampering further advances in terrestrial Te studies. The planetary community, on the other hand, has traditionally used spatio-spectral methods that work directly on the sphere, thereby avoiding the undesirable distortions and biases inherent in Cartesian studies. However, the models and methods developed for the Earth have never been applied to planetary data, therefore also limiting further advances in the mapping of planetary Te. Here we combine advances in both terrestrial and planetary studies to allow the mapping of Te of terrestrial planets using a spherical wavelet analysis of gravity and topography data. In particular, we invert the wavelet admittance and coherence, either separately or jointly, and using either Bouguer or free air gravity anomaly data. The method is applied to estimate Te on Earth’s continents and our results show that Te varies between <10 km in young orogenic provinces to >100 km in continental cores, in agreement with rheological models based on temperature-dependent rheology. Results obtained from the joint inversion of admittance and coherency show that simple lithospheric loading models fail to capture the complexity of the data, with adverse effects on the estimated parameters. Finally, we extend the analysis to the Moon and other terrestrial planets and discuss limitations and future applications of the fully spherical techniques.",

            "abstract": "Alluvial soils in mountainous regions are typically heterogeneous and cover a few percent of catchment area. As a result, their contribution to outflow is rarely isolated or monitored continuously; alluvial groundwater discharge under river gauging-stations is generally assumed negligible; and hydrological models tend to lump alluvial storage with other units. To date, the role of alluvial aquifers remains unclear: can they contribute to outflow when they cover a limited area? Should they be considered a storage unit per se or a transmission zone? These issues are addressed experimentally through the continuous monitoring of groundwater and river discharge in the narrow alluvial system of a 208 km2 perialpine catchment. The contribution of alluvial groundwater to outflow was highest at the outlet of a sub-catchment where subsurface discharge amounted to 16% of the annual outflow, and 80% of daily outflow during the three driest weeks. In this period, the groundwater flux was almost entirely induced by alluvial storage depletion, whereas over the entire system, depletion supported 40% of outflow. Storage fluctuation occurred predominantly in the upstream reach where the unsaturated zone was thickest, and the groundwater heads fluctuated over 6 m. Thus, the study shows that alluvial soils covering a limited area may contribute significantly to the outflow of mesoscale catchments. In such system, hydrological models will likely underestimate downstream river discharge, and have a biased calibration. Technically, however, the estimation of outflow may be improved, as illustrated here, by extending river gauging stations to monitor alluvial groundwater discharge.",

            "abstract": "The geochemical record through the mid-Cryogenian (Sturtian) glaciation suggests an extraordinary resumption of productivity following snowball glaciation. Here we present new nitrogen and carbon isotopic data from five sites in the Centralian Superbasin of Australia, and Tasmania. Our data suggest that post-glacial marine conditions were anoxic and nutrient replete, which helped fuel the biological recovery after snowball glaciation. Nitrogen isotope values increase from +5‰ to +9‰ at the glacial termination and decrease to +2‰ through the carbon isotope increase that characterizes the post-glacial interval. Oxidation of the ocean following glaciation fostered loss of DIN via ammonia oxidation coupled with nitrate reduction in addition to drawdown of DIN by high productivity. We interpret the decrease in δ15N as an increase in the relative importance of nitrogen fixation as compensatory response to DIN loss. The long-term low in δ15N values suggests that nitrogen fixation played an important role in maintaining high fractional burial of organic carbon as indicated by the carbon isotope record. Site-to-site differences in the δ13Corg records suggest a strong role for local carbon cycling, vertical mixing, and are consistent with a large surface-to-deep gradient in the δ13C of DIC. If this interpretation is correct, our results are consistent with high phosphate concentrations and a vigorous biological pump in the post-snowball world.",

            "abstract": "It is widely accepted that the space weather related electrodynamic forcing of the geospace environment acts through the high geomagnetic latitude regions. At high latitudes inter-hemispheric asymmetries are largely due to the differences in solar illumination, the direction of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field components and to a lesser extent, due to differences between the two hemispheric internal fields. So far most research regarding interhemispheric differences concentrated on learning about the basic magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling mechanisms. It has been well established that sunlit conditions affect the energy flux of auroral precipitation resulting from the reduction in the mean energy of the auroral electrons in the sunlit summer hemisphere. This can be explained by the partial shorting out of the particle accelerating fields by the sunlight induced conductivity. It has also been found that sunlit conditions reduce the particle fluxes and therefore the associated field aligned currents. Unless the precipitation-induced conductivities overwhelm the sunlit component of conductivity, this would imply that the magnetospheric current generator responds to the ionospheric load in a highly non-linear manner. Interhemispheric currents may also play an important role that has not been fully explored. Interhemispheric asymmetries in substorm morphology have been explored critically because conjugacy implies that substorms have a common source at equatorial latitudes. In some cases the lack of conjugacy of substorms could be explained by considering the magnitude and direction of the IMF.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon is globally unique as it experiences the deepest atmospheric convection with important teleconnections to other parts of the Earth’s climate system. In the Amazon Basin a large fraction of the local evapotranspiration is recycled through the formation of deep convective precipitating storms. Deep convection occurs due to moist thermodynamic conditions associated with elevated amounts of convective available potential energy. Aerosols invigorate the formation of convective storms in the Amazon via their unique concentrations, physical size, and chemical composition to activate into cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), but important aspects of aerosol/precipitation feedbacks remain unresolved. During the wet season, low atmospheric aerosol concentrations prevail in the pristine tropical air masses. These conditions have led to the Green Ocean hypothesis, which compares the clean tropical air to maritime air-masses and emphasizes biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks, to explain the features of the convective-type rainfall events in the Amazon. Field studies have been designed to investigate these relationships and the development of mesoscale convective systems through the Green Ocean Amazon project and the GOAmazon Boundary Layer Experiment.\nFrom March to October 2014 a field experiment was conducted at the Cuieiras Biological Reserve (2°51' S, 54°58' W), 80 km north of the city of Manaus, Brazil. This investigation spans the biological, chemical, and physical conditions influencing emissions and reactions of precursors (biogenic and anthropogenic volatile organic compounds, VOCs), formation of aerosols and CCNs and transport out of the ABL, and their role in cloud formation and precipitation triggers. In this presentation we will show results on the magnitude turbulent fluxes of latent and sensible heat, CCN concentrations, and rain droplet size distribution for both the wet and dry season. Such influencing factors on precipitation, will be contrasted with the vertical contoured frequency-by-altitude diagrams (CFADs) for representative mesoscale convective systems for dry and wet seasons. Rainfall yields from mesoscale convective storms will be linked to the antecedent thermodynamic conditions derived from analyses of upper air soundings.",

            "abstract": "Students in the Environmental Studies major at the University of Southern California fulfill their curriculum requirements by taking a broad range of courses in the social and natural sciences. Climate change is often taught in 1-2 lectures in these courses with limited examination of this complex topic. Several upper division elective courses focus on the science, policy, and social impacts of climate change. In an upper division course focused on the scientific tools used to determine paleoclimate and predict future climate, I have developed a project where students download, manipulate, and analyze data from the National Climatic Data Center. Students are required to download 100 or more years of daily temperature records and use the statistical program R to analyze that data, calculating daily, monthly, and yearly temperature averages along with changes in the number of extreme hot or cold days (≥90˚F and ≤30˚F, respectively). In parallel, they examine population growth, city expansion, and changes in transportation looking for correlations between the social data and trends observed in the temperature data. Students examine trends over time to determine correlations to urban heat island effect. This project exposes students to “real” data, giving them the tools necessary to critically analyze scientific studies without being experts in the field. Utilizing the existing, public, online databases provides almost unlimited, free data. Open source statistical programs provide a cost-free platform for examining the data although some in-class time is required to help students navigate initial data importation and analysis. Results presented will highlight data compiled over three years of course projects.",

            "abstract": "In this study, the potential utility of using rapid temporal changes in drought indices to provide early warning of an elevated risk for drought development over sub-seasonal time scales is assessed. Standardized change anomalies were computed each week during the 2000-2013 growing seasons for drought indices depicting anomalies in evapotranspiration, precipitation, and soil moisture derived from satellite remote sensing observations and land surface model output. A new metric, known as the Rapid Change Index (RCI), was created to encapsulate the accumulated magnitude of rapid changes in the weekly anomalies for each dataset, and is designed to highlight areas undergoing either rapid increases or rapid decreases in moisture stress. Case study analyses revealed that the initial appearance of negative RCI values indicative of rapid increases in moisture stress often occur several weeks prior to the introduction of severe drought conditions in the United States Drought Monitor. Statistical analyses showed that drought intensification probabilities derived from the RCI datasets have some reliability and forecast skill over the central and eastern United States in regions most susceptible to rapid drought development. Taken together, the results suggest that tools used to identify areas experiencing rapid changes in drought indices may be useful components of future drought early warning systems.",

            "abstract": "Now that observed global warming has been clearly attributed to human activities, there has been increasing interest in the extent to which that warming has influenced the occurrence and severity of individual extreme climate events. However, although trends in the extremes of the seasonal- and daily-scale distributions of climate records have been analyzed for many years, quantifying the contribution of observed global warming to individual events that are unprecedented in the observed record presents a particular scientific challenge. We will describe a modified method for leveraging observations and large climate model ensembles to quantify the influence of observed global warming on the probability of unprecedented extreme events. In this approach, we first diagnose the causes of the individual event in order to understand which climate processes to target in the probability quantification. We then use advanced statistical techniques to quantify the uncertainty in the return period of the event in the observed record. We then use large ensembles of climate model simulations to quantify the distribution of return period ratios between the current level of climate forcing and the pre-industrial climate forcing. We will compare the structure of this approach to other approaches that exist in the literature. We will then examine a set of individual extreme events that have been analyzed in the literature, and compare the results of our approach with those that have been previously published. We will conclude with a discussion of the observed agreement and disagreement between the different approaches, including implications for interpretation of the role of human forcing in shaping unprecedented extreme events.",

            "abstract": "Hydroxyl radical (•OH) is a very reactive and unselective oxidant produced ubiquitously by photochemical reactions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) or iron in sunlit surface waters. Once formed, •OH can oxidize DOM to produce CO2 or low molecular weight compounds that bacteria convert to CO2, thereby contributing to the mineralization of DOM in inland waters. This role of •OH in aquatic carbon cycling was thought to be limited to sunlit waters, but we recently demonstrated that •OH is also formed in the dark by a sunlight-independent pathway. We show that •OH is formed in soil and surface waters of the Alaskan Arctic during the oxidation of reduced DOM and ferrous iron. Across a gradient of soil waters from dry upland to wet lowland habitats, •OH formation rates increased with increasing concentrations of DOM and reduced iron, with highest •OH formation observed at oxic−anoxic boundaries in soil and surface waters. Comparison of measured vs. expected electron release from reduced moieties suggested that both DOM and iron contributed to •OH formation. At landscape scales, DOM oxidation to CO2 by dark •OH pathway may be as important to carbon cycling as bacterial oxidation of DOM in arctic surface waters, and is likely much more important than photochemical oxidation of DOM by •OH in sunlit surface waters of the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Ground-based remote sensing observations from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun-sky radiometers have recently shown several instances where cloud-aerosol interaction had resulted in modification of aerosol properties and/or in difficulty identifying some major pollution transport events due to aerosols being imbedded in cloud systems. AERONET has established Distributed Regional Aerosol Gridded Observation Networks (DRAGON) during field campaigns that are short-term (~2-3 months) relatively dense spatial networks of ~15 to 45 sun and sky scanning photometers. Recent major DRAGON field campaigns in Japan and South Korea (Spring 2012) and California (Winter 2013) have yielded observations of aerosol transport associated with clouds and/or aerosol properties modification as a result of fog interaction. Analysis of data from the Korean and Japan DRAGON campaigns shows that major fine-mode aerosol transport events are sometimes associated with extensive cloud cover and that cloud-screening of observations often filter out significant pollution aerosol transport events. The Spectral De-convolution Algorithm (SDA) algorithm was utilized to isolate and analyze the fine-mode aerosol optical depth signal for these cases of persistent and extensive cloud cover. Satellite retrievals of AOD from MODIS sensors were also investigated to assess the issue of detectability of high AOD events associated with high cloud fraction. AERONET is updating the cloud-screening algorithm applied to AOD data in the upcoming Version 3 database. Comparisons of cloud screening from Versions 2 and 3 of cases with high AOD associated with clouds will be studied. Additionally, extensive fog that was coincident with aerosol layer height on some days in both Korea and California resulted in large increases in fine mode aerosol radius, with a mode of cloud-processed or residual aerosol of radius ~0.4-0.5 micron sometimes observed. Cloud processed aerosol may occur much more frequently than AERONET data suggest due to inherent difficulty in observing aerosol properties near clouds from remote sensing observations. These biases of aerosols associated with clouds are even greater for passive satellite remote sensing retrievals of aerosol properties near clouds due to sub-pixel cloud contamination and 3-D effects issues.",

            "abstract": "We continue efforts to estimate the intrinsic accuracy of range measurements made by the major satellite laser ranging stations of the ILRS Network using normal point observations of the primary geodetic satellites LAGEOS and LAGEOS-II. In a novel approach we carry out weekly reference frame solutions for satellites’ initial state vectors, station coordinates and daily EOPs (X-pole, Y-pole and LoD), as well as estimating range bias for each of the stations. We apply known range errors a-priori from the table developed and maintained through the efforts of the ILRS Analysis Working Group and apply station- and time-specific satellite centre of mass corrections (Appleby and Otsubo, 2014), both corrections that are currently implemented in the standard ILRS reference frame products. Our new approach, to solve simultaneously for station coordinates and range bias for all the stations, has the strength that such bias results that are discovered are independent of the coordinates taken for example from ITRF2008; thus this approach has the potential to determine range errors that may have become absorbed primarily in station height had the coordinates been determined on the assumption of zero bias. A possible weakness of the approach is that correlations will inevitably exist between station height and range bias, and a clear separation may not be possible. However, for the major stations of the Network, and using LAGEOS and LAGEOS-II observations simultaneously to determine a single mean bias for each station in the weekly solutions, we do perform a partial separation between these parameters at the expense of an increase in the variance of the stations’ height time series. In this paper we discuss the results in terms of impact on coordinate solutions and on the scale of the reference frame, and in the context of preparations for ITRF2013.",

            "abstract": "The updated status of TEMPO, as it proceeds from formulation phase into implementation phase is presented. TEMPO, the first NASA Earth Venture Instrument, will measure atmospheric pollution for greater North America from space using ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy. TEMPO measures from Mexico City to the Canadian oil sands, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, hourly and at high spatial resolution. TEMPO provides a tropospheric measurement suite that includes the key elements of tropospheric air pollution chemistry. Measurements are from geostationary (GEO) orbit, to capture the inherent high variability in the diurnal cycle of emissions and chemistry. The small product spatial footprint resolves pollution sources at sub-urban scale. Together, this temporal and spatial resolution improves emission inventories, monitors population exposure, and enables effective emission-control strategies.\nTEMPO takes advantage of a GEO host spacecraft to provide a modest cost mission that measures the spectra required to retrieve O3, NO2, SO2, H2CO, C2H2O2, H2O, aerosols, cloud parameters, and UVB radiation. TEMPO thus measures the major elements, directly or by proxy, in the tropospheric O3 chemistry cycle. Multi-spectral observations provide sensitivity to O3 in the lowermost troposphere, reducing uncertainty in air quality predictions by 50%. TEMPO quantifies and tracks the evolution of aerosol loading. It provides near-real-time air quality products that will be made widely, publicly available.\nTEMPO provides much of the atmospheric measurement capability recommended for GEO-CAPE in the 2007 National Research Council Decadal Survey, Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond. GEO-CAPE is not planned for implementation this decade. However, instruments from Europe (Sentinel 4) and Asia (GEMS) will form parts of a global GEO constellation for pollution monitoring later this decade, with a major focus on intercontinental pollution transport. TEMPO will launch at a prime time to be a component of this constellation",

The resulting maps were compared to GPS field data that were collected in 2012 as well as to two wetland maps currently in use by the Province of New Brunswick, namely the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) wetland map and the forested wetland classes of the DNR forest map (called hereafter “DNR forested wetland map”). Overall the Random Forests classifier gave better classification accuracies than the maximum likelihood classifier. The comparison with the 146 wetland ground truth sites shows that 73.3% are correctly identified using the LANDSAT-5 TM classified image. For the SAR-based classified images, the number of correctly identified wetland ground truth sites is higher when the image acquired during the flooding is considered, the difference being higher with the ALOS-PALSAR images than with the RADARSAT-2 images. The number of correctly identified ground truth wetland sites is the highest when both the ALOS-PALSAR images and RADARSAT-2 images are used (98.6%). This percentage is well above the one obtained with the DNR wetland and forested wetland maps (44.5%). For both SAR-based classifications, the majority of the misidentifications are due to wetlands not being classified in the right wetland class and very few are wetland sites being classified as a non-wetland class. For the DNR maps, about half of the misclassifications are field-validated wetlands that are not mapped as wetland on the DNR maps, the remaining half are wetland sites classified in the wrong wetland class.",

            "abstract": "With the advent of long image time series as a part of the emerging earth observing system, it is now possible to examine the geographic distribution of trends in seasonal change. However, image time series of earth phenomena exhibit many forms of variability that detract from the signal of interest including cloud contamination, path radiance and short term inter- and intra-annual variability. To accommodate this, a special procedure called Seasonal Trend Analysis (STA) was developed that uses a combination of harmonic analysis and robust statistical trend measurement to reduce the effects of noise and short-term variability. A Contextual Mann-Kendall test is then used to test the trends associated with each of five harmonic shape parameters developed by STA. A three-class categorization of significance then leads to 243 possible classes of seasonal trend. In a study of a 30-year series of global monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index imagery (GIMMS NDVI3g, 1982-2011), it was found that over half (56.30%) of vegetated land surfaces exhibited significant trends in seasonality. Further, almost half (46.10%) of these significant trends belonged to just three classes of seasonal trends. Class 1 consisted of areas that experienced a uniform increase in NDVI throughout the year, and was primarily associated with forest biomes. Class 2 was predominantly associated with grassland and shrubland biomes and exhibited increases in the amplitude of the annual seasonal signal without a net annual change. Class 3 exhibited increases in the annual summer peak in NDVI and was found primarily in the Taiga and Tundra biomes. While no single attribution could be established for each of these classes, they point to a widespread greening of vegetated surfaces associated with climate-related ameliorations of growing conditions.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting the magnetic structure of an Earth-directed CME remains a difficult challenge, even with all the observational and modeling assets available today. Coronagraph and heliospheric imager data provide the only tangible information on CME structure near the Sun, but they specifically measure the mass distribution and offer only vague hints at the magnetic configuration. As input to models of the interplanetary medium, this information currently enables prediction of the arrival time at 1 AU within a statistical 8-hour or so window, but no forecast of the magnetic content of the CME. We discuss how the introduction of time-dependent ambient flows may impact the estimation of magnetic draping fields at the front of a CME, and we examine how the interplanetary evolution of a CME with an embedded magnetic cloud (MC) differs from that with a purely hydrodynamic driver, as in current operational models. In both cases the driver represents a localized injection of momentum, which dominates the dynamics. However, the MC case presents two additional dynamic elements: (1) the magnetic tension and high Alfven speeds in the cloud provide a rigidity that tends to preserve the initial shape of the driver; (2) the edges of the MC interact directly with the swept-up spiral magnetic ambient field, leading to erosion of the internal fields. In both cases, the hypersonic flow conditions and the geometric spreading of the predominantly radial motion tends to keep the interactions local, such that different parts of the structure may experience quite different evolution with heliocentric distance. The resulting localized deformations make the interpretation of the true configuration of such structures difficult to infer from in situ observations and severely complicate our ability to forecast accurately the magnetic structure expected at Earth. A key issue confronting any purported forecast scheme for CME magnetic content is the definition of a “good fit” between prediction and observation – this is not at all a straightforward task and real progress in this area hinges upon sensible and honest evaluation forecast performance.",

Stream restoration projects have a variety of goals, including improvement in water quality and in-stream habitat. Popular approaches to restoration (such as Natural Channel Design, or NCD) aim to move degraded streams along a trajectory toward a dynamic ecological endpoint that represents natural conditions. Project designs primarily focus on channel form and function, but stream-groundwater exchanges of water and solutes are not typically a design consideration, although a primary component of fully functioning stream ecosystems. Here, we synthesize results from field investigations of the impact of NCD stream restoration on stream-groundwater exchanges by (1) comparing restored sites to reference reaches, which serve as the basis for the restoration design, (2) characterizing multiple restored sites to determine universal characteristics of streams restored by NCD, and (3) monitoring a stream pre- and post- restoration. NCD restoration creates hot spots of rapid hyporheic exchange upstream of channel spanning structures, with water fluxes across the bed interface up to an order of magnitude higher than at pre-restoration or reference reaches. Elevated flux rates result in short hyporheic residence times, which are not sufficiently long to generate net changes in nutrient concentrations. Hot spots of biogeochemical transformations are instead located around secondary bedforms, such as pool-riffle sequences, where gross water exchange rates are more moderate. ",

Few field methods are available for quantifying variability of hydrologic exchange rates across the streambed interface through space and time at high resolution. Advances in heat tracing provide opportunities for improved assessment of the paired spatial and temporal structure of heterogeneity in water flux and chemistry in the hyporheic zone. Here, we present a synthesis of heat transport monitoring and modeling studies aimed at improving spatial and temporal characterization of water exchange across the bed interface. Hot spots of water and solute exchange at the bed interface are quantified in the field at the reach scale by integrating high-resolution streambed temperature maps with point measurements of water flux inferred from 1D temperature profiles. The effectiveness and potential errors of this methodology are explored through numerical groundwater flow and heat transport modeling. Hot moments of water and solute exchange are quantified in the field using high-resolution distributed temperature sensing, paired with 1D heat transport modeling and detailed water quality profiles. The effectiveness and potential errors of quantifying temporal variability in water flux using heat tracing are explored through controlled laboratory experiments. Our results demonstrate the enormous potential for using heat tracing to quantify spatial and temporal changes in water flux across the bed interface at high resolution. The methods presented take advantage of inexpensive temperature sensors and user-friendly modeling methods, such as VFLUX, making heat tracing a good option for field practitioners interested in observing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of water flux at the bed interface.",

We here present a case study of Namibia's Namib Sand Sea and Skeleton Coast ergs, in which all the aforementioned methods have been combined using a three-way multidimensional scaling (aka INDividual Differences SCALing or INDSCAL) analysis:\n1. Each of the datasets was represented by a 'dissimilarity matrix' of pairwise distances between samples.\n2. The set of these matrices was fed into the INDSCAL algorithm, which produces two pieces of graphical output: the 'group configuration', which is a scatter plot or 'map' in which similar samples plot close together and dissimilar samples plot far apart, and the 'proxy weights', in which not the samples but the proxies are plotted according to the weight they attached to the 'group configuration' axes.\nThe INDSCAL map of the Namibia dataset indicates that (a) long-shore drift of Orange River sediments dominates the coastal sediment compositions all along the Namibian coast until Angola, and (b) that light and heavy minerals tell complementary parts of the provenance story.",

Thus, an early component of a potential GEOSS-AI system, in the continuum between observations and end point research, applications, and decision making, would be one that enables transparent data discovery and access by users. Such a component might be effected via the system’s “data agents.” Presumably, some kind of data cataloging has already been implemented, e.g., in the GEOSS Common Infrastructure (GCI). Both the agents and cataloging could also leverage existing resources external to the system. The system would have some means to accept and integrate user-contributed agents. The need or desirability for some data format internal to the system should be evaluated. Another early component would be one that facilitates browsing/visualization of the data, as well as some basic analyses.\nThree ongoing projects at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) provide possible proto-examples of potential data access and visualization components of a cloud-based GEOSS-AI system.\nReorganizing data archived as time-step arrays to point-time series (“data rods”), as well as leveraging the NASA Simple Subset Wizard (SSW), to significantly increase the number of data products available, at multiple NASA data centers, for production as on-the-fly (virtual) data rods.

Here we examine for site-specific isotopic composition of propane from natural and synthetic sources using novel instruments and techniques gas source mass spectrometry 1, and discuss the possible relationship of our findings to recent independent evidence from NMR measurements for the isotopic structures of long-chain alkanes2.\nA recent NMR study2 demonstrates that n-alkanes can be divided into three groups according to their site-specific carbon isotope structure: long (C16+) even carbon number, long (C17+) odd carbon number , and short (C11-C15). We modeled the isotopic site-specific composition of propane derived from these three distinct groups. If propane is cleaved from such long-chain hydrocarbons without fractionation, the long odd-numbered and the shorter alkanes would produce propane with an average terminal position 6-7‰ lighter than the center position, while the long even-numbered chain compounds would produce propane with a terminal position averaging around 7‰ heavier than the center. If, instead the fractionation associated with cleaving propane from such parent molecules is ~10‰ (as seems likely), then these average terminal — center differences should be decreased by ~5 ‰ (i.e., to -11-12 and +1-2 ‰, respectively). We will compare these predictions with our previous demonstrations of the changes in bulk and site specific compositions in propane due to isotope exchange equilibria, diffusion and conventional models of kerogen ‘cracking’, and will use these models as a framework for interpreting the observed site-specific isotopic compositions of propane from diverse natural gas deposits.\n1.

            "abstract": "Forests in the eastern United States are species rich and affected by a variety of disturbance agents such as fire, invasive insects, diseases, and storm events. Millions of hectares of forest are disturbed each year, altering the forest carbon sink and changing forest nutrient cycles. The magnitude and direction of these changes, though, can be different for different disturbance agents. For example, trees that burn in severe fire rapidly release stored carbon into the atmosphere whereas standing deadwood from insect attacks decompose slowly while atmospheric carbon is fixed in regenerating vegetation. The diagnosis and attribution of these processes require accurate and reliable estimates of the extent and frequency of different disturbance agents. Here, a new method is presented that classifies disturbance events identified using time-series analysis of Landsat TM imagery. The method exploits information about changes in the canopy heterogeneity as measured by several texture indices within forest patches. Classifiers were trained using data from the US Forest Service Aerial Detection Surveys and currently differentiate between fires, southern pine beetle, gypsy moth, hemlock woolly adelgid, beech bark disease, anthracnose, and storm events. In addition, the classifier returns a value of 'uncertain' when it is unable to make a clear determination, which is currently approximately 10% of identified disturbances. Classification accuracy for the remainder is 81%, though is variable between agents. For example, the classifier performs well in identifying southern pine beetle and gypsy moth affected areas, but poorly in identifying storms. Reliabilities are similar to accuracies for each agent. The results presented are the first yearly, regional-scale estimates of forest disturbance partitioned by disturbance agent. We find good correspondence with previously described patterns of disturbance and distribution, including direct observational evidence of their predicted periodicities over entire ecoregions. Such estimates are vital for forest monitoring and to better understand the role of the dynamic forest carbon sink in order to reduce uncertainty in atmospheric carbon models. Future work must focus on the inclusion of direct anthropogenic changes such as harvest and urbanization.",

            "abstract": "Forest disturbances drive successional changes, impact management, redistribute carbon among ecosystem pools and the atmosphere, and alter nutrient cycling. Detecting these important ecological dynamics using remotely sensed methods allows for a consistent and comprehensive census of vegetation change over the study area, unlike in traditional plot-based methods. However, in the species-rich and structurally complex forests of the eastern United States, disturbance events caused by low-intensity fires or species-specific insects and disease are often partial, and therefore difficult to detect using satellite-based methods that rely only on total vegetation amount. We developed a set of new algorithms, collectively called VeRDET (Vegetation Regeneration and Disturbance Estimates through Time), which use a novel patch-based approach to incorporate spatial information from Landsat TM to detect disturbance, stable, and regeneration periods in a time-series of imagery. VeRDET uses SPARCS to identify clear-sky probabilities for each pixel, generates a yearly clear-sky composite of those images, calculates a vegetation index using that composite, spatially segments the vegetation index into patches using total variation regularized denoising, and then temporally segments the time-series of each pixel into a piecewise linear function. For each pixel, the slopes of the segments in the piecewise linear function are interpreted as disturbed, stable, or regenerating. We present a map of cumulative forest disturbance and regeneration over the Landsat 5 record in the eastern United States. We detect higher total rates of forest disturbance than previous studies, likely because we include stress and non-mortality declines in vegetation cover. Additionally, ecoregions predict major differences in forest change, with the Piedmont and Southeastern Plains having upwards of 7% of total forest lands affected by disturbance each year on the high end and the Blue Ridge Mountains having a low of 1.9% annual area affected. Across all ecoregions, the predominant trend is for dynamic equilibrium or afforestation. Overall, VeRDET is a promising new tool to answer spatially and temporally explicit questions about vegetation change, and can open new avenues of inquiry into forest monitoring and assessment.",

            "abstract": "Dendrochronology provides unique ecological information on forest dynamics that can be used to develop and benchmark terrestrial carbon cycle models. In recent years, integration between dendrochronology and process-based ecosystem models has been yielded insight into climate sensitivity of tree growth, annual carbon uptake, water-use efficiency, and phenology. Here we review some of these advances as well as some of the scaling challenges associated with representing forest stand-level dynamics from individual tree growth measurements. In particular, increment cores from trees provide annual temporal resolution of biomass gain that is recorded from decade to centennial time scales. Efforts to use such measurements to reconstruct stand level biomass gain, or net primary production, have to address issues related to sampling design as well as account for mortality-driven changes in stem density that take place during stand development, what is referred to as the ‘fading record’ problem. One solution to the fading record problem is to reconstruct stem density over time by applying self-thinning theory within a calibrated forest dynamics model. With this approach, recorded tree growth and modeled stand density dynamics can be used to estimate stand-level net primary production that more accurately relates to productivity estimates from carbon cycle models. An improved understanding of trends in forest productivity over the past century is critical for a range of forest management and forest science issues, where traditional growth and yield tables exclude effects of climate and atmospheric changes in CO2 on forest growth.",

Large year-to-year variability in the terrestrial carbon sink influences the atmospheric CO2 growth rate with the underlying mechanisms of variability poorly constrained and thus the evolution of future land carbon uptake unclear. The exceptionally large land carbon sink in the year 2011, almost 40% of anthropogenic emissions, provided an opportunity to investigate this year-to-year variability using a variety of carbon cycle observation techniques, including a terrestrial biogeochemical model, an atmospheric inversion, and remote sensing data. We found that the global land sink anomaly was driven mainly by semi-arid vegetation activity in the Southern Hemisphere, with almost 60 percent of carbon uptake attributed to Australian ecosystems, where prevalent La Niña conditions caused up to six consecutive seasons of increased precipitation. Since 1981, vegetation expansion over Australia was found to drive a four-fold increase in the sensitivity of continental net carbon uptake to precipitation. These combined results suggest that the higher-turnover rates of carbon pools in semi-arid biomes are an increasingly important driver of global carbon cycle inter-annual variability with implications for the paradigm that tropical rainforests drive carbon cycle variability at inter-annual timescales. More research in semi-arid regions is needed to identify mechanisms of carbon turnover at inter-annual scales and to determine the causes, and their possible interactions, in driving vegetation expansion over longer time scales.",

            "abstract": "Advancements in computing power have created new opportunities for the use of numerical models in wildfire research. Models like the Wildland Fire Dynamics Simulator (WFDS) and FIRETEC attempt to represent interactions between the dominant processes that determine wildfire behavior such as convective and radiative heat transfer, aerodynamic drag and buoyant response of the atmosphere to heat released by the fire. Such models are not practical for operational faster-than-real-time fire prediction due to their computational and data requirements. However, their process-based model-development approach creates an opportunity to provide additional perspectives concerning aspects of fire behavior that have been observed in the field and in the laboratory, allow for sensitivity analysis that is impractical through observations and pose new hypotheses that can be tested experimentally. Specific examples of the use of FIRETEC in this fashion include: 1) investigation of the 3D fire/atmosphere interaction that dictates multiscale fireline dynamics; 2) the influence of vegetation heterogeneity and variability in wind fields on predictability of fire spread; 3) the interaction between ecosystem disturbances such as insect attacks and potential fire behavior; and 4) the effects of nonlocal topography. Numerical studies support new conceptual models for the dominant roles of multi-scale fluid dynamics in determining the nature and viability of fire spread. Results from these studies highlight the critical roles of upwind buoyancy-induced vorticity and crosswind fireline-intensity variations on heat transfer to unburned fuels, the influence of canopy structure on convective heating and cooling of canopy fuels and the impact of heterogeneous vegetation distribution/aggregation on wind penetration into canopies and crown fire behavior. There needs to be continued efforts to meet the challenges of validating the results from these numerical investigations with lab experiments and field observations, but, even so, they help progress wildfire science by suggesting relationships, interactions and phenomenology that should be considered in the context of the interpretation of observations, design of fire behavior experiments and development of new operational models.",

            "abstract": "In meeting the needs of rapidly expanding city residents, ecosystem functioning within the urban boundary may provide several key services ranging from life-sustaining services such as climate regulation and food production to services associated with recreation and aesthetics. In contrast, ecosystem disservices are associated with ecosystem characteristics that have a negative impact on residents and range from potentially injurious components such as increasing pollutant exposure or additional resource requirements such as irrigation water. Identifying trade-offs in both services and disservices is a priority for assessing how ecosystem functioning influences urban residents. Such assessments require a baseline understanding of their rates of production and acutely need expanded monitoring and modeling. Recent efforts at quantifying ecosystem services and disservices have relied on combinations of direct field surveys, in-situ environmental sensor networks, and remotely sensed vegetation. While much work has been conducted within single metropolitan regions, expanded efforts are underway to analyze networks of urban sites. Here I highlight recent findings associated with urban ecosystem services associated with variation in urban forests and urban gardens as two contrasting ecosystem types within a city. These research efforts are leading to improved understanding of the variation in the production of and specific desires for ecosystem services and disservices. Initial data across several studies suggests desires for services show sensitivity to both socioeconomic status as suggested by a hierarchy of needs hypothesis and local environmental conditions as suggested by an environmental determinism hypothesis. Consequently, the production of ecosystem services also varies dramatically across socioeconomic and climate gradients. Future projections of the rates of service production are highly uncertain with likely strong nonlinearities in responses to urban conditions. Designing for sustainable ecosystem services within cities such that benefits are maximized and costs are minimized as we prepare for a near future with 2.5 billion more urban residents.",

            "abstract": "The successful inauguration of both NASA OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2) and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) missions, and continuing operations from other flagship Earth Observing systems (e.g. MODIS) provide new opportunities to improve understanding of global carbon and water cycle connections over land. Carbon and water cycles interact such that soil moisture and frozen temperatures constrain net ecosystem productivity and terrestrial sources and sinks for atmospheric CO2. OCO-2 and SMAP will have overlapping global observations beginning in 2015. The combined measurements from these sensors provide complimentary information linking top-down atmospheric CO2 measurements with bottom-up carbon fluxes and underlying environmental controls.\nSMAP will consist of a satellite L-band radar and radiometer suite designed for global monitoring of soil moisture and freeze-thaw dynamics. SMAP science objectives include improving understanding of processes linking terrestrial water, energy and carbon cycles, and quantifying the net carbon flux in boreal landscapes. SMAP products include model enhanced estimates of net ecosystem CO2 flux (NEE) and component carbon fluxes for productivity and respiration; targeted accuracy for NEE is defined at the level of tower (FLUXNET) eddy covariance measurement based CO2 fluxes.\nOCO-2 has similar carbon science objectives and complimentary observations to SMAP, including canopy fluorescence (SIF) and atmosphere total column CO2 concentrations (XCO2) derived with unprecedented sampling and precision. An initial framework for integrating and analyzing these data is presented in the context of planned post-launch field campaigns and community carbon model synthesis activities. Example research applications are presented using available satellite data prior to SMAP and OCO-2 operations. Activities include using SIF (a proxy for canopy photosynthesis) with MODIS FPAR and SMAP data to improve understanding of canopy structural and functional phenology attributes. Also discussed are research priorities and next steps for regional experiments, benchmarking studies and carbon model inversions linking top down atmosphere CO2 observations with bottom-up C-fluxes and environmental controls that build upon existing community activities.",

            "abstract": "Microbial life in soil occurs within fragmented aquatic habitats in complex pore spaces where motility is restricted to short hydration windows (e.g., following rainfall). The limited range of self-dispersion and physical confinement promote spatial association among trophically interdepended microbial species. Competition and preferences for different nutrient resources and byproducts and their diffusion require high level of spatial organization to sustain the functioning of multispecies communities. We report mechanistic modeling studies of competing multispecies microbial communities grown on hydrated surfaces and within artificial soil aggregates (represented by 3-D pore network). Results show how trophic dependencies and cell-level interactions within patchy diffusion fields promote spatial self-organization of motile microbial cells. The spontaneously forming patterns of segregated, yet coexisting species were robust to spatial heterogeneities and to temporal perturbations (hydration dynamics), and respond primarily to the type of trophic dependencies. Such spatially self-organized consortia may reflect ecological templates that optimize substrate utilization and could form the basic architecture for more permanent surface-attached microbial colonies. Hydration dynamics affect structure and spatial arrangement of aerobic and anaerobic microbial communities and their biogeochemical functions. Experiments with well-characterized artificial soil microbial assemblies grown on porous surfaces provide access to community dynamics during wetting and drying cycles detected through genetic fingerprinting. Experiments for visual observations of spatial associations of tagged bacterial species with known trophic dependencies on model porous surfaces are underway. Biophysical modeling provide a means for predicting hydration-mediated critical separation distances for activation of spatial self-organization. The study provides new modeling and observational tools that enable new mechanistic insights into how differences in substrate affinities among microbial species and soil micro-hydrological conditions may give rise to a remarkable spatial and functional order in an extremely heterogeneous soil microbial world.",

Three tiers are supported: Tier 1 (GES DISC-hosted) gives the remote data center a data management interface to add and maintain data, which are provided through the Giovanni instance at the GES DISC. Tier 2 packages Giovanni up as a virtual machine for distribution to and deployment by the other data centers. Data variables are shared among data centers by sharing documents from the Solr database that underpins Giovanni's data management capabilities.

            "abstract": "Over 300 hydrothermal systems have been discovered since the first finding of Galapagos vents over three decades ago. The size, morphology, chemistry and associated biology show a rich diversity that is in part governed by their host rocks and tectonic setting. Each vent system is unique in terms of the morphology of black smoker edifices and associated diffuse flow, which suggests that local processes and feedback loops govern the nature and evolution of these dynamic systems. In fast-spreading environments (e.g. EPR), vent fields are spaced far apart and individual structures are small in number and size. In contrast, to date, the highest concentrations of fields per kilometer of ridge segment, and the largest individual black smokers occur in intermediate-spreading systems (e.g. Endeavour hosting 45 m-tall chimneys). The largest complexes occur in intermediate and slow-spreading environments (e.g. TAG at 200 m across). The highest temperature vents are transient, with temperature excursions at or above the critical point of seawater. Extremely high temperatures are associated with diking and eruptive events that likely vaporize subsurface fluids, forcing them across the two-phase boundary briefly. Along slow- and ultraslow-spreading ridges, the character of vents is strongly controlled by faulting, in particular, long-lived detachment faults that expose variably deformed and altered ultramafic rocks. Here, vent systems evolve from high-temperature black smokers within the axial valley with fluids rich in CO2, to black smokers with mantle and basaltic signatures along the axial valley walls, to end member systems such as the Lost City Field with chimneys and fluid chemistries never before seen: 60 m tall limestone towers that vent 90°C, metal-poor, pH 9-11 fluids devoid of CO2, yet rich in H2, CH4 and other low molecular weight hydrocarbons formed abiotically. This relatively stable environment, free from volcanic events, promotes venting for >150,000 years.",

The object has a radius of about 125 km and moves on an unstable orbit between Saturn and Uranus, with lifetime of about 10 Myr.\nThe fifth ring system ever discovered (after those around the four giant planets) is made of two dense and narrow rings with respective widths of 7 and 3 kilometers, normal optical depths of 0.4 and 0.06, and orbital radii of 391 and 405 kilometers, respectively (see figure). They are separated by an empty gap of about 9 km (see Figure 1). Their current configuration may be explained by the presence of putative kilometric-sized satellites. By means of the shepherd mechanism, satellites can confine and open the gap between the rings, otherwise they would spread out in few thousand years.\nFrom 1997 to 2008, the Chariklo system exhibited an unexplained behavior. It dimmed by 0.6 in absolute magnitude and the water-ice band in its spectrum, formerly observed, could not be detected in 2008. All this is simply explained by the rings' pole orientation, which implies that they were seen edge-on in 2007-2008. We can also calculate their reflectivity I/F ~ 0.1. Spectroscopic and photometric observations of the system allowed us to calculate the amount of water ice and silicate elements in the rings as well as on the main body. No water ice is detectable on the surface of Chariklo. \nNew stellar occultations by the Chariklo system were observed in 2014, and they show the fine structure of the rings as well confirm the preferred pole position from the 2013 event. These findings will be presented and possible formation scenarios will be discussed.",

The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction (UN-ISDR) adopted HFA in January 2005 in order to reduce disaster risk. As an instrument to compare the risk due to different natural hazards, an integrated worldwide study was implemented and published in several Global Assessment Reports (GAR) by UN-ISDR. The results of the global earthquake induced tsunami hazard and exposure analysis for a return period of 500 years are presented. Both deterministic and probabilistic methods (PTHA) are used. The resulting hazard levels for both methods are compared quantitatively for selected areas. The comparison demonstrates that the analysis is rather rough, which is expected for a study aiming at average trends on a country level across the globe. It is shown that populous Asian countries account for the largest absolute number of people living in tsunami prone areas, more than 50% of the total exposed people live in Japan. Smaller nations like Macao and the Maldives are among the most exposed by population count. Exposed nuclear power plants are limited to Japan, China, India, Taiwan, and USA.\nOn the contrary, a local tsunami vulnerability and risk analysis applies information on population, building types, infrastructure, inundation, flow depth for a certain tsunami scenario with a corresponding return period combined with empirical data on tsunami damages and mortality. Results and validation of a GIS tsunami vulnerability and risk assessment model are presented. The GIS model is adapted for optimal use of data available for each study. Finally, the importance of including landslide sources in the tsunami analysis is also discussed.",

The surface stresses are partitioned between the ice and the waves, such that whitecaps and turbulence are reduced in the MIZ. This alters the wave-mediated fluxes of heat and momentum between the ocean and the atmosphere. As the MIZ evolves, the system shifts from an ice-dominated regime to a wave-dominated regime.",

            "abstract": "Crop growth stages in concert with weather and soil moisture conditions can have a significant impact on crop yields. In the U.S., crop growth stages and conditions are reported by farmers at the county level. These reports are somewhat subjective and fluctuate between different reporters, locations and times. Remote sensing data provide an alternative approach to monitoring crop growth over large areas in a more consistent and quantitative way. In the recent years, remote sensing data have been used to detect vegetation phenology at 1-km spatial resolution globally. However, agricultural applications at field scale require finer spatial resolution remote sensing data. Landsat (30-m) data have been successfully used for agricultural applications. There are many medium resolution sensors available today or in near future. These include Landsat, SPOT, RapidEye, ASTER and future Sentinel-2 etc. Approaches have been developed in the past several years to integrate remote sensing data from different sensors which may have different sensor characteristics, and spatial and temporal resolutions. This allows us opportunities today to map crop growth stages and conditions using dense time-series remote sensing at field scales.\nHowever, remotely sensed phenology (or phenological metrics) is normally derived based on the mathematical functions of the time-series data. The phenological metrics are determined by either identifying inflection (curvature) points or some pre-defined thresholds in the remote sensing phenology algorithms. Furthermore, physiological crop growth stages may not be directly correlated to the remotely sensed phenology. The relationship between remotely sensed phenology and crop growth stages is likely to vary for specific crop types and varieties, growing stages, conditions and even locations. In this presentation, we will examine the relationship between remotely sensed phenology and crop growth stages using in-situ measurements from Fluxnet sites and crop progress reports from USDA NASS. We will present remote sensing approaches and focus on: 1) integrating multiple sources of remote sensing data; and 2) extracting crop phenology at field scales. An example in the U.S. Corn Belt area will be presented and analyzed. Future directions for mapping crop growth stages will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Southern Hemisphere currently exhibits low levels of atmospheric dust concentrations relative to the Northern Hemisphere. Recent research suggests that dust concentrations could, however, increase as a result of loss of vegetation cover in the Southern Kalahari and the Mallee. Disturbances resulting from grazing and agriculture are identified as such drivers of land use change in these regions. While studies on the importance of atmospheric dust in global-scale processes are abundant, little has been done to locate the potential dust sources in the Southern Hemisphere because potential new sources are by definition inactive and are undetected in satellite images. To this end, using a combination of laboratory experiments and field observations, we assess that the sediments collected from the dunefields in the Southern Kalahari and Mallee can emit substantial amount of dust, are rich in soluble iron and dust from these sources would reach the Southern Ocean. It is suggested that the supply of soluble iron through atmospheric dust deposition limits the productivity of the Southern Ocean. Thus intensification of land use can potentially make these regions an important source of iron given their proximity to the Southern Ocean. This iron-rich dust could stimulate ocean productivity in future as more areas are reactivated as a result of land-use and droughts.",

            "abstract": "Satellite observations of recent sea ice changes around Antarctica reveal regionally heterogeneous trends, but with an overall increasing trend in Antarctic-wide sea ice extent. Proposed mechanisms to account for increasing sea ice extent around Antarctica include freshening of the ocean surface due to melting of land ice and northward wind drift associated with strengthening of the Southern Ocean westerly winds. In this study we use extended, regional reconstructions of Antarctic sea ice changes from ice core chemistry and reanalysis of the South Orkney fast ice series to examine long-term relationships between Antarctic regional sea ice changes and surface winds.\nThe formation and breakout of fast ice at the South Orkney islands (Murphy et al., 2014) indicates that westerly wind strength is an important factor in determining spring sea ice retreat in the Weddell Sea region. In contrast, autumn sea ice formation is more strongly influenced by long-lived ocean temperature anomalies and sea ice migration from the previous year, highlighting the multiple influences that act at different times of the year to determine the overall extent of winter sea ice. To assess the hypothesized role of westerly wind changes in driving opposing patterns of recent sea ice change between the Ross Sea and Bellingshausen Sea, we also present a comparison of ice core MSA evidence for sea ice changes derived from the James Ross Island (Mulvaney et al., 2012) and Erebus Saddle (Rhodes et al., 2012) ice cores, and view this in the context of trends in the Southern Annular Mode (Abram et al., 2014) over the last 200 years.\n",

The City of Los Angeles (City) is evaluating plans for individual Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) pollutants in each of its major watersheds. However, it has yet to be studied if implementing individual BMP projects will adequately address water quality objectives for receiving (downstream) water bodies, such as Ballona Creek, Ballona Estuary and the Santa Monica Bay. In addition, there is significant uncertainty surrounding potential ancillary benefits (flood reduction, water supply, green space, etc.) from BMP/LID implementation. This presentation will overview our work with the City evaluating the influence of BMPs and LIDs in improving water quality at the watershed scale as well as quantifying other hydrologic benefits. Multiple BMP scenarios are considered to identify various pathways toward improved receiving water body quality in Ballona Creek and Dominquez watersheds. Specific study objectives are to: 1) identify suites of BMP scenarios which can lead to TMDL compliance, 2) quantify the multiple benefits provided by BMPs beyond their primary water quality improvement purpose, and 3) evaluate the success of using existing software for watershed-scale BMP modeling. Our goal is to provide realistic, implementable pathways that can be used by stakeholders to help plan for future education, outreach and capital improvement programs as well as determine feasible pollutant reduction objectives.",

            "abstract": "The City of Los Angeles relies heavily on external water sources, primarily the Eastern Sierra, Northern California and the Colorado River, and approximately 90% of the City’s water supply is snowpack dependent. In recent years, water conservation measures have been implemented in response to regional drought, which include a tiered pricing structure and watering restrictions. As a result of implemented conservation policies, Los Angeles reported the lowest water consumption per capita per day in 2011 among cities over 1 million people in the U.S. This presentation will highlight our ongoing work to better understand the coupling between humans, ecosystems and water across the City of Los Angeles, especially during the recent drought period. Our work is unique in that we integrate social, ecological, and hydrologic data, including ten years of residential water consumption data for the entire city of Los Angeles, extensive groundwater well data, socio-economic information and remote sensing to evaluate relationships as well as spatial and temporal patterns. Developed statistical models demonstrated that Single-Family Residential (SFR) water use across the City is primarily driven by household income, landscape greenness, water rates and water volume allocation,, with higher consumption rates in the northern, warmer and more affluent parts, and lower consumption rates in the less affluent neighborhoods near Downtown. Landscape use also varies greatly across the city, averaging 50% of total SFR. Our evaluation of conservation efforts shows that the combination of mandatory watering restrictions and price increase led to a water reduction of 23%, while voluntary restrictions led to only a 6% reduction in water use. Relationships of water use to ecosystems (greenness) and groundwater variability were also evaluated and will be highlighted. Our ultimate goal is to improve predictions of human-water interactions in order to drive policy change and guide future demand strategies under uncertain climate variability and a growing urban population.",

            "abstract": "Russia’s West Siberian Lowland (WSL) contains nearly 600,000 km2 of peatlands with depth >0.5 m, the most extensive such deposits in the world. These peatlands impact the global carbon cycle, representing an important CH4 source and net CO2 sink since the early Holocene. However, together with other Arctic and sub-Arctic peatlands, the likely responses of WSL peatlands to warming climate and associated permafrost degradation are a subject of ongoing study and debate. Of prime interest is whether WSL peatlands may switch from a net carbon sink to source, especially in permafrost peatlands. Climate models predict warmer temperatures, longer growing seasons, and enhanced precipitation which should increase net primary productivity and litter production, but also soil microbial decomposition, increasing release of sequestered carbon through outgassing of CH4 and/or CO2 to the atmosphere. Projecting the net outcome of these opposing ecosystem processes on carbon sink/source status requires is difficult, and given strong N-S temperature and permafrost gradients across the WSL, the response will likely vary geographically. Hydrological status is deeply important because aerobic dry peats emit a greater fraction of CO2 whereas anaerobic wet peats predominately release CH4. A first estimate of subsurface water storage in WSL peatlands suggests they may hold ~1,200 km3 of liquid-water equivalent (~2 m), a large number that is roughly triple the annual flow of water in the Ob’ River. New models, observations, and synthesis are needed to confidently project the future role of this important region to global carbon and water cycles.",

            "abstract": "For climate sensitive decisions and adaptation planning, guidance on how local climate is changing is needed at the specific thresholds relevant to particular impacts or policy endeavours. This requires the quantification of how the distributions of variables, such as daily temperature, are changing at specific quantiles. These temperature distributions are non-normal and vary both geographically and in time. We present a method[1,2] for analysing local climatic time series data to assess which quantiles of the local climatic distribution show the greatest and most robust changes. We have demonstrated this approach using the E-OBS gridded dataset[3] which consists of time series of local daily temperature across Europe over the last 60 years. Our method extracts the changing cumulative distribution function over time and uses a simple mathematical deconstruction of how the difference between two observations from two different time periods can be assigned to the combination of natural statistical variability and/or the consequences of secular climate change. The change in temperature can be tracked at a temperature threshold, at a likelihood, or at a given return time, independently for each geographical location. Geographical correlations are thus an output of our method and reflect both climatic properties (local and synoptic), and spatial correlations inherent in the observation methodology. We find as an output many regionally consistent patterns of response of potential value in adaptation planning. For instance, in a band from Northern France to Denmark the hottest days in the summer temperature distribution have seen changes of at least 2°C over a 43 year period; over four times the global mean change over the same period. We discuss methods to quantify the robustness of these observed sensitivities and their statistical likelihood. This approach also quantifies the level of detail at which one might wish to see agreement between climate models and observations if such models are to be used directly as tools to assess climate change impacts at local scales.\n[1] S C Chapman, D A Stainforth, N W Watkins, 2013, Phil.

            "abstract": "The rarity of long, well-dated paleoseismic records from sites along plate boundary transform faults is a major constraint on the development and evaluation of conceptual models of fault rupture behaviour. This is the case for the 800 km long, high slip rate (27±5 mm yr-1), dextral strike-slip Alpine Fault at the boundary between the Pacific and Australian plates in southern New Zealand. We use lacustrine paleoseismology to evaluate the hypothesis that the Alpine Fault exhibits self-similar behaviour, that is, the fault always produces earthquakes at or near a maximum magnitude of Mw8. The hypothesis is tested using reconstructions of high intensity shaking from five lakes situated along 240 km of the Alpine Fault’s Central section. Sedimentological investigation of lake cores shows that high intensity shaking events are recorded in the lake sediments as turbidites formed by subaqueous slumping. These turbidites are overlain by terrigenous sediment from co- and post-seismic landsliding on hillslopes in the lakes’ mountainous catchments. Chronologies derived from Bayesian modelling of AMS 14C dates on terrestrial leaf macrofossils precisely constrain the timing of earthquakes at the lake sites, facilitating along-strike correlation. Shaking events correlate between the sites and with known ruptures of the Alpine Fault, confirming the seismic origin of the deposits and allowing thresholds of shaking intensity for deposit formation to be determined using isoseismal modelling. Modelled shaking intensities for the last two Alpine Fault earthquakes show that subaqueous slumping occurs when shaking intensities exceed Modified Mercalli scale (MM) VI-VII, and that increased fluvial sediment fluxes from earthquake-induced landslides occur when shaking intensities exceed MM IX. The record of synchronous MM IX shaking at the lake sites provides first order constraint on the rupture length of the last ten earthquakes on the central Alpine Fault. Rupture scenarios for these earthquakes are augmented by correlating event timing with long earthquake records from the South Westland section and geomorphic reconstructions of the slip distribution for the most recent ruptures to explore the best-fit model of fault behaviour and to test the hypothesis that the Alpine Fault always ruptures in great (Mw8) earthquakes.",

Here we investigate whether climate change exerts a first-order control on the delivery of terrestrial organic matter to the coastal ocean by rivers and explore the consequences for the rate of C exchange between atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial reservoirs of C. Specifically, we employ inorganic proxies of sediment source and composition, coupled with stable-isotope and radiocarbon measurements of terrestrial biomarkers delivered to the Bay of Bengal since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to investigate climate-driven changes in the dynamics of terrestrial organic carbon (OC) export and burial in the world’s largest depocenter of sediment and OC.\nCompound-specific stable hydrogen (δD) and carbon (δ13C) isotopic measurements of plant wax compounds from a series of cores from the channel-levee system of the Bengal Fan capture variations in the strength of the Indian summer monsoon and vegetation dynamics within the Ganges-Brahmaputra drainage basin over the past 21 kyrs. Specifically, a 35 ‰ shift in plant wax δD between the LGM and Holocene Climatic Optima, (HCO; 9-5 ka) indicates a change from weaker to stronger monsoon conditions over this time period. Likewise, compound-specific δ13C measurements demonstrate a ca. 4 ‰ shift from the LGM to the HCO, recording a large decline of C4 plants in the basin during this period.\nResidence times of organic matter within the Ganges-Brahmaputra drainage basin determined from compound-specific radiocarbon dating of plant wax compounds vary between ca. 800 and 8000 years over the past 21 kyrs. These calculated residence time show a strong correlation with climate and in particular with the intensity of the summer monsoon as inferred from plant wax δD values. This is illustrated by an order of magnitude decrease in residence time between the driest (Heinrich event 1) and wettest (HCO) intervals of our record. This difference reflects protracted storage of organic matter on land during relatively colder, drier periods. Thus, we have identified climate change as a driver of the rates and sources (e.g., deep soils vs. recent biomass) of terrestrial-OC export from the largest erosional system on earth.",

            "abstract": "The atmosphere is a small reservoir of carbon compared to rocks, the biosphere and the ocean. As such, its size is sensitive to small imbalance of C exchange with and between larger reservoirs. Over long timescales, the continental biosphere is mostly at equilibrium with the atmosphere, most of the net photosynthetic primary production being quickly returned to the atmosphere via respiration. However, rivers deliver particulate organic carbon (OC) from continental to oceanic reservoirs, where OC can be buried and stored over long timescales. This “leak” of biospheric carbon away from the biosphere-atmosphere loop represents a net sequestration of atmospheric C. Rivers also transfer OC from the rock reservoir (petrogenic C) to marine sediments, thereby transferring C between two reservoirs disconnected from the atmosphere. During this transfer, oxidation of petrogenic C represents another “leak’’ of C, in this case towards the atmosphere. Riverine export of OC to the ocean thus fundamentally affects the atmospheric C inventory, over both long and short timescales. Nevertheless, global riverine OC export to and burial in marine sediments has heretofore remained poorly constrained and the respective fluxes of biospheric and petrogenic C have simply been unknown. Even more importantly, the mechanisms controlling OC export and burial have remained poorly defined, impeding our ability to make quantitative predictions of OC fluxes under forcing scenarios. Based on bulk, ramped-pyrolysis and molecular level 14C dating of OC in modern river sediments we present: 1) an evaluation of the global delivery of petrogenic and biospheric OC to the ocean and, 2) a characterization of the dominant drivers of petrogenic and biospheric OC delivery the ocean.",

            "abstract": "The oxygen-deficient zone that extends from coastal Peru well into the tropical Pacific Ocean has been described as “suboxic,” but recent measurements of sulfate reduction suggest it may have some anoxic characteristics (e.g., free sulfide). The redox poise of suboxia strongly affects the solubility/stability of a wide variety of trace elements and therefore their vertical and horizontal transport. The problem is that suboxic is not chemically well defined, but certainly represents a very wide range of redox conditions (pE of ca. 10 to -2). During the 2013 US GEOTRACES Pacific cruise (International GEOTRACES section GP16) we determined a suite of redox couples to help define the redox poise in the water column: oxygen(/water), iodate/iodide, nitrate/nitrite, selenate/elemental Se, arsenate/arsenite, and sulfate/hydrogen sulfide. Using the RV Thomas Thompson we occupied a total of 11 stations along 12° S from coastal Peru to 94° W to sample the oxygen deficient waters using a conventional CTD/rosette and the trace metal-clean US GEOTRACES CTD/carousel. Determinations of all the redox tracers were made on board ship except for selenium. On the Peru shelf, oxygen concentrations were less than 10 µM from 30m to the bottom, while farther offshore the depth of this oxygen minimum was 700 m thick starting at ca. 80 m depth; the layer thickness steadily decreased moving west. In spite of the low oxygen conditions, nitrate and iodate were still detectable, while their corresponding reduced species had maxima in the low O2 waters. Dissolved hydrogen sulfide was below the detection limit of 70 pM, and no evidence of As(V) reduction was found; selenium speciation has yet to be determined. The lack of detectable dissolved hydrogen sulfide shows the redox conditions are certainly not anoxic, and incomplete iodate and nitrate reduction suggest the redox environment is more oxidizing than previously reported. The apparent temporal and spatial variability of the redox poise will be discussed.",

This curriculum incorporates up-to-date SMD education resources and science and mission data relating to NASA’s explorations of Mars. The MRC focuses on the adventure of learning and discovery, asking participating teams to propose their own scientific mission to Mars, design a rover to carry it out, and present a mock-up at an open house. The curriculum is structured to be inquiry-based throughout. The “students choose the mission” structure is highly engaging. The latter half of the curriculum presents the Engineering Design Process and walks the students through the steps of designing and engineering a spacecraft/rover to meet the mission objectives chosen by the students. Students are introduced to engineering using the design-project approach. The six-week project period culminates in a public celebration at which students present their missions to members of the community including undergraduate and graduate students in science, engineering, and education fields; university faculty in these fields; and professionals from associated industries.",

            "abstract": "In order to perform transient simulations of ice sheet evolution, a spin up of several thousands of years is usually required to obtain an initial state for which the ice sheet model is close to thermo-mechanical equilibrium. Using this approach, however, the final ice sheet geometry will likely be significantly different from that of the present-day, which will strongly impact forward model simulations, in particular those targeting a short (50-100 years) period of time. To mitigate this problem, we propose an adjoint-based optimization algorithm for the ice sheet initialization, in which we minimize the mismatch with observed surface velocity data and between the surface mass balance forcing and the modeled flux divergence. We invert for basal topography and basal friction fields simultaneously, and use the first-order Stokes approximation. We provide results for the Greenland ice sheet and also compare our proposed approach to the more widely used approach of matching surface velocity data only, by inverting for basal friction parameters. Also, we compute the sensitivity of integral quantities like the total ice discharge flux with respect to spatial changes in the basal friction or the basal topography. Current and future work will focus on modeling uncertainties of the optimized basal sliding parameters using the inverse of the Hessian as an approximation for the covariance of the parameter distribution.",

            "abstract": "Triangular facets are among the most striking landforms associated with normal faulting. The genesis of facets is of great interest both for the information facets contain about tectonic motion, and because the progressive emergence of facets makes them potential recorders of both geomorphic and tectonic history. In this report, we present observations of triangular facets in the western United States and in the Italian Central Apennines. Facets in these regions typically form quasi-planar surfaces that are aligned in series along and above the trace of an active fault. Some facet surfaces consist mainly of exposed bedrock, with a thin and highly discontinuous cover of loose regolith. Other facets are mantled by a several-decimeter-thick regolith cover. Over the course of its morphologic development, a facet slope segment may evolve from a steep (~60 degree) bedrock fault scarp, well above the angle of repose for soil, to a gentler (~20-40 degree) slope that can potentially sustain a coherent regolith cover. This evolutionary trajectory across the angle of repose renders nonlinear diffusion theory inapplicable. To formulate an alternative process-based theory for facet evolution, we use a particle-based approach that acknowledges the possibility for both short- and long-range sediment-grain motions, depending on the topography. The processes of rock weathering, grain entrainment, and grain motion are represented as stochastic state-pair transitions with specified transition rates. The model predicts that facet behavior can range smoothly along the spectrum from a weathering-limited mode to a transport-limited mode, depending on the ratio of fault-slip rate to bare-bedrock regolith production rate. The model also implies that facets formed along a fault with pinned tips should show systematic variation in slope angle that correlates with along-fault position and slip rate. Preliminary observations from central Italy and the eastern Basin and Range are consistent with this prediction.",

Unlike induction currents at bodies surrounded by significant atmospheres, Rhea’s flux tube current system is not driven by motion through the plasma, but rather thermoelectrically, by heat flow into the object. In addition to Rhea, the requirements for the current system are easily satisfied at many plasma absorbing bodies: (1) a difference of average ion and electron gyroradii radii, and (2) a “sharp” body of any size, i.e., without a significant thick atmosphere. This type of current system is therefore expected to occur generally, e.g. at other airless planetary satellites, asteroids, and even spacecraft; and accordingly, represents a fundamental aspect of the physics of the interaction of astrophysical objects with space plasmas.",

            "abstract": "In this presentation we address federal wildfire risk management largely through the lens of economics, targeting questions related to costs, effectiveness, efficiency, and tradeoffs. Beyond risks to resources and assets such as wildlife habitat, watersheds, and homes, wildfires present financial risk and budgetary instability for federal wildfire management agencies due to highly variable annual suppression costs. Despite its variability, the costs of wildfire management have continued to escalate and account for an ever-growing share of overall agency budgets, compromising abilities to attain other objectives related to forest health, recreation, timber management, etc. Trends associated with a changing climate and human expansion into fire-prone areas could lead to additional suppression costs in the future, only further highlighting the need for an ability to evaluate economic tradeoffs in investments across the wildfire management spectrum.\nCritically, these economic analyses need to accurately capture the complex spatial and stochastic aspects of wildfire, the inherent uncertainty associated with monetizing environmental impacts of wildfire, the costs and effectiveness of alternative management policies, and linkages between pre-fire investments and active incident management. Investing in hazardous fuels reduction and forest restoration in particular is a major policy lever for pre-fire risk mitigation, and will be a primary focus of our presentation. Evaluating alternative fuel management and suppression policies could provide opportunities for significant efficiency improvements in the development of risk-informed management fire management strategies. Better understanding tradeoffs of fire impacts and costs can help inform policy questions such as how much of the landscape to treat and how to balance investments in treating new areas versus maintaining previous investments. We will summarize current data needs, knowledge gaps, and other factors influencing research and development on this critically important topic. Specifically we will focus on how to embed simulation models within an economic framework, how to link fire models with models of wildfire management expenditures, how to evaluate alternative management policies, and how to measure cost-effectiveness.",

The ASO data was delivered to water resource managers from the California Department of Water Resources in under 24 hours from the time that the Twin Otter aircraft landed in Mammoth Lakes, CA to the time disks were plugged in to the ASO Mobile Compute System (MCS) deployed at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory (SNARL) near the airport.\nASO performed weekly flights and each flight took between 500GB to 1 Terabyte of raw data, which was then processed from level 0 data products all the way to full level 4 maps of Snow Water Equivalent, albedo mosaics, and snow depth from LIDAR. These data were produced by Interactive Data analysis Language (IDL) algorithms which were then unobtrusively and automatically integrated into an Apache OODT and Apache Tika based Big Data processing system. Data movement was both electronic and physical including novel uses of LaCie 1 and 2 TeraByte (TB) data bricks and deployment in rugged terrain. The MCS was controlled remotely from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology (JPL) in Pasadena, California on behalf of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Communication was aided through the use of novel Internet Relay Chat (IRC) command and control mechanisms and through the use of the Notifico open source communication tools.\n\nThis talk will describe the high powered, and light-weight Big Data processing system that we developed for ASO and its implications more broadly for airborne missions at NASA and throughout the government. The lessons learned from ASO show the potential to have a large impact in the development of Big Data processing systems in the years to come.",

Although scientists have become increasingly convinced about anthropological climate change, change in public opinion has been underwhelming. The unexplained gap between scientific consensus and public opinion has made this topic an important research area in the realm of public understanding of science. Recent research on climate change risk perception (CCRP) has advanced an intriguing hypothesis, namely, cultural cognition thesis (CCT), which posits that the public has adequate knowledge to understand climate change science but people tend to use this knowledge solely to promote their culturally motivated view-point of climate change. This talk provides evidence to demonstrate that despite culture playing a significant role in influencing CCRP, knowledge deficiency remains a persistent problem in our society and contributes to the aforementioned gap. However, such deficits can remain undiagnosed due to limitations of survey design.",

            "abstract": "We combine seismic and geochemical datasets that span a 2000 km stretch of the Aleutian arc\nto investigate the processes that control arc magmatism at a regional scale. We use seismic data\nrecorded over 10 years from 46 volcano monitoring networks to search for regional variations\nin volcano seismicity. The volcanoes in the central portion of the arc—those located from\nAniakchak to Okmok—are associated with significantly more seismicity at depths below 15 km.\nWe compare the trends in seismicity with variations in the SiO2 compositions of the volcanoes\nby compiling published geochemical data. The transition between felsic volcanism in the east\nto more mafic volcanism in the west occurs in the same region where the depth distribution of\nvolcanic earthquakes changes. Since deep volcanic earthquakes are often thought to be generated\nby the ascent of magma through the deep crust (i.e., depths greater than 15 km), our results\nsuggest that magma ascent is more prolific in the central part of the arc compared to the western\nand eastern regions. This observation is in agreement with the location of the largest and most\nhistorically active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc, which are found in same region that generates\nabundant deep volcano seismicity. We propose two models to explain these apparent variations\nin magmatic flux: (1) a stress-based model, in which subduction obliquity and the collision of the\nYakutat block affect the stress regime in the upper plate, inhibiting the rise of magma in eastern\nand western regions of the arc and (2) a melt-based model, where more magma is generated\nin the central region of the arc through increased H2O in the downgoing slab via water-laden\nsediments and subducting fracture zones.",

A practical RESTful API is used whose endpoints are also URIs in an ontology. Both the relational schema and the ontology are maleable, and stability is ensured through test driven development and continuous integration testing using modern open source techniques.

            "abstract": "The Mars Exploration Rover Spirit encountered a remarkable diversity of rocks during its traverse of the Columbia Hills in Gusev crater, manifested both as variations in primary mineralogy and in secondary alteration. The Wishstone and Watchtower Classes represent examples where the less altered (Wishstone) and more altered versions (Watchtower) were recognized as members of an alteration series identified by variations in geochemistry and Fe-bearing mineral phases [1-3]. Work by [1] demonstrated a geochemical relationship consistent with two-component mixing between a high Al2O3, TiO2, CaO, Na2O, P2O5 end-member and a second end-member enriched in MgO, Zn, S, Br, and Cl. The first end-member probably is Wishstone Class, with Watchtower Class intermediate between it and an unrecognized second end-member lithology [1].\nNew results using mirror-dust corrected spectra from Spirit’s Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer [4] affirm the dominant plagioclase component in Wishstone and an amorphous component resembling basaltic glass in Watchtower identified previously [5]. But now we recognize a suite of rocks spanning the full range of alteration, including one dubbed Bruce that appears to be an alteration spectral end-member [4]. The spectra of some rocks with an intermediate level of alteration are well modeled as a simple two-component mixture of Wishstone and Bruce spectra. This is consistent with a style of alteration that progressively obscures spectral contributions of the host rock minerals and is inconsistent with a surface coating. The Bruce spectrum is poorly modeled by primary and secondary phases including phyllosilicates and amorphous silicates. This suggests a style of alteration not recognized in terrestrial settings. Based on the similarity of the Bruce spectrum to TES type 2, this style of alteration may be more widespread on Mars. The conditions that produced this alteration are poorly constrained, hence the relationship to habitability is unknown at this time.\n[1] Hurowitz, J. A., et al. (2006), J. Geophys.

            "abstract": "Access to soil water by roots is a key ecophysiological factor for plant productivity in natural systems. Periodically during dry seasons or critically during episodic climate droughts, shortage of water supply can reduce or severely impair plant life. At the other extreme persistent soil waterlogging will limit root respiration and restrict local establishment to adapted species, usually leading to stunted and less productive communities. Soil-water availability is therefore a very important climate variable controlling plant physiology and ecosystem dynamics. Terra-firme, the non-seasonally floodable terrain that covers 82% of the landscape in Amazonia,\n[1]\nsupports the most massive part of the rainforest ecosystem. The availability of soil water data for terra-firme is scant and very coarse. This lack of data has hampered observational and modeling studies aiming to develop a large-scale integrative ecohydrological picture of Amazonia and its vulnerability to climate change. We have mapped the Amazon basin with a new terrain model developed in our group (HAND, Height Above the Nearest drainage\n[2]\n), delineating soil water environments using topographical data from the SRTM digital elevation model (250 m horizontal interpolated resolution). The preliminary results show that more than 50% of Terra-firme has the water table very close to the surface (up to 2 m deep), while the remainder of the upland landscape has variable degree of dependence on non-saturated soil (vadose layer). The mapping also shows extremely heterogeneous patterns of fine-scale relief across the basin, which implies complex ecohydrological regional forcing on the forest physiology. Ecoclimate studies should therefore take into account fine-scale relief and its implications for soil-water availability to plant processes.\n[1] Melack, J. M., & Hess, L. L. (2011).

            "abstract": "Pyroclast density and vesicularity are critical parameters in physical volcanology used to reconstruct eruptive dynamics and feed numerical models. Pyroclastic deposits typically present a wide range of density and vesicularity values, so measurements must be repeated tens of times. These data are generally treated using classical statistical analysis including averages and frequency histograms. One issue in this approach is that density and vesicularity are intensive properties and therefore they cannot be added or averaged directly. We encourage the use of weighted density and vesicularity averages and histograms, which is, until now, done only in few studies. In order to insure an adequate and efficient use of the weighting equations, we introduce an open-source R code to calculate the most common statistical parameters such as range and weighted averages, and produce abundance histograms. An important question when working with statistics is whether or not the sample size is large enough. To address this matter we also included a stability analysis based on a Monte Carlo approach which enables to quantify the reliability of the results. To illustrate this methodology we chose two large datasets from Chachimbiro (Ecuador) and Unzen (Japan) volcanoes. Our first results indicate that the use of weighted analysis instead of frequency analysis can change the density and vesicularity averages up to 4% and the shape of the abundance histogram leading to different interpretations. The stability analysis reveals that the number of measurements required for reliable results depends greatly on the distribution of density and vesicularity values. Therefore the number of measurements must be fixed on an ipso facto basis using a large sample size at the beginning and reducing it to achieve time efficiency.",

            "abstract": "In reflection seismic interpretation, a 1-D convolutional model is commonly used to interpret amplitude variations based on the geometric ray theory assuming seismic wave to reflect at a reflection point; however, the propagation of seismic waves actually occurs in a finite zone around the geometric ray path and gets reflected from a zone known as Fresnel zone. The collected signal at the surface turns out to be the superposition of reflections from within the Fresnel zone, which is a function of texture. Generally, for a rough texture such as sandstone, the dominant reflection is from the zone margin, while for a smooth texture such as marine shale, the dominant reflection is from the zone center. Based on this concept, Fresnel-zone texture directly affects amplitude variations with offset (AVO), azimuth (AVAZ), and frequency (AVF).\nHere we develop a computer algorithm for evaluating Fresnel-zone textural roughness. The algorithm starts with dividing the Fresnel zone into a set of micro-zones. It then builds an initial texture model to be convolved with an extracted wavelet. By comparing the synthetic signal from a Fresnel zone to the real seismic signal within an analysis window at a target location, the model is adjusted and updated until both synthetic and real signals match best. The roughness is evaluated as the correlation coefficient between the generated texture model within the Fresnel zone and the ideal model for a rough texture medium. Our new algorithm is applied to a deep-water 3D seismic volume over offshore Angola, west Africa. The results show that a rough texture is associated with channel sands, whereas a smooth texture with marine shale.",

            "abstract": "Geologic and geophysical data suggest that partially serpentinized peridotites and serpentinites are a significant part of the oceanic lithosphere. All serpentinization reactions are exothermic and result in volume expansion as high as 40%. Volume expansion beneath the seafloor will lead to surface uplift and elevated stresses in the neighborhood of the region undergoing serpentinization. The serpentinization-induced stresses are likely to result in faulting or tensile fracturing that promote the serpentinization process by creating new permeability and allowing fluid access to fresh peridotite. To explore these issues, we developed a first-order model of crustal deformation by considering an inclusion undergoing transformation strain in an elastic half-space. Using solutions for inclusions of different shapes, orientations, and depths, we calculate the surface uplift and mechanical stresses generated by the serpentinization processes. We discuss the topographic features at the TAG hydrothermal field (Mid-Atlantic Ridge, 26°N), uplift of the Miyazaki Plain (Southwestern Japan), and tectonic history of the Atlantic Massif (inside corner high of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, 30°N, and the Atlantis Transform Fault).\nOur analysis suggests that an anomalous salient of 3 km in diameter and 100 m high at TAG may have resulted from approximately 20% transformational strain in a region beneath the footwall of the TAG detachment fault. This serpentinization process tends to promote slip along some overlying normal faults, which may then enhance fluid pathways to the deeper crust to continue the serpentinization process. The serpentinization also favors slip and seismicity along the antithetic faults identified below the TAG detachment fault. Our solution for the Miyazaki Plain above the Kyushu-Palau subduction zone explains the observed uplift of 120 m, but the transformational strain needs only be 3%. Transformational strains associated with serpentinization in this region may promote thrust-type events in the aseismic slip zone near the upper boundary of the subducting Philippine Sea Plate. Thermal effects of serpentinization in both regions are small.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation links the planet’s water and carbon cycles. Stomata on plant leaves are the pores through which CO2 is fixed during photosynthesis, and also the pores through which water is returned to the atmosphere as the transpiration flux. Stomata therefore exert considerable control over both the water and carbon cycles. Unfortunately, the long-term responses of stomata to rising CO2 and changes in climate are still rather uncertain, despite their significance for future climate. In contrast, Plant Water Use Efficiency (WUE) which is the ratio of the carbon assimilated through photosynthesis to the water lost through transpiration, is a robust diagnostic of the functioning of the land biosphere that is not directly dependent on the uncertain long-term responses of stomata.\nWe have recently shown that it is possible to get constrained estimates of fractional changes in WUE based purely on changes in atmospheric CO2 and near surface temperature and humidity. This is achieved by calibrating against eddy covariance flux measurements (that constrain the response of WUE to humidity deficit), and also d13C records from tree-rings (that constrain the CO2-sensitivity of WUE). This talk will show how these ground-based measurements imply very significant changes in WUE, both globally and regionally, from 1900 onwards. Furthermore, we will show how the combination of our reconstructed changes in WUE with satellite-based estimates of Gross Primary Productivity, enable recent changes in plant transpiration to be estimated.",

            "abstract": "Climate is often invoked as a major driver of soil and landscape evolution. But a coherent story has failed to emerge for how climate controls soil properties and weathering rates – partially due to competing influences of mineral residence times and supply rates in eroding landscapes. Here, we combine insights and methods across the related fields of geomorphology, soil science and geochemistry, to explore weathering thresholds in non-eroding, young soils along a strong precipitation gradient (400-4000 mm/yr) in the South Island of New Zealand.\nWe studied ~30 soil profiles developed in thin (~1m) loess deposits that mantle LGM and post LGM moraines and outwash in the Waitaki catchment, extending from Lake Benmore to just below the Tasman glacier in the north. We find repeated thresholds (sharp, non-linear transitions) in soil chemistry, including exchangeable cations, pH and total elemental abundances. Abundance of pedogenic iron and aluminum increase with precipitation, stabilizing at ~2000 mm/yr. Plant-available phosphorous and exchangeable Ca and Mg are rapidly depleted as precipitation exceeds 1000 mm/yr. However total elemental abundances show up to 50% of major cations are retained at wetter sites, likely in less labile minerals. Preliminary numerical modeling of cation weathering kinetics provides some support for this interpretation. Together our data identify nonlinear changes in weathering intensity with rainfall, and show clear climate control on relatively young, post-glacial soil development.\nAdditionally, we measured profiles and inventories of meteoric 10Be to quantify soil residence times across the climate gradient. This nuclide is cosmogenically produced in the atmosphere and binds strongly to reactive surfaces in soil following fallout. Exchangeable beryllium does not decrease with rainfall, despite decreasing pH along the climate gradient. Therefore we are confident that nuclide concentrations do not reflect leaching. Instead, these measurements provide insight into the timescale of loess stabilization and soil development during major climate transitions in the region, including the glacial-interglacial transition and changing intensity of the westerlies.",

While there have been many theoretical advances in both topics, including suggestions that they may be intimately related, the inherent scale coupling and complexity of these phenomena limits our ability to construct models that test them on a fundamental level for realistic solar conditions. At the same time, there is an ever increasing impetus to improve our spaceweather models, and incorporating treatments for these processes that capture their basic features while remaining tractable is an important goal. With this in mind, I will give an overview of our exploration of a wave-turbulence driven (WTD) model for coronal heating and solar wind acceleration based on low-frequency Alfvénic turbulence. Here we attempt to bridge the gap between theory and practical modeling by exploring this model in 1D HD and multi-dimensional MHD contexts. The key questions that we explore are: What properties must the model possess to be a viable model for coronal heating? What is the influence of the magnetic field topology (open, closed, rapidly expanding)? And can we simultaneously capture coronal heating and solar wind acceleration with such a quasi-steady formulation? Our initial results suggest that a WTD based formulation performs adequately for a variety of solar and heliospheric conditions, while significantly reducing the number of free parameters when compared to empirical heating and solar wind models. The challenges, applications, and future prospects of this type of approach will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is affecting the seasonality and mass of snow, and impacting the water resources of hundreds of millions of people who depend on streamflow originating in High Asia. Global climate model (GCM) outputs are the primary forcing data used to investigate future projections of changes in snow and glacier processes; however, these processes occur at a much finer spatial scale than the resolution of current GCMs. To facilitate studying the cryosphere in High Asia, we developed a software package to downscale monthly GCM data to 30-arcseconds for any global land area. Using this downscaling package, we produce an ensemble of downscaled GCM data from 2020-2100, corresponding to representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. We then use these data to model changes to snowfall in the Karakorum and Hindu Kush (KHK) region, which is located in High Asia. The ensemble mean of these data predict that total annual snowfall in 2095 will decrease by 22% under RCP 4.5 and 46% under RCP 8.5, relative to 1950-2000 climatological values. For both scenarios, the changes in snowfall are dependent on elevation, with the maximum decreases in snowfall occurring at approximately 2,300 m. While total snowfall decreases, an interesting feature of snowfall change for the RCP 8.5 scenario is that the ensemble mean projection shows an increase in snowfall for elevations between 3,000- 5,000 m relative to historic values. These fine-scale spatial, temporal, and elevation-dependent patterns of changes in projected snowfall significantly affect the energy balance of the snowpack, in turn affecting timing of melt and discharge. Therefore, our work can be coupled with a glacio-hydrological model to assess effects of these snowfall patterns on other processes or compared to existing model results to assess treatment of snow processes in the existing model. Our method is designed to downscale climate data for any global land area, allowing for the production of these fine-scale climate and cryosphere forcing data for other high altitude areas as well.",

All forms of Hg are deposited from the atmosphere; however, because oxidized Hg is more available for methylation in ecosystems it is of significant concern. Recent work has suggested that different chemical compounds of GOM exist in the atmosphere. Each has unique chemical and physical properties. Understanding the relative abundances and properties of GOM in the atmosphere is critical for assessing the potential impacts on human and ecological health. A newly developed active system that measures the chemical form and concentration of GOM was deployed with triplicate nylon and cation-exchange membranes, respectively. Membranes were deployed and collected every two weeks at highway, free-troposphere, and agricultural impacted sites. Nylon membranes are used to estimate potential GOM compounds using thermodesorption and cation-exchange membranes are assumed to collect all GOM. The objective of this study was to understand distribution and chemistry of GOM compounds in the atmosphere, at these three locations with different oxidants. Thermodesorption profiles were generated using a laboratory system consisting of a custom-built eight-port manifold system and compared to profiles developed from samples collected from the field. GOM profiles developed in the laboratory were created from permeation of GOM from solid compounds: HgCl2, HgBr2, HgO, Hg(NO3)2, and HgSO4. Results indicate different forms of GOM across space and time. GOM concentrations were observed to be 33% higher at the free-troposphere site compared to the highway-impacted site. Data suggest that different Hg reactions are occurring at different sites.",

            "abstract": "Detecting the atmospheric response to changes in solar irradiance and energetic particle fluxes on timescales up to several decades remains a significant challenge. The satellite observational record is still comparatively short. Attribution is hampered by the presence of other natural variability (e.g., that induced by volcanoes, ENSO or stratospheric sudden warmings) and also the possible non-linear response to a combination of forcings. Still, models and observations are rapidly improving. Several earth system models now fully resolve the middle atmosphere and include interactive chemistry. The observational database is growing to better characterize irradiance and particle fluxes and now includes many chemical constituents. This allows us to better represent both the solar-induced forcing of the atmosphere and how the physical system responds to that forcing. In this overview, I will attempt to summarize recent progress towards correctly representing the full Sun-Earth connection. Examples will be given of where advancements in model and observational capabilities would substantially improve this representation.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon is the optically dark component of particulate matter and results from both anthropogenic and natural combustion, including biomass combustion during wildland fire. Recent studies have shown that the deposition of black carbon (BC) is a significant contributor to observed warming trends in the Arctic. We examine the ability of the atmosphere to transport emissions to the Arctic from source locations across the Northern Hemisphere, creating a measure of Arctic transport potential. When Arctic transport potential is low, the ability of the atmosphere to transport emissions, including black carbon, to the Arctic quickly is reduced, and the likelihood of the emissions source creating a large impact on the Arctic is reduced. Using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model along with global reanalysis and regional reanalysis data sets, trajectories were released at 7 source heights every 6 hours for the period 1979-2009 and tracked to see when they reached the arctic. An altas of Arctic transport potential was then developed using the results of the ~1B trajectories that shows the spatial patterns and variation in the number of trajectories reaching the Arctic within a threshold time period (selectable from 1-10 days) as a function of seasonality and starting height. By combining these results with estimated emissions sources, here done for wildland fire emissions, critical source areas and seasonal timings can be identified for further study or mitigation. Additionally, a daily prediction tool was created to indicate those periods when emissions are less likely to reach the Arctic. This tool, done as a prototype, offers the potential that managers, such as prescribed burners, may be able to better choose when burn in order to help mitigate potential impacts on the Arctic.",

To better understand the response of global mean thermosteric sea-level change to these forcings, we compare three observational datasets to experiments of 28 climate models with up to five different forcing scenarios for 1957-2005. We use the pre-industrial control runs to determine the internal climate variability. Our analysis shows that anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing is required to explain the magnitude of the observed changes, while natural forcing drives most of the externally-forced decadal variability. The experiments that include anthropogenic and natural forcings capture the observed increased trend towards the end of the 20th century. The observed changes can be best explained by scaling the natural-only experiment by 0.70±0.30 and the anthropogenic-only experiment (including opposing forcing from greenhouse gases and aerosols) by 1.08±0.13 (+/-2σ).",

            "abstract": "Deltas are typically treated as binary systems composed of a channel network and the land separating adjacent channels. Field studies of these systems have tended to focus on collecting data either from the channels or from the land, and by doing so have missed a central characteristic of deltas, the connectedness between the land and channels. We propose that the resiliency of any delta can only be accurately assessed if the naturally occurring exchanges of fluid, solids and solutes between the channels and islands (neighboring land) are understood. These exchanges control the growth of land via the deposition of sediment and accumulation of plant biomass, and also affect delta ecology by mediating water temperature and solute concentrations. The deposition of sediment and organic material in turn influences future growth and pattern development for the deltaic channel network. Exchanges between channelized flow in the delta network and the more distributed flow over submerged island tops is currently being monitored and studied at an NSF-funded observatory under development at Wax Lake Delta, Louisiana. Characterization of flow in distributary channels and on island tops reveals that a considerable fraction of water originally travelling in the large channels is transferred onto island tops either through focused entry points (tie channels) or via distributed flow through island-bounding levees. These volume transfer fractions range between 10 and 60 percent, and are sensitive to location within the delta, as well as river discharge, tides, and winds. Island tops develop tributary-like networks through which the fluid, solids, and solutes drain back into adjacent channels or drain out of the system at the front of the delta, in between the mouths of primary distributary channels. Characteristic fluid velocities vary over roughly two orders of magnitude (centimeter- to meter-per-second) depending on whether a fluid parcel is located in shallow laterally unconfined flow on an island top or positioned in a primary channel. We will discuss how these monitored exchanges affect the growth of new land and delta ecology, as well as how overall delta growth influences future exchange of water, solids and solutes between the channels and islands composing this prograding coastal environment.",

            "abstract": "In our continued effort to understand the climate system and improve its representation in general circulation models (GCMs) it is crucial to develop new methods to evaluate these models. This is certainly true as the GCM community advances towards high horizontal resolutions (i.e., grid spacing less than 0.5 degrees), which will require interpreting and improving the performance of many model components. Of specific interest is the role of convective parameterizations at these spatial scales and its impact on tropical dynamics and precipitation processes. Idealized, or reduced complexity, frameworks can be used to investigate how model assumptions impact behavior across scales. A simplified global radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) configuration is proposed to explore the implication of horizontal resolution on equilibrium climate. RCE is the statistical equilibrium in which the radiative cooling of the atmosphere is balanced by heating due to convection and has had a fundamental place in our understanding of the Earth system.\nIn this work, the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Community Atmosphere Model 5 (CAM5) is configured in RCE to better understand tropical climate and extremes. The RCE setup consists of an ocean-covered earth with diurnally varying, spatially uniform insolation and no rotation effects. CAM5 is run with the spectral element dynamics package at two horizontal resolutions: a standard resolution of approximately 1 degree grid spacing and a high-resolution of approximately 0.25 degree grid spacing. Surface temperature effects are considered by comparing simulations using fixed, uniform sea surface temperature to simulations using an interactive slab ocean model. The various CAM5 configurations provide useful insights into the simulation of tropical climate at the high-resolution, as well as the model’s ability to simulate extreme precipitation events. In particular, the manner in which convection organizes is shown to be dependent on model resolution, as evident by differences in cloud structure, circulation, and precipitation intensity. The use of the interactive slab ocean also impacts convective characteristics, by increasing convective temporal variability and intensity.",

            "abstract": "A cyberinfrastructure data management system for sedimentary geology is crucial to multiple facets of interdisciplinary Earth science research, as sedimentary systems form the deep-time framework for many geoscience communities. The breadth and depth of the sedimentary field spans research on the processes that form, shape and affect the Earth’s sedimentary crust and distribute resources such as hydrocarbons, coal, and water. The sedimentary record is used by Earth scientists to explore questions such as the continental crust evolution, dynamics of Earth’s past climates and oceans, evolution of the biosphere, and the human interface with Earth surface processes.\nMajor challenges to a data management system for sedimentary geology are the volume and diversity of field, analytical, and experimental data, along with many types of physical objects. Objects include rock samples, biological specimens, cores, and photographs. Field data runs the gamut from discrete location and spatial orientation to vertical records of bed thickness, textures, color, sedimentary structures, and grain types. Ex situ information can include geochemistry, mineralogy, petrophysics, chronologic, and paleobiologic data. All data types cover multiple order-of-magnitude scales, often requiring correlation of the multiple scales with varying degrees of resolution. The stratigraphic framework needs dimensional context with locality, time, space, and depth relationships. A significant challenge is that physical objects represent discrete values at specific points, but measured stratigraphic sections are continuous. In many cases, field data is not easily quantified, and determining uncertainty can be difficult.\nDespite many possible hurdles, the sedimentary community is anxious to embrace geoinformatic resources that can provide better tools to integrate the many data types, create better search capabilities, and equip our communities to conduct high-impact science at unprecedented levels.",

            "abstract": "Hafnium isotope signatures in some Archean komatiites (ca. 3.5-3.0 billion years old) require a mantle source with a time-integrated Lu/Hf that exceeds average modern depleted mantle. Investigation of the timing and locus of parent–daughter fractionation in their mantle sources potentially constrains differentiation processes in the early Earth and their subsequent distribution and storage. In addition, they may help to constrain the Hf isotope evolution of the greater depleted mantle. In order to shed light on these processes, we discuss radiogenic Hf isotopes in conjunction with stable Fe isotope systematics in Archean komatiites from the Pilbara craton in Western Australia. Our findings indicate that, after careful evaluation of the effects of alteration, pristine samples are characterised by initial 176Hf/177Hf, which lie above the age-corrected depleted mantle, as a consequence of ancient melt extraction. Iron isotope systematics for these samples further point to a mantle source that is isotopically lighter than average modern depleted mantle, which is also consistent with melt-depletion. Taken together, these observations require a component of an old, super-depleted reservoir in the komatiite mantle source(s) that survived in the mantle for possibly hundreds of millions of years. The Lu/Hf of this refractory mantle appears to be complementary to, and therefore contemporaneous with, the first terrestrial crust, as preserved in Hadean (i.e., > 4 Ga) detrital zircon cores, which may indicate a causal relationship between them. We will discuss implications for very early mantle dynamics and the formation of very early mantle reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "Radar altimetry measurements of the ocean surface topography from two satellites have recently been used to construct a new global marine gravity model that is twice as accurate as previous models. The model reveals previously invisible abyssal hill (AH) fabric in many parts of the ocean basins, placing valuable additional constraints on tectonic events reflected in changes in the orientation of linear AHs, and thus in spreading direction. AH fabric, if dated via marine magnetic anomalies, puts much tighter temporal constraints on changes in seafloor spreading directions than fracture zones, which, depending on their offset, often take many millions of years to adjust to major plate motion events. The new data also reveal previously unmapped microplates in the Pacific and Indian oceans. They preferentially form in spreading corridors where spreading rates were very high, reaching plate tectonic speed limits, or in response to plate reorganization stresses. The mapping of previously unknown or poorly mapped ridge propagation events during the Cretaceous Normal Superchron (CNS), leading to pseudofaults and extinct ridges, is relevant for interpreting marine magnetic anomaly sequences during the CNS in terms of magnetic field variability. The new grid provides breathtakingly detailed views of individual fault structures, previously only mapped via expensive seismic surveys, in the North Falkland Basin. Here narrow vertical gravity gradient highs and lows can be shown to correspond to seismically imaged horsts and grabens bounded by normal faults. The new gravity field allows us to create a detailed regional fault map outside of existing seismic coverage. The fault network that emerges illustrates that this eastern region of the Falkland Plateau is characterised by broadly distributed faulting, reflecting a wide rift that typically occurs in regions of higher than normal heat flow with relatively thick crust, where local crustal buoyancy effects dominate localising processes. In summary, the new gravity grid sheds light on many small-scale features in abyssal plains, along continental margins and on submerged continental plateaus, facilitating a new period of discovery in remote parts of the oceans, and leading to a revised tectonic fabric map of the seafloor.",

            "abstract": "In order to determine the distribution of present-day ice mass change across the Antarctic Ice Sheet it is first necessary to remove the geodetic signal of past ice mass change. This signal arises due to the ongoing process of Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), which has traditionally been estimated by modelling the response of the Earth system to ice-sheet changes during a glacial cycle.\nReconstructions of ice-sheet change are typically based on field observations relating to past ice extent and thickness, although a more recent approach has involved the use of ice-sheet models, and even coupled ice-sheet – GIA models, to reconstruct the ice-sheet history in areas where field constraints are sparse. Both methods have their limitations and in this presentation I will highlight the advantages of each and compare recently-published models to assess our current state of knowledge in the field of Antarctic GIA. I will also briefly discuss the motivation behind active areas of model development, which include the consideration of lateral variations in Earth structure and feedbacks between solid Earth, ice sheet and ocean processes.\nFinally, I will assess the suitability of the various data sets that are used to constrain or test Antarctic GIA models, and I will explain how combinations of data are being used to isolate the GIA signal independently of traditional modelling assumptions. Despite the clear benefits of this approach for the purposes of quantifying present-day ice mass change, it is still crucial to be able to model how GIA processes will evolve in the future. The motivation for this goal is provided by recent modelling studies, which suggest that GIA processes will be modified by, and are capable of influencing, the future dynamics of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.",

The ideas on how to handle the day-to-day management of data and data systems need to scale with the data and the demand. We have seen the effects of rapid growth spurts at the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) and anticipate we are not done yet. Looking back, ASF was conceived in 1982 to be a single-purpose imaging radar receiving station supporting a science team focused on geophysical processes. The primary construction at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) was completed in 1988 and full operational status achieved in 1991. The expected supports were estimated at 10 minutes per day and quickly grew to 70 minutes per day. In 1994, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between NASA and UAF formed the ASF Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) complementing, the existing agreement for ASF. The demand for the use of ASF as a receiving station and as a data center grew as fast as, and at times faster, than the capabilities.\nLooking forward, as demand drives the system larger just adding on more of the same often complicates rather than simplifies the system. A growing percentage of efforts and resources spent on dealing with problems that originate from a legacy system can creep up on an organization. This in turn limits the ability to keep the overall sustaining costs under control and leads to a crisis. Such growth means more-of-the-same philosophy has to shift into change-or-die philosophy in order to boot strap up to the next level. In this talk, we review how ASF has faced this several times in the past as the volume and demand of data grew along with the technology to acquire and disseminate it. We will look at what is coming for ASF as a data center and what we think are the next steps to stay ahead of the Big Data wave.",

            "abstract": "There are very few natural environments where life is absent in the Earth’s surface biosphere. However, uninhabitable region is expected to be exist in the deep subsurface biosphere, of which extent and constraining factor(s) have still remained largly unknown. Scientific ocean drilling have revealed that microbial communities in sediments are generally phylogenetically distinct from known spieces isolated from the Earth’s surface biosphere, and hence metabolic functions of the deep subseafloor life remain unknown. In addition, activity of subseafloor microbial cells are thought to be extraordinally slow, as indicated by limited supply of neutrient and energy substrates.\nTo understand the limits of the Earth’s subseafloor biosphere and metabolic functions of microbial populations, detection and quantification of the deeply buried microbial cells in geological habitats are fundamentary important. Using newly developed cell separation techniques as well as an discriminative cell detection system, the current quantification limit of sedimentary microbial cells approaches to 102 cells/cm3. These techniques allow not only to assess very small microbial population close to the subsurface biotic fringe, but also to separate and sort the target cells using flow cytometric cell sorter.\nOnce the deep subseafloor microbial cells are detached from mineral grains and sorted, it opens new windows to subsequent molecular ecological and element/isotopic analyses. With a combined use of nano-scale secondary ion masspectrometry (NanoSIMS) and stable isotope-probing techniques, it is possible to detect and measure activity of substrate incorporation into biomass, even for extremely slow metabolic processes such as uncharacteriszed deep subseafloor life. For example, it was evidenced by NanoSIMS that at least over 80% of microbial cells at ~200 meters-deep, 460,000-year-old sedimentary habitat are indeed live, which substrate incooporation was found to be low (10-15 gC/cell/day) even under the lab incubation condition. Also microbial activity in ultraoligotrophic biosphere samples such as the South Pacific Gyre (i.e., IODP Expeditions 329) will be shown. Our results demonstrates metabolic potential of microbes that have been survived for geological timescale in extremely starved condition.",

Reconciling these high-order system models with perpetually larger volumes of field data is becoming more and more difficult, particularly because classical likelihood-based fitting methods lack the power to detect and pinpoint deficiencies in the model structure. In this talk I will give an overview of our latest research on process-based model calibration and evaluation. This approach, rooted in Bayesian theory, uses summary metrics of the calibration data rather than the data itself to help detect which component(s) of the model is (are) malfunctioning and in need of improvement. A few case studies involving hydrologic and geophysical models will be used to demonstrate the proposed methodology.",

            "abstract": "We have completed a series of global climate simulations from the LGM (21 ka) to present at 3‑ky increments with GENMOM, a coupled A/OGCM with a nominal horizontal resolution of 3.75°. Each time segment was forced by appropriate boundary conditions (insolation, GHGs, ice sheets, sea level,) and run out for 1100 years to ensure minimal drift in the temperature of the deep ocean. GENMOM produces LGM and mid-Holocene (6 ka) climates consistent with paleoenvironmental data and the PMIP2 and CMIP5/PMIP3 simulations. The climate sensitivity is attributed to the interplay of various boundary conditions changes throughout the deglaciation as the ice sheets melt, the seasonality of insolation increases and GHG concentrations rise. Given the dominance of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and insolation-driven continental heating during the deglaciation and MH, these controls are particularly evident in the hydroclimate of NA. We use our simulations alone and combined with the PMIP simulations to explore aspects of the evolution of the glacial‑Holocene hydroclimate of Western North America related to changes in storm tracks and the strength of the monsoon circulation. We find variable agreement and disagreement among the models, particularly in the Southwest monsoon regions. We also find that, while the LGM moisture climatologies of the models may be locally consistent with paleoenvironmental data, the precipitation and temperature fields from the models produce substantial variability in simulations of the LIS as modeled by the CISM-GLIMMER ice sheet model, suggesting deficiencies in modeled regional and hemispheric circulation, moisture transport, or the surface energy balance over the ice.",

It was also demonstrated that three-dimensional aspects are of critical importance for this process. This presentation will particularly address the mass transport rate and the amount of open magnetic flux created by reconnection driven by nonlinear KH modes as a function of IMF orientation.

            "abstract": "Weathering of volcanic rocks plays many important roles at Earth’s surface. U-series isotopes (e.g. 238U-234U-230Th and 232Th) have been demonstrated to be a novel chronometer to constrain the formation rates of weathering rinds on tropical volcanic islands [Pelt et al., 2008, EPSL, 276, 98-105; Ma et al., 2012, GCA 80, 92-107].\nHere, new U-series isotopes and major element concentrations were analyzed in a basaltic-andesite weathering rind collected from the relatively dry side (northern) of the tropical Basse-Terre Island, Guadeloupe. Core and rind samples were drilled across low, medium and high curvature segments of the core-rind boundary and the measured (238U/232Th) and (230Th/232Th) activity ratios range from 1.024 to 1.390, and 1.007 to 1.186, respectively. Both (238U/232Th) and (230Th/232Th) ratios increase systematically from the core into the weathering rind, similar to those observed previously in the well-characterized weathering rind of the Bras David watershed, located on the central wet part of Basse-Terre [Ma et al., 2012]. We suggest that similar mechanisms controlled the evolution of U-series isotope compositions of the new weathering clast: 1) an influx of soil solution carries dissolved U with (234U/238U) activity ratios >1 into the clast, responsible for the observed gradual increase of (238U/232Th) activity ratios in the rind; and 2) subsequent production and accumulation of 230Th in the rind over time from the decay of excess 234U and 238U account for the observed continuous increase of (230Th/232Th) activity ratios.\nWeathering advance rates of this new clast calculated with the U-series activity ratios are ~0.1-0.2 mm kyr-1. These preliminary rates are lower than the clast weathering advance rate (~0.3 mm kyr-1) previously determined for the Bras David watershed. Such a difference may be attributed to less precipitation in the northern region of the island (~1800 mm yr-1), compared to the Bras David watershed (~3000 mm yr-1). This study illustrates a new case study where weathering advance rates of rinds are successfully estimated by using U-series isotopes. Furthermore, the application of U-series chronometry in chemical weathering and rind formation will also be useful in measuring the importance of precipitation on weathering at the clast scale.",

They are very stable sensors, usually unaffected by satellite drifts or other issues that might affect the temporal stability of the wind time series.

Here we will review the challenges and progress made towards producing high-quality and consistent time series of ocean vector winds from past, current, and future scatterometer missions. We will describe the development of consistent Geophysical Model Functions (GMF) at the Ku-, C, and L-band frequencies, and the efforts in understanding and removing sources of bias among different scatterometer winds (i.e., atmospheric/ocean surface effects, rain impact, imperfect calibration of the GMF, etc..) . An additional and important source of inter-satellite bias at a regional level is due to the diurnal variability in the ocean surface winds. We will present an analysis aimed at estimating the amplitude and phase of wind diurnal variability. We will show how global time series of ocean winds from different scatterometer missions do overlap within the accuracy required for climate studies, when processed in a consistent manner and with proper quality control,.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in the technology of unmanned vehicles have greatly expanded the range of contemplated terrestrial operational environments for their use, including aerial, surface, and submarine. The advances have been most pronounced in the areas of autonomy, miniaturization, durability, standardization, and ease of operation, most notably (especially in the popular press) for airborne vehicles. Of course, for a wide range of planetary venues, autonomy at high cost of both money and risk, has always been a requirement. Most recently, missions to Mars have also featured an unprecedented degree of mobility. Combining the traditional planetary surface deployment operational and science imperatives with emerging, very accessible, and relatively economical small UAV platforms on Earth can provide flexible, rugged, self-directed, test-bed platforms for landed instruments and strategies that will ultimately be directed elsewhere, and, in the process, provide valuable earth science data. While the most direct transfer of technology from terrestrial to planetary venues is perhaps for bodies with atmospheres (and oceans), with appropriate technology and strategy accommodations, single and networked UAVs can be designed to operate on even airless bodies, under a variety of gravities. In this presentation, we present and use results and lessons learned from our recent earth-bound UAV volcano deployments, as well as our future plans for such, to conceptualize a range of planetary and small-body missions. We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of students and colleagues at our home institutions, and the government of Costa Rica, without which our UAV deployments would not have been possible.

MRO carries 7 investigations, of which 6 will be used to observe the comet or search for comet particle effects on Mars. MRO focuses on three science objectives for Comet Siding Spring observations. First, MRO will observe the comet nucleus near the comet-Mars closest approach (131,000 ± 3,000 km) to attempt to determine nucleus size, rotation, and shape. This objective utilizes the HiRISE (high-resolution) camera which has 131 m/pixel at closest approach. The CRISM instrument (VIS-NIR imaging spectrometer) with >8 km/pixel, and the Context camera (CTX) with >3 km/pixel will also take measurements. Second, MRO will observe the comet coma and tail with the intent of gaining information on composition and morphology utilizing spectral and spatial coverage of the same three instruments. In particular, HiRISE covers 0.4-1.0 μm in 3 bands, with 1 microrad/pixel, CRISM which covers 0.4-3.9 μm at 6.55 nm/channel and 2.1 deg field-of-view, and CTX which has an almost 6 deg field-of-view, covering 0.5-0.8 μm. Third, MRO will observe the Mars atmosphere and ionosphere to detect potential atmospheric heating or cloud formation and changes in total electron column density, using the MCS (atmospheric profiling instrument), the MARCI (weather camera), and the SHARAD (shallow radar instrument, sensitive to ionospheric total electron count). The preliminary results of the Comet C/2013 A1 MRO observations will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Northern peatlands have served as persistent, small sinks of atmospheric CO2 throughout the Holocene. In western Canada, peatlands exist on the drier spectrum of global peatland distributions. As a result, peatlands in this region are drier (e.g., no/few open pools in bogs and poor fens) and all bogs are treed. Because they occupy this climate space, continental peatlands might be regarded as being vulnerable to future warming and drying. On the other hand, these peatlands and their plant communities might already be adapted to drier conditions, conferring some resistance to climate change.\nThe position of the water table within a peatland serves as a dominant control on peat accumulation rates, as it influences plant structure and productivity, decomposition, and dissolved carbon export. Many studies predict that lower water table position, in response to enhanced evapotranspiration or drought, will cause peatlands to release stored C back to the atmosphere, indicative of a state change to an ecosystem type that no longer supports long-term peat accumulation. A 10-yr drainage experiment at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX) sites showed that lowering the water table made a rich fen more of an atmospheric C source, primarily by altering plant species composition and lowering plant primary production rather than by increasing soil CO2 flux. Multi-decadal drainage of Canadian peatlands also resulted in changes in plant species composition, with increasing tree and shrub canopy coverage and declines in moss abundance. Increased forestation in western Canadian peatlands will have large impacts on fire danger, which also has the potential to cause long-term shifts in plant and ecosystem structure, either through severe burning of surface peat layers or by inducing permafrost thaw. This talk will present findings from empirical and modeling studies examining peatland responses to warming, drought, permafrost thaw, and wildfires. Within the context of these dominant western Canadian disturbances, we will interpret our data within a resiliency framework, considering peatlands as complex adaptive systems that are resilient to some level of perturbation. However, we will present evidence that peatlands in some cases will experience state changes at higher levels of disturbance.",

Regional to global scale synthesis studies of static chamber measurements show that relationships between temperature, water availability and CH4 emissions depend on wetland type (bog, fen, swamp), region (tropical, temperate, arctic) and disturbance. For example, while water table position and temperature serve as the dominant controls on bog and swamp CH4 flux, vegetation is an important control on emissions from fens. These studies highlight the fact that wetland types have distinct controls on CH4 emissions; however, it is unlikely that modeling of wetland CH4 flux will improve without a better mechanistic understanding of the processes underlying CH4 production, transport, and oxidation.\nAt the Alaska Peatland Experiment, we are quantifying CH4 emission using static chambers, automated chambers, and towers. Our sites vary in permafrost regime, including groundwater fens without permafrost, forested peat plateaus with intact permafrost, and collapse scar bogs formed through permafrost thaw. Experimental studies that examine plant and microbial responses to altered water table position and soil temperature are complemented by a gradient approach, where we use a space-for-time substitutions to examine the consequences of thaw on time-scales of decades to centuries. Our results thus far have documented the importance of soil rewetting in governing large CH4 fluxes from northern wetland soils. Accounting for CH4, our collapse scar bog significantly contributed to the global warming potential of the landscape. A major objective of our work is to explore the role of permafrost C release in greenhouse gas fluxes from wetland soils, which we are assessing using radiocarbon as a natural tracer. We have shown, for example, that ebullition of CH4 is dominated by recently fixed C, but a significant fraction of CH4 in bubbles is derived from old C released during thaw. The APEX time series datasets are being used in a variety of modeling studies, from small-scale soil pore and microbial controls on gas production and transport to regional scale assessments of how carbon cycle feedbacks to climate vary with wetland type and abundance.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater quality is specifically vulnerable in irrigated agricultural lands in California and many other(semi-)arid regions of the world. The routine application of nitrogen fertilizers with irrigation water in California is likely responsible for the high nitrate concentrations in groundwater, underlying much of its main agricultural areas. To optimize irrigation/fertigation practices, it is essential that irrigation and fertilizers are applied at the optimal concentration, place, and time to ensure maximum root uptake and minimize leaching losses to the groundwater. The applied irrigation water and dissolved fertilizer, as well as root growth and associated nitrate and water uptake, interact with soil properties and fertilizer source(s) in a complex manner that cannot easily be resolved. It is therefore that coupled experimental-modeling studies are required to allow for unraveling of the relevant complexities that result from typical field-wide spatial variations of soil texture and layering across farmer-managed fields. We present experimental approaches across a network of tree crop orchards in the San Joaquin Valley, that provide the necessary soil data of soil moisture, water potential and nitrate concentration to evaluate and optimize irrigation water management practices. Specifically, deep tensiometers were used to monitor in-situ continuous soil water potential gradients, for the purpose to compute leaching fluxes of water and nitrate at both the individual tree and field scale.",

            "abstract": "High-precision (< ±5 ppm 2σ SD on 182W/184W) measurements of W isotopic ratios have boosted recent exploration of early Earth processes [1, 2, 3]. Tungsten isotope anomalies have been reported for ~3.8 Ga rocks from Isua, Greenland [1], 2.8 Ga komatiites from Kostomuksha, Russia [2] and ≥3.8 Ga rocks from Nuvvuagittuq, Quebec [3]. All of these rocks are characterized by 182W enrichments of as much as 15 ppm. These compositions are within the estimated mantle composition prior to addition of ~0.5 wt.% of late accreted materials to Earth [4]. However, the calculated higly siderophile element (HSE) contents of the mantle source for the Kostomuksha komatiites and Nuvvuagittug rocks are similar to modern mantle, inconsistent with a source dominated by a pre-late accretionary mantle reservoir. Thus, their mantle source must have incorporated an ancient (while 182Hf was still extant; i.e., <50 Ma after Solar System formation), high Hf/W component [2].\nWe have determined the W isotopic compositions of >3.8 Ga ultramafic rocks (including mantle peridotites and meta-komatiites), plus tonalitic to mafic Uivak gneisses from northern Labrador, Canada. Within the peridotitic suite, 9 samples show well-resolved, variable 182W enrichments ranging from +9 to +22 ppm, while three meta-komatiites have uniform ~+9 ppm enrichments. The four gneisses also show +8 to +13 ppm enrichments. As with the Kostomuksha and Nuvvuagittuq suites, the relative and absolute HSE abundances in both peridotitic and komatiitic suites are similar to their late Archean equivalents, indicating the delivery of late-accreted materials prior to 3.8 Ga. Prominent W enrichments, relative to elements with similar incompatibilities in peridotitic rocks suggest that W in these rocks may not be representative of their mantle sources, but instead could reflect redistribution of W in the crust by metamorphic processes. The 182W enrichment of this component could be inherited from a pre-late accretionary or early depleted parental mantle reservoir, or late-accreted materials that were preferentially enriched in 182W relative to most such materials.\n[1] Willbold et al.

As pressures on water resources grow due to “peak water” constraints, the agricultural sector will be disproportionately affected because farmers currently use the vast majority of water mobilized by humans, are especially sensitive to climatic variability and change, and typically pay far less for water than urban and industrial users. There are economic, security, and political challenges associated with these climate impacts. This presentation will look at the interactions among the water, climate, and food sectors, drawing on experience from recent extreme events in hot spots such as the severe drought in California and the drought in the eastern Mediterranean affecting the Tigris and Euphrates river basins.",

            "abstract": "In our book, Merchants of Doubt, we documented how deliberate disinformation campaigns served to confuse the American people about the reality and significance of climate change over more than two decades. We showed how a variety of strategies were used to persuade the public that the scientific “jury was still out” on climate change, including deliberate mispresentation of facts, cherry-picking of evidence, and personal attacks on scientists. And we documented the links, both conceptual and actual, between doubt-mongering about climate change and the rejection of scientific evidence of the harms of tobacco, acid rain, the ozone hole, nuclear winter, and DDT. These tactics are still in use today, but they are now reinforced by a new problem, the problem of wishful thinking. Increasingly, we see commentators who accept the reality of climate change assuring us that the problem can be solved by natural gas, or even by some as yet unknown and uninvented technological innovations. In this paper we argue that these forms of wishful thinking, while not malicious in the same way that previous doubt-mongering campaigns have been, contribute substantially to scientific illiteracy and misunderstanding both of the character of the challenges that we face and of the history of technological innovation.",

Yet history shows that in the past, scientists often have spoken out on broad issues of societal concern, often (although not always) effectively.

            "abstract": "Warming over the last several decades has led to an upward or poleward shift in the distributional limit of trees at sites around the circumboreal north. In our own research in three regions in Alaska, we found evidence for an upward shift in treeline at every site, in the form of a decline in population age with increasing elevation. The prevalence of that particular signature of change suggests that continued expansion of forest vegetation at treeline is likely. But how fast, and how sustained are those changes likely to be in the future? Changing disturbance regimes, non-linear growth responses to warming, and unexplained regional variability in the rate of historical responses to warming all introduce significant uncertainty to projections of future change at treeline. In an effort to compare historical with current patterns of change, we set up permanent plots in each of the sites at which we had reconstructed forest history, tagging each tree and seedling. We resampled these plots more than a decade after the initial measurements, and thus have an opportunity to compare the actual trajectory of change in each plot with the trajectory that we inferred from our dendrochronological reconstructions. At most sites, the observed pattern of change over the last 10-15 years is consistent with the trajectory inferred from dendrochronological studies. Seedling density at treeline and above treeline increased significantly over this time period-- almost doubling (98.6% increase) at treeline plots, and increasing more than 189%, on average, in above treeline plots. The expansion of forest vegetation at treeline has thus continued at an extremely rapid pace. The remeasurements also, however, yielded surprises that could not have been anticipated from the reconstructions at forest history. A severe fire at one of our sites killed most of the seedlings that had established above treeline, and in the years since the fire, aspen-- which is not a common treeline species in Alaska-- has become the dominant woody vegetation both at and above treeline at this site. This suggests that changes in disturbance regime at treeline could have unexpected consequences-- leading to rapid establishment of vegetation types that are not currently common at treeline.",

Field observations and mapping in the aftermath of several recent tsunamis has greatly improved our understanding of the diversity of tsunami impacts in different environments, the variability observed in the sedimentary record of tsunamis, and the change in these characteristics along the tsunami path from the near- to far-field.\nRecent tsunamis originating in the Indian Ocean (2004), South Pacific (2009), Chile (2010), and Japan (2011) have affected both local and distant coastlines across a wide range of coastal environments and morphologies. Coral reefs, beaches, dunes, coastal plains with wetlands and/or beach ridge complexes, and rocky embayed coasts have been examined for depositional patterns and evidence of erosion, landscape and vegetation change, and, at a number of sites, impacts to the built environment. We summarize deposit variability, including thickness, stratification, and composition, in an effort to document the wide range of observed deposit features. We observed evidence where vegetation can modify the tsunami flow characteristics. Our field efforts did not focus on impacts to coastal structures, but observations during the course of our work can be applied to improve hazard assessment and recognition of vulnerable areas.\nTsunami magnitude, deposits, and hazards are most pronounced near the source and tend to decline with distance, although local factors can modify this trend significantly. For example, general trends in the decrease of tsunami height, inundation, and run-up with distance from the source often exhibit local anomalies where interactions between the tsunami characteristics and local physiography, such as slope and orientation of the coast, create complex interactions that may greatly modify general trends. Efforts to relate the sedimentary record to complexities in tsunami inundation will improve our understanding of past events, which may ultimately lead to better hazard assessments.",

            "abstract": "One of the most fundamental factors controlling all biological and chemical processes is changing temperature. Temperature dependence was originally described by the Arrhenius function in the 19th century. This function provides an excellent description of chemical reaction rates. However, the Arrhenius function does not predict the temperature optimum of biological rates that is clearly evident in laboratory and field measurements. Previously, the temperature optimum of biological processes has been ascribed to denaturation of enzymes but the observed temperature optima in soil are often rather modest, occurring at about 40-50°C and generally less than recognised temperatures for protein unfolding. We have modified the Arrhenius function incorporating a temperature-dependent activation energy derived directly from first principles from thermodynamics of macromolecules. MacroMolecular Rate Theory (MMRT) accounts for large changes in the flexibility of enzymes during catalysis that result in changes in heat capacity (∆C‡p) of the enzyme during the reaction. MMRT predicts an initially Arrhenius-like response followed by a temperature optimum without the need for enzyme denaturation (Hobbs et al., 2013. ACS Chemical Biology. 8: 2388-2393). Denaturation, of course, occurs at much higher temperatures. We have shown that MMRT fits biogeochemical data collected from laboratory and field studies with important implications for changes in absolute temperature sensitivity as temperature rises (Schipper et al., 2014. Global Change Biology). As the temperature optimum is approached the absolute temperature sensitivity of biological processes decreases to zero. Consequently, the absolute temperature-sensitivity of soil biological processes depends on both the change in ecosystem temperature and the temperature optimum of the biological process. MMRT also very clearly explains why Q10 values decline with increasing temperature more quickly than would be predicted from the Arrhenius function. Temperature optima of many soil biological processes including respiration are very poorly documented but would lead to a better understanding of how soil systems will respond to increasing global temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Structural Geology is about 3D geometry and the symphony of kinematically-coordinated movement. In this case we discuss patterns of violent relative displacement inferred from focal plane data for earthquakes. Systematic stereographic analysis of centroid moment tensor data often shows well-defined orientation groups in scatterplots of fault plane normals and associated slip line vectors. These allow important geodynamic inferences, e.g., we can show that ductile faults control the geometry of oceanic transforms, and that normal fault earthquakes on spreading ridges are usually skewed with respect to adjacent transform faults. To explain this asymmetry requires finite rock strength, but it also means that it is not brittle failure that controls the orientation of oceanic transforms. This asymmetry also requires formation of tilt block geometries reminiscent of Basin-and-Range-style continental extension, systematic offset of earthquake hypocentres from the spreading ridge, and a general complexity in magma-fault interactions that is far beyond what might be expected if ocean-floor spreading is the result of dilating tension-mode fractures in dyke swarms. The role of ductile faulting should be given special mention because mostly it is argued that brittle faults are responsible for earthquakes. Yet many other examples of ductile faults in operation can be inferred, e.g., ductile faults associated with slab drop-off, where slab boudinage leads to extensional ductile faults and seismic activity driven by the pulling away of a relict slab, e.g., beneath the Hindu Kush. Another example might be found by close examination of the tectonic significance of the lowermost of the double (or paired) seismic zones such as can be seen in cross-sections of the subducting slab beneath Japan. The lowermost of the paired seismic zones may mark the locus of aseismic ductile shears or detachments formed by slumping of gigantic sheets of rock attempting to slide down the face of actively subducting slabs. Seismogenic activity may be driven by ductile faulting (again related to boudinage) of the relatively strong sheet of the subducting slab overlying this movement zone. The role of ductile faulting has been undervalued in earthquake generation, and this data suggests revision of seismotectonic doctrines may be necessary.",

            "abstract": "Neogene climate reflects the transition into a colder, more variable world dominated by the onset and intensification of major Northern Hemisphere glaciations. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 341 recovered a cross-margin transect of pelagic facies from this subarctic, high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll modern setting to glacigenic material from the exhuming coastal mountains. The recovered sedimentary record extends from the late Miocene through the Pleistocene/Holocene. Shipboard results indicate a ~doubling in sediment accumulation rates at ~2.56 Ma at the deep-water distal Site U1417, which is interpreted as the onset of significant glacial coverage in the St. Elias Range after the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition, resulting in the start of deposition in the Surveyor Fan. At all sites, clast-rich mud and/or diamict are prevalent in the Pleistocene, indicating the persistent transport of glacigenic sediment by ice, iceberg or sea-ice rafting. An unanticipated observation is the often sharp transitions between these ice-dominated facies and more biogenic-rich, often bioturbated, muddy lithologies that might be related to increased biological productivity, enhanced nutrient supply, and/or decreased input of terrigenous sediments. All sites contained variable preservation of biosiliceous and calcareous microfossils that indicate dynamic water column productivity and/or variable sediment geochemistry from the late Miocene to the present. At deep-water sites, strong variations in environmentally sensitive planktic foraminifera, radiolarians, and diatoms record alternating warming and cooling intervals during the last 1.2 Ma. At Site U1417, planktic foraminifera and radiolarian taxa abundances indicate cooler conditions in the Pleistocene relative to the Pliocene/late Miocene. Especially high sedimentation rates during the late Pleistocene hold promise for future studies related to suborbital-scale variability in paleoproductivity and glacigenic sedimentation.",

For large scale processes, the height integrated conductivities (conductances) of the ionosphere are known to modulate the energy transfer between the magnetosphere and ionosphere. Estimating the Pedersen and Hall conductances on a global scale, particularly in the auroral regions, is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of the high latitude ionosphere and thermosphere. Experimental measurements with sufficient spatial coverage and with time scales of order of minutes or less are required. While the spatial coverage of HF radar and spacecraft measurements has recently improved, it turns out that the most challenging aspects for global estimates of ionosphere conductance are directly related to ground-based magnetometer data.\nThe Iridium satellite constellation consists of more than 70 satellites in circular, polar, 780 km altitude orbits which provides a unique opportunity to obtain in-situ measurements of the global distribution of the Birkeland currents and associated magnetic field perturbations. In this paper, examples and challenges for combining the Iridium satellite, HF radar and ground magnetometer data in order to produce estimates of the Pedersen and Hall conductances on global spatial scales will be presented.

Seven Model simulations of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are compared to reanalysis dataset to ascertain how well they simulate wind speed trends and variability over North America region. Trend values for the period 1979-2005 are calculated using a linear least square analysis with trend uncertainties computed using the standard error, where temporal autocorrelation is employed for non randomness of the datasets. Results showed strong regional difference in surface wind speed trends among individual models, as well as between models and reanalysis dataset. Furthermore, comparison of horizontal wind speed climatology, trends and variability among models, reanalysis and radiosonde observations at station level were performed. Result showed that CMIP5 models have wind speed bias (ranging from -5m/s to 5 m/s) for both annual and seasonal averages, specifically during JJA and DJF seasons. Furthermore, CMIP5 underestimated the radiosonde observed wind speed interannual and intra-annual variability in the troposphere. Overall, the trends estimated from CMIP5, radiosonde and ERA-Interim reanalysis product are not statistically significant for the period 1979-2005. Lastly, implications of this study on future satellite missions and the data to be collected are also investigated. It is shown that future satellites need to provide approximately 0.5 km resolution data to resolve the jet stream variability.",

            "abstract": "Walker Lake is a closed-basin remnant of the large Pleistocene glacial Lake Lahontan that has experienced drastic changes in water level. Carbonate structures, such as stromatolites, precipitated from the lake and were studied as potential sources for historical climate change. A 16.7 cm long stromatolite was collected from a paleoshoreline approximately 58 meters above the present Walker Lake surface elevation. Radiocarbon dating revealed that the stromatolite spans approximately 2,000 years of growth, from 35,540 to 33,580 Calibrated YBP (IntCal13). Distinct laminae were drilled along the growth axis, and the resulting powders were collected for clumped isotope analyses, which uses the amount of heavy CO2 “clumps” (13C-18O-16O, or ∆47) generated from the dissolution of carbonate in acid to measure the temperature of formation of a rock. Using this method, we tracked the change in lake temperature and δ18Ofluid during stromatolite formation. Our results show that the stromatolite experienced an overall increase in temperature and δ18Ofluid values during the course of accretion. The resulting data were input to a Rayleigh distillation model for water evaporation in order to estimate the magnitude of lake level and volume fluctuations. Our modeling results show that, during the course of stromatolite accretion, the lake experienced a volume decrease of ~5 Km3, corresponding to lake level fall of ~14 meters. This study shows that lacustrine material (such as stromatolites or other tufas) can potentially be used to reconstruct the timing and magnitude of terrestrial climate change during important transitions in Earth history.",

            "abstract": "Phenology has been shown to be a robust integrator of the effects of year-to-year climate variability and longer-term climate change on natural systems. At the level of organisms, phenology plays a critical role in processes related to growth, reproduction, and competition. At the level of ecosystems, phenology is important because of implications for productivity, carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, and feedbacks to the climate system. At decadal-to-century time scales, climate change will indirectly cause additional shifts in ecosystem phenology via shifts in community composition and structure.\nThere is a demonstrated need to better document biological responses to a changing world, and improved phenological monitoring will contribute to achieving this goal. In this talk, I will describe a collaborative research network called “PhenoCam” (http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/). PhenoCam uses networked digital cameras – webcams – for phenological monitoring in a range of ecosystems (over 100 sites, and 300+ site-years of archived data) across the North American continent. These sites range from coastal wetlands of the southeast to mountain highlands of the northwest, and from the hot deserts of Arizona to the cold of arctic Alaska. Images are captured every 30 minutes, are uploaded to the PhenoCam server for display in real-time, and are then processed to yield measures of vegetation greenness.\nI will discuss how we are using data from PhenoCam (1) to improve understanding of the environmental controls on phenology at organism-to-ecosystem scales; (2) to relate ecosystem processes (e.g. carbon and water fluxes measured via eddy covariance) to phenology; and (3) to develop predictive models and forecast future climate change impacts on phenology.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is the mechanism by which magnetic field lines change partners, enabling a low stress magnetic configuration to be converted into a high-stress state. An example of this can be found in the Earth’s magnetotail lobes in which the two oppositely directed bundles of magnetic flux that constitute the lobes join up in the center of the tail, creating magnetic stress toward the Earth on the Earthward side of the point of linkage and anti-Earthward stress beyond that point. Antiparallel magnetic fields can also occur at the magnetopause, but the magnetic configuration of the solar wind-magnetosphere boundary is complex. The external field is bent and the internal field is bent as well, but in a different configuration. A variable amount of magnetic flux is close to being antiparallel across the magnetopause as the interplanetary magnetic field varies its orientation, especially its clock angle about the solar wind flow.\nIf we model the interaction and look for the area of maximum anti-parallelness, we find that this area is sensitive to the clock angle of the magnetic field around the point of intersection of the solar wind with the center of the magnetopause, i.e. the stagnation point. It is also sensitive to the tilt angle of the dipole. If the solar wind flowed along the direction to the Sun, this stagnation point would be the subsolar point and the best coordinate system to use would be the solar magnetospheric coordinate system and the effective magnetic field component would be the Z component.",

We will present a new suite of sedimentary U and Cr isotope data and a new framework to interpret the existing Archean record. Archean samples display essentially the same range of U isotope variability as modern sedimentary rocks, indicating the formation of soluble U(VI) in weathering environments during the Archean. This reaction requires surface oxygen levels well above those characteristic of a prebiotic atmosphere—by several orders of magnitude. Cr isotope variability is the Archean, with limited exceptions is muted. However, rare cases of Cr isotope variability require surface oxygen levels above those required by the U isotope record and above the maximum atmospheric oxygen threshold linked to ‘atmospheric rare S isotope anomalies’. These results provide evidence for intermittent surface oxygenation preceding the Great Oxidation Event and suggest the possibility of significantly variable oxygen levels at Earth's surface during the Archean.",

If the recent methodology of initialized decadal climate prediction could have been applied in the mid-1990s using the CMIP5 multi-models, both the negative phase of the IPO in the early 2000s as well as the hiatus could have been simulated, with the multi-model average performing better than most of the individual models.

            "abstract": "This study focused in turn on detailed data of buildings and boats damage caused by the 2011 tsunami in order to understand its main causes and provide damage probability estimates. Tsunami-induced building damage data was collected from field surveys, and includes inundation depth, building material, number of stories and occupancy type for more than 80,000 buildings. Numerical simulations with high resolution bathymetry and topography data were conducted to obtain characteristic tsunami measures such as flow velocity. These data were analyzed using advanced statistical methods, ordinal regression analysis to create not only empirical 2D tsunami fragility curves, but also 3D tsunami fragility surfaces for the first time. The effect of floating debris was also considered, by using a binary indicator of debris impact based on the proximity of a structure from a debris source (i.e. washed away building). Both the 2D and 3D fragility analyses provided results for each different building damage level, and different topography. While 2D fragility curves provide easily interpretable results relating tsunami flow depth to damage probability for different damage levels, 3D fragility surfaces allow for several influential tsunami parameters to be taken into account thus reduce uncertainty in the probability estimations. More than 20,000 damaged boats were used in the analysis similar to the one carried out on the buildings. Detailed data for each boat comprises information on the damage ratio (paid value over insured value), tonnage, engine type, material type and damage classification. The 2D and 3D fragility analyses were developed using representative tsunami heights for each port obtained from field surveys and flow velocities obtained from the aforementioned simulations. The results are currently being adapted for practical disaster mitigation. They are being integrated with the probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis, in order to create offshore and onshore probabilistic hazard maps. Through the GPS and embedded calculation function based on the aforementioned fragility results, these applications can be used in the field for a quick estimation of possible building damage, as well as a decision support system for fishermen (whether or not they should move their boats to the deep sea upon tsunami arrival).",

            "abstract": "A central objective of the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) is to produce a long-term climate data record of Earth’s radiation budget at the top-of-atmosphere, within-atmosphere and surface together with coincident cloud, aerosol and surface properties. CERES relies on a number of data sources, including broadband CERES radiometers on Terra, Aqua, and Suomi-NPP, high-resolution spectral imagers (MODIS and VIIRS), geostationary visible/infrared imagers, meteorological, aerosol and ozone assimilation data, and snow/sea-ice maps based on microwave radiometer data. The many input data sets are integrated and cross-calibrated to provide a consistent climate data record that accurately captures variations in Earth’s radiation budget and associated cloud, aerosol and surface properties over a range of time and space scales. The CERES datasets are primarily used for climate model evaluation, process studies and climate monitoring.\nThis presentation will review some of the ways in which the CERES record along with other datasets have been used to improve our understanding Earth’s energy budget. At the top-of-atmosphere, we will show how Earth’s energy imbalance, a critical indictor of climate change, has varied during the past 15 years relative to what is observed by in-situ observations of ocean heat content by the Argo observing system. We will use these results to place the so-called global warming hiatus into a larger context that takes Earth’s energy budget into account. We will also discuss how recent advances in surface radiation budget estimation by the CERES group is reshaping the debate on why the surface energy budget cannot be closed to better than 15 Wm-2 using state-of-the-art observations. Finally, we will highlight the dramatic changes that have been observed by CERES over the Arctic Ocean, and discuss some of the yet unresolved observational challenges that limit our ability document change in this unique part of the planet.",

            "abstract": "Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are transported to great water bodies via long-range atmospheric transport and released from the surface water as air concentrations continue to diminish. As the largest fresh water bodies in North America, the Great Lakes have both the potential to accumulate and serve as a secondary source of persistent bioaccumulative toxins. OCP and PCB concentrations were sampled at 30+ sites across Lake Superior, Ontario and Erie in the summer of 2011. Polyethylene passive samplers (PEs) were simultaneously deployed in surface water and near surface atmosphere to determine air-water gaseous exchange of OCPs and PCBs. In Lake Superior, surface water and atmospheric concentrations were dominated by α-HCH (average 250 pg/L and 4.2 pg/m3, respectively), followed by HCB (average 17 pg/L and 89 pg/m3, respectively). Air-water exchange varied greatly between sites and individual OCPs, however α-endosulfan was consistently deposited into the surface water (average 19 pg/m2/day). PCBs in the air and water were characterized by penta- and hexachlorobiphenyls with distribution along the coast correlated with proximity to developed areas. Air-water exchange gradients generally yielded net volatilization of PCBs out of Lake Superior. Gaseous concentrations of hexachlorobenzene, dieldrin and chlordanes were significantly higher (p < 0.05) at Lake Erie than Lake Ontario. A multiple linear regression that incorporated meteorological, landuse and population data was used to explain variability in the atmospheric concentrations. Results indicated that landuse (urban and/or cropland) greatly explained the variability in the data. Freely dissolved concentrations of OCPs (<LOD-114 pg/L) were lower than previously detected concentrations. Nonetheless, concentrations of p,p'-DDE and chlordanes were higher than water quality guidelines for the protection of human health from the consumption of fish. Spatial distributions of freely dissolved OCPs in Lakes Erie and Ontario were influenced by loadings from areas of concern and the water circulation patterns. Air-water exchange calculations indicated that the majority of OCPs were volatilizing from the water; therefore the lower Great Lakes were acting as a secondary source to the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Ice clouds play a key role in the Earth’s radiation budget, mostly through their strong regulation of infrared radiation exchange. Submillimeter wave remote sensing offers a unique capability to improve cloud ice measurements from space. At 874 GHz cloud scattering produces a larger brightness temperature depression from cirrus than lower frequencies, which can be used to retrieve vertically-integrated cloud ice water path (IWP) and ice particle size. The objective of the IceCube project is to retire risks of 874-GHz receiver technology by raising its TRL from 5 to 7. The project will demonstrate, on a 3-U CubeSat in a low Earth orbit (LEO) environment, the 874-GHz receiver system with noise equivalent differential temperature (NEDT) of ~0.2 K for 1-second integration and calibration error of 2.0 K or less as measured from deep-space observations. The Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is partnering with Virginia Diodes, Inc (VDI) to qualify commercially available 874-GHz receiver technology for spaceflight, and demonstrate the radiometer performance. The instrument (submm-wave cloud radiometer, or SCR), along with the CubeSat system developed and integrated by GSFC, will be ready for launch in two years. The instrument subsystem includes a reflector antenna, sub-millimeter wave mixer, frequency multipliers and stable local oscillator, an intermediate frequency (IF) circuit with noise injection, and data-power boards. The mixer and frequency multipliers are procured from VDI with GSFC insight into fabrication and testing processes to ensure scalability to spaceflight beyond TRL 7. The remaining components are a combination of GSFC-designed and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) at TRLs of 5 or higher. The spacecraft system is specified by GSFC and comprises COTS components including three-axis stabilizer and sun sensor, GPS receiver, deployable solar arrays, UHF radio, and 2 GB of on-board storage. The spacecraft and instrument are integrated and flight qualified through environmental testing at GSFC. The concept of operations is to fly the GSFC designed instrument/spacecraft in a LEO orbit and collect the 874-GHz radiance data for a period of at least 28+ days. Communication will be through the WFF’s UHF ground station. Mission Operations and data processing and validation will be conducted at GSFC.",

Complex morphological structures in the PMC brightness distribution provide observable consequences of the deposition of energy and momentum by atmospheric gravity waves in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. This data set represents the highest resolution set of optical images of this phenomenon to date, and therefore provides a unique window into the poorly understood instability and turbulent dynamics on the smallest scales (between roughly a meter and a few km). Through this analysis, morphological features identified in individual images will be compared with those predicted in numerical models in order to identify key dynamical features present in the data on these small scales. Multiple spatially-overlapping sequential images will be analyzed together in order to extract cloud velocities and to measure timescales for feature permanence. These image compilations will also be used to place the observed small-scale features in a broader context by using multiple images to re-construct larger features, as well as to compare to features simultaneously observed on much larger scales by the CIPS instrument flying on the AIM satellite.",

            "abstract": "Lake Douglas is a small inland lake in Northern Michigan, surrounded by the forest of the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS). Over a decade of eddy-covariance measurements of carbon fluxes at the UMBS provide us good knowledge of the rates and dynamics of fluxes between the forest and the atmosphere. However, there is very little knowledge about the flux rates from the near-by lake and how they relate to the conditions in the surrounding forest. We have conducted eddy-covariance measurements of CO2 fluxes from the lake over two summers. We found the microclimate predictably different over the lake. Carbon uptake rates by the lake ecosystem were high during the daytime, but lower than the adjacent forest, which led to higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the lake surface than over the forest. Using concurrent wind and CO2 concentration data from the lake and two flux towers in the forest we estimated the rate of lateral advection of CO2 from the lake to the forest. Though the lake is almost never within the forest flux tower footprint, this advection term may bias forest carbon budget estimates.\nTo further study this advection, we generated a virtual experiment using a high resolution canopy-resolving large eddy simulation model (RAFLES). We assumed a circular lake surrounded by a homogeneous forest and prescribed typical conditions representing different times of day during the summer growing season. The observed latent and sensible heat flux rates at the forest and lake tower where prescribed to the simulated forest and lake patches in the simulation, respectively. The resolved wind field includes the effects of the different surface heat fluxes, as well as the roughness transition caused by the trees at the water edge. We used this wind field in a series of simulations using Hi-VACC, a scalar diffusion-advection model. In these Hi-VACC simulations we assumed the observed carbon flux rates as surface sinks for CO2 at the two patch types. The model resolved the apparent flux rates that would have been measured at any virtual location along the lake-forest continuum. We show that the distance at which the lake effect is negligible is highly dependent of wind speed and sensible heat flux.",

Many studies have measured active methylation/demethylation in ocean margin sediments but few have reported similar rates for the marine water column. This presentation will review available evidence for water column methylation in estuaries, including new experimental measurements of methylation/demethylation rates from a deep subarctic fjord in Labrador Canada collected in Spring and Fall of 2012-2013. We used these and other data to construct a mass budget for MeHg in the estuary and show that water column methylation (with rates ranging from 1.5 to 2.8 % day-1), is the largest contributor, followed by inputs from rivers (4.9 mol year-1), to the in situ pool of MeHg available for uptake by biota. By contrast, the sediment in this system is a net sink for MeHg (-1.5 mol year-1). We discuss the relationship between observed MeHg and other ancillary environmental factors (organic carbon, sulfur and nutrients) as well as implications for the response time of fish to future changes in mercury inputs.",

            "abstract": "Although it is well recognized that extreme temperatures occurring at particular growth stages are destructive to yield, there appears substantial scope for improved empirical assessment and simulation of the relationship between temperature and yield. Several anecdotes are discussed.\nFirst, a statistical analysis of historical U.S. extreme temperatures is provided. It is demonstrated that both reanalysis and model simulations significantly differ from near-surface temperature observations in the frequency and magnitude of extremes. This finding supports empirical assessment using near-surface instrumental records and underscores present difficulties in simulating past and predicting future changes.\nSecond, an analysis of the implications of extreme temperatures on U.S. maize yield is provided where the response is resolved regionally and according to growth stage. Sensitivity to extreme temperatures during silking is found to be uniformly high across the U.S., but the response during grain filling varies spatially, with higher sensitivity in the North. This regional and growth-stage dependent sensitivity implies the importance of representing cultivar, planting times, and development rates, and is also indicative of the potential for future changes according to the combined effects of climate and technology.\nFinally, interaction between extreme temperatures and agriculture is indicated by analysis showing that historical extreme temperatures in the U.S. Midwest have cooled in relation to changes in regional productivity, possibly because of greater potential for cooling through evapotranspiration. This interpretation is consistent with changes in crop physiology and management, though also noteworthy is that the moderating influence of increased evapotranspiration on extreme temperatures appears to be lost during severe drought.\nTogether, these findings indicate that a more accurate assessment of the historical relationship between extreme temperatures and yield may be obtained through judicious use of instrumental data, resolving regional and stage-based responses, and dynamically accounting for the interactions between temperature extremes and crop type. These considerations should also be informative for accurate simulation and prediction of future changes in yield.",

            "abstract": "The critical zone, which extends from the top of the canopy to the elevation of unweathered bedrock, hosts a variety of processes that control the evolution of the topographic surface. Though studies of hillslope evolution tend to focus on erosion and soil production mechanisms near the surface, evidence suggests that weathering and fluid transport processes that occur at depths beyond the soil influence hillslope form. Despite this, little is known about what controls the boundary between weathered and fresh bedrock (Zb) under hillslopes and few direct observations of Zb and moisture dynamics within weathered rock exist. This study presents observations from a heavily monitored 4000 m2 experimental hillslope within the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory in northern California. Drilling data, groundwater monitoring, and geophysical imaging reveal a weathered bedrock zone that thickens towards the divide and is consistent with a theory for predicting Zb under hillslopes that links channel incision to the drainage of fresh bedrock within the hillslope. Direct observations of rock moisture indicate that moisture dynamics within weathered rock regulate streamflow and transpiration. Water transport in the weathered bedrock occurs via two mechanisms: a diffuse wetting front and rapid transport along fractures. This water recharges a seasonally perched water table that provides baseflow. Rock moisture storage increases upslope and remains seasonally elevated longer into the dry season of this Mediterranean climate suggesting that Zb and the spatial distribution of weathered rock controls the spatial and temporal moisture dyanmics in hillslopes. Data from vegetative water use monitoring efforts suggest that rock moisture influences forest ecosystem dynamics and thus physical weathering, erosion mechanisms, climate (via transpiration), and baseflow. Our observations within the interior of this hillslope highlight the consequences of critical zone evolution on the mechanisms that influence hillslope form.",

            "abstract": "The conventional geothermal electrical generation capacity potential in the United States is estimated to be as high as 90 GW (USGS, 2008). If Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) are included, the estimated capacity soars beyond 800 GW. Current generation capacity in the U.S. is approximately 1,000 GW. With a capacity factor close to 0.9, these numbers suggest that geothermal energy has the potential to be the primary provider of electrical energy in the United States. Realizing that potential is important, since geothermal energy is renewable, has low to no emissions, involves no fuel cycle, has one of the lowest spatial footprints per MW, has one of the lowest levelized costs of energy and the highest energy returned on energy invested values.\nHowever, access to water is an important prerequisite for geothermal power generation. It is required in drilling, heat transfer and power production. For EGS applications, water is also needed for stimulation. Much of the water currently utilized in these geothermal applications is groundwater.\nThe impact of climate change on geothermal power generation will be expressed primarily through water availability. The details of potential water change impacts on power generation in existing and future geothermal sites will be presented in three case studies. It will be shown that strategies for mitigating groundwater losses are available, and include: use of degraded water in geothermal systems; use of captured CO2 for heat transfer; expanded use of dry cooling; improved resolution of subsurface permeability mapping; improved efficiencies in power generation; and expanded access to high enthalpy resources.\nAchieving these benefits will require aggressive research programs. Developing model hybrid technologies that combine geothermal-solar-biomass-wind-small hydro should be part of this research effort. Coupling geothermal resource exploration and mapping with detailed analysis of groundwater resources (recharge sites; climate change impacts; budgets; evolution of competitive uses) must be more strenuously and rigorously pursued. Otherwise climate change effects on subsurface water budgets may, over the long term, negatively impact the ability to achieve the electrical generation potential of geothermal energy.",

            "abstract": "Previous models of continental collision predict that Tibetan Plateau has grown progressively northward following the Indo-Asian collision since ~60-50 Ma. Increasing evidence of crustal shortening and uplift in northern Tibet soon after the collision, however, challenges these models and thus our current understanding of the fundamental mechanics of continental collision. We show that these discrepancies may be reconciled in a viscoelasto-plastic geodynamic model that incorporates the vertically variable rheology of the continental lithosphere. Our results show that, upon the Indo-Asian collision, stress transmits instantly across the brittle upper crust to cause localized shorting and uplift over preexisting fault zones, including those in northern Tibet. Broad plateau uplift, however, results from crustal thickening, which occurs mainly in the viscous lower crust and propagates gradually northward. Such two-mode deformation of the Tibetan lithosphere explains both early crustal shortening in northern Tibet and the progressive northward growth of the Tibetan Plateau; the results provides a new framework for understanding the broad impacts of the Indo-Asian collision.",

The velocity and energy distributions of this need to be explained in order to understand the inner magnetospheric plasma physics. We have investigated the velocity and energy distributions of water group ions in the vicinity of Enceladus using test particle and Monte Carlo methods including collisional processes such as charge exchange and ion-neutral chemical reaction.

            "abstract": "Construction and operation of large dams in river basins have trapped large volumes of freshwater and sediment, which not only alters the natural seasonal rhythm of river hydrological cycles, but also creates a disconnection between rivers and their deltas. As a result, the water and sediment discharged to the coastal ocean have been greatly reduced, which triggers profound responses in coastal region including delta destruction, accelerated rise of relative sea level and changes in coastal primary production. The Yellow River has been a well documented system with significant impacts of dam regulation. Recent sediment load and freshwater (2002-2012) delivered to the sea have been reduced to 0.16 billion tones per year and 17.9 km3/yr, approximately 13% and 34% of those in 1950s-1960s, a period without significant dam impacts. Dam interception and dam-facilitated water regulation play a dominated role in reducing the flux of water and sediment to the sea, as well as in changing the grain-size composition of sediment. Consequently, the process of estuarine sediment dynamics has changed and the delta has recently been converted into a destructive phase with strong coastal erosion due to insufficient rive sediment supply although the accretion of the active delta lobe was evident because of rapid local deposition of coarsening river sediment around the river mouth. The delta coast erosion has thus become a major source for sediment transport in the Bohai Sea and even to those in the Yellow Sea given the critical role of monsoonal climate on coastal resuspension and coastal currents. Delta erosion and subsidence have therefore accelerated the rate of relative sea-level rise, considerably higher than the global mean, which has put the mega-delta to be at risk. In addition, recent works have identified two peaks of chlorophyll-a within annual cycle in the delta coastal region, one of which is closely associated with the river delivery of nutrients transferred with freshwater and sediment. This implied a significant decrease in coastal primary production resulting from the reduction of river water and sediment. Therefore, the coastal ecosystem in the delta region is expected to be greatly altered given the combined effects of decreasing primary production and destruction of coastal wetland due to the enhanced coastal erosion.",

            "abstract": "Significant evolutionary, climatic, and oceanographic events in Earth history are often accompanied by excursions in the carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of marine carbonates and co-occurring sedimentary organic material. The observation of synchronous excursions in the δ13C values of marine carbonates and coeval organic matter is commonly thought to prove that the deposit has not been altered by diagenesis, and that the variations in the δ13C records are the result of a significant change in global carbon cycling. Furthermore, this model suggests that the covariance of carbonate and organic δ13C records is driven only by changes in the δ13C value of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface waters of the ocean. However, recent work suggests that there may be at least two alternate models for generating covariance between carbonate and organic δ13C values in the geologic record. One of the models invokes sea-level driven syndepositional mixing between isotopically distinct sources of carbonate and organic material to produce positive covariance between carbonate and organic δ13C values. The second model suggests that post-depositional alteration to the carbonate δ13C values during meteoric diagenesis, in concert with concurrent contributions of terrestrial organic material during subaerial exposure, can also produce co-occurring negative excursions with tightly covariant δ13C records. In contrast to earlier interpretations of covariant δ13C values, these models suggest that both syndepositional and post-depositional factors can significantly influence the relationship between carbonate and organic δ13C values in a variety of depositional environments. The implications for reconstructions of ancient global carbon cycle events will be explored within the context of these three models, and their relative importance throughout geologic time will be discussed.",

These two regions are characterized by different ozone precursor sources and exhibit unique regional wind flow patterns. During these studies, NOAA deployed its truck-based, scanning TOPAZ ozone lidar to document the vertical structure and temporal evolution of ozone concentrations from near the surface up to about 2.5 km above ground level. In Houston, TOPAZ was located next to a radar wind profiler while during the Colorado campaign, Doppler wind lidars collocated with TOPAZ measured wind profiles and vertical velocity statistics throughout the boundary layer (BL). For both studies, nearby in situ sensors provided continuous observations of surface ozone and NOx. These combinations of remote and in situ sensors lend themselves to study the influence of BL transport and mixing processes on surface-level ozone. In this presentation, we focus on characterizing and quantifying changes in surface ozone due to several BL processes, including the Houston land-sea breeze circulation, the terrain-driven BL flow in the Colorado Front Range area, thunderstorm outflows, BL growth rate and depth, and entrainment of air from the residual layer or lower free troposphere into the BL.",

            "abstract": "Stormwater Control Measures are required by jurisdictions across the USA and internationally to treat runoff quantity and quality. Like any anthropogenic device, these systems must be maintained. However, often times once a system has been constructed, it is neglected, either assumed it will work in perpetuity or (more likely) just forgotten. Recent research on multiple stormwater practices illustrates the pitfalls of neglecting certain practices, while highlighting other SCMs that are resilient despite lack of care. The focus of this presentation will be to highlight three often-used SCMs, constructed stormwater wetlands, bioretention, and permeable pavement, describing each SCM's failure modes. The degree to which water quality and hydrologic mitigation function is lost will be presented for each practice. Moreover, design and construction guidance will be provided so that the exposure to failure mechanisms is limited for each practice. Of the three practices, it appears that their resilience to failure is (in descending order): constructed stormwater wetlands, bioretention, and permeable pavement. One key to the former two practices robustness seems to be the important role in vegetation, which helps heal \"wounds\" of neglect. Because constructed stormwater wetlands do not rely upon filtration, they tend to be slighly less prone to failure than bioretention (which is a filtration-based SCM).",

            "abstract": "The climate controls on past and present tropical glacier fluctuations are unclear. Here we present a chronology of past glacial extents in the Rwenzori Mountains (~1ºN, 30ºE), on the border of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and compare this with local and regional paleoclimate records to infer the climate controls on glaciation. The Rwenzori Mountains host the most extensive glacial system in Africa and are composed of quartz-rich bedrock lithologies, enabling 10Be dating. Our dataset includes thirty 10Be ages of boulders on moraines estimated to have been deposited between the end of the last glacial period and early Holocene time. In the Mubuku Valley, eight 10Be ages of large (~50-150 m relief) lateral moraines that extend down to ~2000 m asl indicate that deposition occurred at ~23.4 ka (n=4) and ~20.1 ka (n=4), contemporaneously with the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Local and regional paleoclimate records document dry, cool conditions in East Africa during this time. Therefore, we suggest that cooler temperatures were a primary influence on the LGM glacial extents. Upvalley from these samples, six 10Be ages of boulders on moraines (between 3450 and 3720 m asl) document stillstands or readvances of glacier ice at ~14.3 ka (n=2), ~13.2 ka (n=2), and ~11.1 ka (n=2). In the nearby Nyagumasani Valley sixteen 10Be ages of boulders on moraines at similar elevations (3870-4020 m asl) indicate stillstands or readvances at ~11.5 ka (n=4), ~10.6 ka (n=4), and ~10.5 ka (n=4). Local and regional paleoclimate records indicate dry conditions during Younger Dryas time, wet conditions during early Holocene time, and no significant late-glacial temperature reversal. Thus, the relationship between glacier advance and climate conditions during late-glacial time remains enigmatic. We continue to develop the moraine chronology in order to improve our interpretations of climate controls on glacier fluctuations during late-glacial to early Holocene time.",

Two garnet-bearing components of the WFO, the Malaspina Pluton and Breaksea Orthogneiss, crystallised from monzodioritic magma at 1.2 and 1.8 GPa, respectively. These units are dominated by monzodioritic gneiss with minor decimetre- to centimetre-scale cumulate layers including garnetite, clinopyroxenite, eclogite and hornblendite. Diopside in the Malaspina Pluton compared with omphacite in the Breaksea Orthogneiss is the key difference between the monzodioritic hosts and eclogite components, reflecting a c. 20 km difference in emplacement levels. Mineral rare earth element (REE) characteristics of garnet and clinopyroxene within each monzodioritic host and included cumulate eclogite layers are remarkably similar for the different crustal levels; most garnet and clinopyroxene in each unit has a common igneous origin. Trace element mineral fractionation models based on the observed igneous chemical concentrations and accumulated proportions within both units predict eclogite (garnet-clinopyroxene) fractionation as significant in producing middle and upper crustal magmatism on the Cretaceous Gondwana margin. The results suggest fractionation of magmatic eclogitic residue is of significance in crustal differentiation of overthickened continental arcs at depths greater than 1.2 GPa. The similar trace element compositions of garnet and clinopyroxene for rocks emplaced at c. 40 km and c. 60 km suggest that once an arc is > 40 km thick, eclogitic fractionation will be produce similar patterns regardless of how thick the arc is.",

            "abstract": "Low temperature dolomite formation continues to be an enigmatic process. However, with the advent of the clumped isotope technique, there is an opportunity to determine the temperature of formation as well as the δ18O of the fluid (δ18Ow) from which it formed. By using samples with a well constrained geologic and thermal history, we have attempted to accurately develop a technique for the application of clumped isotopes to varying dolomite systems.\nSamples for this study were taken from two cores, one from the island of San Salvador and one on Great Bahama Bank (known as Clino), located on the eastern and western edges respectively of the Bahamian Archipelago. Both cores penetrate through Pleistocene to Miocene aged carbonates. The San Salvador core has a 110m section of pure, near stoichiometric dolomite, while the Clino core is of a mixed carbonate composition with varying abundances (0% - 50%) of calcian dolomite (42-46 mol % MgCO3). The water temperature profile of the Bahamas can be assumed over time due to the stable geology and no influence of higher temperature waters. Because of its location and the present burial depth, the largest influence on dolomite formation has been changes in sea level.\nAs the dolomites from San Salvador are 100% dolomite, the Δ47 was determined directly. The Clino dolomites however were only partially dolomitized and so were treated with buffered acetic acid to remove non-dolomite carbonates. This was carried out in stages, using X-ray diffraction to determine composition, followed by the measurement of Δ47 after each leaching episode. Because the dolomite formation temperature and δ18Ow can be constrained, it becomes possible to evaluate the applicability of the multitude of clumped isotope correction schemes that have been applied to various dolomite samples. Also tested were several different equations which link temperature to the δ18O of the dolomite allowing the δ18O of the water to be calculated. This is a necessary exercise for the study of dolomite because of the inability to properly standardize low temperature dolomite formation as well as the novelty of the clumped isotope technique. In doing so, we hope to establish accurate protocols in how to best handle low temperature dolomite clumped isotope data.",

It is partly because of the less well managed way for land use planning and lack of the environmental impact assessment at least at the early stage of the development. A stable isotopic ( δ 18O and δ 2H) and hydrochemical investigation was carried out in the reclaimed area at the south of the Ismailia Canal to identify recharge sources, and mixing and salinization processes of the Quaternary aquifer. On the basis of the isotopic data, four end-members, i.e., the Quaternary aquifer, the Miocene aquifer, surface freshwater and wastewater ponds were found to be mixed in different degree in the study area. As a consequence of mixing with groundwater in the Miocene aquifer which shows highly saline and depleted isotopic signature, groundwater in the Quaternary aquifer was found to have a depleted isotopic trend towards south, i.e., toward structural highs. On the contrary, northward trends of the enriched isotopic values and lower EC values in the Quaternary aquifer indicated the mixing with surface water. Local abnormal EC values at an agricultural area and the vicinity of well field were considered to be related to the excessive pumping for irrigation and reclamation activities which in turn resulted in upconing of deeper saline groundwater. Mixing pattern also suggested local contribution of the wastewater ponds to the recharge process, which is consistent with the previously reported heavy metal contamination in the vicinity of these ponds, indicating the necessity to protect and remediate the subsurface water resources in the area.",

            "abstract": "The discovery and extraction of natural resources represents major challenges on both technical and socio-political fronts. Societal demand for commodities continues to increase as population, infrastructure, energy demands and standards of living increase. In parallel, society expects more efficient, cleaner and more sustainable practices. There are therefore multiple incentives for industry to invest in research and innovation to meet these fundamental goals.\nNatural resource companies fund research internally and externally but the focus, approach and level of funding varies considerably among sectors, companies and disciplines. The wide variety of philosophies creates difficulties for those who seek to work with industry. Most funding arrangement are built through extensive engagement, opportunities to leverage funds particularly in higher risk or less well defined areas (e.g., geoscience), and the attraction of meeting potential new high quality employees. Barriers to funding include unrealistic perceptions of confidentiality issues in industry, bureaucracy and unrealistic IP constraints in academia, and onerous overhead charges by universities that vastly exceed those charged by consulting and contract researchers.\nAcademics and students can benefit immensely from productive research arrangements with industry, but understanding realistic expectations on both sides is critical. Although funding from industry may introduce constraints, some companies are willing to take a virtual hands-off approach in support of quality science. Selecting the appropriate researchers and methodology is important; it takes time for students to become effective and some problems are simply not suited to graduate research, or even academia.\nSome Governments play an enormous role in facilitating collaborative research with industry while others struggle to differentiate programs that encourage investment from those that unfairly subsidize industry. The traditional Government role in the provision of geoscientific data to serve society and underpin high risk exploration has diminished in many jurisdictions and new innovative partnerships and collaborative research and development approaches are required to fill these gaps and hence meet societal needs for commodities.",

Similarly, can we identify places on earth where planting large-scale runoff-reducing forests might increase down-wind precipitation, thus leading to magnified carbon capture? In this talk we present an analytical Lagrangian framework for the prediction of incremental increases in down-wind precipitation due to land surface evaporation and transpiration. We compare these predictions to recently published rainfall recycling values from the literature. Focus is on the Columbia basin (Pacific Northwest of hte USA), with extensions to East Africa.

            "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) fertilization is a cornerstone of modern agriculture, but the practice also leads to eutrophication, hypoxia, and harmful algal blooms in both inland and coastal waters. Several studies identify Iowa, Illinois and Indiana as major source areas of N discharged by the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico where large-scale hypoxia develops annually. Continental-scale management of nitrogen requires a comprehensive understanding of watershed-specific hydrologic dynamics and their consequences for nitrate flushing from agricultural landscapes. Spatiotemporal variation in nitrate fluxes is inherently complex due to the broad range of physicochemical and hydraulic properties that influence N movement through soils, groundwater, and rivers. In-stream N fluxes respond to both short- and long-term climactic forcing interacting with the cumulative human modification to both physical and biogeochemical systems in agricultural catchments.\nHere, we synthesize results from three individual studies in the Iowa River watershed. First, we demonstrate significant inter- and intra-annual variability in stream responses to rainfall events as a function of antecedent moisture conditions in three nested catchments (first through third-order). This study highlights the use of in-situ, high temporal resolution sensor networks as an emerging tool. Next, we leverage a catchment-wide synoptic study repeated in 2013 to demonstrate the landscape-scale impact of climate dynamics interacting with management decisions on the landscape. This study highlights the role of changes in extreme event frequency on water quality in agricultural landscapes. Finally, we extend results onto the landscape, using a numerical model to quantify heterogeneity of key controlling variables within the landscape (e.g., soil texture) and N retention or mobilization. We compare variability in key controls with variability driven by climate over a 60-yr period of record.",

            "abstract": "International collaborative exploration over the last decade has revealed East Antarctica as a geologically diverse continent underlying an ice sheet with significant sea level potential, parts of which are currently undergoing rapid change. The Wilkes and Aurora Subglacial Basins (WSB and ASB), two of the largest reservoirs of sea level potential in Antarctica, are broader, deeper, and more susceptible to marine ice sheet instability than previously known. The morphology and coastal connections of the ASB indicate a dynamic early ice sheet with a significant erosional history and multiple ice sheet configurations. Recent results imply significant retreat into the WSB during the Pliocene while today irreversible discharge there is halted by only a small ridge.\nWe have unveiled complex contemporary subglacial landscapes beneath both basins providing new challenges and opportunities to ice sheet modelers. For instance, geothermal heat flow varies spatially on multiple scales in the continental crust assumed to be homogeneous. A large, active, subglacial hydrological system flows through the ASB along pathways that likely predate large-scale glaciation.\nProxies indicate four to eight meters of global sea level rise during the last interglacial period. Ice core results constrain the amount of sea level rise to one to three meters from contributed by East Antarctica. Going forward, new altimetry data along the East Antarctic coast reveal extensive lowering of the Totten and Denman Glaciers while satellite gravity indicate a variable but persistent record of negative regional mass loss. These discoveries provide a new baseline as the international community increases its focus on the region through ongoing airborne and marine exploration to address the many outstanding questions:\nWhat is the character and distribution of subglacial boundary conditions and water systems upstream of the grounding line in areas of significant potential sea level impact?\nHow much subglacial water discharges into sub-ice shelf cavities and what is its impact on the ocean?\nHow do ocean forcings drive variations in ice surface elevation change and grounded ice mass budget?\nHow does ice shelf cavity geometry affect sub-ice shelf circulation, and melt/freeze distribution in areas of significant potential sea level impact?",

            "abstract": "The shallow topographic gradient of the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau has captured the attention of Earth scientists for decades. The area is host to a complex system of long-lived stike slip fault systems, including the Red River fault system. Likewise, the large areas of low-relief landscapes are perched above deeply incised rivers. Both have been proposed to hold clues related to the timing and magnitude of topographic growth of the southeast margin. The presence of the low relief landscape, in concert with the low topographic gradient led to the interpretation of late Miocene lower crustal flow as the mechanism for surface uplift. Surface uplift was also linked to regional drainage reorganization. This study examines the topographic evolution of the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau throughout the Cenozoic using stable isotope paleoaltimetry of pedogenic carbonates and leaf waxes preserved in Cenozoic basins extending from the northern to the southern portions of the SE margin of the Tibetan Plateau (Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces, China). Isotope– elevation relationships are determined from a modern sampling transect along the Lancang (Mekong) River and an estimated Eocene Rayleigh fractionation model that was randomly resampled. Paleoelevations are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation of the normally distributed uncertainties in each parameter used to calculate elevations from the oxygen isotopic value of pedogenic carbonate and hydrogen isotopic value of plant waxes. Elevations calculated by each method indicate the SE margin of Tibet was at its present elevation as early as the late Eocene, with elevations of 3.3 km as far south as the northern third of China’s Yunnan Province. This result expands the extent of the Eocene Tibetan Plateau more than 1000 km east of that previously known and precludes Miocene surface uplift via lower crustal flow in the area of SW Sichuan and Northern Yunnan as a driver for drainage reorganization and an observed middle to late Miocene pulse of rapid exhumation. Elevation estimates from the southern two thirds of the study area parallel to the Red River Fault suggest approximately 1 km of post late Miocene surface uplift, consistent with estimates from previous geomorphic studies in the Red River.",

            "abstract": "Eolian (wind-blown) dune deposits are widespread on Earth and Mars, with soft-sediment deformation preserved in cross-bedded sandstone deposits comprising important records of past environmental conditions. Exceptional 3-D exposures of the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, in the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument of northern Arizona, contain distinctive intervals of decameter- scale soft-sediment contortions, up-turned dune sets, brittle strain, massive layers with breccia blocks, and associated geomorphic mounds. Both field studies and remote-controlled unmanned aerial vehicles (airplane or kite) images respectively provide “ground truth” and “bird’s-eye” perspectives of the deformation. The nature of the continuous folds within stratigraphically constrained beds indicates confining layers breached by rapid fluid expulsion, strain softening, and cataclastic flow of partially lithified sandstone under water-saturated conditions (i.e., a relatively high-water table), consistent with theoretical and laboratory studies of deformation in saturated sand. Loose grain packing and high porosity and permeability in eolian sands allow for water-filled pores, which are conducive for soft-sediment deformation. The likely driver for this observed deformation was liquefaction-induced ground failure from strong ground motion, such as long-duration surface waves of a large earthquake.\nThese eolian examples preserve complex geologic stories and serve as paleoenvironmental records. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) HiRISE images of exposed layer contortions and soft-sediment deformation in Candor Chasma are remarkably similar to the Jurassic examples. The Jurassic analog examples provide baseline criteria to help interpret high-water table conditions and subsequent strong ground motion in the late Hesperian to early Amazonian sediments on the floor of Candor Chasma and other chasmata of Valles Marineris.",

We studied the effect of temperature on CO2 emissions from soil, from the active layer to deep permafrost (400 cm), during a 140-day incubation at temperatures of −5.0 °C to +5.0 °C. We found that permafrost carbon emissions on the QXP increase with soil temperature. Temperature has greater impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition in permafrost soils than in thawed soils. A temperature increase of 4.5° results in an average increase in carbon release of 482.8% (±60%) at temperature below 0 °C (−5.0 to −0.5 °C), and 102.0% (±37.5%) at temperatures above 0 °C (0.5 to 5.0 °C). Permafrost carbon has greater vulnerability at subzero temperatures than at temperature above 0 °C. Moreover, the increase in permafrost carbon release in mineral soils was larger than that in organic soils at temperatures form −5.0 to −0.5 °C. The released CO2 mostly came from soils at depths of 10−20 cm and deep permafrost soils at depths of 245−255 cm and 285−295 cm, based on the stable carbon isotope analysis of δ13SOC and δ13CO2.",

Operating as an integrated observing system, DISCOVER-AQ has employed multiple aircraft and ground instrumentation to conduct multi-perspective observations of the distribution of gaseous and particulate pollution in the lower atmosphere over contrasting regions of the U.S. that are currently in violation of National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The four study areas include Maryland (Baltimore-Washington corridor), California (southern San Joaquin Valley), Texas (Greater Houston area), and Colorado (Denver/Northern Front Range). The DISCOVER-AQ observations are actively being used to promote improvements in remote sensing in the following ways: Characterizing vertical structure in the atmosphere and its diurnal patterns to develop improved a priori information for satellite retrievals; Examining horizontal variability to assess the spatial scales needed to resolve emissions and photochemistry; Determining correlative relationships between remotely sensed and in situ observations; Assessing the value of ground-based remote sensing to provide information on impact of boundary layer dynamics and mixing on air pollution. Examples of the ongoing analysis of these datasets and their relevance to future geostationary satellite observations as well as augmentation of air quality monitoring networks with ground-based remote sensing will be discussed.",

The tremendous volume of this outreach program has only been possible by including over 100 undergraduate interns, which adds a layer of professional development to their formal education. We’ve also leveraged the “hands-on” informal education program to develop both formal professional development workshops for teachers and new undergraduate courses. So we’re now using hands-on science activities developed by undergraduates for use in grades 5-8 for teaching climate science to undergrads! It’s remarkable how well this integration works. We’ve also extended the approach beyond “hands-on” to “minds-on” experiments based on interactive modules that run inside web browsers. Building on the framework we developed for extending informal science education into formal instruction, we also entrained dozens of students at the largest graduate Atmospheric Science program in the US to provide them with professional development experiences and tracked their matriculation into the professional research and academic workforce. Finally, we’ve extended the informal minds-on techniques to both in-person and online courses offered to retirees and to the public. Combining these forms of outreach leverage direct experience of the nature of science with authentic communication to reach diverse audiences with climate science content.",

            "abstract": "The carbon-climate community has an historic opportunity to make a step-function improvement in climate prediction by using regional constraints to improve mechanistic model representation of carbon cycle processes. Interactions among atmospheric CO2, global biogeochemistry, and physical climate constitute leading sources of uncertainty in future climate. First-order differences among leading models of these processes produce differences in climate as large as differences in aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions and fossil fuel combustion. Emergent constraints based on global observations of interannual variations provide powerful constraints on model parameterizations. Additional constraints can be defined at regional scales. Organized intercomparison experiments have shown that uncertainties in future carbon-climate feedback arise primarily from model representations of the dependence of photosynthesis on CO2 and drought stress and the dependence of decomposition on temperature. Just as representations of net carbon fluxes have benefited from eddy flux, ecosystem manipulations, and atmospheric CO2, component carbon fluxes (photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, disturbance) can be constrained at regional scales using new observations. Examples include biogeochemical tracers such as isotopes and carbonyl sulfide as well as remotely-sensed parameters such as chlorophyll fluorescence and biomass. Innovative model evaluation experiments will be needed to leverage the information content of new observations to improve process representations as well as to provide accurate initial conditions for coupled climate model simulations. Successful implementation of a comprehensive benchmarking program could have a huge impact on understanding and predicting future climate change.",

            "abstract": "Strain localization is significantly enhanced by the influx of fluid; however, processes associated with deformation in polycrystalline material, fluid infiltration, and the evolution of creep processes and rock fabric with increasing strain localization are not well constrained for many lower crust lithologies. We combine field and experimental observations of mafic rocks deforming at lower crust pressure, temperature, and water conditions to examine strain localization processes associated with the influx of fluid, strength dependence of fabric evolution, and flow law parameters for amphibolite. General shear experiments were conducted in a Griggs rig on powdered basalt (≤5 µm starting grain size) with up to 1 wt% water at lower continental crust conditions (750˚ to 850˚C, 1GPa). Amphibole formed during deformation exhibits both a strong shape preferred orientation (SPO) and lattice preferred orientation (LPO). With increasing strain, the amphibole (and clinopyroxene) LPO strengthens and rotates to [001] maximum aligned sub-parallel to the flow direction and SPO, which indicates grain rotation during deformation. Plagioclase LPO increases from random to very weak in samples deformed to high strain. As the amphibole LPO rotates and strengthens, the mechanical strength decreases. The correlation of the SPO and LPO coupled with the rheological evidence for diffusion creep (n ≈ 1.5) indicates that the amphibole fabric results from grain growth and rigid grain rotation during deformation. The coevolution of LPO (and grain rotation) and mechanical weakening coupled with the absence of grain size reduction in our samples suggests that strength depends on the formation of a strong mineral LPO. Both our field and experimental data demonstrate that fluid intrusion into the mafic lower crust initiates syn-deformational, water-consuming reactions, creating a rheological contrast between wet and dry lithologies that promotes strain localization. Additionally, the rheology of both naturally deformed amphibolite shear zones and our fine-grained experimental amphibolite is comparable to that predicted using flow laws for wet anorthite. Thus, both our experimental and field analyses indicate that wet plagioclase rheology provides a good constraint on the strength of hydrated lower continental crust.",

Calculated catchment-weighted evaporation losses based on a lake survey in the 1990s were estimated at ~10–15% in tundra areas draining into the Arctic Ocean to as high as 60% in forested subarctic areas draining to the Mackenzie River via Great Bear or Great Slave Lakes. Open-water evaporation was found to generally decrease with increasing latitude, accounting for 5 to 50% of total evapotranspiration. Two long-term studies initiated in the 1990s, and carried on for 20+ years, confirm many of the findings of the initial survey and now provide a complimentary perspective of temporal variations in water balance along two representative string-of-lakes drainages located in boreal and tundra settings. For a tundra watershed, the study reveals important lake-order-dependent patterns of evaporation/inflow, evaporation/evapotranspiration, land-surface-runoff/precipitation and discharge/precipitation. For a boreal watershed, the analysis also reveals that fluctuations in effective drainage area due to intermittent connectivity between lakes during dry periods can be an important driver of downstream isotopic signals.",

Kailas to the west were collected for detrital zircon U-Pb geochronologic and Apatite Fission Track (AFT) thermochronologic analyses. Zircon U-Pb ages for all rivers range between 15 and 3568 Ma. Rivers draining the northern side of the suture zone mainly yield ages between 40 and 60 Ma, similar to the age of the Gangdese magmatic arc. Samples from rivers draining the southern side of the suture zone record a Tethyan Himalayan signal characterized by age clusters at 500 Ma and 1050 Ma. Our results indicate that the ages and proportion of U-Pb zircons ages of downstream samples from tributaries of the Yarlung River directly reflect source area ages and relative area of source rock exposure in the catchment basin. Significant age components at 37 – 40 Ma, 47 – 50 Ma, 55 – 58 Ma and 94 – 97 Ma reflect episodicity in Gangdese arc magmatism. Our AFT ages show two main signals at 23–18 Ma and 12 Ma, which are in agreement with accelerated exhumation of the Gangdese batholith during these time intervals. The 23 – 18 Ma signal partly overlaps with deposition of the Kailas Formation along the suture zone and may be related to exhumation due to upper plate extension in southern Tibet in response to Indian slab rollback and/or break–off events.\nDetrital thermochronology of four sand samples from the Kali Gandaki River and some of its tributaries in Nepal is underway and will provide constraints on the timing of erosion of the central Nepal Himalaya.",

This system currently processes data from a constellation of 5 geostationary and 2 polar-orbiting sensors. Additional sensors, including NPP VIIRS and the imager on the Korea COMS-1 geostationary satellite, will soon be added. This constellation experiences schedule changes and outages of various durations, making the set of available scenes for fire detection highly variable on an hourly and daily basis. Adding to the complexity, the latency of the satellite data is variable between and within sensors. FLAMBE shares with many fire detection systems the goal of detecting as many fires as possible as early as possible, but the FLAMBE system must also produce a consistent estimate of smoke production with minimal artifacts from the changing constellation. To achieve this, NRL has developed a system of asynchronous processing and cross-calibration that permits satellite data to be used as it arrives, while preserving the consistency of the smoke emission estimates. This talk describes the asynchronous data ingest methodology, including latency statistics for the constellation. We also provide an overview and show results from the system we have developed to normalize multi-sensor fire detection for consistency.",

            "abstract": "Inherent geochemical, organic matter, and microbial heterogeneity over small spatial scales can complicate studies of carbon dynamics through soils. Stable isotope analysis has a strong history of helping track substrate turnover, delineate rhizosphere activity zones, and identifying transitions in vegetation cover, but most traditional isotope approaches are limited in spatial resolution by a combination of physical separation techniques (manual dissection) and IRMS instrument sensitivity. We coupled laser ablation sampling with isotope measurement via IRMS to enable spatially resolved analysis over solid surfaces. Once a targeted sample region is ablated the resulting particulates are entrained in a helium carrier gas and passed through a combustion reactor where carbon is converted to CO2. Cyrotrapping of the resulting CO2 enables a reduction in carrier gas flow which improves overall measurement sensitivity versus traditional, high flow sample introduction. Currently we are performing sample analysis at 50 µm resolution, require 65 ng C per analysis, and achieve measurement precision consistent with other continuous flow techniques.\nWe will discuss applications of the laser ablation IRMS (LA-IRMS) system to microbial communities and fish ecology studies to demonstrate the merits of this technique and how similar analytical approaches can be transitioned to soil systems. Preliminary efforts at analyzing soil samples will be used to highlight strengths and limitations of the LA-IRMS approach, paying particular attention to sample preparation requirements, spatial resolution, sample analysis time, and the types of questions most conducive to analysis via LA-IRMS.",

            "abstract": "A prominent sea level rise pattern in the Pacific Ocean – large increases of 12 mm/yr in the West and near-stagnant levels in the East – has been observed with satellite altimetry since the 1990s. A significant fraction of this dipole trend pattern has been attributed to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), a large-scale mode of internal climate variability. However, the PDO cannot fully account for the Western Pacific Ocean trend pattern. Whether or not the remaining non-PDO pattern can be linked to an anthropogenic influence has been discussed in several recent studies. Here, we use a large ensemble of CMIP5 20th century simulations (more than 150 runs from 27 different GCM setups) to further investigate the role and contribution of the PDO and other modes of equatorial variability to Pacific sea level change patterns. Specifically, we focus on 20-year trend patterns since 1950, and attempt to isolate and attribute an externally forced sea level pattern. Rather than averaging over the large CMIP5 model ensemble to dampen non-synchronized internal variability, we remove sea level trend contributions from internal variability to test if the remaining patterns become more consistent across the models, and thus support the notion of a detectable common externally forced sea level change since 1990. Our results also indicate that the representation of the PDO and its link to large-scale regional sea level variations can differ significantly across the CMIP5 ensemble. While some CMIP5 models can replicate observed connections between PDO-related and equatorial climate modes and Pacific sea level patterns, others show large differences.",

            "abstract": "Magnetotellurics (MT) provides a powerful geophysical tool for imaging of ancient suture zones, which are frequently marked by elongated zones of very low resistivity. These conductive anomalies, which can extend to great depths and have apparently persisted for several billion years, most likely result from graphite and sulfides deeply emplaced and remobilized, through subduction, accretion and orogenesis. The Earthscope MT transportable array provides a unique broad-scale view of sutures in the continental US. In the northwestern US subvertical conductive features bound all of the major cratonic blocks. These can be identified with the Cheyenne Belt between the Wyoming Craton (WC) and Yavapai Terranes (YT), the Great Falls Tectonic Zone between WC and the Medicine Hat Block (MHB), and the Vulcan Structure of southern Alberta between MHB and the Hearne Craton. In all cases the conductive anomalies extend well into the mantle lithosphere. The more recent MT TA footprint in the north-central US (surrounding the Mid-Continent Rift (MCR)) also reveals conductive signatures of ancient sutures. The most prominent lies south of Lake Superior, just north of the Niagara Fault (NF), and can be associated with the Penokean Orogeny (~1.85 Ga). A second, further south beneath Iowa and western Wisconsin, just south of the Spirit Lake tectonic zone (SLtz), can be identified with YT accretion (~1.75 Ga). Both of these sutures are cleanly cut by the MCR. The break in the anomalies is narrow (comparable to the surface expression of the MCR) indicating that rifting impacts on the entire crustal section were highly localized. The south-dipping NF conductive anomaly extends from surface outcrop to at least the Moho. The SLtz anomaly is north-dipping, extending from mid-crust through the Moho. In both cases there is some evidence for a modestly conductive layer (likely carbon) thrust to mid-lithospheric depths within the overriding terrane.",

            "abstract": "The standard techniques for chemical analysis of SOM often lack molecular detail necessary for characterization of the key classes of compounds in soil necessary for the development of predictive models. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) combined with tandem mass spectrometry (MSn) is the technique of choice for structural characterization of individual molecules in complex environmental mixtures because HR-MS enables chemical characterization of complex samples with a level of detail that is not attainable using other techniques. However, the power of this technique for characterization of SOM has been demonstrated only recently. Nanospray desorption ionization (nano-DESI) bypasses the traditional SOM extraction steps and provides the unique ability to record SOM mass spectra from small whole-soil samples. Nano-DESI benefits from a short sample preparation time (dozens of samples can be analyzed in a matter of hours by simply swapping the samples on the sample holder and running a pre-programmed positioning stage protocol), fast analysis time (useful signal results from only a few seconds of contact between the sample and the liquid bridge), and highly sensitive detection (less than 10 ng of organic mass is required for analysis). The nano-DESI method is minimally destructive. Only a small spot (typically < 1mm) is in contact with the solvent bridge during the analysis, and the rest of the sample is unaffected. Sampling over multiple spots on the same sample in effect replaces the need to extract a large amount of SOM from a soil sample in order to homogenize it, as done in conventional soil analysis. Another critical advantage of nano-DESI is that it makes it possible to observe organic components that cannot be easily detected using traditional ESI method (69). Specifically, by minimizing the residence time of analyte in the spray solvent, it enables detection and structural characterization of chemically labile molecules in environmental samples, which tend to slowly react with or decompose in typical ESI working solvents.",

POLDER / PARASOL registers spectral polarimetric characteristics of the reflected atmospheric radiation at up to 16 viewing directions over each observed pixel. Such observations have very high sensitivity to the variability of the properties of atmosphere and underlying surface and can not be adequately interpreted using look-up-table retrieval algorithms developed for analyzing mono-viewing intensity only observations traditionally used in atmospheric remote sensing. Therefore, a new enhanced retrieval algorithm GRASP (Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties) has been developed and applied for processing of PARASOL data. GRASP relies on highly optimized statistical fitting of observations and derives large number of unknowns for each observed pixel. The algorithm uses elaborated model of the atmosphere and fully accounts for all multiple interactions of scattered solar light with aerosol, gases and the underlying surface. All calculations are implemented during inversion and no look-up tables are used. The algorithm is very flexible in utilization of various types of a priori constraints on the retrieved characteristics and in parameterization of surface – atmosphere system. It is also optimized for high performance calculations.\nThe results of the PARASOL data processing will be presented with the emphasis on the discussion of transferability and adaptability of the developed retrieval concept for processing polarimetric observations of other planets. For example, flexibility and possible alternative in modeling properties of aerosol polydisperse mixtures, particle composition and shape, reflectance of surface, etc. will be discussed.",

The method is applied to a flux transfer event (FTE), which was encountered on 27 June 2007 by at least three (TH-C, TH-D, and TH-E) of the five THEMIS probes and was situated between two oppositely directed reconnection jets near the subsolar magnetopause under a southward interplanetary magnetic field condition. The recovered 3-D field indicates that a magnetic flux rope with a diameter of ~3000 km was embedded in the magnetopause. The FTE flux rope had a significantly 3-D structure, because the 3-D field reconstructed from the data from TH-C and TH-D (separated by ~390 km) better predicts magnetic field variations actually measured along the TH-E path than does the 2-D Grad-Shafranov reconstruction using the data from TH-C (which was closer to TH-E than TH-D and was at ~1000 km from TH-E). Such a 3-D nature suggests that reconnected field lines from the two reconnection sites are entangled in a complicated way through their interaction with each other. The generation process of the observed 3-D flux rope is discussed on the basis of the reconstruction results and the pitch-angle distribution of electrons observed in and around the FTE.\n",

            "abstract": "Dust plays an important role in the Earth system, and it usually displays largely spatial and temporal variations. It is necessary for us to reconstruct the past variations of dust in different regions to better understand the interactions between dust and environments. Ice core records can reveal the history of dust variations. In this paper, we used the Guliya, Dunde, Malan and Dasuopu ice cores from the Tibetan Plateau to study the spatial distribution, the seasonal variations and the secular trends of dust. It was found that the mean dust concentration was higher by one or two order of magnitudes in the Guliya and Dunde ice cores from the northern Tibetan Plateau than in the Dasuopu ice core from the southern Tibetan Plateau. During the year, the highest dust concentration occurs in the springtime in the northern Tibetan Plateau while in the non-monsoon season in the southern Tibetan Plateau. Over the last millennium, the Dasuopu ice core record shows that the 1270s~1380s and 1870s~1990s were the two epochs with high dust concentration. However, the Malan ice core from the northern Tibetan Plateau indicates that high dust concentration occurred in the 1130s~1550s and 1770s~1940s. Interestingly, climatic and environmental records of the ice cores from the Tibetan Plateau reflected that the correlation between dust concentration and air temperature was strongly positive in the southern Plateau while negative in the northern Plateau over the last millennium. This implies that climatic and environmental changes existed considerable differences in the different parts of the Plateau. Moreover, four Asian megadroughts occurred in 1638~1641, 1756~1758, 1790~1796 and 1876~1878, which caused more than tens millions people died, were revealed clearly by dust record in the Dasuopu ice core.",

Damage of the maritime structures by storm surges and wind waves induced by typhoon frequently occurs in the western prefectures, for example, Kumamoto Prefecture. The coastline in this prefecture is complex. It faces open and closed seas. The coastline is divided into 4 coastal regions in this paper. Each coast has different topographical characteristics.\nUsing data on the damage of maritime structures caused by typhoons during past 25 years from 1980 to 2004 and the path and central pressure of typhoons during past 110 years from 1902 to 2011, damage of 4 regions along the coast line of Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan for 13 groups of typhoon with different paths is estimated. All typhoons had passed through an area delineated by a latitude of 30° N and 35° N and at a longitude of 127° E and 132° E.\nThe improved Central Pressure (iCP) Method can be used to estimate the damage of maritime structures that will occur along the coast before typhoon strikes. The improved Central Pressure Method is developed based on the 25 years from 1980 to 2004. The estimation of the damage is done using the central pressure of typhoon at a latitude of 30° N. To develop the central pressure method considering the influence of global warming, the data of the central pressure of typhoons based on the 100 years more term is needed. The trend of the depression of central pressure due to the global warming is discussed using the central pressure based on the 110 years term typhoon data. Furthermore, the risk of each coastal regions in a future is estimated using the increasing or decreasing value of central pressure which is determined on this period data.",

            "abstract": "Geosciences are becoming increasingly data intensive, particularly in relation to sustainability problems, which are multi-dimensional, weakly structured and characterized by high levels of uncertainty. In the case of complex resource management problems, the challenge is to extract meaningful information from data and make sense of it. Simultaneously, scientific knowledge alone is insufficient to change practice. Creating tools, and group decision support processes for end users to interact with data are key challenges to transforming science-based information into actionable knowledge.\nThe ENCOMPASS project began as a multi-year case study in the Atacama Desert of Chile to design and implement a knowledge transfer model for energy-water-mining conflicts in the region. ENCOMPASS combines the use of cyberinfrastructure (CI), automated data collection, interactive interfaces for dynamic decision support, and participatory modelling to support social learning.\nA pilot version of the ENCOMPASS CI uses open source systems and serves as a structure to integrate and store multiple forms of data and knowledge, such as DEM, meteorological, water quality, geomicrobiological, energy demand, and groundwater models. In the case study, informatics and data fusion needs related to scientific uncertainty around deep groundwater flowpaths and energy-water connections. Users may upload data from field sites with handheld devices or desktops. Once uploaded, data assets are accessible for a variety of uses.\nTo address multi-attributed decision problems in the Atacama region a standalone application with touch-enabled interfaces was created to improve real-time interactions with datasets by groups. The tool was used to merge datasets from the ENCOMPASS CI to support exploration among alternatives and build shared understanding among stakeholders.\nTo date, the project has increased technical capacity among stakeholders, resulted in the creation of both for-profit and non-profit entities, enabled cross-sector collaboration with mining-indigenous stakeholders, and produced an interactive application for group decision support. ENCOMPASS leverages advances in computational tools to deliver data and models for group decision support applied to sustainability science problems.",

Using a website design with mobile applications in mind, NCA takes advantage of mobile learning technology which is revolutionizing how, when and where learning occurs. In an effort to maximize the \"teachable moments\" inherent in the assessment, a community of experts from the National Center for Science Education and the CLEAN Network, working under the auspices of the National Climate Assessment Network (NCAnet) Education Affinity Group, have developed a series of NCA Learning Pathways that match key NCA messages and resources with reviewed educational materials and trusted online information sources, thereby adding pedagogical depth to the assessment. The NCA Learning Pathways, which focus on the regional chapters of the report, are designed make climate change science more local, human, relevant and, if properly framed by educators and communicators, hopeful for learners. This paper touches on the challenges and opportunities of infusing climate education, communications and outreach into curriculum and society, and details the development and content of NCA Learning Pathways, which are available online through NOAA's Climate.gov website: http://www.climate.gov/teaching",

While most existing knowledge on pesticides degradation refers to processes within bulk soil and water, applied pesticides may remain on treated surfaces (and on airborn particles) for long duration, exposed to atmospheric oxidants and solar radiation. The resulting photo-oxidation processes may have significant effect on their fate, especially in semiarid regions where pesticide applications take place during the long dry season and targeted irrigation is common.\nHere we present our studies on heterogeneous photo-oxidation of few commonly used pesticides (e.g., cypermethrin, methyl parathion, and chlorpyrifos), using novel laboratory setups enabling simultaneous monitoring of both phases. Experiments focused on kinetics, quantum yields, and identification of gaseous and condensed products. In addition, the reactivity of the selected pesticides was investigated as a function of their matrix (analytical vs. commercial formula), their phase (thin film vs. airborne aerosols), and the substrate they are sorbed on (leaf, soil, and glass).\nComplimentarily to these laboratory studies, field measurements of selected pesticides concentrations in few streams in northern Israel during the first rain events were also conducted and showed the important role of surface processes on these pesticides fate and transport in semi-arid climate.",

            "abstract": "A large body of work has shown, using both in-situ data and remote sensing products, that there is a negative correlation between Sahelian rainfall and African dust outbreaks that traverse the tropical Atlantic. One theory for this relationship is that drying out of the Sahel results in the activation of new dust sources. However, there is no direct evidence to support this theory, nor has any modeling study conclusively shown this to be the case. Another theory is that changes in the regional circulation associated with wet and dry periods of the Sahel results in this inverse proportionality between dust and rainfall. A new modeling study has provided compelling evidence to show that this latter theory may be closer to the truth. Here we show that the recent trends in dust from western Africa can be explained by examining changes in surface winds over source regions near the Air, Adrar, and Ouaddai mountains, and the Bodélé depression. Our analysis shows that the recent trends in dust are due to a slow down of the surface winds over the Air and Adrar source regions, and that this is a result of the simultaneous intensification of the low-level circulation of the Sahara Heat Low. Thus, coupling of Sahel rainfall and the Sahara Heat Low results in the correlation between dust and Sahel drought. Furthermore, we estimate future changes in dust from climate models via analysis of modeled changes in wind speeds over these regions. We find that one model in the Fifth Phase Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, the GFDL-CM3, accurately represents historical changes in wind speeds over these key source regions, and that in future scenarios this model shows a large and statistically significant increase in surface windspeeds over the Bodélé, suggesting an increase in African dust emission throughout the 21st Century.",

            "abstract": "The Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012 includes an instrument suite consisting of a laser-induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) and a remote micro-imager (RMI). The LIBS is effectively the first Mars microprobe, as its interrogation region is 0.35-0.5 mm in diameter; it can access targets up to 7 m from the rover. The LIBS pulsed laser excites atoms and ions from the target, creating a plasma that emits light at characteristic wavelengths. When calibrated, LIBS provides quantitative elemental abundances. The elements observed on Mars include H, Li, O, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Cl, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zn, Rb, Sr, Ba. The first few laser shots clear the surface of dust, allowing unobscured analyses of the targets. Within the first two years of operation ChemCam has returned > 150,000 spectra from > 4,000 locations along the rover traverse. The RMI is the highest resolution (0.04 mrad) remote imager on the rover and provides context before/after images of the LIBS targets as well as long-distance stand-alone imagery.\nThe ChemCam LIBS instrument concept was developed based on laboratory LIBS instrumentation. For terrestrial field work ChemCam’s design with its unshielded laser beam is an eye safety hazard. However, hand-held devices with closed laser-beam designs have been developed. In order to provide a realistic field test prior to the launch of the rover the ChemCam team fielded a backpack LIBS system featuring a shielded laser beam. The system was calibrated using the same 66 geological standards used by the ChemCam instrument prior to flight. During the field test, data was sent remotely to a team back at Los Alamos, effectively imitating operations on Mars and data analysis on the ground. The ground team successfully reported accurate results, identifying the site as rich in kaolinite clay soils.",

            "abstract": "Antarctic sea ice distribution, a canary in the coal mine for climate change in the Southern Hemisphere, is controlled by the marginal ice zone (MIZ). The MIZ is the dynamic outer part of the sea-ice zone, where it interacts with the high-energy open ocean and is strongly affected by waves and storms. As an interface between ocean and atmosphere with extreme vertical and horizontal temperature gradients and large variations in mechanical properties, the MIZ is a complex system that evolves with, and impacts upon, the advancing/receding ice edge. More than a zone, it is a migratory transition in 'phase space' that biannually passes across the entire Antarctic SIZ. During the advance phase of sea-ice seasonality, and under freezing conditions, wave-induced pancake-ice formation can lead to rapid ice-edge advance. During the retreat phase, the dynamic break-up and modification of sea ice by passing storms, winds and waves greatly modifies the floe-size distribution within the MIZ, to create smaller floes that melt more rapidly and accelerate sea-ice retreat as spring progresses.\nInspired by the current Arctic MIZ efforts, new fieldwork is proposed to resolve the key characteristics of the Antarctic MIZ and the processes controlling its extent. Combining new autonomous observation technology with ship-based techniques, integrated experiments are being designed to advance our understanding of the MIZ and its role in driving seasonal sea ice advance and retreat around Antarctica. The proposed project provides a unique opportunity to develop an observational, analytical, and science-policy framework for coordinated monitoring of sea ice in both the northern and southern hemispheres, with implications for forecasting, monitoring, and prediction that are essential with increasingly dynamic and variable polar climate systems.",

            "abstract": "The possible detection of a water vapour plume on Europa [1] suggests resemblances to Enceladus, a cryovolcanically active satellite [2]. How does this activity work, and what lesson does Enceladus have for plumes on Europa?\nThe inferred vapour column densities of the Europa [1] and Enceladus [3] plumes are similar, but the inferred velocity and mass flux of the former are higher.\nAt Enceladus, the inferred plume strength is modulated by its orbital position [4,5], suggesting that tides opening and closing cracks control the eruption behaviour [6,7]. An additional source of stress potentially driving eruptions is the effect of slow freezing of the ice shell above\n[7,8]. The original detection of the Europa plume was close to apocentre, when polar fractures are expected to be in tension [1]. Follow-up observations at the same orbital phase did not detect a plume [9], although the Galileo E12 magnetometer data may provide evidence for an earlier plume [Khurana, pers. comm.]. One possible explanation for the plume's disappearance is that longer-period tidal effects are playing a role; there are hints of similar secular changes in the Enceladus data [4,5]. Another is that detectability of the Europa plume\nin the aurora observations also depends on variations in electron density (which affects the UV emission flux) [9]. Or it may simply be that eruptive activity on Europa is highly time-variable, as on Io.\nAt Enceladus, the plume scale height is independent of orbital position and plume brightness [5]. This suggests that the vapour velocity does not depend on crack width, consistent with supersonic flow through a near-surface throat. The large scale height inferred for the Europa plume likewise suggests supersonic behaviour. Continuous fallback of solid plume material at Enceladus affects both the colour [10] and surface texture [2] of near-polar regions. Less frequent plume activity would produce subtler effects; whether the sparse available imagery at Europa [11] contains any similar evidence is yet to be determined. Forthcoming Hubble observations may also provide additional constraints.\n[1] Roth et al. 2012 [2] Porco et al. 2006 [3] Hansen et al. 2011 [4] Hedman et al. 2013 [5] Nimmo et al. 2014 [6] Hurford et al. 2007 [7] Porco et al. 2014 [8] Manga and Wang 2007 [9] Roth et al., submitted [10] Schenk et al. 2011.

            "abstract": "The spatial arrangement of landscape elements into nonrandom patches reflects internal dynamics and external forcing and is itself a critical component of a system’s internal dynamics. Metrics such as connectivity that quantify the configuration of landscape elements thus have the potential to indicate a system’s key dynamics as well as provide understanding of how that system might respond to changes in hydrologic inputs or other forcing. Consequently, connectivity metrics for hydrologic systems may also advance understanding of large-scale hydroecologic and geomorphic feedback processes. Typically, studies have focused on achieving local-scale understanding of the effects of roughness elements or vegetation patches on flow, but understanding of the effects of landscape-scale configurations of channel networks and vegetation patches on water and sediment throughput remains a research frontier and is a prime focus of this study.\nIn systems forced by gradient-flux dynamics, directional measures of connectivity yield the most insight and provide the most information for characterizing and comparing landscapes. For example, the graph theory-based Directional Connectivity Index has shown sensitivity in the Everglades to specific trajectories of landscape evolution and is a first responder to events triggering catastrophic shifts in landscape state. On hillslopes directional connectivity of channel networks provides a measure of slope coherence and new insight into erosional feedbacks. When used in combination with other metrics such as fractal dimension and anisotropy, directional connectivity is also a powerful predictor of hydrologic fluxes. Modifying an approach initially developed for modeling groundwater fluxes, we developed an analytical spatial averaging scheme for predicting hydrologic fluxes through heterogeneously rough surface-water landscapes. Analysis of the equation’s partial derivatives suggests that hydrologic fluxes exhibit the highest sensitivity to the Directional Connectivity Index, followed by fractal dimension and finally by the aerial coverage of the roughness elements.",

            "abstract": "Ecogeomorphology is the understanding of the signature of life on landforms. The field has advanced primarily on the basis of studies of physical-biological feedbacks between vegetation, flow, and sediment transport. However, biogeochemistry also has the potential to exert strong feedback on life and landforms. This potential is particularly high in tropical and subtropical regions, where vegetation is often phosphorus (P)-limited. Aquatic landscapes are essentially closed systems for P—in contrast to nitrogen—and the transport of P primarily in particulate form can establish a tight feedback between biogeochemical and geomorphic processes in these regions. Here we examine mechanisms that can contribute to spatial patterning, or patchiness, in nutrient distributions and vegetated landforms.\nWe evaluated hypotheses for evapotranspiration focusing, differential hydrologic exchange, and particulate nutrient redistribution mechanisms to explain spatial patterns of P retention and function of the Everglades. Based on field measurements in sloughs and on slightly higher and more densely vegetated ridges and field-grounded mechanistic models, we quantified P fluxes attributable to the three mechanisms. Findings suggest that evapotranspiration focusing is not a driver of Everglades nutrient retention nor of ridge and slough patterning. Instead, differential hydrologic exchange, driven by different periods of groundwater-surface water connectivity across topographic elements, is the primary cause of elevated P concentrations on ridges and can completely explain interpatch differences in long-term P accumulation rates. With historical flow velocities, which were an order of magnitude higher than at present, particulate P redistribution would have further increased the interpatch difference in long-term P retention rates nearly twofold, with potential consequences for landscape pattern development. In conclusion, differential hydrologic exchange and particulate nutrient redistribution are the dominant drivers of nutrient patchiness in the Everglades and are hypothesized to be important in P-limited river and floodplain corridors globally.",

The Student Dust Counter onboard the New Horizons Mission to Pluto continues makes measurements since 2006, cutting across the entire solar system. These measurements provide an opportunity to test our models about our own the dust disk, and compare it to dust disks around other stars. The Pluto encounter will happen in the summer of 2015, the mission will carry on beyond Pluto, and continue to make dust observations in the Kuiper belt.\nThe Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) onboard the Cassini mission continues to make observations since 2004, mapping the dust distributions near Saturn. CDA is also capable to identify the chemical composition of the impacting particles, clearly identifying water ice as the composition of particles in Saturn’s E-ring. One of its most exciting discoveries to date is the identification of other minor constituents of the particles in addition to water ice, resulting in the unambiguous conclusion about the existence of a liquid ocean underneath the ice crust of Enceladus.\nThe Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) in orbit about the moon onboard the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explore (LADEE) mission. LDEX maps the lunar dust exosphere that is sustained by the continual bombardment of the lunar surface by interplanetary dust particles.\nThis talk will report on the recent observation by all three instruments: SDC, CDA and LDEX, and discuss how the measurements can be used to improve our theoretical models about the dust environment in the Kuiper belt, at Saturn, and near the Moon, respectively. We will also discuss the intimate relationships between these measurements, and argue that the entire body of these observations, and measurements made by previous dust instruments can be used to learn about the sources, sinks, and transport of dust in the solar system.\nThis work was supported by NASA’s New Horizons, Cassini, and LADEE missions, and by the SSERVI Institute for Modeling Plasmas, Atmospheres, and Cosmic Dust (IMPACT).",

            "abstract": "Changes in CO2 and CH4 emissions represent one of the most significant consequences of drastic climate change in the Arctic, by way of thawing permafrost, a deepened active layer, and decline of thermokarst lakes in the Arctic. This study conducted flux-measurements of CO2 and CH4, as well as environmental factors such as temperature, moisture, and thaw depth, as part of a water table manipulation experiment in the Arctic coastal plain tundra of Barrow, Alaska during autumn. The manipulation treatment consisted of draining, controlling, and flooding treated sections by adjusting standing water. Inundation increased CH4 emission by a factor of 4.3 compared to non-flooded sections. This may be due to the decomposition of organic matter under a limited oxygen environment by saturated standing water. On the other hand, CO2 emission in the dry section was 3.9-fold higher than in others. CH4 emission tends to increase with deeper thaw depth, which strongly depends on the water table; however, CO2 emission is not related to thaw depth. Quotients of global warming potential (GWPCO2) (dry/control) and GWPCH4 (wet/control) increased by 464 and 148 %, respectively, and GWPCH4 (dry/control) declined by 66 %. This suggests that CO2 emission in a drained section is enhanced by soil and ecosystem respiration, and CH4 emission in a flooded area is likely stimulated under an anoxic environment by inundated standing water. The findings of this manipulation experiment during the autumn period demonstrate the different production processes of CO2 and CH4, as well as different global warming potentials, coupled with change in thaw depth. Thus the outcomes imply that the expansion of tundra lakes leads the enhancement of CH4 release, and the disappearance of the lakes causes the stimulated CO2 production in response to the Arctic climate change.",

            "abstract": "Speleothem fabrics record processes that influence the way geochemical proxy data are encoded in speleothems, yet, there has been little advance in the use of fabrics as a complement to palaeo-proxy datasets since the fabric classification proposed by us in 2010. The systematic use of fabrics documentation in speleothem science has been limited by the absence of a comprehensive, numerical system that would allow constructing fabric time series comparable with the widely used geochemical time series. Documentation of speleothem fabrics is fundamental for a robust interpretation of speleothem time series where stable isotopes and trace elements are used as proxy, because fabrics highlight depositional as well as post-depositional processes whose understanding complements reconstructions based on geochemistry.\nHere we propose a logic system allowing transformation of microscope observations into numbers tied to acronyms that specify each fabric type and subtype. The rationale for ascribing progressive numbers to fabrics is based on the most up-to-date growth models. In this conceptual framework, the progression reflects hydrological conditions, bio-mediation and diagenesis. The lowest numbers are given to calcite fabrics formed at relatively constant drip rates: the columnar types (compact and open). Higher numbers are ascribed to columnar fabrics characterized by presence of impurities that cause elongation or lattice distortion (Elongated, Fascicular Optic and Radiaxial calcites). The sequence progresses with the dendritic fabrics, followed by micrite (M), which has been observed in association with microbial films. Microsparite (Ms) and mosaic calcite (Mc) have the highest numbers, being considered as diagenetic. Acronyms and subfixes are intended to become universally acknowledged. Thus, fabrics can be plotted vs. age to yield time series, where numbers are replaced by the acronyms. This will result in a visual representation of climate- or environmental-related parameters underpinning speleothem crystal growth. The Fabric log thus becomes a useful tool providing robustness to the geochemical data or test the overall utility of the speleothem record.",

            "abstract": "Process-based numerical models for coastal waves, water levels, and sediment transport are initialized with digital elevation models (DEM) constructed by interpolating and merging bathymetric and topographic elevation data. These gridded surfaces must seamlessly span the land-water interface and may cover large regions where the individual raw data sources are collected at widely different spatial and temporal resolutions. In addition, the datasets are collected from different instrument platforms with varying accuracy and may or may not overlap in coverage. The lack of available tools and difficulties in constructing these DEMs lead scientists to 1) rely on previously merged, outdated, or over-smoothed DEMs; 2) discard more recent data that covers only a portion of the DEM domain; and 3) use inconsistent methodologies to generate DEMs.\nThe objective of this work is to address the immediate need of integrating land and water-based elevation data sources and streamline the generation of a seamless data surface that spans the terrestrial-marine boundary. To achieve this, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is developing a web processing service to format and initialize geoprocessing tasks designed to create coastal DEMs. The web processing service is maintained within the USGS ScienceBase data management system and has an associated user interface. Through the map-based interface, users define a geographic region that identifies the bounds of the desired DEM and a time period of interest. This initiates a query for elevation datasets within federal science agency data repositories. A geoprocessing service is then triggered to interpolate, merge, and smooth the data sources creating a DEM based on user-defined configuration parameters. Uncertainty and error estimates for the DEM are also returned by the geoprocessing service. Upon completion, the information management platform provides access to the final gridded data derivative and saves the configuration parameters for future reference. The resulting products and tools developed here could be adapted to future data sources and projects beyond the coastal environment.",

The lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of olivine and chlorite was determined using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD)/scanning electron microscope. A sample with abundant garnet showed [100] axes of olivine aligned subparallel to lineation, and [010] axes aligned subnormal to foliation: A-type LPO. Samples rich in chlorite showed different olivine LPOs. Two samples showed [001] axes aligned subparallel to lineation, and [010] axes aligned subnormal to foliation: B-type LPO. Two other samples showed [100] axes aligned subparallel to lineation, and [001] axes aligned subnormal to foliation: E-type LPO. Chlorite showed a strong LPO characterized by [001] axes aligned subnormal to foliation with a weak girdle subnormal to lineation. FTIR spectroscopy of the specimens revealed that the olivines with A-type LPO contain a small amount (170 ppm H/Si) of water. In contrast, the olivines with B-type LPOs contain a large amount (340 ppm H/Si) of water.\nThe seismic anisotropy of the olivine and chlorite was calculated. Olivine showed Vp anisotropy of up to 3.8% and a maximum Vs anisotropy of up to 2.7%. However, the chlorite showed a much stronger Vp anisotropy, up to 21.1% and a maximum Vs anisotropy of up to 31.7%. A sample with a mixture of 25% of olivine and 75% of chlorite can produce a Vp anisotropy of 14.2% and a maximum Vs anisotropy of 22.9%. Because chlorite has a wide stability field at high pressure and high temperature in subduction zone, the strong LPO of chlorite can be a source of the observed trench-normal or trench-parallel seismic anisotropy in the mantle wedge as well as in subducting slabs depending on the dipping angle of slab in a subduction zone where chlorite is stable.",

            "abstract": "This study analyzes storm-triggered landslides in the US Appalachians, in the current geological setting. Concave valleys that favor the convergence of surface runoff are the primary locales for landslides. If the slopes are weathered to the same degree and have the same vegetation coverage, slope orientation (azimuthal) is not critical for slope stability. However, it is found that for the region south of the Black Mountains (North Carolina), north-facing slopes are more prone to slide, because the northern slopes usually are grass slopes for the regions not limited by annual precipitation (water availability). For the slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountains, south facing slopes are more prone to slide. Deforestation and topsoil erosion are critical contributors to the massive sizes of the debris flows. Gravity measurements over the past decade reveal that geological conditions, the chute system and underground cracks over the region are stable, and sliding material is plentiful. Future changes in storm-triggered landslide frequency are primarily controlled by changes in extreme precipitation. Thus, a series of ensemble climate model experiments is carried out of possible changes in future extreme precipitation events, using the WRF model forced by temperature perturbations. The focus is the impact on storm-triggered landslides, and over 50 locations are identified as prone to future landslides. In a future warmer climate, more severe extreme precipitation events are projected because of increased vapor content and more frequent passage of tropical cyclone remnants. There also is a likely shift of tropical cyclone tracks and associated extreme precipitation, and the Appalachians scarps cluster center is expected to move westward. The remote sensing way of detecting unstable regions are applicable to other regions of interest. We further examine the following regions (except the Fuji Mount) recently (since 1900) experienced volcanic eruption: Pelee, Agung, Elchichon, Pinatubo, St. Helens, and Fuji mountains. The state of the surface chute system and underground chanelling system are estimated and for the region of accelerating underground water gains, possible future unstable regions are projected.",

Furthermore, the ECSs are downwind of the Asian continental outflow in spring and winter driven by the East Asian monsoon. The sources of 16 USEPA priority PAHs in strategically selected surface sediment samples from the ECSs were apportioned using positive matrix factorization model, and the input pathways of PAHs were also revealed in the regions. Four sources were identified: petroleum residue, vehicular emissions, coal combustion and biomass burning. Petroleum residue was the dominant contributor of PAHs in the coast of the Bohai Bay probably due to Haihe River runoff, oil leakage from ships and offshore oil fields. The PAHs in sediments of the coastal East China Sea were mainly sourced from the Yangtze River discharge into the sea. The combined results of PMF, PCA and composition of PAHs suggest that the atmospheric deposition is the dominate input of PAHs for the open seas of Bohai Sea, East China Sea and Yellow Sea; while river input is the major pathway of PAHs in the estuarine and neighborhood coastal areas. The demographic and economic conditions around the ECSs have profound influence on the origins of the land-based PAHs in the sediments of the open seas.",

            "abstract": "Long-term satellite-derived vegetation biophysical products like the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) are widely popular in the scientific research community for monitoring ecosystem health and vegetation dynamics as well as for a number of climate-ecosystem models that use LAI/FPAR as an input. The availability of continuous time series data from heritage sensors like the MODIS, AVHRR, SPOT, Landsat and MISR have allowed a number of research teams to generate biophysical products from these sensors using a wide variety of physical and emperical modeling techniques. However, the consistency and the continuity in the generated products from these various sensors have always been a concern for application scientists. Deriving consistent products require sophisticated algorithm formulation that takes into account the differences in sensor characteristics like spectral response function, field of view, spatial resolution and view/azimuth angle, to name a few. There have been recent advances in algorithms that take into account these differences in order to create a consistent long-term data. Another important advancement has been the generation of hybrid products that use information from two different sensors to drive a physical model. This paper presents a treatise on the existing long-term biophysical products and their usability in terms of global change research and applications that may range from a watershed level to climate model simulations. In addition, the paper will present (a) state-of-the-art LAI/FPAR products that are being generated from the Landsat sensor at a continental scale and its application to the NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) and, (b) some of the recent efforts on extending the physical algorithm to next generation satellite sensor systems like the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2.",

However, the ECS also depends on the radiative forcing and this has been overlooked as a possible source of uncertainty. This paper illustrates how rapid adjustments to forcing affect the spread of ECS in CMIP5 models. Also, how rapid adjustments can help understand robust aspects of response, including regional precipitation changes.",

            "abstract": "Most episodes of ocean acidification (OA) in Earth’s past were either too slow or too minor to provide useful lessons for understanding the present. The end-Cretaceous event (66 Mya) is special in this sense, both because of its rapid onset and also because many calcifying species (including 100% of ammonites and >95% of calcareous nannoplankton and planktonic foraminifera) went extinct at this time. We used box models of the ocean carbon cycle to evaluate whether impact-generated OA could feasibly have been responsible for the calcifier mass extinctions. We simulated several proposed consequences of the asteroid impact: (1) vaporisation of gypsum (CaSO4) and carbonate (CaCO3) rocks at the point of impact, producing sulphuric acid and CO2 respectively; (2) generation of NOx by the impact pressure wave and other sources, producing nitric acid; (3) release of CO2 from wildfires, biomass decay and disinterring of fossil organic carbon and hydrocarbons; and (4) ocean stirring leading to introduction into the surface layer of deep water with elevated CO2. We simulated additions over: (A) a few years (e-folding time of 6 months), and also (B) a few days (e-folding time of 10 hours) for SO4 and NOx, as recently proposed by Ohno et al (2014. Nature Geoscience, 7:279-282). Sulphuric acid as a consequence of gypsum vaporisation was found to be the most important acidifying process. Results will also be presented of the amounts of SO4 required to make the surface ocean become extremely undersaturated (Ωcalcite<0.5) for different e-folding times and combinations of processes. These will be compared to estimates in the literature of how much SO4 was actually released.",

            "abstract": "In studying coupled natural-human systems, most modeling efforts focus on humans and the natural resources. In reality, however, humans rarely interact with these resources directly; the relationships between humans and resources are mediated by infrastructures. In sociohydrological systems, these include, for example, dams and irrigation canals. These infrastructures have important characteristics such as threshold behavior and a separate entity/organization tasked with maintaining them. These characteristics influence social dynamics within the system, which in turn determines the state of infrastructure and water usage, thereby exerting feedbacks onto the hydrological processes. Infrastructure is thus a necessary ingredient for modeling co-evolution of human and water in sociohydrological systems. A conceptual framework to address this gap has been proposed by Anderies, Janssen, and Ostrom (2004). Here we develop a model to operationalize the framework and report some preliminary results. Simple in its setup, the model highlights the structure of the social dilemmas and how it affects the system’s sustainability. The model also offers a platform to explore how the system’s sustainability may respond to external shocks from globalization and global climate change.",

The 2011 Iwaki earthquake occurred one month after the 2011 Mw 9.0 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tohoku (March 11, 2011; hereafter, 2011 Tohoku earthquake) (Ozawa et al., 2011; Simons et al., 2011). The 2011 Iwaki earthquake was followed by simultaneous slips of multi faults (the Itozawa fault and the Yunodake fault) (e.g. Toda and Tsutsumi, 2013). We examine the activity of the Itozawa fault and Yunodake fault and the mechanical preparation of the 2011 Iwaki earthquake from the temporal change of the stress state before and after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. Furthermore, we quantitatively evaluate the role of crustal fluid beneath the faults and its supply mechanisms when the 2011 Iwaki earthquake occurred. We revealed that the generation of the slip on the Itozawa fault and simultaneous activity of faults cannot be occurred under the state of stress before the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, even though the both the state of stress is normal-faulting stress regimes before and after 2011 Tohoku earthquake. We show the importance of excess fluid pressure on the 2011 Iwaki earthquake, and we estimated the magnitude of excess fluid pressure ~30 MPa and ~20 MPa on the Itozawa and Yunodake fault respectively. We also show that the state of stress after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake favorably change the permeability of the Itozawa fault to be supplied the crustal fluid beneath the fault.

To meet this demand, not only mining activities but recently also the recovery of these elements from industrial waste is in the focus of research. It has been shown that the application of extracting solutions with pH values lower than 4 lead to an economically feasible recovery of industrially precious metals. This abiotic extraction efficiency can potentially be increased by using microorganisms capable of dissolving more stable minerals at low pH.\nIn collaboration with industry, a waste incineration plant, and governmental authorities, we investigate the extraction and recovery of strategically important metals and Rare Earth Elements from industrial waste. We optimize the (bio)-geochemical conditions for the extraction of these elements. To this end, a variety of microorganisms are evaluated for efficient metal extraction. We focus on known laboratory cultures capable of oxidizing and reducing Fe minerals and S compounds. Additionally, unknown microbial communities able to increase the efficiency of precious metal extraction from the industrial waste are enriched from environments with comparable geochemical conditions found in the extraction solutions.",

            "abstract": "In the last years it has emphatically suggested that, when dealing with water management and hydrological extremes, stationarity is no longer a proper assumption. Hence, it was proposed that hydrological processes should be treated as nonstationary. Two main reasons contributed to this perception. First, the climate models project a future hydroclimate that will be different from the current one. Second, as streamflow record become longer, they indicate the presence of upward or downward trends. However, till now hydroclimatic projections made in the recent past have not been verified. At the same time, evidence from quite longer records, instrumental or proxy, suggest that local trends are omnipresent but not monotonic; rather at some time upward trends turn to downward ones and vice versa. These observations suggest that improvident dismiss of stationarity and adoption of nonstationary descriptions based either on climate model outputs or observed trends may entail risks. The risks stem from the facts that the future can be different from what was deterministically projected, that deterministic projections are associated with an illusion of decreased uncertainty, as well as that nonstationary models fitted on observed data may have lower predictive capacity than simpler stationary ones. In most of the cases, what is actually needed is to revisit the concept of stationarity and try to apply it carefully, making it consistent with the presence of local trends, possibly incorporating information from deterministic predictions, whenever these prove to be reliable, and estimating the total predictive uncertainty. In a few cases nonstationarity is justified but the conditions justifying it should be carefully assessed.",

            "abstract": "The Koyna region, located in the ~65 Ma old Deccan Traps of India, is globally the most prominent site of artificial water reservoir triggered earthquakes (RTS). Triggered earthquakes are occurring since impoundment of the Koyna Dam in1962 including M 6.3 December 10, 1967; 22 M>5, and thousands of smaller earthquakes. Filling of the nearby Warna Reservoir gave a further impetus to triggered earthquakes. The entire earthquake activity is limited to an area of about 20 km x 30 km, with most focal depths being within 6 km. There is no other earthquakes source within 50 km of the Koyna Dam. An ICDP Workshop held at Hyderabad and Koyna in March 2011 found Koyna to be the most suitable site to investigate RTS through deep drilling. A preparatory phase of investigations was recommended. Studies carried out since 2011 in the preparatory phase were recently reviewed in the second ICDP Workshop held at Koyna from May 16 to 18, 2014. Results of detailed airborne magnetic and gravity-gradient surveys, MT surveys, drilling of 6 boreholes going to depths of ~ 1500 m and logging, heat flow measurements, seismological investigations including the deployment of two borehole seismometers, and LiDAR surveys were reviewed. Significant results include absence of sediments below the basalt cover, the thickness of the basalt column and its relation with the surface elevation, and almost flat topography of the basement. The temperatures at the depth of 5 km would be around 130 to 150 degrees Celsius, in confirmation of earlier estimates. To achieve desired accuracies of a few tens of meters in focal parameters, seismometers need to be placed below the basalt cover. This has led to the plan of putting eight borehole seismometers with good azimuthal coverage around the earthquake zone. Two of them have been already in operation and six more are likely to be installed in the months to come. The future plan of work include:\n  Submitting a proposal to ICDP for the main boreholes by Jan 15, 2015. Details need to be worked out.\nDrilling two 3 km deep boreholes by summer of 2015 (leap-frog with two rigs).\nConcurrent planning of deep borehole(s), firming the specifications by the summer of 2015 and drilling through October 2015 through December 2017.\nPlan for an international meeting and visit to Koyna in 2017.\n  ",

Some methods (e.g. TDR) have become standard, off-the-shelf, components of hydrogeologic field studies. Others (e.g. GPR, TEM, and ERT) are being used widely in reconnaissance-level studies. There is also increasing appreciation of the advantages available through leveraging multiple geophysical methods and standard hydrogeologic measurements and through joint and coupled hydrogeophysical inversion. However, to date, there have been very few efforts to develop approaches to determine which geophysical methods (if any) may be suitable for a given hydrologic investigation and even fewer attempts to optimize the integration of geophysics. I will discuss why coupled hydrogeophysical analysis should form the basis for developing logical, quantitative approaches to the design of hydrogeophysical investigations.

            "abstract": "Temporal variations in the Mascarene High (MH), defined by the sea level pressure (SLP) maximum within a region of [40°–120°E, 50°–10°S] in austral summer (November–January), were investigated using NCEP–NCAR reanalysis dataset. The MH intensity has interannual variations, which is associated with the Southern Annular Mode. The MH longitudinal position shows a longer timescale of 5–10 years compared to the MH intensity. It appears to be independent of the MH intensity variation because of no significant correlation between the MH intensity and longitudinal position. The MH longitudinal movement is caused by a combination of SLP variations in the eastern South Indian Ocean (ESIO) and western South Indian Ocean (WSIO). Pressure variations in the ESIO region are confined from the sea surface to the mid-troposphere, and are associated with the Matsuno­-Gill response due to El Niño-Southern Oscillation. The pressure variations in the WSIO region, characterized by a quasi-barotropic structure throughout the troposphere, are related to the meridional movement of storm track.\nWe examine the influence of MH variations on sea surface temperature (SST) field. The MH intensity variations form a northeast-southwest dipole pattern, which resembles the Indian Ocean Subtropical Dipole (IOSD) pattern. In addition, the MH longitudinal shifts also show the dipole pattern, but this is shifted 10° westward in longitude compared with that associated with the MH intensity. The correlation between the MH variations and IOSD index show significant values (0.42 for intensity and ­−0.58 for longitudinal position). Therefore, it is suggested that both the changes in the MH intensity and longitudinal position cause the IOSD.",

            "abstract": "“Watershed development” has been the dominant paradigm for water management in India for the last two decades. Current spending on watershed development programmes rivals spending on large dams. In practice, watershed development involves a range of soil and water conservation measures including building check dams, gully plugs, contour bunds etc. Despite their dominance in water management paradigms, relatively little empirical data exists on these structures. Importantly, even though the benefits of individual watershed structures are recognized, the cumulative impact of building hundreds of such structures on hydrologic partitioning of a watershed remains unknown.\nWe investigated the role of check dams in two small milli-watersheds in the Arkavathy River basin in South India. We conducted a comprehensive census of all check dams in the two milli-watersheds with a total area of 26 sq km. 40 check dams (representing a density of 1.35/sq km of watershed area) were geotagged, photographed, measured and their condition was recorded.\nWe then selected twelve check dams and monitored the water stored using capacitance sensors. We also set up Automatic Weather Stations in each watershed. Inflows, evaporation and infiltration were calculated at each site to evaluate how check dams alter hydrologic partitioning in the watershed as a whole.",

An unstructured-grid SUNTANS (Stanford Unstructured Nonhydrostatic Terrain-following Adaptive Navier-Stokes Simulator) model is employed to perform three-dimensional simulations of flow in Singapore coastal waters. The unstructured-grid has an average resolution of 50 – 100 m around Singapore and in areas close to the shoreline, while a coarse grid resolution is employed in the open waters. The model is tidally forced at the three open boundaries, located to the west, south and east of Singapore, using the 8 main tidal constituents as derived from the OSU Tidal Prediction Software (OTPS). A detailed calibration is performed, and the model-predicted water levels and currents compare well with observed data throughout the model domain. We examine the individual and combined effects of tidal and wind forcing by performing simulations with (1) tides only, (2) winds only and (3) both tides and wind. The exchange through Singapore Strait is investigated by computing volume fluxes and transport pathways at four transects, namely the Malacca Strait, Java Sea, South China Sea and Singapore transects. The transport pathways are computed by releasing particles on each side of the transects, and identifying the spatial distribution of the particles over one tidal cycle. Our results show that tidal forcing is predominant in Singapore Strait, and wind forcing is an important mechanism during the monsoon season. The residual effects, attributed to nonlinear interactions between tidal and wind forcing, is dominant during the inter-monsoon season.",

            "abstract": "Microstructures significantly influence the rheological properties of rocks and are important to understand geodynamical processes such as the descent of slabs. For example, grain size reductions during phase transitions in the dominant upper mantle constituent, olivine, to its high-pressure polymorphs wadsleyite and ringwoodite have been related to the stagnation of slabs in the transition zone. Detailed studies of the microstructure development, underlying transformation mechanism and transformation kinetics are needed in order to assess the effects of these phase transformations on the rheological properties of the slab material and to build reliable models of mantle flow and slab subduction behaviors. So far, the experimental studies dedicated to this theme were mostly based on ex situ techniques (e.g. electron microscopy of quenched products).\nIn this contribution, we present detailed results form in situ single-grain analysis on the evolution of microstructures during the succession of phase transitions in Mg2SiO4*H2O. We used a new approach based on in situ three dimensional-X-ray diffraction (3D-XRD) experiments performed up to 30 GPa and 1100 K using a resistively heated diamond anvil cell at the beam lines ID11 and ID27 of the ESRF. The individual orientations, crystallographic parameters and growth rates of numerous grains inside a polycrystalline sample have been monitored in situ at the high pressure and temperature conditions and while the material was transforming. These parameters have been used to infer grain size distributions, textural relations between parent and newly formed phase and their evolution with ongoing transformation, as well as changing PT conditions and transformation kinetics. This original dataset allows drawing a refined picture of phase transitions in the most abundant minerals of the Earth’s upper mantle, shed new light on the origin of seismic anomalies at transition zone depth and provide new grounds for complex simulations of geodynamical processes in the Earth’s mantle.",

            "abstract": "Two issues are often recognized as main risk drivers for carbon storage projects. The first is the possibility of pressure-induced slip of pre-existing faults, which can lead to breaching of seals to CO2 storage reservoirs. Although the mechanics of induced seismicity are well known, the characteristics of such slip events are poorly constrained and significant questions remain. The second is the potential impact of leaking CO2 on the quality of shallow potable groundwater. While several studies have been conducted using laboratory tests, natural analogues, and numerical models to evaluate the water quality changes induced by elevated CO2 concentrations, predictive understanding of these coupled processes remains limited in realistic field settings.\nWe discuss in this invited contribution two controlled-release field experiments targeting remaining science gaps associated with induced seismicity and groundwater chemistry. The first experiment is a planned active fault slip experiment conducted in an underground research laboratory (URL) in a hardened shale formation that serves as a caprock analog. The critically stressed fault will be perturbed by the injection of fluid under pressure to simulate the influence of CO2 overpressure. The in situ reactivation experiment will use a novel borehole deformation tool that assesses the magnitude of overpressure required to cause slip, defines the mode of this slip as creeping (aseismic) or rapid (seismic), and measures the evolution of permeability on the fault.\nThe second controlled-release field experiment was conducted in 2011/2012 to simulate the release of CO2 from a geologic storage site and study the transport as well as the chemical mechanisms leading to the CO2-induced mobilization of trace elements in a shallow aquifer. The field test involved a dipole system in which the shallow groundwater was pumped from one well, saturated with CO2 at the pressure corresponding to the hydraulic pressure of the aquifer, and then re-injected into the same aquifer using a second well. Innovative monitoring techniques were used to measure water quality changes and to detect the dissolved CO2 plume. For both field studies, we will discuss related coupled-processes modeling work.",

            "abstract": "Rate- and state-dependent friction law (RSF), proposed on the basis of laboratory experiments, has been extensively applied to modeling of earthquake stick-slip cycles. A simple spring-slider model obeying RSF predicts a significant decrease of the frictional strength Phi (the state of contact) that is localized within a few years preceding the earthquake occurrence. On the other hand, recent laboratory experiments successfully monitored the history of the strength by simultaneously measuring the P-wave transmissivity |T| across the frictional interface using a 1-MHz transducer. This suggests a possibility of earthquake forecast by monitoring the strength of a natural fault by acoustic methods.\nThe present paper explores the feasibility of such monitoring in the field on the basis of the physics of RSF combined with the linear slip model (LSM) employed in the classical acoustic methodology for monitoring an imperfectly welded interface.\nThe characteristic frequency fc, around which |T| (or reflectivity |R|) has a good sensitivity to the interface strength, is shown to be proportional to the strength and inversely proportional to the representative scale of real contacts. For natural faults fc is estimated to be 1 to 100Hz, which is practicable in the field. The changes of |T| and |R| depend on the ratio of the strength drop to the absolute strength level, the latter of which is not constrained by RSF simulations. Expected changes in wave amplitude in the preslip period would be several percent for strong faults and several tens percent for weak faults, which may be detectable by acoustic methods such as seismic reflection surveys.

The ruptures are visualized by photo-elasticity recorded with a high velocity camera. The radiated wavefield is studied with a network of acoustic sensors.\nIn a first part, we study the slow initiation of the rupture. We show that this stage actually consists of two phases, a long exponential growth followed by a catastrophic acceleration. The critical length and critical rupture velocity of the transition scale depend inversely on the normal stress; while the characteristic time is independent of the normal stress. We discuss these results with respect to recent observations of earthquake nucleation in natural faults.\nIn a second part, we will show that this experiment can be used to study the effect of barriers on a fault, as well as the effect on rupture propagation of a kink on a fault. We provide detailed observation of the wavefield radiated by the barrier, and compare it to the wavefield radiated by a kink. We compare the observations with theoretical results for the radiation of a barrier in a 2D in-plane geometry, and with 2D numerical simulations of rupture dynamics by the spectral element method.",

            "abstract": "Several development projects are currently under way in developing countries to meet growing demand for water and energy. However, due to the lack of the hydro-meteorological data, some projects were conducted without rigorous check of water balance and the potential changes in the flow regime likely to be induced by reservoirs, and their implications for irrigation projects and ecosystems. To cope with this issues, we carried out analysis by using a hydrological model and quasi-observed rainfall data.\nA distributed water circulation model was introduced as a tool to implement the analysis. Given daily meteorological data, the model calculates spatial distribution of surface runoff, evapotranspiration, river flow and water demand. In addition, it represents operation of water use facilities, and return flow from irrigated areas.\nWe performed a case study in the Pursat River Basin in Cambodia, where multiple projects are ongoing. We first calculated river discharge with observed rain data and calibrated it.\nNext, we performed a water balance analysis of the basin using the compiled model with 7 years of rainfall data. Because 20-30 years of data is generally required for water resources planning, we thus prepared 25 years of data by using a climate model with a statistically corrected bias. We determined a reference year for irrigation planning from the long-term data such that annual precipitation of 5-year return period.\nWe selected a scenario for irrigated areas from the Water Balance Study Report (JICA, 2013) to project the future water demand, and checked the water balance under no-dam conditions. The results revealed that water supply was more than adequate to meet water demand in the reference year.\nWe finally incorporated the future dam operations into the calculations and evaluated the impact of the dams on river flows and irrigation projects. Even under the changed flow regimes, the water balance was satisfied in the reference year. However, river flows highly decreased in the beginning of rainy seasons, whereas the river flows increased notably in the dry season due to a hydropower dam.\nOur analysis is not intended to the precise ‘prediction’ of the future, but to show stakeholders what will happen if we manage water resources based on scenarios and to indicate what actions may be needed to prevent undesirable outcomes.",

            "abstract": "This research aims to improve the representation of convective processes during the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and other modes of intra-seasonal variability in the LMDZ atmospheric models, by making use of joint δD and H2O (vapor) measurements.\nIn addition to atmospheric drying and wetting derived from the humidity measurements, the additional δD measurements provide enrichment and depletion information. This information is used to distinguish between different moistening and drying processes. For example, moistening due to ocean surface evaporation and due to rain re-evaporation can be distinguished, as re-evaporating moisture is more depleted in δD than surface evaporation.\nWe use mid-tropospheric IASI satellite δD and H2O measurements to determine the humidity and δD evolution during about eight MJO events from 2010-2012 (including those monitored during the CINDY/DYNAMO campaign). Moreover, these evolutions are compared to the standard isotope enabled LMDZ GCM, as well as to sensitivity tests of key parameters (cold pool representation, precipitation efficiency, droplet size and fall speed, etc.) in the convection scheme.\nThe IASI measurements over the Indian ocean suggest that from 20 days to 5 days before the MJO peak, the main moisture source is oceanic surface evaporation, which is advected upwards by shallow convection. During the 5 days around the MJO peak, the moisture evolution is dominated by deep convection. Most inter-event variability occurs 5 to 10 days after the event, when 75% of the events are dominated by large scale condensation, while convection dominate the remaining quarter of the events. After this, the advection of relatively dry and enriched air brings back the state to the mean. Over the Maritime continent, similar δD-H2O dynamics occur, but the variability of advected moisture dominates the inter-event variability.\nThe model captures the δD and H2O dynamics of the MJO reasonably well. However, over the Indian ocean, the timing of the modeled depletion peak is too soon after the MJO peak. Initial results of sensitivity tests shows that parameters controlling rain re-evaporation rates have a significant influence on this timing of the δD minimum. Further sensitivity tests will be presented, together with the usefulness of δD and H2O data to understand the MJO.",

            "abstract": "Mechanisms driving microbial processes in soil or decomposing litter are still largely unclear and only poorly represented in current biogeochemical models. Soil processes are traditionally investigated from a bird’s eye view, i.e. at scales considerably larger than those relevant to soil microbes, in both empirical and modeling studies, which has limited their understanding and consequently hampered the prediction of microbial organic matter decomposition under changing environmental conditions.\nWith the aim to envisage the soil as a complex, dynamic system, we developed an individual-based mm-scale soil C and N turnover model, which simulates competitive and synergistic interactions between functionally different microbes in a spatially structured environment (a two-dimensional grid of 10 000 soil ‘microsites’) of decomposing litter or soil.\nAnalyses of our model show that microbial interactions at the micro-scale drive the emergence of qualitatively new system properties at the macro-scale. In particular, interactions between microbes that actively degrade chemically complex compounds (‘degraders’) and those who do not, but benefit from the activity of others (‘opportunists’), lead to a self-regulation of the overall soil microbial activity: increasing catalytic efficiency of extracellular enzymes released by degraders are outbalanced by increased competition from opportunists, thereby down-regulating the amount of enzymes produced at the community level. As a consequence, decay rates in our model became effectively independent of the catalytic properties of extracellular enzymes.\nOur results show that regulations at the community level have the potential to overrule anticipated responses of microbial physiology or extracellular enzyme kinetics to changing environmental conditions. We conclude that current efforts to enhance mechanistic detail in biogeochemical models need to go beyond microbial physiology, and to include mechanisms of community-driven regulation.",

            "abstract": "Urban and exurban residential populations in South Africa reside primarily in low-income settlements, including many townships remaining from Apartheid. Over 3 million free government homes have been built in the last 20 years, but the number of people living in informal settlements is the same as at the end of Apartheid in 1994 - a consequence of rapid urbanization. Despite availability of electricity to the vast majority of South Africans, ~80% of electrified homes in low-income areas also burn coal and/or wood as supplementary fuels for cooking and heating. These domestic burning activities represent 70-85% of total PM10mass during winter in South Africa’s low-income settlements.\nHere we analyze data from observations of human-atmosphere systems in: 1) 19 ground monitoring sites in Gauteng Province (Johannesburg and Pretoria), and 2) an intensive sampling campaign in a township in Mpumalanga Province (Industrial Highveld). From ground monitoring, we quantitatively describe seasonal and diurnal trends in PM10 and PM2.5 typical in low-income settlements as compared with industrial and developed suburban areas, and demonstrate the impact of low-income settlements on regional air quality. We also explore the implications of economic development in townships (increased household income, expanded commercialization and widespread electricity usage) on local and regional air quality. Data from the intensive township sampling study provides a seasonal energy budget for domestic burning in low-income settlements and suggests that indoor and ambient air quality are independent systems requiring unique interventions. We conclude with a preview of innovative strategies being developed by industry, government, and academic stakeholders for a not-like-for-like emissions offset policy in South Africa, focused on investments directly into low-income settlements that are aimed at reducing PM exposure.",

            "abstract": "The impact of city emissions of short lived gases and aerosols on the tropospheric chemistry and climate is examined over Central Europe. A coupled modelling system consisting of the regional climate model RegCM4 and the chemistry transport model CAMx is implemented over a 10 km x 10 km resolution domain. For each period of 2001-2010, 2026-2035 and 2046-2055 a pair of experiments is performed: one with urban emissions removed and one with urban emissions scaled by the factor. The chemistry-climate impact is evaluated as the difference between the corresponding experiments divided by this factor. This choice was important to obtain statistically significant results. The linearity is examined to justify this approach. The radiative feedbacks of tropospheric ozone, primary (black and organic carbon) and secondary inorganic aerosols (sulfates and nitrates) are taken into account including the 1st and 2nd indirect aerosol effect. Due to city emissions, we found significant ozone titration especially over the western and northern part of the domain. City emissions contribute to ozone production over southern Europe. An increase of sulfate, nitrate aerosols and black/organic is significant as well and is modelled not only over urbanized areas but all over the computational domain. Evaluating the radiative impacts, we found that the total urban impact on 2 m temperature over central Europe is characterized by cooling up to -0.015 K as a 2001-2010 average. The radiative impact of the individual constituents (ozone, sulfate-, nitrate aerosols etc.) is examined as well.",

Knowledge of salt formation, sea salt mixing and bacterial transportation associated with the particles, and the subsequence of these processes and phenomena were investigated and discussed.\n(1) Sulfate and nitrate were efficiently produced on dust particles in marine air but the production of the salts in the upwind continental air was very weak. Some studies reported substantial sulfate and nitrate in mineral particles in the urban air of Chinese cities. However, the reported mineral particles were more likely from anthropogenic activities rather than desert dust. The formation of sulfate on Ca-rich particles did not enhance the hygroscopicity of the particles. In contrast, nitrate produced on dust particles changed the particles from hydrophobic to hydrophilic to deliquesce at ~30% RH or less. (2) Evidence for HCl deposition on dust particles in marine air was obtained. In the absence of substantial sulfate and nitrate, chloride formation on dust particles could be a major process capable of converting the particles into aqueous droplets. (3) Dust particles frequently became mixture of mineral dust and sea salt in marine air, causing the change of particles in size, hygroscopicity and other properties. Estimates showed significant enhancement of dust particle gravitational settling by sea salt adherence, resulting in more efficient gravitational removal of the dust particles than without sea salt adherence. Thus the settling of dust particles to sea surface is fundamentally different from that in continental atmosphere. (4) A close relation between bacteria and long-range transported Asian dust was confirmed in dust plumes and their concentrations were proportional and comparable.",

In the present study, we investigate morphological changes by far-field tsunami impacts at the US west coasts via numerical simulations. Firstly, we develop a numerical model for predicting morphological evolutions by integrating a set of sub-models; hydrodynamics, sediment transport and morphological evolution models. Particularly, fully nonlinear Boussinesq-type equations are employed in the hydrodynamic model to the accurate calculation of nearshore current fields which tend to be easily chaotic and unpredictable due to the existence of various types of turbulence sources(e.g., wave-breaking). Then, the developed model is validated through benchmark tests of one-dimensional or two-dimensional sedimentation problems; dam-break flow over the movable bed, breaking solitary waves over a sloping beach, partially breached dam-break flow over the mobile bed, and dam-break flows over a movable bed with a sudden enlargement. Throughout tests, calculated results agree well with the experimental records when a reasonable parameter is chosen for an empirical formula. Lastly, a real-scale application of the model to the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami is presented with the results of tsunami-generated scouring and depositon in the the Santa Cruz Harbor and in the Crescent City Harbor, CA(USA). In both locations, strong currents are successfully generated through the model and cause severe depth changes through sedimentation process. Calculated area coverages for scouring and deposition in the harbor area also agree well with observations(Figure 1).",

            "abstract": "Rock magnetic and magneto-mineralogical data from scientific drillings contribute to our understanding of the growth history and tectonic evolution of volcanic structures and allows for an improved interpretation of magnetic anomaly data. Such data are not only important for the magnetic structure of volcanic buildings and spreading ridges on Earth but may also provide basic data for the interpretation of extraterrestrial magnetic anomalies like on Mars.\nCrustal magnetization of basalts is well studied since decades and in general, the amplitude of magnetic anomalies is mainly related to the induced and remanent magnetization. Direct measurements of the magnetic field and measurements of magnetic properties of oceanic and continental crust have indicated that the crustal magnetization is very complex and depends on different factors like e.g. magma composition, cooling rate, age and hydrothermal alteration. Generally a high oxygen fugacity (above the NNO buffer) and a low Ti/(Ti+Fe) ratio of the basaltic melt are suggested as a precondition for high concentration of magnetic minerals and therefore high primary TRM. High temperature subsolidus reactions and hydrothermal alteration as e.g. observed in the strongly magnetic basalts from the Stardalur drill core, Iceland, seems to increase NRM intensity and magnetic susceptibility due to creation of small, secondary magnetite (Vahle et al. 2007). Probably the increase occurred after the extinction of the hydrothermal system because active high-temperature (>150 °C) geothermal areas like the Krafla caldera, NE-Iceland, often show distinct magnetic lows in aeromagnetic anomaly maps suggesting a destruction of magnetic minerals by hydrothermal activity (Oliva-Urcia et al. 2011). The destruction explains the significant magnetization loss, which is seen in many local magnetic anomaly lows within the oceanic crust and volcanic islands like Iceland or Hawaii.\nBorehole and core magnetic susceptibility measurements in combination with rock magnetic and magnetic mineralogy studies will be shown from scientific drillings from Hawaii and Iceland, which illustrate how vertical core sections can be used to deduce these processes.\n",

            "abstract": "Coronal Mass Ejections are most severe eruptive phenomenon in the solar atmosphere and are believed as the major energy source of the Near-Earth Space Environment. The study of CMEs is very important for the Space Weather forecast. The active regions , especially super-active regions, containing lots of magnetic free energy, are considered as the most important source regions of CMEs. Knowing why and how may some active regions (ARs) frequently produce CMEs is one of the key questions to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms and processes of energy accumulation and sudden release in ARs as well as improving our capability of space weather prediction.\nBased on above, we have done two parts of work: the first one is selecting all 37 SARs in the entire 23 solar cycle, using data provided by SOHO/LASCO C2|EIT|MDI, manually determining 285 CMEs produced by those SARs; second, we use the term ‘quasi-homologous’to refer to successive CMEs originating from the same ARs within a short interval, analyze the rules of quasi-homologous CMEs' generation. Finally, we got two conclusions.\n1. The waiting times of quasi-homologous CMEs have a two-component distribution with a separation at about 18 hours. The first component is a Gaussian-like distribution with a peak at about 7 hours, which indicates a tight physical connection between these quasi-homologous CMEs. The likelihood of occurrences of two or more CMEs faster than 1200 km /s from the same AR within 18 hours is about 20%.\n2. The correlation analysis among CME waiting times, CME speeds and CME occurrence rates reveals that these quantities are independent to each other, suggesting that the perturbation by preceding CMEs rather than free energy input be the direct cause of quasi-homologous CMEs. The peak waiting time of 7 hours probably characterize the time scale of the growth of instabilities triggered by preceding CMEs. This study uncovers more clues from a statistical perspective for us to understand quasi-homologous CMEs as well as CME-rich ARs.",

            "abstract": "The Federal Republic of Germany has long been among the few European countries that lack a national landslide database. Systematic collection and inventory of landslide data still shows a comprehensive research history in Germany, but only one focused on development of databases with local or regional coverage. This has changed in recent years with the launch of a database initiative aimed at closing the data gap existing at national level.\nThe present contribution reports on this project that is based on a landslide database which evolved over the last 15 years to a database covering large parts of Germany. A strategy of systematic retrieval, extraction, and fusion of landslide data is at the heart of the methodology, providing the basis for a database with a broad potential of application. The database offers a data pool of more than 4,200 landslide data sets with over 13,000 single data files and dates back to 12th century. All types of landslides are covered by the database, which stores not only core attributes, but also various complementary data, including data on landslide causes, impacts, and mitigation. The current database migration to PostgreSQL/PostGIS is focused on unlocking the full scientific potential of the database, while enabling data sharing and knowledge transfer via a web GIS platform.\nIn this contribution, the goals and the research strategy of the database project are highlighted at first, with a summary of best practices in database development providing perspective. Next, the focus is on key aspects of the methodology, which is followed by the results of different case studies in the German Central Uplands. The case study results exemplify database application in analysis of vulnerability to landslides, impact statistics, and hazard or cost modeling.",

            "abstract": "Simple box models of ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle predict that Antarctic ventilation can regulate the steady-state atmospheric CO2 through its control over the biological carbon storage in the deep ocean. A weakened upwelling would lead to a more complete nutrient utilization at the surface and an increased retention of biogenic carbon in the deep ocean. We perform a suite of numerical sensitivity experiments using a coupled seaice and global ocean circulation model to better understand what regulates the Antarctic ventilation and its link to glacial climate. The model is first spun up with a modern climatological surface forcing, which exhibits a multi-decadal oscillation, where the Southern Ocean is heated from below through the influx of warm and salty North Atlantic Deep Water, and the accumulation of heat induces intermittent convective overturning. Through the sensitivity experiments, we explore and illustrate the rich and complex behavior of the Antarctic ventilation and its response to the northern sinking, the surface wind stress, and the global mean temperature. When the northern sinking is weakened by a freshwater perturbation, the intermittent convection events are suppressed as the heat source is reduced. When the atmospheric temperature is lowered uniformly, the Antarctic seaice extent increases and the southern overturning weakens on centennial timescales. However, the convective overturning rebounds on the millennial timescale if the northern sinking is active. We will discuss implications of our results to the deep ventilation of the Southern Ocean and its impact on the ocean carbon storage.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies on the Algerian and the North-Ligurian margins in the Western Mediterranean have evidenced inversion-related superficial structures, such as folds and asymmetric sedimentary perched basins whose geometry hints at deep compressive structures dipping towards the continent.\nDeep seismic imaging of these margins is difficult due to steep slope and superficial multiples, and, in the Mediterranean context, to the highly diffractive Messinian evaporitic series in the basin.\nDuring the Algerian–French SPIRAL survey (2009, R/V Atalante), 2D marine multi-channel seismic (MCS) reflection data were collected along the Algerian Margin using a 4.5 km, 360 channel digital streamer and a 3040 cu. in. air-gun array. An advanced processing workflow has been laid out using Geocluster CGG software, which includes noise attenuation, 2D SRME multiple attenuation, surface consistent deconvolution, Kirchhoff pre-stack time migration. This processing produces satisfactory seismic images of the whole sedimentary cover, and of southward dipping reflectors in the acoustic basement along the central part of the margin offshore Great Kabylia, that are interpreted as inversion-related blind thrusts as part of flat-ramp systems.\nWe applied this successful processing workflow to old 2D marine MCS data acquired on the North-Ligurian Margin (Malis survey, 1995, R/V Le Nadir), using a 2.5 km, 96 channel streamer and a 1140 cu. in. air-gun array. Particular attention was paid to multiple attenuation in adapting our workflow. The resulting reprocessed seismic images, interpreted with a coincident velocity model obtained by wide-angle data tomography, provide (1) enhanced imaging of the sedimentary cover down to the top of the acoustic basement, including the base of the Messinian evaporites and the sub-salt Miocene series, which appear to be tectonized as far as in the mid-basin, and (2) new evidence of deep crustal structures in the margin which the initial processing had failed to reveal.",

            "abstract": "Hydrous phases such as amphibole and chlorite are elastically very anisotropic. Even though olivine is the major mineral that constitutes the upper mantle of the Earth, both amphibole and chlorite in a deformed peridotite under water-rich condition may develop lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) that can significantly affect the seismic anisotropy. Therefore, we studied the LPOs of olivine, amphibole, and chlorite in amphibole peridotites from southwestern Norway. To determine the LPOs of minerals, we used SEM/EBSD (Electron Backscattered Diffraction) technique. The samples are fine-grained and well-foliated rocks with a porphyroclastic texture. They are mostly composed of olivine(60–90%), amphibole(10–40%), and chlorite(0.2–10%) and a minor enstatite and spinel.\nIn this study, a gradual change in olivine LPO was identified. One sample showed that [100] axes are aligned subparallel to lineation and [010] axes subnormal to foliation, which is known as type-A LPO. The other sample showed that [010] axes are aligned subnormal to foliation and [001] axes parallel to lineation, which is known as type-B LPO. Other samples showed intermediate type between type-A and type-B LPO. Amphibole LPOs showed that [001] axes are aligned subparallel to lineation and [100] axes subnormal to foliation. Chlorite LPOs showed that [100] axes are aligned subparallel to lineation and [001] axes subnormal to foliation. We calculated seismic velocity and seismic anisotropy of the studied rock samples. The P- and S-wave anisotropies of amphibole were up to 15.2% and 11.9%, respectively. The P- and S-wave anisotropies of chlorite were up to 25.2% and 46.2%, respectively. It turned out that seismic anisotropy of both amphibole and chlorite is much higher than that of olivine. Our data suggest that the existence of the LPO of hydrous minerals, such as amphibole and chlorite, in a peridotite enhances the seismic anisotropy of the whole rock.",

            "abstract": "The boundary integral equation method formulated in the real space and time domain (BIEM-ST) has been used as a powerful tool to analyze the earthquake rupture dynamics on non-planar faults. Generally, BIEM is more accurate than volumetric methods such as the finite difference method and the finite difference method. With the recent development of the high performance computing environment, the earthquake rupture simulation studies have been conducted considering three dimensional realistic fault geometry models. However, the utility of BIEM-ST has been limited due to its heavy computational demanding increased depending on square of time steps (N2), which was needed to evaluate the historic integration. While BIEM can be efficient with the spectral domain formulation, the applications of such a method are limited to planar fault cases. In this study, we propose a new method to reduce the calculation time of BIEM-ST to linear of time step (N) without degrading the accuracy in the 3 dimensional modeling space. We extends the method proposed earlier for the case of the 2 dimensional framework, applying the asymptotic expressions of the elasto-dynamic Green’s functions. This method uses the physical nature of the stress Green’s function as dividing the causality cone according to the distances from the wave-fronts. The scalability of this method is shown on the parallel computing environment of the distributed memory. We demonstrate the applicability to analyses of subduction earthquake cases, suffering long time from the numerical limitations of previously available BIEMs. We analyze the dynamic rupture processes on dipping reverse faults embed in a three dimensional elastic half space.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic continental margins have a number of distinctive features that are different from those typical of magma-poor continental margins. However, in some places volcanic margins may develop parallel to older, highly extended rift systems. In such situations the resultant continental margin shows a complex structure that merges the characteristics of volcanic and non-volcanic margins. Furthermore, the evolution of this younger magma-rich margin is restricted by the pre-existing lithospheric architecture, causing it to diverge from the generally assumed formation model. We use the case of NE Greenland to demonstrate the structure of a composite margin firstly subjected to extensive extension and later overprinted by magma-assisted continental break-up. The NE Greenland continental margin is a highly extended margin, that is up to 250km wide, with crystalline crust attaining the maximum thickness near to the coast of Greenland and at the Danmarkshaven Ridge. The latter represents a major basement horst formed during an Early Cretaceous rifting event. To the east of the Danmarkshaven Ridge, crust is stretched and onlapped by the Early Cretaceous sedimentary basin. The effects of Tertiary break-up are observable in a relatively narrow zone 80 km wide that usually includes an extended edge of continental crust and an adjacent section of oceanic crust. A volcano-sedimentary succession produced during the break-up reaches the maximum thickness of c. 8000 m above a continent-ocean transition (COB). Oceanic crust overlain by mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks is thicker than usual. No observable SDRs or igneous transitional crust are present near to the COB. Instead, a chain of high density bodies follow the COB at the base of crust.\nThe features observed suggest relatively little extension associated with the Tertiary break-up. Instead localised mantle melting presumably led to rapid break-up with crustal dilatation promptly balanced by production of thick oceanic crust and magma underplating at Moho level. There was practically no syn-rift phase but volcanism and deposition of extensive sedimentary succession followed the initial separation of continental crust.",

            "abstract": "Several studies of primitive mafic arc rocks have shown systematic across-arc variations in the volatile and trace element contents of primary arc magmas. Most of these studies used olivine-hosted melt inclusions in mafic scoria that had been transported rapidly to the surface from depth. These inclusions bypass upper crustal modifications, and constrain the chemical composition of parental magmas in equilibrium with the mantle. The patterns preserved in these melts can be used to explore spatial variation in the volatile-rich flux that enters the mantle wedge, sourced from the subducting plate. Variability in the composition of this flux provides information about fluid and melt transport through the mantle wedge, and of the mineral breakdown or melting processes occurring within the downgoing slab.\nWe analysed olivine-hosted melt inclusions from scoria cones in southern Chile (40 - 42 S), including picrites with unzoned Mg-rich olivine (Fo88) from volcan Apagado. Samples show systematic variations in water, CO2, and trace element content that suggests that the primary-melt chemistry reflects the pattern of element release at the subducting slab interface. This down-slab chemical gradient is consistent with predictions from modelling and experiments. Down-slab, the flux feeding the arc magmas becomes progressively water-poor over a distance of a few km. We suggest that this change marks the onset of significant water-fluxed melting of sediment at the downgoing slab-surface. The short length scale of the across-arc chemical patterns in southern Chile is surprising. The fact that such changes are preserved within our sampled rocks suggests that there is limited across-arc mixing and focussing of fluids or melts as they ascend through the mantle wedge. Our results suggest that slab-surface inputs exert a first-order control on arc-magma chemistry. The chemical patterns that we observe are replicated in other arcs (e.g. Kamchatka, Izu-Bonin), despite the plate-scale thermal differences between these subduction zones. These similar patterns between diverse arcs imply that sub-arc slab-surface temperature ranges may be similar in all three settings. This unexpected result also suggests that slab surface temperature influences the location of volcanic arcs in subduction zones.",

It is unclear which are the biophysical processes that control carbon dynamics (including CO2 and CH4) in estuaries, and whether these ecosystems are net sources or sinks of carbon to the atmosphere. Most efforts have been placed to study CO2 dynamics, but the complex biogeochemical reactions within the sediments that play a role of in situ GHG production cannot be forgotten, especially for CH4 dynamics in wetlands. We present results of ecosystem-scale CO2, CH4 and H2O fluxes using the eddy covariance technique in a brackish temperate estuary near the Delaware Bay, USA. We also present a synthesis effort to bring together concepts and measurements form hydrology and biogeochemistry to explain the temporal patterns and magnitudes of the GHG fluxes measured by the eddy covariance technique. We conclude that an ecohydrological approach and a deeper understanding of biogeochemical characteristics and reactions within the sediments is needed to better understand GHG fluxes in estuaries.",

Consequently, changes in the amount and frequency of rainfall will influence biophysical drivers that regulate the strength and timing of ecosystem fluxes including soil CO2 efflux, gross primary productivity, and evapotranspiration. First, a classic example is presented using fire and changes in precipitation to illustrate how soil CO2 efflux rates respond to these disturbances in arid grasslands. Second, multi-year evapotranspiration patterns are explored in an arid shrubland subject to monsoon rains, arguably extreme water pulses for these water-limited ecosystems. Finally, a multi-year record of ecosystem scale CO2 fluxes and evapotranspiration is presented for coastal water-limited shrublands, where the effects of extreme precipitation and drought are explored along with potential transport of moisture from the ocean. Water-limited ecosystems are subject to different disturbances and climate extremes; however, is still unclear how ecosystems respond and which are the variety of processes that may provide resilience to these events.",

            "abstract": "The understanding of fault-slip behaviour in carbonates has an important societal impact as a) a significant number of earthquakes nucleate within or propagate through these rocks, and b) half of the known petroleum reserves occur within carbonate reservoirs, which likely contain faults that experience fluid pressure fluctuations. Field studies on carbonate-bearing faults that are exhumed analogues of currently active structures of the seismogenic crust, show that fault rock types are systematically controlled by the lithology of the faulted protolith: localization associated with cataclasis, thermal decomposition and plastic deformation commonly affect fault rocks in massive limestone, whereas distributed deformation, pressure-solution and frictional sliding along phyllosilicates are observed in marly rocks. In addition, hydraulic fractures, indicating cyclic fluid pressure build-ups during the fault activity, are widespread.\nStandard double direct friction experiments on fault rocks from massive limestones show high friction, velocity neutral/weakening behaviour and significant re-strengthening during hold periods, on the contrary, phyllosilicate-rich shear zones are characterized by low friction, significant velocity strengthening behavior and no healing. We are currently running friction experiments on large rock samples (20x20 cm) in order to reproduce and characterize the interaction of fault rock frictional heterogeneities observed in the field. In addition we have been performing experiments at near lithostatic fluid pressure in the double direct shear configuration within a pressure vessel to test the Rate and State friction stability under these conditions. Our combination of structural observations and mechanical data have been revealing the processes and structures that are at the base of the broad spectrum of fault slip behaviors recently documented by high-resolution geodetic and seismological data.",

            "abstract": "Tropical broad leaf species are the highest contributors to biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) globally making the Amazon tropical forest a major global source. BVOCs can affect atmospheric chemistry, air quality and climate by influencing the oxidative capacity and radiative balance of the atmosphere. Isoprene is the main constituent of total BVOC emissions, however, a wide suite of compounds such as methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein (MVK and MACR), methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, and monoterpenes play an important role. Due to the remoteness of tropical background sites, there are few continuous long-term canopy scale BVOC measurements and more are needed to improve global atmospheric chemistry models.\nApproximately one year of continuous high temporal resolution BVOC measurements were made during 2013-2014 as part of the CLAIRE-UK project. Measurements were carried out from the top of a tower above a primary terra firme forest canopy situated approximately 60km north of Manaus, Brazil. A high sensitivity proton transfer reaction-(quadrupole) mass spectrometer (PTR-(Q)MS) was deployed alongside a sonic anemometer to quantify BVOC fluxes using disjunct eddy covariance. Mixing ratios of a range of compounds were measured for 45 minutes at a frequency of 0.5 Hz for flux calculation.\nHere we present the first results of BVOC flux and mixing ratio measurements from September 2013 to July 2014. Diurnal variability, seasonal differences and possible driving factors will be discussed. In example, positive isoprene fluxes were observed during the day, closely following light intensity and temperature. Diurnal maxima, typically in the order of 5-15 mg isoprene m-2 h-1 were observed between 11:00 and 14:00 local time. Higher emissions occurred during the drier and warmer months from September to December. Preliminary analyses suggest deposition of isoprene oxidation products MVK and MACR, though there is evidence of emission at higher temperatures during some afternoons.",

            "abstract": "From recent published studies, it is not yet clear whether the sea level spatial trend patterns of the Pacific Ocean from satellite altimetry over 20 years are mostly due to internal climate variability or if some anthropogenic fingerprint is already detectable. The objective of this study is to investigate this issue in a more detailed manner. For that purpose, we remove the signal corresponding to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) from the observed altimetry sea level trend over 1993-2012 and find some significant residual pattern in the western tropical Pacific. When the same is performed on the thermocline attributed steric sea level trend (since most of the observed sea level trend in the tropics is explained by the vertical thermal structure of the ocean), essentially the same residual pattern remains. This suggests that the internal climate variability alone cannot account for all of the observed trend patterns in the western tropical Pacific and that there is likely a fingerprint of anthropogenic forcing. In addition, by making use of different sets of CMIP5 coupled climate models (with and without external forcing), we try to separate the contribution of anthropogenic forcing and internal climate variability to the Pacific Ocean regional sea level variability between 1900 and 2005. As in the CMIP5 models, the timing of the internal climate variability is poorly reproduced, performing an ensemble mean of several such models will therefore compensate this internal variability thereby giving an estimate of regional sea level variability driven by external (natural and/or anthropogenic) forcing only. We show that the sea level trend pattern from the ensemble climate models in the tropical Pacific is very similar to the observed sea level trend patterns from satellite altimetry after removing the PDO signal. This suggests that the presence of anthropogenic fingerprint is already detectable in satellite altimetry based sea level.",

However, recent studies at Stromboli are starting to elucidate some of the complexities in these explosions, with high speed imaging identifying multiple ejection pulses within single explosions. Furthermore, petrological data suggests the presence of a highly crystalline magma in the upper portion of the conduit, which could act as a plug, and indicates a potential source for complexities not seen in existing first order (single viscosity fluid) models. Here we present a detailed laboratory investigation to represent a more complex fluid dynamic scenario in which a viscous liquid (plug) overlays a less viscous fluid within the conduit.\nScaled experiments were designed to reproduce the effects of a plug at the top of the conduit on the dynamics of slug expansion, burst and the resulting geophysical signals. Single slugs ascended silicon oil capped with castor oil in a vertical tube; pressure was measured in the liquid and within the gas 'atmosphere’ above the liquid, and correlated with high-speed imagery of the experiments. Experiments were carried out with different slug gas volumes, thicknesses of the plug and experimental ambient pressure. The results were compared with CFD simulations, carried out both at laboratory and volcanic scale, to further explore the complex pressure distributions and forces exerted on the conduit.\nOur results highlight complex fluid dynamic processes, related to the intrusion of slugs in the viscous plug leading to different flow configurations and liquid mixing. Furthermore, the presence of a viscous plug strongly controls variations in the magnitude of the associated pressure transients, and the slug-plug interaction post burst favours a more impulsive pressure release.",

(i) Rainfall, which can be simulated by a censored first-order autoregressive process (vertical moisture fluxes), exhibits 1/f–spectra if presented as binary events (tropics), while extrema world wide increase with duration according to Jennings’ scaling law. (ii) Runoff volatility (Yangtze) shows data collapse which, linked to an intra-annual 1/f–spectrum, is represented by a single function not unlike physical systems at criticality and the short and long return times of extremes are Weibull-distributed. Atmospheric and soil moisture variabilities are also discussed. (iii) Soil moisture (in a bucket), whose variability is interpreted by a biased coinflip Ansatz for rainfall events, adds an equation of state to energy and water flux balances comprising Budyko’s frame work for quasi-stationary watershed analysis. Eco-hydrologic state space presentations in terms of surface flux ratios of energy excess (loss by sensible heat over supply by net radiation) versus water excess (loss by discharge over gain by precipitation) allow attributions of state change to external (or climate) and internal (or anthropogenic) causes. Including the vegetation-greenness index (NDVI) as an active tracer extends the eco-hydrologic state space analysis to supplement the common geographical presentations. Two examples demonstrate the approach combining ERA and MODIS data sets: (a) global geobotanic classification by combining first and second moments of the dryness ratio (net radiation over precipitation) and (b) regional attributions (Tibetan Plateau) of vegetation changes.",

We have measured the electrical conductivity of Al, Fe-bearing perovskite (Pv), the most abundant lower mantle phase, using a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell (LHDAC). The sample with composition Mg0.83Fe0.21Al0.06Si0.91O3 (Fe3+/ΣFe ratio ~ 0.4) was synthesized at 26 GPa and 2073 K using a multianvil press. Sample resistance was measured in situ at high pressure and high temperature up to 82 GPa and 2000 K. Results show a continuous increase in electrical conductivity with increasing pressure, in contrast to some previous studies of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite and a pyrolite assemblage where a decrease in conductivity was observed at higher pressure. Our results suggest that (1) incorporation of aluminum in Pv has a strong effect on its electrical conductivity and evolution with pressure; (2) spin crossover of Fe3+ does not occur or its effect on the conductivity is small in Al, Fe-bearing Pv, and (3) the contribution of ferropericlase to the electrical conductivity of pyrolite may be significant. The electrical conductivity profile of the Earth’s lower mantle derived from geomagnetic data can be better explained by a pyrolitic bulk chemical composition rather than a non-pyrolitic model such as one based solely on perovskite.",

            "abstract": "Urban sprawl and regional climate variability are major stresses on surface water resources in many places. The Lake Simcoe watershed (LSW) Ontario, Canada, is no exception. The LSW is predominantly agricultural but is experiencing rapid population growth due to its proximity to the greater Toronto area. This has led to extensive land use changes which have impacted its water resources and altered runoff patterns in some rivers draining to the lake. Here, we use a paired-catchment approach, hydrological change detection modelling and remote sensing analysis of satellite images to evaluate the impacts of land use change on the hydrology of the LSW (1994 to 2008). Results show that urbanization increased up to 16% in Lovers Creek, the most-urban impacted catchment. Annual runoff from Lovers Creek increased from 239 to 442 mm/yr in contrast to the reference catchment (Black River at Washago) where runoff was relatively stable with an annual mean of 474 mm/yr. Increased annual runoff from Lovers Creek was not accompanied by an increase in annual precipitation. Discriminant function analysis suggests that early (1992-1997; pre-major development) and late (2004-2009; fully urbanized) periods for Lovers Creek separated mainly based on model parameter sets related to runoff flashiness and evapotranspiration. As a result, parameterization in either period cannot be used interchangeably to produce credible runoff simulations in Lovers Creek due to greater scatter between the parameters in canonical space. Separation of early and late period parameter sets for the reference catchment was based on climate and snowmelt related processes. This suggests that regional climatic variability could be influencing hydrologic change in the reference catchment whereas urbanization amplified the regional natural hydrologic changes in urbanizing catchments of the LSW.",

Despite the ubiquity of life in the deep biosphere, the large community sizes are not yet understood given the extremely low energy fluxes. We have developed and applied new approaches to the deep sub-seafloor to quantify distributions and turnover times of living microbial biomass, endospores and microbial necromass. The approach combines sensitive analyses of unique bacterial marker molecules (muramic acid and d-amino acids) and the bacterial endospore marker (dipicolinic acid) with a series of models that link microscopic (e.g., racemization dynamics of stereo-isomeric amino acids) and macroscopic (e.g., porewater geochemistry) properties. Model output includes production rates and turnover times of microbial biomass and necromass, concentration profiles of reactive organic carbon, and rates of organic carbon decomposition. In combination, these results allow us to assess the role of microbial activity in the sub-seafloor carbon budget. One key result is that the turnover time of biomass is far longer than turnover times found in cultures and active surface sediments.",

            "abstract": "Since the Pangea supercontinent formed some 320 million years ago, the majority of large igneous provinces and diamond-bearing rocks (kimberlites) near Earth’s surface can be sourced to plumes erupting from the margins of two large thermochemical reservoirs at the core-mantle boundary. Using this surface to core-mantle boundary correlation to locate continents in longitude and a new iterative approach for defining a paleomagnetic reference frame corrected for true polar wander, we present a model for plate motion back to earliest Paleozoic time (540 Ma). We have identified six phases of slow, oscillatory true polar wander during the Paleozoic. True polar wander rates (<1 Degree/Myr) are compatible to those in the Mesozoic but plate velocities are on average twice as high. We show that a geologically reasonable model that reconstructs continents in longitude in such a way that large igneous provinces and kimberlites are positioned above the plume generation zones at the times of their formation can be successfully applied to the entire Phanerozoic. Our model is a kinematic model for only the continents. The next step in improving it will be developing a model for the entire lithosphere, including synthetic oceanic lithosphere. This is challenging, but we will demonstrate a full-plate model back to the Late Paleozoic (410 Ma).",

            "abstract": "Partial melting in (most of) the lower mantle occurs only by the presence of volatile elements such as hydrogen (and/or carbon). The experimental studies by [\nKawamoto, 2004\n] showed that partial melting is possible even at temperature of 1673 K in the shallow lower mantle if there is sufficient water. However, if metallic Fe is present in the lower mantle as suggested by [\nFrost et al., 2004\n]). most of hydrogen will be dissolved in metallic Fe, and thus melting will be prevented, making it difficult to explain a seismic velocity drop in the shallow lower mantle [\nSchmandt et al., 2014\n].\nIn this study we conducted high pressure experiments using the Rotational Drickamer Apparatus (RDA), on bridgmanite (Mg,Fe)SiO3 + (Mg,Fe)O mixture at pressure up to 23-29 GPa and temperature of about 2000-2200K. Using the advantage of the new RDA cell design which provide a larger pressure gradient (~6 GPa across the sample), we report experimental observations showing that metallic Fe is formed only in the low pressure conditions, 24-26.5 GPa (corresponding to the depth range of 660-730 km), leaving the shallow lower mantle minerals “dry”. Our results are also consistent with the published results by [Irifune et al., 2010; Sinmyo and Hirose, 2013] where they did not find any metallic Fe above 27 GPa. Therefore we conclude that metallic Fe is present only in the narrow depth range in the lower mantle. In such a case partial melt would be impossible and only occur at depth greater than 730 km. Our results explain why a velocity drop is observed at ~730 km not at 660 km [Schmandt et al., 2014]. The present results also have important implications for other geochemical issues including the behaviors of siderohpile elements during core formation.\nFrost, D.

            "abstract": "Tektites are small stones formed from rapidly cooling drops of molten rock ejected from high velocity asteroid impacts with the Earth, that freeze into a myriad of shapes during flight. Many splash-form tektites have an elongated or dumb-bell shape owing to their rotation prior to solidification[1]. Here we present a novel method for creating ‘artificial tektites’ from spinning drops of molten wax, using diamagnetic levitation to suspend the drops[2]. We find that the solid wax models produced this way are the stable equilibrium shapes of a spinning liquid droplet held together by surface tension.\nIn addition to the geophysical interest in tektite formation, the stable equilibrium shapes of liquid drops have implications for many physical phenomena, covering a wide range of length scales, from nuclear physics (e.g. in studies of rapidly rotating atomic nuclei), to astrophysics (e.g. in studies of the shapes of astronomical bodies such as asteroids, rapidly rotating stars and event horizons of rotating black holes). For liquid drops bound by surface tension, analytical and numerical methods predict a series of stable equilibrium shapes with increasing angular momentum. Slowly spinning drops have an oblate-like shape. With increasing angular momentum these shapes become secularly unstable to a series of triaxial pseudo-ellipsoids that then evolve into a family of two-lobed ‘dumb-bell’ shapes as the angular momentum is increased still further. Our experimental method allows accurate measurements of the drops to be taken, which are useful to validate numerical models.\nThis method has provided a means for observing tektite formation, and has additionally confirmed experimentally the stable equilibrium shapes of liquid drops, distinct from the equivalent shapes of rotating astronomical bodies. Potentially, this technique could be applied to observe the non-equilibrium dynamic processes that are also important in real tektite formation, involving, e.g. viscoelastic effects, non-uniform solidification, surface wrinkling (Schlieren), and rapid separation/fission of dumb-bells via the Rayleigh-Plateau instability.\n[1] M.

            "abstract": "Irrigation is the single largest anthropogenic water use, a modification of the land surface that significantly affects surface energy budgets, the water cycle, and climate. Irrigation, however, is typically not included in standard historical general circulation model (GCM) simulations along with other anthropogenic and natural forcings. To investigate the importance of irrigation as an anthropogenic climate forcing, we conduct two 5-member ensemble GCM experiments. Both are setup identical to the historical forced (anthropogenic plus natural) scenario used in version 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, but in one experiment we also add water to the land surface using a dataset of historically estimated irrigation rates. Irrigation has a negligible effect on the global average radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere, but causes significant cooling of global average surface air temperatures over land and dampens regional warming trends. This cooling is regionally focused and is especially strong in Western North America, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and Asia. Irrigation enhances cloud cover and precipitation in these same regions, except for summer in parts of Monsoon Asia, where irrigation causes a reduction in monsoon season precipitation. Irrigation cools the surface, reducing upward fluxes of longwave radiation (increasing net longwave), and increases cloud cover, enhancing shortwave reflection (reducing net shortwave). The relative magnitude of these two processes causes regional increases (northern India) or decreases (Central Asia, China) in energy availability at the surface and top of the atmosphere. Despite these changes in net radiation, however, climate responses are due primarily to larger magnitude shifts in the Bowen ratio from sensible to latent heating. Irrigation impacts on temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables are regionally significant, even while other anthropogenic forcings (anthropogenic aerosols, greenhouse gases, etc.) dominate the long term climate evolution in the simulations. To better constrain the magnitude and uncertainties of irrigation forcing, irrigation should therefore be considered as another important climate forcing in the next generation of historical climate simulations and multi-model assessments.",

            "abstract": "The repurposing of Bell Laboratories by new owner Lucent Technologies to become a mission-focused applied research facility effectively terminated fundamental, high-risk research everywhere but in research universities. The now almost ten year old NAS study that produced the watershed report Rising Above the Gathering Storm warned that the US research establishment encompassing industry, government, academia and nongovernment organizations has lost its way in promoting fundamental high-risk research of the kind that has historically led to the transformational scientific breakthroughs that radically changed and improved our quality of life for more than a century. Low-risk, incremental research dominates industry and most government funding agendas, including NSF (and including NSF's \"transformational research\" agenda!). Unprecedented challenges such as understanding and dealing with the consequences of climate change will require fundamental new ideas and technologies that do not exist. Adapting future ecosystems and human systems to climate variability and change needs new social models of cooperation, new biotechnologies and new environmental mangement strategies that do not now exist. A case can be made that history provides no strong templates for such a future. I argue that research universities, working in close partnerships with government, provides a fertile seedbed for the kinds of scientific knowledge and thinking that could produce \"game changing\" strategies for dealing with climate change. Government has the resources and the ability to convert and scale new ideas into usable knowledge, research universities have the ingenuity and disciplinary spectra to think up new ideas and test them for proof of concept. Co-locating a government presence within a research university has the potential to integrate a research enterprise that is not afraid to fail a few times before potentially hitting paydirt with an institution that can accelerate the translation of fundamental scientific breakthroughs into new usable information. Examples of how this has worked in other scientific settings will be presented to show the potential of this type of collaboration for dealing with climate change.",

FDCs are used for a variety of applications such as water resources estimation, hydropower planning and evaluation of hydrological models. Given the lack of discharge data in many areas in the world, a technique to estimate FDCs in ungauged or poorly gauged basins is desirable. There exist plenty of examples of regionalisation of FDCs within relatively limited areas (e.g. for local sub-basins or at national or regional scale), but to our knowledge it has not been done on global scale. The large variety of shapes of the flow duration curves and uncertainty in data complicates the process of regionalisation on this large scale. In this study, several methodologies are used to construct FDCs in basins assumed to be ungauged and the results are compared and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic or climate signals that originate in net-erosional catchments are transmitted down-system as sediment. The accumulation of that sediment in net-depositional regions and preservation as stratigraphy can be accessed and used to reconstruct signal generation and propagation. Studies of modern to <20 ka sedimentary systems suggest that signal propagation (or lack thereof) is, in part, controlled by the size, relief, and other morphologic characteristics of sediment-production segments. Thus, it’s critical to measure, estimate, or infer aspects of the feeder catchment when reconstructing system behavior from sedimentary deposits.\nHere, we present results from two studies aimed at determining paleo-sediment flux from stratigraphic archives. The first study uses outcropping middle Pleistocene (~0.6 Ma) alluvial-fan deposits in the Panamint Mountains, California, to investigate the relationship of sediment supply to stratigraphic architecture in a small catchment-fan system. The youth of this system allows us to estimate fan volumes from facies architecture and depositional system dimensions based on catchment-area to fan-area relationships of nearby modern systems. These data, combined with preliminary cosmogenic radionuclide-derived paleo-denudation rates, provide an opportunity to examine the nature of erosional signal propagation.\nThe second study examines much older, Upper Mississippian (~325 Ma), fluvial and deltaic strata. Absolute chronologic tools to calculate centennial-millennial rates in deep-time sedimentary archives do not yet exist. Here, we use the extraordinary tidal rhythmite deposits of the Pride Shale in the Appalachian Basin as a high-resolution chronometer to constrain the duration of basin filling. We then use the scale of fluvial channel bodies in the underlying and overlying units combined with climate-specific empirical relationships derived from modern systems to estimate the size of the paleo-catchment. The resultant estimates of sediment yield allow calculation of denudation rates for a system in which the catchment has long-since eroded.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade, the need to communicate uncertainty increased. Climate sciences and environmental sciences have faced massive propaganda campaigns by global industry and astroturf organizations. These organizations use the deep societal mistrust in uncertainty to point out alleged unethical and intentional delusion of decision makers and the public by scientists and their consultatory function. Scientists, who openly communicate uncertainty of climate model calculations, earthquake occurrence frequencies, or possible side effects of genetic manipulated semen have to face massive campaigns against their research, and sometimes against their person and live as well. Hence, new strategies to communicate uncertainty have to face the societal roots of the misunderstanding of the concept of uncertainty itself. Evolutionary biology has shown, that human mind is well suited for practical decision making by its sensory structures. Therefore, many of the irrational concepts about uncertainty are mitigated if data is presented in formats the brain is adapted to understand. At the end, the impact of uncertainty to the decision-making process is finally dominantly driven by preconceptions about terms such as uncertainty, vagueness or probabilities.\nParallel to the increasing role of scientific uncertainty in strategic communication, science communicators for example at the Research and Development Program GEOTECHNOLOGIEN developed a number of techniques to master the challenge of putting uncertainty in the focus. By raising the awareness of scientific uncertainty as a driving force for scientific development and evolution, the public perspective on uncertainty is changing. While first steps to implement this process are under way, the value of uncertainty still is underestimated in the public and in politics. Therefore, science communicators are in need for new and innovative ways to talk about scientific uncertainty.",

The program aims to develop a robust response to climate change by providing K-16 climate change education; enhance the effectiveness of K-16 education particularly in engineering and other STEM disciplines by use of new instructional technologies; increase the enrollment in engineering programs and the number of engineering degrees awarded by showing engineering’s usefulness in relation to the much-discussed contemporary issue of climate change; increase persistence in STEM degrees by providing student research opportunities; and increase the ethnic diversity of those receiving engineering degrees and help ensure an ethnically diverse response to climate change. Students participated in the second summer internship funded by the project. The program is in its third year. More than 75 students participated in a guided research experiences aligned with NASA Science Plan objectives for climate and Earth system science and the educational objectives of the three institutions. The students went through training in modern media technology (webcasts), and in using this technology to communicate the information on climate change to others, especially high school students, culminating in production of webcasts on investigating the aspects of climate change using NASA data.

During each of these flybys, the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer detected a peculiar split signature in Titan's pickup tail, i.e. the spacecraft passed through two spatially separated cold ion populations of different masses. Whether this might be an omnipresent feature of Titan's plasma interacting or a result of non-stationary upstream conditions is still unclear. To explain these features, we apply the hybrid simulation code AIKEF. The latest version of this code includes chemical reactions, a realistic and statistically consistent photoionization model and recombination for a sophisticated description of the ionospheric composition of Titan. To validate the ionosphere model, we compare its output against measurements of the magnetic field and the electron density from the T70 flyby, which reached the lowest altitude of all flybys and had nearly ideal upstream conditions with the magnetic field pointing southward.",

            "abstract": "Flooding is the most destructive, frequent, and costly natural disaster faced by modern society, and is increasing in frequency and damage (deaths, displacements, and financial costs) as populations increase and climate change generates more extreme weather events.\nWhen major flooding events occur, the disaster management community needs frequently updated and easily accessible information to better understand the extent of flooding and coordinate response efforts. With funding from NASA’s Applied Sciences program, we developed and are now operating a near real-time global flood mapping system to help provide flood extent information within 24-48 hours of events. The principal element of the system applies a water detection algorithm to MODIS imagery, which is processed by the LANCE (Land Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS) system at NASA Goddard within a few hours of satellite overpass. Using imagery from both the Terra (10:30 AM local time overpass) and Aqua (1:30 PM) platforms allows the system to deliver an initial daily assessment of flood extent by late afternoon, and more robust assessments after accumulating cloud-free imagery over several days. Cloud cover is the primary limitation in detecting surface water from MODIS imagery. Other issues include the relatively coarse scale of the MODIS imagery (250 meters) for some events, the difficulty of detecting flood waters in areas with continuous canopy cover, confusion of shadow (cloud or terrain) with water, and accurately identifying detected water as flood as opposed to normal water extent. We are working on improvements to address these limitations.\nWe have also begun delivery of near real time water maps at 30 m resolution from Landsat imagery. Although Landsat is not available daily globally, but only every 8 days if imagery from both operating platforms (Landsat 7 and 8) is accessed, it can provide useful higher resolution data on water extent when a clear acquisition coincides with an active flood event.\nThese data products are provided in various formats on our website, and also via live OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) services, and ArcGIS Online accessible web maps, allowing easy access from a variety of platforms, from desktop GIS software to web browsers on mobile phones.\nhttps://oas.gsfc.nasa.gov/floodmap",

Past studies with both modeled and observed Lagrangian floats have indicated that surface throughput between the two gyres is limited and that sub-surface pathways dominate. We translate these results to the oceanic heat transport through three steps. We first use the modern SST record (1981-2013) to reconcile the lack of inter-gyre connectivity at the surface with previous findings that showed a propagation of surface thermal anomalies from the subtropics to the subpolar gyre on interannual time scales. We then use synthetic trajectories in the FLAME model launched from the Cape Hatteras region to calculate the Lagrangian integral time scales of temperature anomalies along the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Current path. We compare these time scales to the time it takes for particles to reach the subpolar gyre in order to understand whether, on average, particles advect any memory of their anomalous temperature into the subpolar region. Finally, rather than studying the thermal anomalies for individual trajectories, we use the synthetic trajectories from FLAME to determine whether the trajectories that reach the subpolar gyre at a given time period collectively influence the upper ocean temperature of the region.",

            "abstract": "Polar mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE) are strong radar echoes that are typically observed at 50 to 500 MHz. They are often discussed in the context of dusty plasma studies and linked to e.g. the existence of charged ice particles, neutral atmospheric turbulence and atmospheric stratification. The PMSE are observed at mesospheric temperature minimum when ice particles form, though the exact path of formation is still a topic for research. Mesospheric smoke particles that are assumed to form after or during the meteor ablation process possibly contribute to the formation of the ice particles.\nFor understanding the formation of the radar echoes their variation with scattering angle is an important parameter. We analyze PMSE observations with the tri-static EISCAT VHF radar (224 MHz) during one day in June when PMSE were observed almost continuously from 7:00 to 13:00 UT. The radar signal was transmitted and received in zenith direction with the EISCAT VHF antenna near Tromsø. The receivers in Kiruna and Sodankylä were pointed at typical PMSE heights above the Tromsø transmitter and detected radar reflections at the same time and altitude as the Tromsø radar. The altitude of the PMSE changed with time and the extension of the echoes in altitude was smaller toward the end of the observation. These observations are among the first tri-static observations of PMSE.\nThe observations suggest that the scattering process underlying the PMSE occurs over a broad range of scattering angles. Based on the observations we will show that the spectral width of the received echoes is most likely determined by the variations within the observed volume rather than by the scattering process. The observed frequency shifts suggest a layer structure and horizontal motions that vary with altitude. UHF (933 MHz) radar observations were carried out in parallel, they display predominantly incoherent scatter and an electron density typical for the altitude. Some other studies, have in contrast suggested that electron densities are reduced in the presence of charged dust components. We will further discuss this UHF result in regard to the incoherent scatter process. UHF and VHF observations above the PMSE reveal smooth ionospheric conditions and no evidence of precipitation events.",

            "abstract": "There is an increasing concern about the indoor air environment, where we spend most of our time. Common methods of improving indoor air quality include controlling pollution sources, increasing ventilation rates or using air purifiers. Photocatalytic remediation technology was suggested as a new possibility to eliminate indoor air pollutants instead of just diluting or disposing them.\nIn the present study, heterogeneous reactions of NO2 were studied on photocatalytic paints containing different size and quantity of TiO2. The heterogeneous reactions were conducted in a photo reactor under simulated atmospheric conditions. The flat pyrex rectangular plates covered with the paint were inserted into the reactor. These plates have been sprayed with the photocatalytic paints at our industrial partner’s (ALLIOS) facilities using a high precision procedure that allowed the application of a thin layer of a given thickness of the paint. This allows a homogeneous coverage of the surface with the paint and an accurate determination of the exact amount of paint exposed to gaseous NO2.\nWe demonstrate that the indoor photocatalytic paints which contain TiO2 can substantially reduce the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). We show that the efficiency of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) removal increase with the quantity of TiO2 in the range 0 - 7 %. The geometric uptake coefficients increase from 5 · 10-6 to 1.6 · 10-5 under light irradiation of the paints. On the other hand, during the reactions of NO2 with this paint (7 % of TiO2) nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HONO) are formed. Nitrous acid (HONO) is an important harmful indoor pollutant and its photolysis leads to the formation of highly reactive OH radicals (Gomez Alvarez et al., 2013). Maximum conversion efficiencies of NO2to HONO and NO of 15 % and 33 % were observed at 30 % RH, respectively.\nThus, the quantity of TiO2 embedded in the paint is an important parameter regarding the nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) remediation, but may also influence formation of harmful by-products such as HONO, which should be considered for future optimization of photocatalytic paints aimed for indoor applications.\n",

Geodetic estimates of mass changes revealed a possible slight mass gain since the year ~2000. However, longer-term information about length and area changes is scarce and almost no mass budget analysis are available before 2000. We have thus extended both the regional coverage and duration of the time series. As a first step, a glacier inventory for the entire mountain range for the year ~2000 was generated using semi-automated glacier mapping techniques applied to Landsat data. Declassified Hexagon KH-9 data from the 1970s, the SRTM3-DEM and recent stereo data from ~2010 such as Pléiades, SPOT-5, ALOS PRISM, Cartosat and ASTER data allowed geodetic mass balance investigations of selected regions like Muztag Ata (East Pamir), Central Trans Alai Range (North Pamir) and Shimshal Valley (Central Karakoram). The investigations were extended for length and area changes using additional satellite data such as Corona KH-4 and Landsat MSS from the 1970s and Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI covering the period since ~2000.\nOur analysis revealed that in the Karakoram 191 out of 251 investigated glaciers were stationary, 33 receding and 27 advancing since the end of the 1970s until ~2000. Overall, we identified a small, but insignificant area decrease for this period. Glaciers in Eastern Pamir behaved similarly: at Muztag Ata they slightly shrank on average since the mid-1970s. In contrast, we found a continuous and significant glacier retreat in the Northern Pamir over the same period. Similar to the Karakoram, glaciers in the Pamir showed a high temporal and spatial variability of their changes with frequent surge activities. Preliminary results on glacier mass budgets revealed slightly negative values from ~1975 until ~2000 and slightly positive values thereafter in all investigated regions.",

The test period is from 1982-2010 and forecasts are initialized from the beginning of January, April, July and October. We analyzed the forecast skill of drought indices such as the 6-month standardized precipitation index (SPI6), monthly mean soil moisture percentiles (SMP) and the 3-month standardized runoff index (SRI3). The soil moisture and runoff were obtained by drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity land model with forcing derived from the NMME members (NMME_VIC). Drought indices from each member were computed and they were put into percentiles determined from all members in the training period at a given lead. We then formed an ensemble grand mean by averaging all indices together and determined the concurrence measure which is the extent to which all different members agree.\nWe find that : 1) The grand mean has higher skill than individual member; 2) During winter, forecasts are skillful in the regimes where the initial conditions dominant contributions to skill, the agreement between the grand mean and members are above 70-80% . At high leads, the concurrence measure drops to 50-60%, even when forecasts are unskillful. 3) During summer, forecast skill is low and concurrence measure drops to 10-30%, 4). The skill of drought forecasts is regionally and seasonally dependent. The NMME_VIC forecasts tend to over forecast drought events with large false alarm rate. After lead-1, the low thread score indicates no skill. The forecast errors will be analyzed to determine the origin of forecast skill.",

            "abstract": "Observed trends in the intensity of temperature extremes and heavy precipitation events are often not significant at local scales. However, using a spatially aggregated perspective, we demonstrate that the probability distribution of observed local trends across the globe for the period 1960–2010 is clearly different to what would be expected from internal variability. Using a simple and intuitive approach, we thereby detect a distinct intensification of heavy precipitation events and hot extremes, which is consistent with early studies using optimal fingerprinting methods.\nWe further demonstrate that spatial aggregation also allows for a robust quantification of changes in the Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR). While FAR is primarily applied to individual observed extremes, we argue that the concept is equally meaningful for the probability of extremes at continental to global scale. We demonstrate that with a warming of 2°C above pre-industrial conditions, the probability of exceeding the 99th percentile of daily precipitation increases by 25-75% globally. Thereby, in a 2°C warmer world roughly a third of the heavy precipitation events worldwide and more than 90% of the hot extremes are attributable to the temperature increase. We show that the changes in FAR per degree warming are highly sensitive to the thresholds used and the temporal scale of the events considered. However, at regional to global scale changes in FAR are robust across different GCMs.",

            "abstract": "We present the results of an electric resistivity tomography (ERT) survey, combined with mappings of diffuse carbon dioxide flux, ground temperature and self-potential (SP) at Solfatara, the most active crater of Phlegrean Fields. Solfatara is characterized by an intense carbon dioxide degassing, fumarole activity, and ground deformation. This ensemble of methods is applied to image the hydrothermal system of Solfatara, to understand the geometry of the fluid circulation, and to define the extension of the hydrothermal plume at a high enough resolution for a quantitative modeling. ERT inversion results show Solfatara as a globally conductive structure, with resistivity in the range 1-200 Ohmm. Broad negative anomaly of self-potential in the inner part of Solfatara with a minimum in the area of Bocca Grande suggests a significant downward flow of condensing liquid water. Comparison between spatial variations of resistivity and gas flux indicates that resistivity changes at depth are related to gas saturation and fluid temperature. These variations delineate two plume structures: a liquid-dominated conductive plume below Fangaia mud-pool and a gas-dominated plume below Bocca Grande fumarole. The geometry of the Fangaia liquid-saturated plume is also imaged by a high resolution 3-D resistivity model.\nIn order to estimate the permeability, we propose a 2-D axis-symmetric numerical model coupling Richards’s equation for fluid flow in conditions of partial saturation with the resistivity calculation as function of saturation only. Alternatively, we apply the Dupuit equation to estimate the permeability of the shallow layer. Using these two approaches, we obtain the permeability of the shallow layer below Fangaia which ranges between (2 - 4) 10-14 m 2.",

Persistent signal sources are useful as ground truth data for the study of atmospheric infrasound signal propagation, identification of manmade versus naturally occurring seismic sources, and other studies. By using signals emanating from the same location, propagation studies, for example, can be conducted using a variety of atmospheric conditions, leading to improvements to the modeling process for eventual use where the source is not known.

            "abstract": "The ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) have shown a progressive decline over the last five decades, including the spectacular collapses of Larsen A Ice Shelf in 1995 and Larsen B in 2002. These collapses have accelerated the flow of ice inland, contributing significantly to sea-level rise, and have also freshened the Antarctic Bottom Water formed nearby. Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS), the largest on the peninsula, has progressively lowered since 1992, but the origin of this lowering remains controversial; it has been attributed to ocean melting, but most evidence has favoured enhanced firn (snowpack) compaction. By applying a novel method to the data from eight separate radar surveys of LCIS spanning a 15-year period, we show that the lowering is caused by both ice loss and firn air loss. The ice loss may be caused by unbalanced ocean melting, so oceanic changes have contributed to the wastage of LCIS in addition to the well-documented atmospheric warming in the region. If naively extrapolated in space and time, the air loss rate would deplete LCIS firn within 2-3 centuries, while the ice loss could cause LCIS to unground from Bawden Ice Rise within 2-4 centuries. Until we better understand the atmosphere and ocean forcing of the AP Ice Sheet, it will not be possible to project its future stability or determine the anthropogenic contribution to its decline.",

Field data and results from substrate addition microcosm experiments will be presented from two contrasting continental sites of serpentinization: the Tablelands, NL, CAN and The Cedars, CA, USA both Phanerozoic in age. These continental sites share geochemical characteristics that make these environments challenging for life, such as high pH, low Eh, scarce electron acceptors, and limited dissolved inorganic carbon for autotrophic growth. However, microbiological analyses have demonstrated that life does indeed exist in these environments. While environmental genomic studies indicated the potential metabolic capabilities of microorganisms in the sites, actual microbial metabolic activities in these environments remain unknown. To expand the understanding of biogeochemistry of the sites, we are conducting studies focusing on chemical and isotopic measurements, carbon substrate utilization, energy sources, and metabolic pathways of the microorganisms. Thus far, in situ geochemical data suggests that the methane from the Tablelands is primarily non-microbial, while the methane from The Cedars likely has some microbial contributions. To date, substrate addition microcosm experiments show no microbial production of methane from Tablelands’ water and sediments. However, microbial carbon monoxide utilization has been observed in Tableland microcosms, but not in The Cedars microcosms. These results demonstrate how geochemistry and substrate addition experiments can be complementary for the determination of the processes favored at these continental sites of serpentinization.",

Those models estimate discharge with large uncertainties, due to the complex interaction between climate and hydrology, the limited availability and quality of data, as well as model uncertainties. A new purely data-driven scale-extrapolation method to estimate discharge for a large region solely from selected small sub-basins, which are typically 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller than the large region, has been developed. When tested in the Baltic Sea drainage basin, the method was able to provide accurate discharge estimation for the gauged area with sub-basins that cover 5% of the gauged area. There exist multiple sets of sub-basins whose climate and hydrology resemble those of the gauged area equally well. Those multiple sets estimate annual discharge for the gauged area consistently well with 6 % average error. The scale-extrapolation method is completely data-driven; therefore it does not force any modelling error into the prediction. The scale-extrapolation method is now further tested at continent scale in Europe and North America to exam its potential for climate change studies.",

The SAGE project seeks to understand the relative roles played by grain size changes, black carbon (BC), dust, and surface melt in decreasing the albedo of the high elevation areas of the GIS. Traverses were conducted in 2013 and 2014, sampling a total of 67 snow pits across much of northwestern Greenland to characterize snow microphysics and the deposition of absorbing impurities over the prior 1-2 annual cycles, with particular attention paid to sampling the 2012 melt layer. Results show elevated biomass burning derived BC levels in summer 2012 and elevated dust concentrations in spring 2013 at some sites, both particularly in the central areas of the ice sheet. Observations and modeling results indicate, however, that the albedo impact of these modest enhancements in impurity concentrations was very minimal (<<1%) in the dry snow environment. Grain metamorphosis in dry snow and surface wetting/grain growth occurring when melt extends to higher elevations appear to be the most important processes controlling albedo change across the high elevations of the Greenland ice sheet.",

            "abstract": "Information from ice cores from the world’s highest mountains in the Tropics demonstrates both local climate variability and a high degree of teleconnectivity across the Pacific basin. Here we examine recently recovered ice core records from glaciers near Puncak Jaya in Papua, Indonesia, which lie on the highest peak between the Himalayas and the South American Andes. These glaciers are located on the western side of the Tropical Pacific warm pool, which is the “center of action” for interannual climate variability dominated by El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO either directly or indirectly affects most regions of Earth and their populations. In 2010, two ice cores measuring 32.13 m and 31.25 m were recovered to bedrock from the East Northwall Firn ice field. Both have been analyzed in high resolution (~3 cm sample length, 1156 and 1606 samples, respectively) for stable isotopes, dust, major ions and tritium concentrations. To better understand the controls on the oxygen isotopic (δ18 O) signal for this region, daily rainfall samples were collected between January 2013 and February 2014 at five weather stations over a distance of ~90 km ranging from 9 meters above sea level (masl) on the southern coast up to 3945 masl. The calculated isotopic lapse rate for this region is 0.24 ‰/100m. Papua, Indonesian ice core records are compared to ice core records from Dasuopu Glacier in the central Himalayas and from Quelccaya, Huascarán, Hualcán and Coropuna ice fields in the tropical Andes of Peru on the eastern side of the Pacific Ocean. The composite of the annual isotopic time series from these cores is significantly (R2 =0.53) related to tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs), reflecting the strong linkage between tropical Pacific SSTs associated with ENSO and tropospheric temperatures in the low latitudes. New data on the already well-documented concomitant loss of ice on Quelccaya, Kilimanjaro in eastern Africa and the ice fields near Puncak Jaya reinforce the hypothesis that large-scale tropical processes dominate recent tropical glacier retreat. The observed widespread melting of glaciers is consistent with model predictions of a vertical amplification of temperature, which is documented by increasing isotopic enrichment in ice cores from high elevation glaciers throughout the Tropics.",

Project-based modules were developed and taught by MS and HS teachers who participated in climate change education workshops. UG students enrolled in a climate science course completed independent research projects that provided the basis for several of the HS/MS modules. All modules required students to acquire and analyze historical temperature data and future climate predictions, and apply their analysis to the solution of a societal or environmental problem related to our changing climate.\nThree versions of a quantitative survey were developed and used in a pre-test/post-test research design to help evaluate the project’s impact on MS, HS, and UG students’ climate literacy, which includes broad climate knowledge as well as affective and behavioral aspects. Content objectives were guided primarily by the 2009 document, Climate Literacy: The Essential Principles of Climate Sciences. All three groups of students made modest but statistically significant cognitive (p<<0.001) and affective (p<0.01) gains; UG students also showed an increase in behavior scores (p=0.001). Results of an ANCOVA showed significant differences in students’ cognitive (p<0.001), behavioral (p=0.005) and self-efficacy (p=0.012) outcomes among the 9 participating MS and HS classrooms, where both teacher and module content varied.\nThe presentation will include a description of some key aspects of the project-based curricula developed and used in this research, the development and content of the climate literacy survey, and the interpretation of specific pre/post changes in participating students relative to the content of and approach used in the project-based modules.",

            "abstract": "Chemical and textural features of crystals provide unique constrains on the processes and rates that occur during the growth, replenishment and eruption of magma reservoirs. Recent studies that use different methods have highlighted that many eruptions are issued from reservoirs that may grow for up to hundreds of thousands years (e.g, U-Th series of mineral separates, zircon dating). In contrast, the effect of new magma injections (recharges) can influence the thermodynamic state of reservoirs on a much shorter scale. In extreme cases it can lead to remobilization of magmas over months (for small reservoirs) to thousands of years (for larger systems). Modeling of mineral zoning provides a lower bound estimate for the timescales associated with magma recharge because (a) they do not record dissolution/resorbtion of phases and (b) they only record the time at which a crystal reacts to a thermodynamic change, which does not necessarily equate with the timing of an intrusion. In open system reservoirs, magmas may experience significant thermal and compositional fluctuations over time, and so far, only simple cooling scenarios [1] have been considered. In particular, under what conditions does a recharge lead to an eruption? Can large recharge events be mostly recycled and partially involved in later eruptions? Here we combine new forward models of magma chamber replenishment and evolution [2] that track the thermodynamic evolution of shallow resevoir with crystal zoning models. We explore several scenarios of magma reservoir growth and evolution and compare them to the time scales obtained from the crystal zoning (e.g. thermal history and boundary condition changes with time). Inverse modeling of natural crystal zoning profiles from the silicic eruptions of Rabaul caldera in 1994 and 2006 allows us to distinguish between scenarios where inputs of fresh magma leads to eruption and recharges that are accommodated by the reservoir over longer time scales and are expressed over many subsequent eruptions [3]. Differentiating between these scenarios is crucial for proper interpretation of monitoring signals and anticipation of the eruptions. [1] Costa et al (2008), Rev. Min.

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is central to the ecology and chemistry of inland waters as an energy and nutrient source, transporter of heavy metals and other pollutants, and a control on light attenuation. In this research, we examine the manner in which hydrologic variation interacts with biogeochemical processes to affect the utilization and concentrations of DOM throughout streams and rivers of a large drainage basin. The Pulse-Shunt Concept (PSC) forms the framework for our analysis. The PSC is based, in part, on field observations of pulsed inputs of terrestrial DOM to streams of headwater catchments during high-discharge events that are associated with rainfall and snowmelt. The pulse is followed by the shunt, which occurs as rising flows rapidly transmit terrestrially derived DOM from headwater streams to larger streams and rivers of the drainage network. Owing to the reduction in channel residence times, the shunt perturbs the downstream gradient in DOM lability and compositional diversity established under base-flow conditions, leading to the riverine export of biochemically reactive DOM that has retained its terrestrial signature. We explore the fate of terrestrial DOM subsidies in context of the PSC by developing a simple model that routes water and DOM through an idealized 200,000 km2 basin. This basin is drained by a dendritic channel network comprised of 30,000 first- through seventh-order streams that ultimately feed a 500-km long, eighth-order river. Published scaling laws are used to specify the numbers, lengths, and connectivities of the stream segments, while the routing algorithm describes the precipitation-induced delivery of terrestrial DOM to headwater reaches and the down-network changes in DOM concentrations resulting from rate-limited decomposition and mixing of waters from different reaches. Results of model simulations conducted to date underscore the dominant contribution of low-frequency precipitation events to the annual subsidy of terrestrial DOM to the drainage network. The results also suggest that most of this DOM subsidy is utilized in large rivers, far from where it enters the drainage network.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture represents an important near-term option for GHG offsets. Currently, the most widely accepted low-cost approaches to quantify N2O and CH4 emissions are based on emission factors. Given that N2O and CH4 emissions from agricultural practices exhibit high spatial and temporal variability, emission factors are not very sensitive to estimate this variability in emissions at the farm level, even when the emission factors are regional. It is clear that if agricultural offset projects are going to include N2O and CH4 reductions, then process-based biogeochemical models are potentially important tools to quantify emission reductions within offset protocols. The question remains how good a model’s performance is with respect to emission reductions. As PBM, are integrated into protocols for agricultural GHG offsets, comprehensive and systematic validation is needed to statistically quantify uncertainties in model-based estimates of GHG emission reductions that are obtained by standardized approach to parameterization and calibration that can be applied across a whole region.\nThe DNDC model was validated against 88 datasets of rice methane emissions. Data were collected at sites in California and MidSouth. In addition to examining the magnitude of the measured versus modeled emissions, we analyzed model performance for estimating the changes in emissions associated with a change in management practices (e.g. dry versus wet seeded rice, different fertilizer rates, etc.). We analyzed 100 pairs of modeled and measured emission reductions. DNDC model performance and uncertainty was quantified using a suite of statistical measures. First, we examined how well the modeled emissions differences match the field-measured differences on a case-by-case basis and also on average, using a combination of Monte Carlo approaches and equivalence testing. Although modeled emissions for individual fields show a slight bias, emissions reductions for baseline:treatment pairs fall close to the 1:1 line. We illustrate how these results can be used to drive a Margin Of Safety (MOS) uncertainty deduction. The magnitude and impacts of the MOS deduction depend on how emissions are bundled at the field, project, or market levels.",

            "abstract": "Water exchange between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea has important effects on world hydrography, and the exchange varies on both shorter and longer time scales in response to climate, sea-level and tectonics. Drift deposits cored during IODP Exp. 339 provide new information about the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) history. Drift sediments are primarily muddy but they often include layers with coarse silt and sand-sized material which are termed silty or sandy contourites. Several coarser layers are being studied in detail using high-resolution grain size and CAT scanning techniques, along with analysis of the sand fraction and thin section, X-ray and XRF techniques to characterize the beds and the events which created them. Many coarser beds are mixtures of finer sediment, often (but not always) similar in grain size to the sediment deposited before and/or after the bed, and coarser sediment which often (but not always) overlaps in grain size with the finer sediment in the contourite layer. The coarser sediments may have accumulated during numerous shorter episodes of higher-speed flow while the finer sediments may have accumulated at times when flow speeds were reduced. Bioturbation has usually mixed the two or more grain size populations to form the observed layers, and grain-size grading patterns as well as the size and amount of coarser material may relate to the nature of the flow events which formed them. Hiatuses at bed contacts and within beds suggest that flows were erosional at times. At most sites, two or three drill holes 10 to 100 m apart were collected, and sediments in adjacent drill holes could be correlated based on sediment properties. While the nature and sequence of contourite layers in adjacent holes are often quite similar, correlated beds can have somewhat different thickness, grain sizes and layering patterns. This lateral variability may be due to the presence of larger bed forms or other larger-scale depositional or erosional process. While these silty and sandy contourites apparently provide important information about the both the short-term and long-term history of MOW events, we need to distinguish variations related to current flow history with those related to bed forms or other local sedimentary processes to fully characterize the nature and effects of these deep currents.",

            "abstract": "Unlike the strong decline in Arctic sea ice, Antarctic sea ice is experiencing a weak overall increase in area that is the residual of opposing regional trends. This study considers the seasonal pattern of these trends. In addition to traditional ice concentration and ice area, temporal rates of change of these quantities are investigated (“intensification” and “expansion,” respectively). This is crucial to the attribution of the Antarctic sea ice trends, since changes in wind or thermal forcing directly affect ice areal change, rather than ice area itself. The study shows that diverse regional trends all contribute significantly to the overall Antarctic sea-ice increase. In contrast to the widely-held view of a 'south Pacific dipole', trends in the Weddell and Amundsen-Bellingshausen regions are found to best compensate in magnitude and seasonality. Perhaps most importantly, the largest concentration trends, in autumn, are actually caused by intensification trends during spring. Autumn intensification trends directly oppose autumn concentration trends in most places, seemingly as a result of ice and ocean feedbacks. Further study of changes during the spring melting season is therefore required to unravel the Antarctic sea ice increase.",

            "abstract": "In an era dubbed the Anthropocene, the natural world is being transformed by a myriad of human influences. As anthropogenic impacts permeate hydrologic systems, hydrologists are challenged to fully account for such changes and develop new methods of hydrologic design. Deterministic watershed models (DWM), which can account for the impacts of changes in land use, climate and infrastructure, are becoming increasing popular for the design of flood and/or drought protection measures. As with all models that are calibrated to existing datasets, DWMs are subject to model error or uncertainty. In practice, the model error component of DWM predictions is typically ignored yet DWM simulations which ignore model error produce model output which cannot reproduce the statistical properties of the observations they are intended to replicate. In the context of hydrologic design, we demonstrate how ignoring model error can lead to systematic downward bias in flood quantiles, upward bias in drought quantiles and upward bias in water supply yields. By reincorporating model error, we document how DWM models can be used to generate results that mimic actual observations and preserve their statistical behavior. In addition to use of DWM for improved predictions in a changing world, improved communication of the risk and reliability is also needed. Traditional statements of risk and reliability in hydrologic design have been characterized by return periods, but such statements often assume that the annual probability of experiencing a design event remains constant throughout the project horizon. We document the general impact of nonstationarity on the average return period and reliability in the context of hydrologic design. Our analyses reveal that return periods do not provide meaningful expressions of the likelihood of future hydrologic events. Instead, knowledge of system reliability over future planning horizons can more effectively prepare society and communicate the likelihood of future hydrologic events of interest.",

            "abstract": "The Turkey Creek caldera of Southeastern Arizona formed as the result of the catastrophic eruption of more than 500 km3 of high-silica rhyolite (Rhyolite Canyon Tuff). This event occurred ~27 Ma and was coincident with the early phases of Basin and Range extension. The emplacement of the ignimbrite was immediately followed by a resurgent intrusion of dacite/monzonite porphyry (DPI), some of which reached the surface as crystal-rich dacite lavas (DPL) along the ring fault. Due to uplift and erosion, the intracaldera and outflow facies of the Rhyolite Canyon Tuff (RCT) and resurgent intrusion are well-exposed, which renders this an ideal laboratory for examining the plutonic-volcanic connection in a mid- to upper-crustal environment.\nWe examined the potential petrogenetic link between the crystal-poor rhyolite and the crystal-rich intermediate intrusion and lavas through zircon CA-TIMS geochronology and ICP-MS trace element analyses. CA-TIMS U-Pb dates indicate that the RCT and DPI/DPL were coeval, forming over a protracted period of time (>300 kyrs.) prior to the catastrophic event. The trace element data (e.g. Lu/Sc, Y/Hf, Dy/Y) for the individual zircons in the dacitic/monzonitic units and erupted rhyolite record a continuous trend that is interpreted to reflect crystal fractionation. The combination of zircon U-Pb dating and trace element analyses also allows us to trace the apparent timing and duration of the rhyolite melt extraction from the intermediate mush, as the trace element ratios for the rhyolite diverge from those of the DPI approx. 100-150 kyrs. before eruption. This protracted timescale for building an intermediate mush large enough to hold 500 km3 of rhyolite is consistent with that observed for other large ignimbrites in arc settings.",

            "abstract": "Mesospheric clouds have been detected first from Earth (Bell et al 1996 [1]), then from Mars orbit (MGS/TES and MOC, Clancy et al 1998 [2]). Their composition (CO2) was inferred from temperature. Similar detection and temperature-inferred composition was then performed by Spicam and PFS on board Mars Express (Monmessin et al [3], Formisano et al [4]., 2006).\nThe first direct detection and characterization (altitude, composition, velocity) was performed by OMEGA/ Mars Express (then coupled to HRSC/ Mars Express, and confirmed by CRISM/MRO (Montmessin et al. [5], 2007, Maattanen et al [6]., Scholten et al. [7], 2010, Vincendon et al [8]., 2011).\nOmega is a very powerful tool for the study of CO2 clouds as it is able to unambiguously identify the CO2 composition of a cloud based on a near-IR spectral feature located at 4.26 µm [5],. Therefore since the beginning of the Mars Express mission (2004) OMEGA as done a systematic survey of these mesospheric clouds. Thanks to the orbit of Mars Express, we can observe this clouds from different altitudes (from apocenter to pericenter) and at different local times.\nWe will present the result of 6 Martians years of observations and point out a correlation with the dust activity.\nWe also observe that their time of appearance/disappearance varies slightly from year to year.\nWe will mention also the existence of mesospheric H2O clouds.",

            "abstract": "Climate change in high northern latitudes is predicted to be greater in winter than in summer, and to have increasing, widespread impacts in northern ecosystems. Some of the resulting unknowns are the effects of an increasing frequency of sudden, short-lasting winter warming events, which can lead to rain on snow (ROS). Very little is known about ROS in northern regions, and even less about its cumulative impact on surface energy balance, permafrost, snow melt, and hydrological processes. Since, wintertime warming events have become more frequent in sub-Arctic regions, ROS event characteristics (frequency, extent, and duration) may represent new and relevant climate indicators. However, ROS event detection is challenging.\nIn this presentation, we propose new approaches to monitor the occurrence of ROS events using satellite passive and active microwave sensors. Specifically, we utilize observations from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), Global Precipitation Measurements (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI), and GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). GPM was launched in February, 2014. It operates multiple radiometers (in the frequency range 10 – 183 GHz), and two radars (Ku and Ka bands). GPM observations are used to quantify rainfall or snowfall rates and are thus appropriate to monitor ROS events up to 66° North.\nOur satellite monitoring of the ROS event is based on both temporal and spectral variations in the satellite observations. We discuss the observed ROS radiometric signatures using a Multi-Layer microwave emission model based on the Dense Media Radiative Transfer theory (DMRT-ML). In addition, our monitoring is evaluated against atmospheric reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim, and NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). This initial evaluation in winter months shows that the proposed ROS detection using microwave sensors occur in areas that are shown by the reanalysis data to be experiencing liquid precipitation while there is snow on the ground.",

            "abstract": "Statistical models consistently out-perform conceptual models in the short term, however to account for a nonstationary future (or an unobserved past) scientists prefer to base predictions on unchanging and commutable properties of the universe – i.e., physics.\nThe problem with physically-based hydrology models is, of course, that they aren’t really based on physics – they are based on statistical approximations of physical interactions, and we almost uniformly lack an understanding of the entropy associated with these approximations. Thermodynamics is successful precisely because entropy statistics are computable for homogeneous (well-mixed) systems, and ergodic arguments explain the success of Newton’s laws to describe systems that are fundamentally quantum in nature. Unfortunately, similar arguments do not hold for systems like watersheds that are heterogeneous at a wide range of scales.\nRay Solomonoff formalized the situation in 1968 by showing that given infinite evidence, simultaneously minimizing model complexity and entropy in predictions always leads to the best possible model. The open question in hydrology is about what happens when we don’t have infinite evidence – for example, when the future will not look like the past, or when one watershed does not behave like another. How do we isolate stationary and commutable components of watershed behavior?\nI propose that one possible answer to this dilemma lies in a formal combination of physics and statistics. In this talk I outline my recent analogue (Solomonoff’s theorem was digital) of Solomonoff’s idea that allows us to quantify the complexity/entropy tradeoff in a way that is intuitive to physical scientists. I show how to formally combine “physical” and statistical methods for model development in a way that allows us to derive the theoretically best possible model given any given physics approximation(s) and available observations. Finally, I apply an analogue of Solomonoff’s theorem to evaluate the tradeoff between model complexity and prediction power.",

Recently, it has been reported that the Al bearing phase H can transport water into the core-mantle boundary (Ohira et al. 2014) and the melting of phase H at the core mantle boundary may contribute to the cause of ultra-low velocity zones (Andrault et al. 2014). Therefore, there is a possibility of the existence of huge water circulation from the surface to the core-mantle boundary regions and the effects of water on the minerals at the bottom of lower mantle should be investigated. In this study, we will discuss the possible effects of water on the elasticity and seismic anisotropy on bridgmanite and post-bridgmanite, and relative phase stabilities of phase H, bridgmanite and post-bridgmanite at the bottom of lower mantle based on the first principles calculation results.",

            "abstract": "The modern subarctic North Pacific constitutes one of the high-nutrient-low-chlorophyll regions of the modern ocean, where nitrate is perennially abundant at the surface. In a sediment core from the western subarctic North Pacific (SNP), we report the foraminifera-bound δ15N (FB-δ15N, in Neogloboquadrina pachyderma and Globigerina bulloides) and diatom-bound d15N (DB-δ15N) back to the last glacial maximum (LGM), to infer past changes in the degree of surface nitrate consumption. The δ15N of all recorders is higher during the LGM, indicating more complete nitrate consumption over the course of the spring-to-summer maximum in phytoplankton growth. N. pachyderma FB-δ15N is similar to DB-d15N in the Holocene but 2.3‰ higher than DB-δ15N during the LGM, a difference that is consistent with reduced wintertime nitrate supply during the LGM. Unlike DB-δ15N, FB-δ15N does not decrease from the LGM into HS1, which supports the previous suggestion that the HS1 DB-δ15N drop is due to contamination by sponge spicules. FB-δ15N decreases in the latter half of the Bolling/Allerod (B/A) warm period, rises weakly during the Younger Dryas (YD) cold period, followed by a decline into the mid-Holocene. The FB-δ15N records, together with changes in the biogenic flux reconstructed from this site, suggest that the coupling between cold climate and reduced nitrate supply that characterizes the LGM-to-Holocene difference also applied to the deglacial events. The indications for this coupling are strengthened by a correction of the FB- and DB-δ15N data for denitrification-driven increases in the δ15N of subsurface nitrate during the B/A and post-YD period.",

            "abstract": "Lake Towuti is a large tectonic lake in central Sulawesi, Indonesia that provides a unique opportunity to reconstruct climate and terrestrial environments in the heart of the Indo-Pacific warm pool. Long-term climate variations in this region are governed by a complex interplay between the Australasian monsoons and the ENSO system forced by changing insolation, sea level, ice sheets, and greenhouse gas concentrations. Existing reconstructions suggest heterogeneous responses of Indonesian climate to these forcings, highlighting the need for new long records of regional hydrology.\nWe have developed multiproxy datasets from Lake Towuti and nearby lakes that provide continuous, detailed, and reproducible paleoenvironmental records spanning the past 60 kyr BP. Elemental tracers of terrestrial runoff and compound-specific stable isotope records of vegetation show that wet conditions and rainforest ecosystems persisted during Marine Isotope Stage 3 and the Holocene, and were interrupted by severe drying between 33 and 15 kyr BP when high-latitude ice sheets expanded and global temperatures cooled. This chronology of change implies that central Indonesian hydroclimate varies strongly in response to high-latitude climate forcing. New vegetation records from nearby lakes confirm these findings, but suggest the amplitude of glacial-interglacial changes in vegetation were weaker at high altitude, with important implications for the heterogeneity among Indonesian climate reconstructions. New lithologic and trace element records from Lake Towuti further document the significance of climate changes at the MIS3, 2, and 1 boundaries to Lake Towuti’s paleolimnology, heat budget, and seasonal mixing.\nHigh-resolution seismic reflection data from Lake Towuti constrain the maximum depth of lake level lowstands during MIS2. Hydrological modeling suggests that precipitation was reduced by at least 50% at that time, an amplitude at or above the upper limits of precipitation changes simulated by global climate models forced with MIS2 boundary conditions. These findings suggest that changes in regional precipitation were accompanied by large increases in evaporation, requiring large reductions in cloud cover and humidity and providing new constraint on these hitherto unstudied climate variables.",

Ideally, responders in areas that are commonly affected by disasters would have access to archived remote sensing imagery plus the ability to easily obtain the new post event data products. The cost of obtaining and storing the data and the lack of trained professionals who can process the data into a mapping product oftentimes prevent this from happening.\nUSGS Emergency Operations provides remote sensing and geospatial support to emergency managers by providing access to satellite images from numerous domestic and international space agencies including those affiliated with the International Charter Space and Major Disasters and their space-based assets and by hosting and distributing thousands of near real time event related images and map products through the Hazards Data Distribution System (HDDS). These data may include digital elevation models, hydrographic models, base satellite images, vector data layers such as roads, aerial photographs, and other pre and post disaster data. These layers are incorporated into a Web-based browser and data delivery service, the Hazards Data Distribution System (HDDS). The HDDS can be made accessible either to the general public or to specific response agencies. The HDDS concept anticipates customer requirements and provides rapid delivery of data and services.\nThis presentation will provide an overview of remotely sensed imagery that is currently available to support emergency response operations and examples of products that have been created for past events that have provided near real time situational awareness for responding agencies.",

            "abstract": "By investigating the inter-comparison between individual model and multi-model ensemble (MME) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), model uncertainty on summer precipitation over Eastern China is analyzed. Although MME has the ability in reproducing summer precipitation over Eastern China, large model spread exists among models in both climatology and interannual variation. The model uncertainties are small in relatively weak rainfall, but large in heavy or none rainfall. Two possible reasons are proposed for the large uncertainties: different partitioning of stratiform/convective precipitation and horizontal resolutions. As a continued work, sensitivity of uncertainty to model resolutions are further investigated from the aspect of global precipitation. High-resolution MME (HMME) has much lower-frequency but stronger precipitation events than low-resolution MME (LMME) over most tropical regions. The partitions of convective and stratiform precipitation are quite different between the HMME and LMME: the former has much higher ratio of stratiform precipitation while the latter has more convective precipitation. Additionally, the large differences in precipitation between the HMME and LMME are related to differences in the SST and its accompanied large-scale circulation.",

We develop a simple model for steady, uniform transport in aeolian saltation over a horizontal bed that is based on the computation of periodic particle trajectories in a turbulent shearing flow [2]. The wind and the particles interact through drag, and the particles collide with the bed. We consider collisions with a rigid, bumpy bed, from which the particles rebound, and an erodible particle bed, for which a collision involves both rebound and particle ejection. The difference in the nature of the collisions results in qualitative differences in the nature of the solutions for the periodic trajectories and, in particular, to differences in the dependence of the particle flow rate on the strength of the turbulent shearing. We also discuss the pertinence of this model to describe bedload transport in water.\n",

Operation IceBridge utilizes a highly specialized fleet of research aircraft and the most sophisticated suite of innovative science instruments ever assembled to characterize annual changes in thickness of sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets. In addition, Operation IceBridge collects critical data used to predict the response of Earth’s polar ice to climate change and resulting sea-level rise. IceBridge also helps bridge the gap in polar observations between NASA's ICESat satellite missions. Combined with previous aircraft observations, as well as ICESat, CryoSat-2 and the forthcoming ICESat-2 observations, Operation IceBridge will produce a cross-calibrated 17-year time series of ice sheet and sea-ice elevation data over Antarctica, as well as a 27-year time series over Greenland. These time series will be a critical resource for predictive models of sea ice and ice sheet behavior. In addition to laser altimetry, Operation IceBridge is using a comprehensive suite of instruments to produce a three-dimensional view of the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets, ice shelves and the sea ice. The suite includes two NASA laser altimeters, the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) and the Land, Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS); four radar systems from the University of Kansas’ Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS), a Ku-band radar altimeter, accumulation radar, snow radar and the Multichannel Coherent Radar Depth Sounder (MCoRDS); a Sander Geophysics airborne gravimeter (AIRGrav), a magnetometer and a high-resolution stereographic camera (DMS). Since its start in 2009, Operation IceBridge has deployed 8 geophysical survey aircraft and 19 science instruments. All IceBridge data is freely available from NSIDC (http://nsidc.org/data/icebridge) 6 months after completion of a campaign.",

            "abstract": "We have previously presented joint inversions of geodetic data for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) fields that employ a Bayesian framework for the combination of data and models. Data sets used include GNSS, GRACE gravity, and tide-gauge data, in order to estimate three-dimensional crustal deformation, geoid rate, relative sea-level change (RSLC). The benefit to this approach is that solutions are less dependent on any particular Earth/ice model used to calculate the GIA fields, and instead employ a suite of GIA predictions that are then used to calculate statistical constraints. This approach was used both for the determination of the SNARF geodetic reference frame for North America, and for a study of GIA in Fennoscandia (Hill et al., 2010). One challenge to the method we developed is that the inherent reduction in resolution of, and correlation among, GRACE Stokes coefficients caused by the destriping procedure (Swenson and Wahr, 2006; Duan et al., 2009) was not accounted for. This important obstacle has been overcome by developing a Bayesian approach to destriping (Wang et al., in prep.). However, important issues of mixed resolution of these data types still remain. In this presentation, we report on the progress of this effort, and present a new GIA field for North America. For the first time, the region used in the solution includes Greenland, in order to provide internally consistent solutions for GIA, the spatial and temporal variability of present-day sea-level change, and present-day melting in Greenland.",

            "abstract": "Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) has proven useful in asessing the fate of groundwater contamination. However, although evidence of diffuse pesticide degradation is crucial, and CSIA methods have been developed for several pesticides, there is a clear lack of field CSIA data of pesticides. This study now presents the first analysis of field CSIA data from a 47-ha agricultural headwater catchment (Alteckendorf, Alsace, France) in the period March to August 2012. Measured stream concentrations of the two investigated chloroacetanilide herbicides (S-metolachlor and acetochlor) were highest (65 μg/L) following an intense rainfall event in the first month after herbicide application. Carbon isotope ratios increased with more than 2 ‰ in 3 months, which indicates the occurrence of herbicide degradation during transport to the stream. Previously, field CSIA data have also been simulated with reactive transport models to evaluate degradation of groundwater contaminants. This study now presents such a model-assisted interpretation of CSIA data for the first time at catchment scale, which aims at exploring the added value of CSIA in monitoring and modelling of pesticide pollution. The conceptual mathematical model succeeded in reproducing the general trend in concentrations and carbon isotope ratios of metolachlor. It also allowed for the quantification of metolachlor degradation (above 70 % during the study period), and yielded a mass export of 1.8 % of the applied pesticide, which is in agreement with the measured pesticide export. The field concentration and CSIA data informed the model building by indicating the importance of overland flow, and slow pesticide degradation in groundwater compared to the upper soil zone. Moreover, incorporation of the field CSIA data into model calibration slightly reduced model uncertainty in the quantification of pesticide degradation. We suggest that a finer temporal CSIA resolution than possible in this study, especially during base flow conditions, would result in a more significant reduction of model uncertainty. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate how a combined monitoring and modelling approach of concentration and CSIA data can result in an improved understanding of pesticide transport and degradation at catchment scale.",

Many studies have imaged this reflector in previous years, many of them in high-velocity regions that could be due to slab graveyards, and many interpretations have been published previously. Since the discovery of the post-perovskite phase transition ten years ago, the D\" reflector has often been interpreted as the place of the phase transition. Even looking at waveforms, polarities, deeper reflectors and amplitudes of the reflected waves has shown agreement with properties of post-perovskite and the confidence of it as the cause for the D\" reflector has been increasing. Here we are looking at several new places and identify D\" reflections in P and S-waves: we target especially low velocity regions and places, where we do not expect slab material in the lowermost mantle. We test waveforms, polarities, amplitudes, timing and frequency content of the reflected waves and compare these across many diverse regions in the mantle. It seems that post-perovskite can still explain many observations; however, a large number of assumptions has to be made to explain all observations in all regions simultaneously and leaves the question whether the reflector in D\" can always be explained through a phase transition to post-perovskite or whether we have to consider other possibilities.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the transition between effusive and explosive activity in dome-forming volcanoes remains a challenging question for eruption forecasting and eruptive scenario definition. The explosive activity of 26 Oct. and 5 Nov. during the 2010 eruption of Merapi volcano offers the opportunity to explore this transition by quantifying the mechanisms that led to the dome explosion.\nForty-three pumice samples were analyzed by 1) scanning electron microscope for textural analysis and 2) elemental analyzer for water content. The SEM images were processed so as to determine the proportions of gas bubbles, microlites and glass in each sample. These data were combined with the glass water content to feed the simple physical model developed by Burgisser et al. [1,2] to calculate pre-explosive pressure, depth, and porosity level for each pyroclastic pumice sample.\nPreliminary results indicate that the water content in the melt is high, reaching 7 wt.%. These water contents yield a wide range of pre-eruptive pressures. Samples from 26 Oct. originated at pressures from a few MPa to 280 MPa. These pressures correspond to depths ranging from a few hundred meters to more than 10 km. This suggests that large overpressures were associated with conduit evacuation that reached unexpected depths. Samples from the 5 Nov. event range from ~10 to ~100 MPa. This suggests that this event also evacuated a large part of the volcanic conduit. Pre-explosive porosities of both events are low (<10 vol. %) along the depth of the entire conduit, which suggests extensive permeable outgassing of the magma-filed conduit prior to each explosive evacuation.\nOngoing work includes analysis of melt CO2 content due to preliminary evidence that it played an important role in the 2010 Merapi eruption. The modeled conduit properties serve as baseline data for conduit flow modeling and building plausible eruptive scenarios.\n[1] Burgisser et al. (2010) J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res. 194, 27-41.

In this paper, laboratory experiments are conducted to simulate adsorbed Cr(VI) transfer from soil into runoff. A two-layer in-mixing analytical model is developed to to analyze laboratory experimental results. A data assimilation (DA) method via the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is used to update parameters and improve predictions. In comparison with the observed data, DA results are much better than forward model predictions. Based on the used rainfall and relevant physical principles, the updated value of the incomplete mixing coefficient is about 7.4 times of the value of the incomplete mixing coefficient in experiment 1 and about 14.0 times in experiment 2, which indicates the loss of Cr(VI) in soil solute is mainly due to infiltration, rather than surface runoff. With the increase of soil adsorption ability and the mixing layer depth, the loss of soil solute will decrease. These results provide information for preventing and reducing the agricultural nonpoint source pollution.",

They were composed by less than 20 sites each, mainly over undisturbed forest and without a strong coordination between sites, in particular across the ocean.\nIn the following years the networks grew exponentially both at continental and global level, reaching more than 500 sites few years ago and expanding the eddy covariance measurement to different ecosystem types, climate regions and management/disturbance regimes. At the same time, important steps were done in terms of cooperation and harmonization related to data processing, data description and data sharing policies, leading to inter-continental and global activities under the FLUXNET framework.\nToday the networks are facing a new evolution step, moving from pure research activities to something that includes also monitoring and research infrastructure characteristics. AmeriFlux and NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) in USA and ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System) in Europe are opening a new phase in the eddy covariance networks: with a long term perspective, increased level of standardization and a completely open access policy, will hopefully stimulate even more global synthesis studies and a wider use of the flux measurements by other scientific communities. AmeriFlux, NEON and ICOS are also strongly involved in cross-networks harmonization activities in terms of data acquisition, data processing and data format, in order to simplify and encourage the joint use of their measurements.\nA brief history of the development, challenges and solutions in the organization of the different networks and their common activities will be presented, to focus then on selected scientific results that have been possible only thanks to the global integration and international collaboration and finally discuss future developments and current ongoing activities in terms of data harmonization/standardization and sharing.",

            "abstract": "Two complementary lines of evidence support the early anthropogenic hypothesis.\nTop-down evidence comes from comparing Holocene greenhouse-gas trends with those during equivalent intervals of previous interglaciations. The increases in CO2 and CH4 during the late Holocene are anomalous compared to the decreasing trends in a stacked average of previous interglaciations, thereby supporting an anthropogenic origin. During interglacial stage 19, the closest Holocene insolation analog, CO2 fell to 245 ppm by the time equivalent to the present, in contrast to the observed pre-industrial rise to 280-285 ppm. The 245-ppm level measured in stage 19 falls at the top of the natural range predicted by the original anthropogenic hypothesis of Ruddiman (2003).\n Bottom-up evidence comes from a growing list of archeological and other compilations showing major early anthropogenic transformations of Earth’s surface. Key examples include: efforts by Dorian Fuller and colleagues mapping the spread of irrigated rice agriculture across southern Asia and its effects on CH4 emissions prior to the industrial era; an additional effort by Fuller showing the spread of methane-emitting domesticated livestock across Asia and Africa (coincident with the spread of fertile crescent livestock across Europe); historical compilations by Jed Kaplan and colleagues documenting very high early per-capita forest clearance in Europe, thus underpinning simulations of extensive pre-industrial clearance and large CO2 emissions; and wide-ranging studies by Erle Ellis and colleagues of early anthropogenic land transformations in China and elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "Super Typhoon Haiyan made a Philippines landfall in November, 2013 as one of the strongest storms in history. The coast of Eastern Samar Province has deep water very close to shore and experienced extreme wave conditions, with hindcast Hs>18m near landfall. These waves generated large shoreline runup, and caused severe damage to coastal communities even though hindcast storm surge was <1m at these locations.\nOne consequence of the storm was the transport of very large (up to 5m length) boulders shoreward to elevations near 10m, where they were stranded as waves and surge diminished. This presentation describes a field survey of a boulder field on Calicoan Island, combined with Boussinesq simulation of the nearshore storm hydrodynamics and boulder transport modeling using a modified version of the Imamura et al. methodology. Results show highly intermittent shoreward boulder transport driven by infragravity runup, with both inertial and drag forces significant. Boulder transport distance was found to be sensitive to wave properties, enough so that it may in some instances be possible to estimate hydrodynamic properties of historical storms.\nThe coastal boulder transport literature often features uncertainty about whether boulder fields with unknown origin were generated by storms or by tsunamis, and has suggested that coastal storms can not transport boulders very far inland. However, the present work demonstrates that the potential to transport large boulders far onshore to high inland elevations does not lie exclusively with tsunamis, but can also be achieved by strong tropical cyclones.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s inner core is elastically anisotropic, with seismology showing faster wave propagation along the polar axis compared to the equatorial plane. Some inner core studies report anisotropic seismic attenuation. Attenuation of body-waves has, previously, been postulated to be due to scattering by anisotropic microstructure, but recent normal mode studies also show strong anisotropic attenuation (Mäkinen et al. 2014). This suggests that the anisotropic attenuation is a result of the intrinsic (and anisotropic) anelastic properties of the solid iron alloy forming Earth’s inner core.\nHere, I consider the origins of inner core anisotropic attenuation. Possibilities include grain boundary relaxation, dislocation bowing/glide, or point defect (alloying element) relaxations. The inner core is an almost perfect environment for near-equilibrium crystallisation, with very low temperature gradients across the inner core, low gravity, and slow crystallisation rates. It is assumed that grain sizes may be of the order of hundreds of metres. This implies vanishingly small volumes of grain boundary, and insignificant grain boundary relaxation. The very high homologous temperature and the absence of obvious deviatoric stress, also leads one to conclude that dislocation densities are low. On the other hand, estimates for light element concentrations are of the order of a few % with O, S, Si, C and H at various times being suggested as candidate elements.\nLight element solutes in hcp metals contribute to intrinsic anelastic attenuation if they occur in sufficient concentrations to pair and form elastic dipoles. Switching of dipoles under the stress of a passing seismic wave will result in anelastic mechanical loss. Such attenuation has been measured in hcp metals in the lab, and is anisotropic due to the intrinsic elastic anisotropy of the host lattice. Such solute pair relaxations result in a “Zener effect”, which is suggested here to be responsible for observed anisotropic seismic attenuation.\nZener relaxation magnitude scales with solute concentrationand is consistent with around 5% loght element. Variations in attenuation are expected in a core with spatially varying concentrations of light element, and attenuation tomography of the inner core could, therefore, be employed to map chemical heterogeneity.",

            "abstract": "Satellite altimeter data collected along densely spaced ground tracks can map the marine gravity field, revealing the tectonic fabric of the sea floor. This application requires high accuracy of the along-track derivative of sea surface height over distances shorter than 80 km, and so is very sensitive to the instrument’s range precision and any factors that produce short-scale along-track correlation of range measurement errors. To date the altimeters that have collected data over a dense network of ground tracks all acquired their largest data sets in Ku band and employing conventional (incoherent) processing.\nTwo new altimeters go beyond conventional Ku instruments. SARAL AltiKa operates as an incoherent altimeter at Ka-band, and CryoSat collects some Ku-band data in a SAR mode to permit coherent processing for aperture synthesis and delay-Doppler calculations. The along-track range noise correlation characteristics of each of these new measurements are different from what has been seen in previous altimeters.\nSARAL AltiKa has a lower noise floor than pre-Cryosat Ku-band instruments and its noise spectrum shows decorrelation at different wavelengths, in partial agreement with theoretical work on speckle noise decorrelation over homogeneous surfaces. This improved noise performance results in demonstrable improvement in the resolution of geoid anomalies over small seamounts.\nRetracking of Cryosat’s SAR mode multi-looked waveform yields a decorrelation of range errors unlike that found in conventional instruments, such that it doesn’t require two-pass retracking to get the best geoid slope resolution. This is due mainly to the waveform’s shape, which yields partial derivatives with respect to geophysical parameter estimates that are more nearly orthogonal than in conventional Ku-band Brown model waveforms.\nFurther understanding of the limits on range precision in these instruments will require understanding of the heterogeneities in reflecting surfaces that are not yet accounted for in standard retracking methods, how these heterogeneities produce errors in range, and how these errors are serially correlated along-track. Some insight may be had by comparing measurements over ocean surfaces with measurements over heterogeneous scenes on land and in coastal zones or leads in sea ice.",

            "abstract": "The link between drought and fire is not universal because for fires to occur rainfall is needed for fuel build-up but drought is required to make vegetation ignitable. We present an overview of how precipitation patterns and changes therein have shaped spatial and temporal variability in fire occurrence and associated carbon emissions over the past 17 years, using the latest version of the satellite-derived Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4). We start in tropical savannas where there is a clear dualistic relation between precipitation and fire and show how trends and interannual variability in rainfall have modified annual emissions in Africa and Australia. Because savannas are the main source of fire carbon emissions, this variability can be seen in atmospheric abundances of several trace gases. We then zoom in on tropical forest regions and show that the link between drought and fire activity is most pronounced in the Indonesian archipelago where tropical peatlands require prolonged droughts to burn. Highest emissions occurred there in 1997-1998 when a strong El Niño hit the region, but also moderate drought years have boosted fire activity here more recently. Recent Amazonian droughts in 2005, 2007, and 2010 also led to increased fire activity in forested regions in South America, mostly in degraded lands and offsetting some of the reductions in carbon emissions from deforestation achieved in Brazil. Finally we focus on the boreal region, where potentially large climate-carbon feedbacks are present due to the strong linkages between drought and fire in combination with climate change and arctic amplification.",

            "abstract": "Globally, drought events are increasing in both frequency and intensity. Spatial and temporal variation in water availability is expected to alter the ecophysiology and structure of forests, with consequent feedbacks to climate change. Extensive tree mortality induced by heat and aridity has been documented across a range of latitudes, and several global vegetation models have simulated widespread forest die-off in the future. The impact of drought on forest structure and function will depend on the differential responses of trees of different sizes. Understanding the size-dependence of drought-induced mortality is necessary to predict local and global impacts. Here we show that in forests worldwide, drought has a greater impact on the growth and mortality of large trees compared to smaller trees. This trend holds true for forests ranging from semiarid woodlands to tropical rainforests. This finding contrasts with what would be expected if deep root access to water were the primary determinant of tree drought response. Rather, the greater drought response of larger trees could be driven by greater inherent vulnerability of large trees to hydraulic stress or by canopy position becoming more of a liability under drought, as exposed crowns face higher evaporative demand. These findings imply that future droughts will have a disproportionate effect on large trees, resulting in a larger feedback to climate change than would occur if all tree size classes were equally affected by drought.",

It is well-accepted that global sea levels have been rising in response to rising global temperatures. The strategy is the development of a Bayesian hierarchical model of sea levels. The hierarchical nature of the model is formulated to enable inference at various spatial scales. Further, temperature is incorporated in the model as a predictor or explanatory variable. Hence, information regarding future sea levels provided by the model rely on information regarding future temperatures. Forming predictions of future temperatures can be done in several\nways, depending on the goals of the analysis. I consider two classes of goals. In the first we seek short-term or medium-range forecasts as in weather-like forecasting. In the second we seek projections of sea levels under various emissions scenarios as in studies of the impacts of climate change. I illustrate methods and results for each class and suggest how results can contribute to decision support. ",

            "abstract": "A simple relaxation-type model (García-Olivares and Herrero, 2013) based on an optimization of Paillard and Parrenin (2004), has been used to predict the future evolution of atmospheric CO2, global ice volume and Antarctic ice cover during the next 300 kyr, with and without the atmospheric CO2 perturbation caused by anthropogenic emissions.\nThe initial atmospheric CO2 condition is obtained after a critical data analysis that sets 1300 Gt as the most realistic carbon Ultimate Recoverable Resources, with the help of a global compartmental model to determine the carbon transfer function to the atmosphere. This analysis sets a peak of emissions on year 2037 AD and a maximum CO2 concentration of 519 ppmv in 2300 AD, leading to 20 kyr of abnormally high greenhouse effect. Weathering compensation and emission of methane from clathrates have also been considered as they have relevant effects on the dynamics of the system after the perturbation.\nThe anthropogenic CO2 pulse clearly perturbs the natural cycle for all model variables during the forthcoming 300 kyr. The present interglacial will be lengthen by 25 kyr, as the anthropogenic perturbation will lead to a delay in the future advance of the ice sheet on the Antarctic shelf and a consequent perturbation of the deep ocean stratification, so the relative maximum of boreal insolation 65 kyr AP will not affect the developing glaciation. Instead, it will be the following insolation peak, about 110 kyr AP, which will find an appropriate climatic state to trigger the next deglaciation. The next glacial maximum will take place about 105 kyr AP and the following interglacial will be delayed forward in time by 44 kyr in relation to unperturbed conditions.\nThis study endorses the idea that relaxation type coupled models, despite their simple structure, may retain the principal Earth's climatic interactions, being capable of accounting for the natural evolution of an externally imposed atmospheric CO2 pulse.\n- Garcia-Olivares, A. and Herrero, C.

After a small number of preliminary orbits during which the orbital period is reduced, approximately 30 science orbits will be executed to explore the interior of Jupiter, hence, its origin. A second primary objective of the mission, and the subject of this talk, is to carry out the first exploration of Jupiter’s polar magnetosphere. All previous missions to Jupiter, including Ulysses, remained at low Jovian latitudes at close range, hence, our knowledge of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere is a composite of remote sensing (such as radio emissions in the hectometric and decametric bands as well as IR and UV images); application of observations of Earth's auroral and polar cap particles, fields, and auroral emissions; and modeling. While these likely inform our expectations of what Juno will actually measure qualitatively, Juno will provide the first in depth exploration of auroral processes at another planet, other than a small number of very brief encounters of Saturn's kilometric radio source region by Cassini. With a reasonably complete suite of in situ magnetospheric measurements coupled with remote sensing, Juno will enable us to compare Jupiter’s polar magnetosphere with those expectations. Certainly, understanding the nature of auroral currents and mechanisms for particle acceleration are high on the list of priorities for these studies. In addition, it is expected that Juno will greatly improve our understanding of the mapping of auroral processes from high latitudes and low altitudes to the middle and outer magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Low oxygen levels within the Murderkill Estuary, DE, are largely driven by organic matter (OM) metabolism and chemical oxygen demand within the fringing salt marshes. To assess how the connectivity to and inundation of salt marshes impact OM quality and cycling within the Estuary, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) data were used to characterize both dissolved and particulate OM pools. Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) identified five fluorophores that illustrated greater tidal variation in the particulate (POM) than dissolved (DOM) OM pools. The terrestrial-wetland and marine OM sources were statistically separated using the fluorophores in conjunction with the elemental composition and isotopic signature of particulates, as well as dissolved water chemistry (e.g. salinity, dissolved nitrogen, carbon, silica, and phosphorus). DOM pools in the Murderkill and leaving the marsh are dominated by soil humics, while POM pools have greater contributions of protein-rich sources and are generally are less processed. Tidal survey results point to the salt marshes as a sink of fine particulates, in particular protein rich OM, and a source of coarse particulates and DOM dominated by humic substances. Results from dark 24-hour bioassays suggest that coarse and fine POM pools are larger drivers of oxygen consumption than DOM pools. Correlations between community respiration rates during ebb tide, water chemistry, and OM fractions suggest that biological oxygen demand in the Murderkill is driven, in part, by the metabolism of protein-rich, phytoplankton from Delaware Bay. Thus, while the bulk of oxygen drawdown occurs within the salt marshes, in-stream metabolism appears to be driven by marine OM pools.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic tomography (HT) is an approach that has been designed to incorporate multiple hydraulic head records for model calibration. The promising performance of HT has been demonstrated through many synthetic, laboratory and field studies. In virtually all studies published to date, geostatistics forms the backbone of the algorithm. While geostatistics offers many advantages, there are some drawbacks. One disadvantage is its highly parameterized nature, which renders it computationally intensive for large-scale problems. This has resulted in the development of alternative HT methods (e.g., geostatistical reduced order, Krylov subspace, and principal component geostatistical methods). Another issue is that HT may produce overly smooth images of subsurface heterogeneity when there are few monitoring interval data. Therefore, one may question the utility of the geostatistics approach in certain situations and seek alternative approaches. For example, the simultaneous calibration of an effective parameter model may be sufficient for water supply studies, as detailed information on heterogeneity may not be necessary. Moreover, when data used for HT are sparse, the simultaneous calibration of a geological model may be more appropriate than a geostatistics approach. To investigate these issues, we conducted a HT study with different subsurface conceptualizations and parameter resolutions. The performance of different models (effective parameter, geological, and geostatistics models) is assessed through model calibration and validation. Calibration data consisted of data from eight pumping tests, while validation data consisted of 16 separate pumping tests not used in the calibration effort. Our ultimate goal is to conduct a field-based study for this comparison; however, we began our investigation in a synthetic, heterogeneous, sedimentary aquifer constructed in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Results show that the geostatistics approach performed the best among the approaches compared, although the geological model with perfect knowledge of the stratigraphy came a close second. This may suggest that the better knowledge of stratigraphy obtained via geophysics or other means may contribute to improved HT results, although further research is necessary.",

            "abstract": "We have investigated interactions between atmospheric thermodynamics, boundary layer aerosol (CCN) concentrations, convective intensity and lightning flash rates (from the TRMM LIS and the Vaisala GLD 360 global network) on three distinct scales, including the global tropical ocean and land masses, the Madden Julian Oscillation genesis region over the central Indian Ocean (CIO) region, and four regions in the U.S., Washington D.C., northern Alabama, central Oklahoma and eastern Colorado. The U.S. locations are each supported by VHF Lightning Mapping Arrays.\nTotal lightning density is shown to increase by a factor of 2-3 as a function of CCN concentration over tropical land and ocean regions. The greatest sensitivity in the lightning vs. aerosol relationship was found in more unstable environments and where warm-cloud depth was intermediate (deep) over land (ocean). The maximum height of 30 dBZ echo tops in lightning producing convective features was found to be insensitive to changes in CCN concentration. However, the vertical profile of radar reflectivity (VPRR) showed a consistent increase of 2-4 dBZ for convective features that developed in more polluted environments, suggesting that aerosols may act to intensify the convection, but not necessarily make the convection deeper. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that aerosols act to invigorate convection by influencing the evolution of a cloud's hydrometeor populations.\nFor the regional scale analysis, storms in Colorado have favorable thermodynamics (high cloud bases, shallow warm cloud depths and large CAPE’s) that aerosols (CCN) appear to have little effect in a bulk sense. For the three remaining regions, storms forming in environments with CCN concentrations between 700 and 1200 cm-3 have notably stronger VPRR and larger flash rates. For aerosol concentrations below and above this range, storms have less vigor and reduced flash rates, consistent with the Rosenfeld et al. (2008) study.\nFinally we show how continental aerosols transported by Rossby gyres following propagating MJO’s over the CIO may act to modify convection north of the Equator. This effect is minimal south of the Equator where the gyres transport pristine aerosol concentrations from the southern Indian Ocean towards the Equator.",

            "abstract": "Transparency and reproducibility are fundamental properties of good science. In the current era of large and diverse datasets and long and complex workflows for data analysis and inference, ensuring such transparency and reproducibility is challenging. Hydrological science is a good case in point, because the discipline typically uses a large variety of datasets ranging from local observations to large-scale remotely sensed products. These data are often obtained from various different sources, and integrated using complex yet uncertain modelling tools. In this paper, we present and discuss methods of ensuring transparency and reproducibility in scientific workflows for hydrological data analysis for the purpose of water resources assessment, using relevant examples of emerging open source “big data” tools.\nFirst, we discuss standards for data storage, access, and processing that allow improving the modularity of a hydrological analysis workflow. In particular standards emerging from the Open Geospatial Consortium, such as the Sensor Observation Service, the Web Coverage Service, hold promise. However, some bottlenecks such as the availability of data models and the ability to work with spatio-temperal subsets of large datasets, need further development.\nNext, we focus on available methods to build transparent data processing workflows. Again, standards such as OGC’s Web Processing Service are being developed to facilitate web-based analytics. Yet, in practice, the experimental nature of these standards and web services in general often requires a more pragmatic approach. The availability of web technologies in popular open source data analysis environments such as R and Python often makes them an attractive solution for workflow creation and sharing.\nLastly, we elaborate on the potential of open source solutions hold in the context of participatory approaches to data collection and knowledge generation. Using examples from the tropical Andes and the Himalayas, we show how these technologies can help reducing the traditional knowledge gap, by allowing participation from resources constraint stakeholders.",

            "abstract": "Global climate change is a mosaic of regional changes to a large extent determined by region-specific feedbacks between climate and ecosystems. At present the ocean is forming a major sink in the global carbon cycle. Organic matter (OM) storage in sediments displays large regional variations and varied over time during the Quaternary. Upwelling regions are sites of high primary productivity and major depocenters of organic carbon (OC), the least understood of which is the Indian Ocean upwelling off Indonesia. In order to reconstruct the burial and composition of OM during the Late Quaternary, we analyzed five sediment cores from the Indian Ocean continental margin off the Indonesian islands Sumatra to Flores spanning the last 20,000 years (20 kyr). Sediments were analyzed for bulk composition, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of OM, amino acids and hexosamines and terrestrial plant wax n-alkanes and their stable carbon isotope composition. Sedimentation rates hardly varied over time in the western part of the transect. They were slightly lower in the East during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and deglaciation, but increased strongly during the Holocene. The amount and composition of OM was similar along the transect with maximum values during the deglaciation and the late Holocene. High biogenic opal covarying with OM content indicates upwelling-induced primary productivity dominated by diatoms to be a major control of OM burial in sediments in the East during the past 20 kyr. The content of labile OM was low throughout the transect during the LGM and increased during the late Holocene. The increase was stronger and the OM less degraded in the East than in the West indicating that continental margin sediments off Java and Flores were the major depocenter of OC burial along the Indian Ocean margin off SW Indonesia. Temporal variations probably resulted from changes in upwelling intensity and terrestrial inputs driven by variations in monsoon strength.",

            "abstract": "Surface albedo, defined as the ratio of the hemispheric reflected solar radiation flux to the incident flux upon the surface, is one of the essential climate variables and quantifies the radiation interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface. An absolute accuracy of 0.02-0.05 for global surface albedo is required by climate models. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) standard BRDF/albedo product makes use of a linear “kernel-driven” RossThick-LiSparse Reciprocal (RTLSR) BRDF model to describe the reflectance anisotropy. The surface albedo is calculated by integrating the BRDF over the above ground hemisphere. While MODIS Terra was launched in Dec 1999 and MODIS Aqua in 2002, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi-NPP satellite was launched more recently on October 28, 2011. Thus a long term record of BRDF, albedo and Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) products from VIIRS can be generated through MODIS heritage algorithms. Several investigations have evaluated the MODIS albedo products during the growing season, as well as during dormant and snow covered periods. The Land Product Validation (LPV) sub-group of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV) aims to address the challenges associated with the validation of global land products. The validation of global surface radiation/albedo products is one of the LPV subgroup activities. In this research, a reference dataset covering various land surface types and vegetation structure is assembled to assess the accuracy of satellite albedo products. This dataset includes in situ data (Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), FLUXNET and Long Term Ecological Research network (LTER) etc.) and airborne measurements (e.g. Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR)). Spatially representative analysis is applied to each site to establish whether the ground measurements can adequately represent moderate spatial resolution remotely sensed albedo products.",

            "abstract": "Ooids, concentrically laminated carbonate grains, are found in high-energy shallow water environments (the ooid factory). Consequently, ooid laminae are thought to precipitate around suspended grains. The role of microbes in this process is debated: abiotic models neither explain how ooids acquire a high organic content, nor do they account for the fast abrasion and loss of ooid carbonate in highly agitated areas. Here we probe the role of microbes and physical processes in ooid accretion on an oolitic beach in the leeward coast of Cat Island, the Bahamas. Grain size and petrography, microbial community composition and physical factors are compared along a cross-shore transect. A hydro-morphodynamic model is used to analyze sediment transport and sorting across the beach and shallow shelf. We find that the surf zone has a barren seafloor, and it is dominated by shiny and rounded ooids whose size decreases seaward, as predicted by physical grain sorting. Dull ooids and grapestones, irregular coated grains that are thought to form by microbially-mediated precipitation of carbonate around ooids and other grains, are present outside of the surf zone. The bulk size of these grains increases seaward, and they contain more abundant and diverse microbial communities than agitated ooids. The inverted sorting trend indicates that the time scale for grain accretion in this region is shorter than the decadal time scale for grain sorting. Modeling and field observations suggest that carbonate precipitation of both ooids and grapestones occurs in sediments that are colonized by diatom- and cyanobacteria-rich mats and reworked during storms. Periodic storms transport ooids to the surf zone, where they are rounded by abrasion and gain a shiny exterior in less than a day of reworking. Small ooids are periodically transported back to the microbially colonized areas, and the accretion cycle restarts. Grains too large to be frequently transported exit the accretion-erosion conveyor belt, remain trapped outside the surf zone and become grapestones. These observations suggest that ooid growth requires a specific balance between the timescales of microbial growth, colonization and carbonate precipitation. A similar mechanism might occur in tidal shoals, where large bedforms provide protected areas for temporary mat growth.",

This data set consists of about 1,800,000 attenuation curves measured in the period range 50-300s by Debayle and Ricard (2012). A careful selection allows us to reject data for which measurements are likely biased by the poor knowledge of the scalar seismic moment or by a ray propagation too close to a node of the source radiation pattern. For each epicenter-station path, elastic focusing effects due to seismic heterogeneities are corrected using DR2012 and the data are turned into log(1/Q). The selected data are then combined in a tomographic inversion using the non-linear least square formalism of Tarantola and Valette (1982). The obtained attenuation maps are in agreement with the surface tectonic for periods and modes sensitive to the top 200km of the upper mantle. Low attenuation regions correlate with continental shields while high attenuation regions are located beneath young oceanic regions. The attenuation pattern becomes more homogeneous at depths greater than 200 km and the maps are dominated by a high quality factor signature beneath slabs. We will discuss the similarities and differences between the tomographies of seismic velocities and of attenuations.",

            "abstract": "In the western US, snowmelt from the mountains contribute the vast majority of fresh water supply, in an otherwise dry region. With much of California currently experiencing extreme drought, it is critical for water managers to have accurate basin-wide estimations of snow water content during the spring melt season. At the forefront of basin-scale snow monitoring is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO). With combined LiDAR /spectrometer instruments and weekly flights over key basins throughout California, the ASO suite is capable of retrieving high-resolution basin-wide snow depth and albedo observations. To make best use of these high-resolution snow depths, spatially distributed snow density data are required to leverage snow water equivalent (SWE) from the measured depths. Snow density is a spatially and temporally variable property and is difficult to estimate at basin scales. Currently, ASO uses a physically based snow model (iSnobal) to resolve distributed snow density dynamics across the basin. However, there are issues with the density algorithms in iSnobal, particularly with snow depths below 0.50 m. This shortcoming limited the use of snow density fields from iSnobal during the poor snowfall year of 2014 in the Sierra Nevada, where snow depths were generally low. A deeper understanding of iSnobal model performance and uncertainty for snow density estimation is required. In this study, the model is compared to an existing climate-based statistical method for basin-wide snow density estimation in the Tuolumne basin in the Sierra Nevada and sparse field density measurements. The objective of this study is to improve the water resource information provided to water managers during ASO operation in the future by reducing the uncertainty introduced during the snow depth to SWE conversion.",

            "abstract": "Organic-rich mudstones – also called source rocks - are capable of economically producing significant quantities of oil and natural gas. Although the static physical and chemical properties of these rocks are generally well understood, the dynamics of hydrocarbon fluids in them is still a matter of conjecture and debate. In conventional porous petroleum reservoirs, the solid matrix is composed of inorganic minerals such as quartz or calcite, pore sizes are in the range of micrometers, and the following assumptions generally hold to a high degree of approximation: (1) thermodynamic and transport properties of the pore fluids are identical to their bulk values; (2) matrix solids are inert; (3) fluid-solid interactions are fully described by simple notions of wettability. In contrast, in source rock, oil and gas are in intimate contact with an organic solid called kerogen, the pore spaces of which are comparable to molecular dimensions. Therefore the dynamics of hydrocarbons in organic-rich mudstones must take into account significant departures from bulk thermodynamics and hydrodynamics, and fluid-solid interactions are molecular-species specific. We present a multi-scale model of organic-rich mudstone that is consistent with a variety of molecular-level computations and physical property measurements, and that may serve as a basis for understanding the oil and gas production mechanisms of these rocks.",

            "abstract": "Zircon U-Th-Pb dating method is one of the most important tools for estimating the duration of magmatism by means of coupling of uranium, actinium and thorium decay series. Using U-Pb dating method, its reliability is principally guaranteed by the concordance between 238U-206Pb and 235U-207Pb ages. In case of dating Quaternary zircons, however, the initial disequilibrium effect on 230Th and 231Pa should be considered. On the other hands, 232Th-208Pb dating method can be a simple but powerful approach for investigating the age of crystallization because of negligible influence from initial disequilibrium effect. We have developed a new correction model for accurate U-Pb dating of the young zircon samples by taking into consideration of initial disequilibrium and a U-Pb vs Th-Pb concordia diagram for reliable age calibration was successfully established. Hence, the U-Th-Pb dating method can be applied to various zircons ranging from Hadean (4,600 Ma) to Quaternary (~50 ka) ages, and this suggests that further detailed information concerning the thermal history of the geological sequences can be made by the coupling of U-Th-Pb, fission track and Ar-Ar ages. In this presentation, we will show an example of U-Th-Pb dating for zircon samples from Sambe Volcano (3 to 100 ka), southwest Japan and the present dating technique using LA-ICP-MS.",

Australia’s highly variable rainfall regime is influenced by ocean-atmosphere climate mechanisms which induce decadal-scale variability in hydrological data. This talk will summarize research on the identification of appropriate models for incorporating decadal scale variability into stochastic hydrological models. These will include autoregressive, hidden Markov models and a Bayesian hierarchical approach which combines paleo information on climate indices and hydrological data into a climate informed multi-time scale stochastic (CIMSS) framework. To characterize long-term variability for the first level of the hierarchy, paleoclimate and instrumental data describing the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are analyzed. A new paleo IPO-PDO time series dating back 440 yr is produced, combining seven IPO-PDO paleo sources using an objective smoothing procedure to fit low-pass filters to individual records. The paleo data analysis indicates that wet/dry IPO-PDO states have a broad range of run lengths, with 90% between 3 and 33 yr and a mean of 15 yr. Model selection techniques were used to determine a suitable stochastic model to simulate these run lengths. For the second level of the hierarchy, a seasonal rainfall model is conditioned on the simulated IPO-PDO state. Application to two high quality rainfall sites close to water supply reservoirs found that mean seasonal rainfall in the IPO-PDO dry state was 15%–28% lower than the wet state. Furthermore, analysis of the impact of the CIMSS framework on drought risk analysis found that short-term drought risks conditional on IPO/PDO state were far higher than the traditional AR(1) model.",

            "abstract": "Restoration of riverine habitats has largely proceeded on the assumption that by improving physical habitat, and more latterly processes, biophysical interactions will reassemble to a state similar to that prior to the disturbance event. Whilst there had been little monitoring to support this view, there is increasing evidence that the complexity of ecological systems demands a greater understanding of these biophysical interactions before we can state that a restoration has succeeded. In this paper I will draw on two examples to demonstrate the importance of understanding the spatial as well as the temporal scale of biophysical interactions. In the first example, field and modelling was used to demonstrate how different location of large wood and forest restoration can result in different hydrological outcomes. Similarly, as the forest matures it is possible to see change in restoration outcomes, extending beyond the lifetime of the project. In the second example I demonstrate how climate and land use drive the biophysical interactions within spawning salmonid habitats, research that questions accepted models used in the restoration of salmonid spawning habitat. Finally the paper reflects on the problems of restoring complex ecosystems; and points towards the need for improvements in how we research and communicate with stakeholders who ultimately live by the streams we restore.",

            "abstract": "Several rainfall measurement techniques are available for hydrological applications, each with its own spatial and temporal resolution. We investigated the effect of these spatiotemporal resolutions on discharge simulations in lowland catchments by forcing a novel rainfall-runoff model (WALRUS) with rainfall data from gauges, radars and microwave links.\nThe hydrological model used for this analysis is the recently developed Wageningen Lowland Runoff Simulator (WALRUS). WALRUS is a rainfall-runoff model accounting for hydrological processes relevant to areas with shallow groundwater (e.g. groundwater-surface water feedback). Here, we used WALRUS for case studies in a freely draining lowland catchment and a polder with controlled water levels.\nWe used rain gauge networks with automatic (hourly resolution but low spatial density) and manual gauges (high spatial density but daily resolution). Operational (real-time) and climatological (gauge-adjusted) C-band radar products and country-wide rainfall maps derived from microwave link data from a cellular telecommunication network were also used. Discharges simulated with these different inputs were compared to observations. We also investigated the effect of spatiotemporal resolution with a high-resolution X-band radar data set for catchments with different sizes.\nUncertainty in rainfall forcing is a major source of uncertainty in discharge predictions, both with lumped and with distributed models. For lumped rainfall-runoff models, the main source of input uncertainty is associated with the way in which (effective) catchment-average rainfall is estimated. When catchments are divided into sub-catchments, rainfall spatial variability can become more important, especially during convective rainfall events, leading to spatially varying catchment wetness and spatially varying contribution of quick flow routes. Improving rainfall measurements and their spatiotemporal resolution can improve the performance of rainfall-runoff models, indicating their potential for reducing flood damage through real-time control.",

Geophysical variables such as atmopsheric temperature, cloud properties, humidity, aerosols and carbon dioxide all exhibit spatial patterns, and satellite observations can help us learn about the physical mechanisms driving them. However, remote sensing observations are often noisy and incomplete, so inferring properties of true geophysical fields from them requires some care. These data can also be massive, which is both a blessing and a curse: using more data drives uncertainties down, but also drives costs up, particularly when data are stored on different computers or in different physical locations. In this talk I will discuss a methodology for spatial inference on massive, distributed data sets that does not require moving large volumes of data.

It evolves through a staged process that can involve complex dynamics, unanticipated consequences, and significant friction between individuals, organizations, and systems. Collaborators may agree on general directions or principles, but they do not necessarily have common goals. Coalition style politics emerge that can both ameliorate and exacerbate the friction, but it is through this multifaceted perspective that we achieve greater understanding.\nThe Research Data Alliance embraces this complex dynamic. It has no overarching plan or architecture, but it provides core principles and a “neutral place” that provide enough alignment to move forward while still recognizing the value of friction. The focus is on building and implementing bridges or gateways that connect disparate systems, organizations, and processes in order to create more interconnection and increase data sharing.\nThis presentation will describe this approach adopted by RDA and the initial products created--both technical and social. More importantly, it will illustrate how these products have been adopted at multiple scales and suggest ways forward toward a rapid evolution of a data-sharing infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "As the volume of climate-model-generated and observational data increases, it has become infeasible to perform large-scale comparisons of model output against observations by moving the data to a central location. Data reduction techniques, such as gridding or subsetting, can reduce data volume, but also sacrifice information about spatial and temporal variability that may be important for the comparison. Alternatively, it is generally recognized that \"moving the computaton to the data\" is more efficient for leveraging large data sets. In the spirit of the latter approach, we describe a new methodology for comparing time series structure in model-generated and observational time series when those data are stored on different computers. The method involves simulating the sampling distribution of the difference between a statistic computed from the model output and the same statistic computed from the observed data. This is accomplished with separate wavelet decompositions of the two time series on their respective local machines, and the transmission of only a very small set of information computed from the wavelet coefficients. The smaller that set is, the cheaper it is to transmit, but also the less accurate will be the result. From the standpoint of the analysis of distributed data, the main question concerns the nature of that trade-off. In this talk, we describe the comparison methodology and the results of some preliminary studies on the cost-accuracy trade-off.",

However, reliable markers of the tectonic activity are not always straightforward to identify on the field. Here we propose that in oblique collision context, the regional-scale morphology of rivers can be used to track back tectonic deformation. We use the specific example of New Zealand, where the morphology of the Southern Alps is characterized on one side by short rivers generally perpendicular to the main divide, whereas on the other side, the rivers are large and rotated. It has been suggested that this specific pattern could result from the oblique collision that affects the South Island. To go further, we develop a laboratory experimental setup to investigate river pattern evolution over a doubly-vergent orogenic wedge growing in a context of oblique convergence. We use a rain-fall system to introduce erosion, sediment transport and river development. The evolution of this prism is fully recorded though space and time and we are able to follow the drainage deformation. The first results are in good agreement with previous models of river pattern deformation in New Zealand and suggest that in places where such deformation is observed, either modern active or ancient systems, landscape morphology may be inverted to unravel regional tectonic deformation field.",

            "abstract": "The climate of East Antarctica over the last 800 ka can be deduced in some detail from deep ice cores – most notably the EPICA Dome C core and the Dome Fuji core. These cores provide us with evidence of a relatively uniform climate across the ice sheet (though with some differences), and of the sequence of interglacials and glacials running up to the present. Changes in the observed signal in ice cores can be the result of a number of influences: changes in ice sheet altitude due to isostatic effects and ice sheet thickness changes, changes in the way water isotopes record temperature, and changes in underlying climate. I will discuss each of these, although changes in climate are probably the main influence at these sites.\nOf the influences on East Antarctic climate, orbital and greenhouse gas forcing are well-defined (the greenhouse gases from the ice cores themselves). Using these, together with estimates of the state of northern hemisphere ice the climate of East Antarctica over the last 800 ka is rather well simulated, except for some striking differences between interglacials, and between data and simulation, for the recent interglacials. This suggests that there is an additional and significant local forcing, implying an important role for peak warmth due to changes in the bipolar seesaw, and a possible influence of changing ice cover in West Antarctica, which is very poorly known.\nFinally the abstract title cheekily claims a million years, but an ice core extending a million years remains in the future. I will however hold out the prospect of 1.5 Ma ice within the next decade.",

            "abstract": "NASA is a significant contributor to the U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA), which is a central component of the 2012-2022 U.S. Global Change Research Program Strategic Plan. The NCA has identified the need for indicators that provide a clear, concise way of communicating to NCA audiences about not only the status and trends of physical drivers of the climate system, but also the ecological and socioeconomic impacts, vulnerabilities, and responses to those drivers.\nWe are using thermal infrared satellite data in conjunction with in situ measurements to produce water temperatures for all the large inland water bodies in North America for potential use as an indicator for the NCA. Recent studies have revealed significant warming of inland waters throughout the world. The observed rate of warming is – in many cases – greater than that of the ambient air temperature. These rapid, unprecedented changes in inland water temperatures have profound implications for lake hydrodynamics, productivity, and biotic communities. Scientists are just beginning to understand the global extent, regional patterns, physical mechanisms, and ecological consequences of lake warming.\nAs part of our earlier studies we have collected thermal infrared satellite data from those satellite sensors that provide long-term and frequent spaceborne thermal infrared measurements of inland waters including ATSR, AVHRR, and MODIS and used these to examine trends in water surface temperature for approximately 100 of the largest inland water bodies in the world. We are now extending this work to generate temperature time-series of all North American inland water bodies that are sufficiently large to be studied using 1km resolution satellite data for the last 3 decades. These data are then being related to changes in the surface air temperature and compared with regional trends in water surface temperature derived from CMIP5/IPCC model simulations/projections to better predict future temperature changes. This information is also being used to develop ecologically relevant indicators that are meaningful to the general public, and useful for the National Climate Assessment teams.\nWe will discuss the available datasets and processing methodologies together with their potential use for climate assessment.",

Understanding the controls on soil fluxes of these gases is vital for the development of mitigation opportunities and for understanding their impact on atmospheric chemistry. We measured soil N2O and NO emissions from 9 ecosystems across management intensity and biodiversity gradient using semi-continuous automatic chambers over 2 years. The fluxes were measured 4 times a day in: two continuous corn systems, a monoculture without cover crops (CC) and with cover crops (CCcc), a corn-soybean rotation with cover crops (CScc), switchgrass (SWG), miscanthus (MIS); Poplar (POP), successional community (SUC), a native grasses mix (NGM), and a native prairie (NP) ecosystem with 20 different plant species. All ecosystems except NP were fertilized.\nCumulative soil emissions of N2O and NO from the ecosystems decreased with increasing biodiversity and reduced management. The highest fluxes were measured in the CC and the lowest fluxes in the NP ecosystems.\nWithin annual ecosystems the addition of cover crops reduced cumulative soil N2O emissions by 50%: from 1140 to 620 g N ha-1 y-1. Fertilized perennial grasses exhibited 3 – 8 times higher cumulative N2O fluxes then those from fertilized NGM, SUC, and POP ecosystems: 870 and 450 g N ha-1 y-1in SWG and MIS ecosystems, respectively. Native prairie exhibited a cumulative flux close to nil.\nCumulative NO emissions from the annual ecosystems were also reduced by 50 – 90% by cover crops: fluxes were 254, 103, and 30 g N ha-1 y-1 in CC, CScc, and CCcc ecosystems, respectively. In all other studied ecosystems NO emissions did not exceed 16 g N ha-1 y-1 and decreased with increasing biodiversity and reduced management. Overall, NO emissions contributed up to 18% to cumulative N2O and NO emissions from the studied ecosystems.\nTemporal variability of hourly N2O fluxes was lower in perennial than in annual ecosystems, while soil emissions of NO exhibited the opposite dynamics and were more variable in perennial than in annual ecosystems. Soil temperature was a poor predictor of hourly N2O and NO emissions from annual systems, but explained up to 20% of emissions variability in perennial ecosystems.",

This scanner consists of a stationary Hall probe with adjustable z-direction and a 2D (XY) motorized stage. The hall probe senses the magnetic component perpendicular to the scanning surface from a distance 0.3 mm from the polished thin section of the meteorite fragment removed from the bottom of lake Chebarkul. This sample was magnetically scanned after application of multiple steps of DC magnetizing/demagnetizing fields. Initially, the sample was saturated in a specified direction in 1T magnetic field, followed by about 40 steps of gradual demagnetization with step of 1 mT, until full saturation in opposing direction, which was achieved at -40mT. The very same process was applied after this sample was re-saturated in opposing direction. The magnetic anomalies have been analyzed at each step and demagnetizing curves interpreted (\nKletetschka et al., 2013\n) based on the magnetic characteristics of individual grains, which have been located in the fragments. These areas with magnetic anomalies were subjected to scanning electron micrography to reveal composition and morphology of magnetic sources.

            "abstract": "The 2010 eruption of Gunung Merapi (Java, Indonesia) began with an explosion resulting from the rapid development of shallow conduit overpressure, which destabilized the pre-existing lava dome and generated large PDCs on 26 October. This was followed by rapid ascent and extrusion of a juvenile dome that also collapsed, generating the largest surges of the series on 5 November. Lava lapilli within the PDC deposits were analyzed using helium pycnometry to determine variations in pyroclast porosity during the transition from dome collapse to rapid dome regrowth and subsequent collapse. Lapilli were separated into pyroclasts derived from the earlier phase of dome growth from those derived from the later and more voluminous phase of dome growth. For all lapilli, regardless of eruptive phase, open porosity of the pyroclasts averages 0.19 (0.08). However, closed porosities of the lapilli are generally higher for the earlier phase, which were derived from deposits of the 26 October PDCs. Efficient degassing during both stages of dome growth produced similar open porosities in pyroclasts, but a higher closed porosity in the 26 October samples resulted from late-stage vesiculation of the residual melt during the initial explosion. This vesiculation event was triggered by the rapid development of shallow conduit overpressure, evidence of which is provided by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiling analyses of plagioclase phenocrysts from the ash-sized component of the PDC deposits. Phenocrysts from the earlier phase of dome growth show a build-up of Li in the groundmass glass (attached to crystal surfaces) due to a stage of protracted gas accumulation prior to the 26 October explosion. Conversely, phenocrysts from the later stage of dome growth reveal decreasing Li contents in the groundmass glass due to efficient volatile loss during magma ascent. Vesiculation of the residual melt during the initial explosion resulted in a higher closed porosity in pyroclasts derived from the 26 October PDCs. Thus, although efficient degassing during ascent may result in similar open porosities of lava lapilli, sudden variations in conduit conditions will alter the textural characteristics of pyroclasts immediately prior to their eruption and deposition, which are not revealed through a measurement of density alone.",

            "abstract": "Measuring sap-flow in thin wheat tillers has been difficult so far due to technical difficulties associated with the application of the heat-balance method for this purpose. We developed a new method which solved this problem (Langensiepen et al. 2014) and applied it during four consecutive vegetation seasons for determining tiller transpiration rates in a wheat field with strong soil heterogeneity. The transpiration rates differed insignificantly between different field sections characterized by strong differences in physical soil conditions, regardless whether the crop was irrigated or supplied with variable rainwater. Tiller transpiration in a sheltered section was slightly reduced. Maximum leaf vapor conductance didn't differ among these different conditions, except under severe water stress conditions. Leaf water potential varied considerably during daily cycles under all circumstances. These responses are typical for plants with anisohydric behaviors which are characterized by small sensitivities of guard cells to critical leaf water potential thresholds and high photosynthetic productivity under absent or mild water stress. Recent studies conducted in Eucalyptus, tomato, and Arabidopsis plants have shown that the transition from mild to severe stress in anisohydric plants is marked by an increasing sensitivity of stomatal control to the transpiration rate. The results of this study demonstrate that this also seems to be the case for wheat. This practically implies that the parameterization of models calculating wheat canopy flux responses to soil heterogeneity patterns must not only account for the crop-type specific soil-vegetation pattern interaction under absent or mild stress, but also for additional mechanisms which kick in when water stress becomes severe.\nLangensiepen, M., Kupisch, M., Graf, A., Schmidt, M., Ewert, F.

Traditionally, such temperature structures are observed using time series of air temperature perturbations in a single point. The observed temperature signal is typically the result of a mix of turbulent and non-turbulent processes with different time and length scales. The superimposed nature of the temperature signal impedes the identification of key temperature patterns and their governing flow processes.\nUsing DTS, we can acquire air temperature measurements in many points. We will show how the additional spatial detail helps reveal temperature structures and flow processes near the surface. The state-of-the-art for using DTS to quantify temperature structure scales and flow is presented with a case study on stable nighttime conditions (Fig. 1). In addition, we discuss the current limitations in the application of DTS to monitor atmospheric flow near the surface.\n\nFigure 1: Observations of air temperature perturbations (T’) using DTS with a quasi three-dimensional array of optical fiber.",

Without a predictive model, significant uncertainties in flowback from the formation, the communication between the fracture and matrix as well as proper fracturing practice will ensue. Informed by SEM images, we develop deterministic network models that couple pores from multiple scales and their respective fluid physics. The models are used to investigate sorption hysteresis as an affordable way of inferring the nanoscale pore structure in core scale. In addition, restricted diffusion as a function of pore shape, pore-throat size ratios and network connectivity is computed to make correct interpretation of the 2D NMR maps possible. Our novel pore network models have the ability to match sorption hysteresis measurements without any tuning parameters. The results clarify a common misconception of linking type 3 nitrogen hysteresis curves to only the shale pore shape and show promising sensitivty for nanopore structre inference in core scale. The results on restricted diffusion shed light on the importance of including shape factors in 2D NMR interpretations. A priori \"weighting factors\" as a function of pore-throat and throat-length ratio are presented and the effect of network connectivity on diffusion is quantitatively assessed. We are currently working on verifying our models with experimental data gathered from the Eagleford formation.",

            "abstract": "Canada’s boreal forest supports many aquatic ecosystem services (AES) due to the intimate linkage between aquatic systems and their surrounding terrestrial watersheds in forested landscapes. There is an increasing risk to AES because natural development activities (forest management, mining, energy) have resulted in disruptions that deteriorate aquatic ecosystems at local (10s of km2) to regional (100s of km2) scales. These activities are intensifying and expanding, placing at risk the healthy aquatic ecosystems that provide AES and may threaten the continued development of the energy, forest, and mining sectors. Remarkably, we know little about the consequences of these activities on AES. The idea that AES should be explicitly integrated into modern natural resource management regulations is gaining broad acceptance. A major need is the ability to measure cumulative effects and determine thresholds (the points where aquatic ecosystems and their services cannot recover to a desired state within a reasonable time frame) in these cumulative effects. However, there is no single conceptual approach to assessing cumulative effects that is widely accepted by both scientists and managers. We present an integrated science-policy framework that enables the integration of AES into forest management risk assessment and prevention/mitigation strategies. We use this framework to explore the risk of further deterioration of AES by (1) setting risk criteria; (2) using emerging technologies to map process-based indicators representing causes and consequences of risk events to the deterioration of AES; (3) assessing existing prevention and mitigation policies in place to avoid risk events; and (4) identifying priorities for policy change needed to reduce risk event. Ultimately, the success of this framework requires that higher value be placed on AES, and in turn to improve the science and management of the boreal forest.",

            "abstract": "Postseismic surface deformation is used to investigate both fault behaviour and lithospheric rheology, with the two being closely linked. Studies of postseismic deformation are therefore important in enabling us to characterize the progression of an earthquake cycle, as well as potentially feeding into long timescale geodynamic models. We have studied a number of earthquakes on the seismically active Tibetan Plateau. Collectively, the postseismic phases of these events reveal the processes that occur in the months to decades following major earthquakes. Our aim in this presentation is to highlight what we consider are the important facets of these processes, in order to aid future postseismic studies. In some cases there is a clear signature of afterslip only (e.g. the Nima-Gaize, Yutian and Damxung earthquakes in 2008), with no detectable contribution from viscoelastic relaxation (VER). Such cases enable straightforward characterization of afterslip (e.g. duration, spatial distribution), which can be used to inform other studies. There is also one case of viscoelastic relaxation only (the 1951/1952 Beng Co/Gulu earthquakes), with no “contamination” from afterslip within the late postseismic observation period. In light of this latter case, we re-examine previously-published InSAR datasets for the 1997 Manyi and 2001 Kokoxili earthquakes. Since these were strike-slip events, interpretation of their postseismic signature has in the past caused some uncertainty. We use synthetic examples to demonstrate how to distinguish between afterslip and VER, and apply the insights gained to individual interferograms for these large earthquakes. How earthquake magnitude, focal mechanism and observation time affect postseismic deformation is also explored. Finally, we present an example of postseismic release faulting imaged by InSAR (the Zhongba earthquake, 2008), which appears to take the place of afterslip in the conventional sense. Where relevant, comparisons are made with findings from postseismic studies elsewhere in the world. As a community, we are now at the stage where enormous value can be gained from pooling results and insights from the many postseismic investigations that have been published, which will enable us to model earthquakes, faults and their associated seismic hazard more effectively.",

            "abstract": "Over the coming century, climate change has the potential to impact infrastructure, particularly in population-dense areas that depend on transportation and built environments. Many of these impacts may occur via changes in the frequency and magnitude of extremes: high and low temperature, precipitation, coastal flooding, and storm events. High temperatures, for example, accelerate the deterioration of some types of infrastructure materials; affect aircraft performance; require increased refrigeration and cooling for ports and terminals; and shorten construction times for work crews. Heavy precipitation events affect bridge scour, culvert performance, roadways, and transportation safety, impairing operations and travel or bringing them to a standstill. Stronger hurricanes and increased risk of coastal flooding due to storm surges and sea level rise can lead to temporary and permanent flooding of transportation- and built infrastructure as well as residential areas.\nWe describe the development of, and projected future changes in, a collection of infrastructure-relevant climate indices for three different locations within the United States: the Mobile Bay region in the Southeastern U.S., the city of Cambridge, MA in the Northeastern U.S., and the city of Austin, TX in the Southern Great Plains. The indices are based on mean and extreme temperature, precipitation, humidity, and combinations thereof, and vary depending on the region. Historical trends are calculated from long-term weather stations, while projected future changes are based on GCM simulations corresponding to a lower and a higher scenario, statistically downscaled to the same individual station records using the ARRM model.\nWe find that all three locations are likely to be affected by an increase in average temperatures as well as a greater number of extremely hot days and heat waves with increasing risk under a higher scenario as compared to a lower. For precipitation, projected changes differ based on both the nature of the indices relevant to each region as well as the spatially inhomogeneous rate of change in mean and extreme precipitation. These results highlight the importance of local knowledge and flexibility in identifying thresholds and potential indices relevant to quantifying the impacts of climate change at the regional scale.",

In order for ASDC data scientists to effectively implement the most efficient processes for cataloging and organizing data access applications, they must be intimately familiar with data contained in the datasets with which they are working. Key technologies that are critical components to the background of ASDC data scientists include: large RBMSs (relational database management systems) and NoSQL databases; web services; service-oriented architectures; structured and unstructured data access; as well as processing algorithms. However, as prices of data storage and processing decrease, sources of data increase, and technologies advance - granting more people to access to data at real or near-real time - data scientists are being pressured to accelerate their ability to identify and analyze vast amounts of data. With existing tools this is becoming exceedingly more challenging to accomplish.\nFor example, NASA Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) alone grew from having just over 4PBs of data in 2009 to nearly 6PBs of data in 2011. This amount then increased to roughly10PBs of data in 2013. With data from at least ten new missions to be added to the ESDIS holdings by 2017, the current volume will continue to grow exponentially and drive the need to be able to analyze more data even faster. Though there are many highly efficient, off-the-shelf analytics tools available, these tools mainly cater towards business data, which is predominantly unstructured. Inadvertently, there are very few known analytics tools that interface well to archived Earth science data, which is predominantly heterogeneous and structured. This presentation will identify use cases for data analytics from an Earth science perspective in order to begin to identify specific tools that may be able to address those challenges.",

And yet, with the exploration of the solar system with planetary probes, it has become clear that dynamic planetward injections are if fact a ubiquitous characteristic of most strongly magnetized planets; only Neptune did not reveal the signatures of such processes when visited. But, within this diversity of magnetospheric environments, it is clear that the driving forces associated with injections can be very different from those at Earth. Jupiter, for example, is known to be powered by planetary rotation rather than the solar wind. Saturn has injections that are clearly powered by rotations, but it also has nightside injections that are, at minimum, triggered by solar wind events if not powered by the solar wind. Even for those magnetospheres clearly powered by rotation, there appears to be substantial similarity between the physical processes involved with the extraterrestrial planetary injections and recent formulations of injections within Earth’s near-Earth magnetotail. With a focus on comparisons between Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, I here review the state of understanding generally of injections within extraterrestrial planets and what the comparisons might tell us about our understanding of substorm phenomena at Earth.",

Following a previous and similar comparative investigation of radiation belt electrons, we here turn our attention to ions. Specifically, we examine the possible role of the differential ion Kennel-Petschek limit, as moderated by Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves, as a standard for comparing the most intense ion spectra within the strongly magnetized planetary magnetospheres. In carrying out this investigation, the substantial complexities engendered by the very different ion composition distributions of these diverse magnetospheres must be addressed, given that the dispersion properties of the EMIC waves are strongly determined by the ion composition of the plasmas within which the waves propagate. Chosen for comparison are the ion spectra within these systems that are the most intense observed, specifically at 100 keV and 1 MeV. We find that Earth and Jupiter are unique in having their most intense ion spectra likely limited and sculpted by the differential Kennel-Petschek process. The ion spectra of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune reside far below their respective limits and are likely limited by interactions with gas and dust (Saturn) and by the absence of robust ion acceleration processes (Uranus and Neptune).",

            "abstract": "The soil Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) is an important soil characteristic that has many applications in soil science and environmental studies. For example, CEC influences soil fertility by controlling the exchange of ions in the soil. Measurement of CEC is costly and difficult. Consequently, several studies attempted to obtain CEC from readily measurable soil physical and chemical properties such as soil pH, organic matter, soil texture, bulk density, and particle size distribution. These studies have often used multiple regression or artificial neural network models. Regression-based models cannot capture the intricate relationship between CEC and soil physical and chemical attributes and provide inaccurate CEC estimates. Although neural network models perform better than regression methods, they act like a black-box and cannot generate an explicit expression for retrieval of CEC from soil properties. In a departure with regression and neural network models, this study uses Genetic Expression Programming (GEP) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) to estimate CEC from easily measurable soil variables such as clay, pH, and OM. CEC estimates from GEP and MARS are compared with measurements at two field sites in Iran. Results show that GEP and MARS can estimate CEC accurately. Also, the MARS model performs slightly better than GEP. Finally, a sensitivity test indicates that organic matter and pH have respectively the least and the most significant impact on CEC.",

            "abstract": "The fingerprint of human-induced global warming stands out clearly above the noise In the time series of global-mean temperature, but not local temperature. At extratropical latitudes over land the standard error of 50-year linear temperature trends at a fixed point is as large as the cumulative rise in global-mean temperature over the past century. Much of the samping variability in local temperature trends is “dynamically-induced”, i.e., attributable to the fact that the seasonally-varying mean circulation varies substantially from one year to the next and anomalous circulation patterns are generally accompanied by anomalous temperature patterns. In the presence of such large sampling variability it is virtually impossible to identify the spatial signature of greenhouse warming based on observational data or to partition observed local temperature trends into natural and human-induced components. It follows that previous IPCC assessments, which have focused on the deterministic signature of human-induced climate change, are inherently limited as to what they can tell us about the attribution of the past record of local temperature change or about how much the temperature at a particular place is likely to rise in the next few decades in response to global warming. To obtain more informative assessments of regional and local climate variability and change it will be necessary to take a probabilistic approach. Just as the use of the ensembles has contributed to more informative extended range weather predictions, large ensembles of climate model simulations can provide a statistical context for interpreting observed climate change and for framing projections of future climate. For some purposes, statistics relating to the interannual variability in the historical record can serve as a surrogate for statistics relating to the diversity of climate change scenarios in large ensembles.",

We find that all three samples of volcanic ash are excellent depositional ice nuclei, nucleating ice at ice saturation ratios of 1.05 ± 0.1. For immersion freezing, however, only the Taupo ash exhibited efficient heterogeneous ice nucleation activity. Similar to recent studies on mineral dust, we suggest that the mineralogy of volcanic ash may dictate its ice nucleation activity in the immersion mode.",

            "abstract": "Coronal heating and the acceleration of the solar wind are unsolved problems in solar physics. The propagation of Alfven waves along magnetic field lines is one of the candidate mechanisms for carrying energy to large distances from the surface and heat the coronal plasma. However, the dissipation process is still unclear in observational aspects.\nThe new NASA's solar physics satellite IRIS (Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph) provides spectral information of plasma in the chromosphere and transition region with high-spatial and high-temporal resolution. Hence, we performed observations of a limb prominence to find evidence and clues of dissipation in collaboration with Hinode/SOT and SDO/AIA.\nIn our observations, we found a clear evidence of resonant absorption that takes place on the surface of the oscillating prominence flux tubes. This mechanism facilitates the onset of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, which deforms the thin tube's boundaries and generates thin current sheets and turbulence, leading to dissipation of the wave energy into heat. In this talk, we will show the observed phenomena and discuss the dissipation mechanism compared with numerical simulations of an oscillating prominence.",

MEPS is composed of 7 first-principles-based data assimilation models for the ionosphere, ionosphere-plasmasphere, thermosphere, high-latitude ionosphere-electrodynamics, and mid-low latitude ionosphere-electrodynamics. The data assimilation models cover the globe, and ensemble modeling can be conducted for mid-low latitude ionospheric studies because 5 different data assimilation models cover this domain. For this domain, the comparison of the resulting reconstructions should help distinguish between the underlying physics and model artifacts. The MEPS models can assimilate a range of ground and space observations, including GPS-TEC, ionosonde-digisonde, in situ electron density, occultation, and ultraviolet emission measurements. The long-range goal of the program is to improve space weather specification and forecasting with ensemble modeling. Selected ionospheric events that were reconstructed with more than one data assimilation model will be presented and compared.",

In this talk, we will introduce one such platform; Paradigm4’s SciDB, the first DBMS designed from the ground up to combine the kinds of quality-of-service guarantees made by SQL DBMS platforms—high level data model, query languages, extensibility, transactions—with the kinds of functionality familiar to scientific users—arrays as structural building blocks, integrated linear algebra, and client language interfaces that minimize the learning curve.

            "abstract": "Pore-scale modeling is recently become an important tool for a deeper understanding of complex transport phenomena in porous media. However its direct usage for field-scale processes is still hindered by limited predictive capabilities. This is due to the large uncertainties in the micro-scale parameters, in the pore geometries, in the limited number of available samples, and in the numerical errors. These issues are often overlooked because it is usually thought that the computational cost of pore-scale simulation prohibits an extensive uncertainty quantification study with large number of samples.\nIn this work we propose an computational tool to estimate statistics of pore-scale quantities. The algorithm is based on (i) an efficient automatic CFD solver for pore-scale simulations, (ii) a multi-scale Bayesian theoretical framework, and (iii) a generalized multilevel Monte Carlo to speed up the statistical computations. Exploiting the variance reduction of the multi-level and multi-scale representation, we demonstrate the feasibility of the forward and inverse uncertainty quantification problems. The former consists in quantifying the effect of micro-scale heterogeneities and parametric uncertainties on macro-scale upscaled quantities. Given some prior information on the pore-scale structures, the latter can be applied to (i) assess the validity and estimate uncertainties of macro-scale models for a wide range of micro-scale properties, (ii) match macro-scale results with the underlying pore-scale properties.",

Although water is the most abundant volatile species in comets, its lack of spectral features in the UV and visible make it difficult to observe. OH is then an important proxy for H2O, and observations of its production and radial distribution can give insight into the water content in comets. Our observations of the comet are planned to occur on Oct 17th 2014, two days before its closest approach to Mars. The two imaging modes that will capture the OH coma include a 10x10 degree mode, as well as a finer resolution mode of 2x2 degrees. From these observations we will be able to observe a majority of the OH coma, and inform observations of Mars’ perturbed atmosphere, as well as contributing to the understanding of volatile content in Oort cloud comets.",

            "abstract": "Although common in other bodies of the solar system, impact craters formed in basaltic terrains are rare on Earth and only a few examples are known. Two of these craters are located south of Brazil, the Vargeão and Vista Alegre impact craters. The Cerro do Jarau structure is not confirmed, but is a possible third Brazilian basaltic crater, formed above the Serra Geral basalt floods of the Paraná Basin like the other two. Cerro do Jarau is a 13 km circular landform that rises over 200 meters above the plains of the “pampas” in southern Brazil. The name, meaning “Jarau hills”, is given after the crests of silicified and deformed Botucatu sandstones, which form a semiring of elevated hills in the northern part of the structure. This work focused on the construction of a 3D subsurface geological model that could explain a new set of ground gravimetric data. Bouguer anomalies were calculated from gravity acceleration measured at 313 stations irregularly distributed on the area of the impact structure. A regional component represented by a polynomial trend surface was extracted from the total Bouguer anomalies. The residual Bouguer map (fig. 1) shows a strong positive anomaly with a NE-SW trend, located in the northeastern part of the structure. This gravity feature is not common in other impact structures, being possibly related to a dike intrusion. However, the negative anomaly present in the center of the structure and the circular positive anomaly surrounding the central part of the structure could be related to an impact structure. The positive circular anomaly is not spatially coincident with the edges of the structure, a feature that is also observed at the Vargeão and Vista Alegre impact structures. Density values of basalts, sandstones and breccias were measured from rock samples and each average value were used as constraints for the 3D model developed with the Geosoft® VOXI Earth modelling.This model provided a better understanding of the subsurface design of the structure. The impact crater hypothesis still remain the best hypothesis, but our results suggest that there was a post-impact dike intrusion and deep erosion processes that removed most of the impact breccia and a possible central uplift. The remaining of the uplifted rocks is observed as the silicified sandstone that forms the crests of the Jarau hills.",

            "abstract": "The Western U.S. is strongly reliant on snowmelt from forested areas for ecosystem services and downstream populations. The ability to manage water resources from snow-covered forests faces major challenges from drought, disturbance, and regional changes in climate. An exciting avenue for improving ecohydrological process understanding is Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) because the technology simultaneously observes topography, forest properties, and snow/ice at high-resolution (<10 cm) and over large extents (>100 km2). The availability and quality of LiDAR datasets is increasing rapidly, however they remain under-utilized for process-based ecohydrology investigations. This presentation will illustrate how LiDAR datasets from the Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) network have been applied to advance ecohydrological understanding through direct empirical analysis, as well as model parameterization and verification. Direct analysis of the datasets has proved fruitful for pre- and post-disturbance snow distribution estimates and interpreting in-situ snow depth measurements across sites. In addition, we illustrate the potential value of LiDAR to parameterize and verify of physical models with two examples. First, we use LiDAR to parameterize a land surface model, Noah multi-parameterization (Noah-MP), to investigate the sensitivity of modeled water and energy fluxes to high-resolution forest information. Second, we present a Snow Physics and Laser Mapping (SnowPALM) model that is parameterized with LiDAR information at its native 1-m scale. Both modeling studies demonstrate the value of LiDAR for representing processes with greater fidelity. More importantly, the increased model fidelity led to different estimates of water and energy fluxes at larger, watershed scales. Creating a network of experimental watersheds with LiDAR datasets offers the potential to test theories and models in previously unexplored ways.",

For the last 10 years, the post-perovskite transition has been related to major seismic structures in the region, including the D’’ discontinuity, the D’’ anisotropy, and the anti-correlation between the bulk sound speed and shear wave velocity. Whereas the post-perovskite phase appeared to provide a coherent framework to explain many of the major structures, more recent mineral physics studies have revealed that the compositional effects can be significant. High-resolution seismic imaging studies have reported complex structures which cannot be explained by the post-perovskite transition in chemically simple systems. Furthermore, recently proposed mineralogical changes in the lower mantle will affect the properties of post-perovskite and may provide alternative explanations for some seismic structures. In this talk, we will discuss the post-perovskite phase transition and other phase transitions in chemical heterogeneities in the lowermost mantle and their importance in understanding seismic structures. We will also report new data on the spin and oxidation state of iron in mantle silicate which can affect the post-perovskite transition.",

However, the correct use and interpretation of these technologies relies on accurate models of their transport. Even for less exotic particles, the factors controlling particle transport through fractures are poorly understood.\nIn this presentation, we will describe ongoing research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory into the transport properties of particles in natural rock fractures. Using three dimensional printing techniques, we create clear-plastic reproductions of real-world fracture surfaces, thereby enabling direct observation of the particle movement. We will also discuss how particle tracking of dense particle packs can be further enhanced by using such specially tailored flow cells in combination with micro-encapsulated tracer particles. Experimental results investigating the transport behavior of smart tracers and proppants close to the neutrally buoyant limit will be presented and we will describe how data from these experiments can be used to improve large-scale models of particle transport in fractures.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

            "abstract": "Methane-rich, hyperalkaline spring waters and bubbling pools have been sampled in the Ronda peridotite massif in southern Spain. Water chemistry (T: 17.1-21.5 ºC; pH: 10.7-11.7; DO: <2 mg/L; Ca–OH facies) is characteristic of present-day serpentinization. Dissolved CH4 concentrations range from 0.1 to 3.2 mg/L. CH4 stable C and H isotope ratios suggest a dominant abiotic origin in two natural spring sites (delta13C: -13 to -29 ‰ VPDB; delta2H: -309 to -333 ‰ VSMOW) and a mixed biotic-abiotic origin in springs with artificial water delivery systems (i.e., pipes or fountains; delta13C: -44 to -69 ‰; delta2H: -180 to -319 ‰). At the natural springs, gas is mainly released through bubbles close to the water outlet (CH4 flux ~1 kg/day by individual bubble trains), and subordinately by microseepage from the ground, even at distances of ~100 m from the bubble-spring site (flux of 10’s, up to 97, mg CH4 m-2day-1). Gas seepage is strictly controlled by faults. Under-saturation of CH4 in water, bubbling and seepage location suggest that CH4 is not exclusively transported to the surface by hyperalkaline water, but it follows autonomous migration pathways along faults. Similar ‘dry’ seepage of abiotic gas was observed in the Philippines, New Zealand, Turkey and Italy. Like other land-based serpentinization systems, the Ronda peridotite massif is characterized by low heat flow (<40 mW/m2), with temperatures <60°C at depths of 1.5 km. At these low T and high pH conditions, CO32- is the only available carbon source dissolved in the water, and unlikely contributes to catalysed Fischer-Tropsch Type reactions. Methane production from CO2 hydrogenation in a gas phase system (unsaturated fractured rocks) cannot be excluded. The presence of ruthenium-enriched chromitites in the Ronda peridotites may support the hypothesis that CH4 is produced by CO2 hydrogenation catalyzed by Ru minerals, even at temperatures below 100°C, as demonstrated in recent laboratory experiments (Etiope and Ionescu, 2014, Geofluids, in press).",

            "abstract": "The impact of climate change is often discussed using examples from Polar Regions such as decreasing polar bear populations but significant changes are happening to local climates around the world. Climate change is often perceived as happening elsewhere, evoking a sense that others have to take action to mitigate climate change.\n Learning about climate change is very tangible for students when it addresses impacts they can observe close to their home. The Lens on Climate Change (LOCC) program engaged Colorado middle and high school students in producing short videos about climate change topics in Colorado, specifically ones that are impacting students’ lives and their local community. Participating schools were located in rural, suburban and urban Colorado many of which have diverse student populations and high Free and Reduced Lunch rates. Project staff recruited university graduate and undergraduate student to mentor the students in their research and video production. With the help of these mentors, ten student groups selected and researched climate topics, interviewed science experts from local research institutes and produced short videos.\n The program aimed at engaging students in self-motivated researching and learning about a climate topic. Furthermore, it served as a way to spark students’ interest in a career in science by matching them with college students for the program duration and bringing them to the University of Colorado campus for a final screening event, for many of students their first visit to a college campus. The LOCC middle and high school student groups were in addition paired with undergraduate student groups enrolled in a college course that explores climate change through artistic compositions. The undergraduate students were tasked to develop a companion video based only on a brief prompt from the secondary students. Both student videos were screened back-to-back at a final screening.\nThe LOCC project’s goal was to connect secondary students, who would otherwise not have the opportunity, with college life and the scientific community. Our evaluation results showed that the process of video production was a powerful tool for the students to explore and learn about climate change topics. Students and teachers appreciated the unique approach to learning.",

            "abstract": "During her crossing of Aeolis Palus, the plains region between the Gale crater rim and Aeolis Mons (Mount Sharp), Curiosity encountered a remarkably rich array of clastic sedimentary rocks primarily of fluvial and lacustrine origin. Our challenge is to reconstruct at fine-scale the ancient sedimentary environment. The Kimberley was chosen as a waypoint for detailed investigation because of a set of distinct 'orbital' stratal units identified in Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) HiRISE imagery that showed repetitive stratal relationships. Curiosity's exploration of these outcrops in April and May 2014 provided an excellent 3-D window into complex sedimentary stratigraphy on Mars. Here, we describe in situ observations of sedimentary facies, and their spatial and relative temporal relationships. Sedimentary facies at the Kimberley include conglomerates, cross-bedded sandstones, and fine-grained, cross-laminated sandstones, all of which are overlain by a massive butte-forming unit, that is itself capped by a resistant, dark-toned fine-grained unit. The most distinct and scientifically perplexing facies is characterized by consistent southward-dipping decimetre-thick sandstone beds that can be traced over hundreds of meters. This facies partly equates to a 'orbital' unit characterized by NE-SW oriented lineations (informally termed the 'Striated Unit'). Topography data shows that the unit rises in elevation traced southward toward Mount Sharp. The consistent dip of the south-dipping sandstone facies, its apparent lack of variability in strike orientation, and the presence of prominent south-dipping beds observed in cliff face sections leads us to propose a model in which these represent clinoform geometrical elements. We discuss plausible models to explain the clinoforms (e.g., large-scale bedforms, downstream-accreting or laterally-accreting, small-scale delta mouth bars). In light of these models we consider the larger-scale stratal relationships at the Kimberley.",

            "abstract": "The identification of putative ancient deltaic sedimentary systems on Mars has been both exciting and controversial. Our excitement is elicted by the potential provided by deltas as evidence for standing bodies of water associated with the deltas, and the resulting implications for both the ancient climate of Mars and ancient habitability. The controversy stems from how confident can we be in the identification of ancient deltaic systems from orbital data, and how robust are our assertions about the habitability potential of such settings. Delta systems in particular are key astrobiological targets because at their distal toes fine-grained sediment (ie., clays) settle from suspension in a lower energy setting and they are commonly characterised by high rates of sedimentation. This leads to high preservation potential of biosignatures. Targeting of future Mars rovers to investigate deltaic landing sites requires better understanding of these issues to reduce exploration risk. In this presentation, we describe the key criteria that enable us to make robust interpretations of deltaic stratigraphy and constrain delta evolution for martian systems. In particular, the past 10 years has seen in a revolution in our process understanding of terrestrial delta systems through a combination of field, experimental and numerical modelling studies. Analysis of martian deltas has much to gain from these results. We go on to consider why deltaic systems offer potential as astrobiological target paleoenvironments. We use the exhumed delta system (Hypanis delta system) at the termination of Hypanis Vallis, 11.8°N, 314.96°E as a case example. This system, situated in Xanthe Terra, comprises layered sedimentary rocks with an overall multi-lobate geometry and associated inverted channel networks. The Hypanis 'delta' is a proposed landing site for the ExoMars rover and also for the NASA 2020 mission.",

            "abstract": "Public health studies often require thermal infrared (TIR) images at both high temporal and spatial resolution to retrieve LST. However, currently, no single satellite sensors can deliver TIR data at both high temporal and spatial resolution. This technological limitation prevents the wide usage of remote sensing data in epidemiological studies. To solve this issue, we have developed a few image fusion techniques to generate high temporally-resolved image data. We downscaled GOES LST data to 15-minute 1-km resolution to assess community-based heat-related risk in Los Angeles County, California and simulated ASTER datasets by fusing ASTER and MODIS data to derive biophysical variables, including LST, NDVI, and normalized difference water index, to examine the effects of those environmental characteristics on WNV outbreak and dissemination. A spatio-temporal analysis of WNV outbreak and dissemination was conducted by synthesizing the remote sensing variables and mosquito surveillance data, and by focusing on WNV risk areas in July through September due to data sufficiency of mosquito pools. Moderate- and high-risk areas of WNV infections in mosquitoes were identified for five epidemiological weeks. These identified WNV-risk areas were then collocated in GIS with heat hazard, exposure, and vulnerability maps to answer the question of whether WNV is a heat related virus. The results show that elevation and built-up conditions were negatively associated with the WNV propagation, while LST positively correlated with the viral transmission. NDVI was not significantly associated with WNV transmission. San Fernando Valley was found to be the most vulnerable to mosquito infections of WNV. This research provides important insights into how high temporal resolution remote sensing imagery may be used to study time-dependant events in public health, especially in the operational surveillance and control of vector-borne, water-borne, or other epidemic diseases.",

            "abstract": "We present a pioneering report on the utility of seismic methods in imaging bio-induced elastic property changes within a contaminated aquifer. To understand physical properties of contaminated soil, we acquired 48 meters long multichannel seismic profile over the Norman landfill leachate plume in Norman Oklahoma, USA. We estimated both the P- and S- wave velocities respectively using full-waveform inversion of the transmission and the ground-roll coda. The resulting S-wave model showed distinct velocity anomaly (~10% over background) within the water table fluctuation zone bounded by the historical minimum and maximum groundwater table. In comparison, the P-wave velocity anomaly within the same zone was negligible. The Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) images of samples from a core located along the seismic profile clearly shows presence of biofilms in the water table fluctuation zone and their absence both above and below the fluctuation zone. Elemental chemistry further indicates that the sediment composition throughout the core is fairly constant. We conclude that the velocity anomaly in S-wave is due to biofilms. As a next step, we develop mechanistic modeling to gain insights into the petro-physical behavior of biofilm-bearing sediments. Preliminary results suggest that a plausible model could be biofilms acting as contact cement between sediment grains. The biofilm cement can be placed in two ways – (i) superficial non-contact deposition on sediment grains, and (ii) deposition at grain contacts. Both models explain P- and S- wave velocity structure at reasonable (~5-10%) biofilm saturation and are equivocally supported by the ESEM images. Ongoing attenuation modeling from full-waveform inversion and its mechanistic realization, may be able to further discriminate between the two cement models. Our study strongly suggests that as opposed to the traditional P-wave seismic, S-wave acquisition and imaging can be a more powerful tool for in-situ imaging of biofilm formation in field settings with significant implication for bioremediation and microbial enhanced oil recovery monitoring.",

            "abstract": "The Ionosphere/Thermosphere system is a very dynamic and complex medium to model. Given sufficient data and proper data handling, assimilative models can give a good representation of this system. One good dataset for this purpose comes from UV imagers on spacecraft. In particular, the Oxygen recombination emission (135.6 nm) and the Nitrogen Lyman-Birge Hopfield band (both 140-150 nm and 165-180 nm) are being collected by instruments on the NASA TIMED/GUVI and DMSP/SSUSI instruments. Similar UV data will also be available in the future from the ICON and GOLD missions. Currently, the Air Force is using the oxygen emission to infer ionospheric electron densities in the USU GAIM model for ionospheric forecasts. We have also been integrating data for the IDA4D model assimilation (Bust et al, 2007). As the data product designer for these UV products, we have an unique perspective on issues related to assimilating this data. These issues concern model resolution scales (Schunk, et al, 2011), filtering of noisy data, and handling of second order effects. We will discuss our experience with these issues and point out some future directions for assimilation of UV data.\nBust, G., Crowley, G., Curtis, N., Reynolds, A., Paxton, L., Coker, C., Bernhardt, P. \"IDA4D - a new ionospheric imaging algorithm using non-linear ground-based and spaced- based data sources\", American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2007, abstract #SA11B-06.\nSchunk, R.W., Scherliess, L., and Thompson, D.C., 2011 “Ionospheric Data Assimilation: Problems Associated with Missing Physics”, Aeronomy of the Earth's Atmosphere and Ionosphere.

Beginning in 2007, CC@CSU has organized some 120 talks to audiences totaling some 6,000, helping inform the student body and community and catalyzing relationships among faculty and researchers across campus. It has offered communication coaching to scientists (and others) who want to translate their expertise for the public. And it has developed a multidisciplinary website (http://changingclimates.colostate.edu) with over 450 annotated entries, all college-level content, primer-level clarity, on topics that include climate science and ecology, economics and emotions, ethics and policy, communication and activism, paleoclimate and human history, and much more. This presentation will address the basic questions of why, who, how, what, for whom, and so what, concluding with some of the key lessons learned about communicating across disciplinary boundaries on this important subject.",

            "abstract": "Coastal karst networks are formed by mineral dissolution, mainly calcite, in the freshwater-saltwater mixing zone. The problem has been approached first by studying the kinetics of calcite dissolution and then coupling ion-pairing software with flow and mass transport models. Porosity development models require high computational power. A workaround to reduce computational complexity is to assume the calcite dissolution reaction is relatively fast, thus equilibrium chemistry can be used to model it (Sanford & Konikow, 1989). Later developments allowed the full coupling of kinetics and transport in a model. However kinetics effects of calcite dissolution were found negligible under the single set of assumed hydrological and geochemical boundary conditions. A model is implemented with the coupling of FeFlow software as the flow & transport module and PHREEQC4FEFLOW (Wissmeier, 2013) ion-pairing module. The model is used to assess the influence of heterogeneities in hydrological, geochemical and lithological boundary conditions on porosity evolution. The hydrologic conditions present in the karst aquifer of Quintana Roo coast in Mexico are used as a guide for generating inputs for simulations.",

JPSS provides critical data for key operational and research applications, and includes: 1) Weather forecasting – data from the JPSS Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) are needed to forecast weather events out to 7 days. Nearly 85% of all data used in weather forecasting are from polar orbiting satellites. 2) Environmental monitoring – data from the JPSS Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) are used to monitor the environment including the health of coastal ecosystems, drought conditions, fire, smoke, dust, snow and ice, and the state of oceans, including sea surface temperature and ocean color. 3) Climate monitoring – data from JPSS instruments, including OMPS and CERES will provide continuity to climate data records established using NOAA POES and NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite observations. These data records provide a unified and coherent long-term observation of the environment; the records and products are critical to climate modelers, scientists, and decision makers concerned with advancing climate change understanding, prediction, mitigation and adaptation strategies, and policies. To bridge the gap between products and applications, the JPSS Program has established a proving ground program to optimize the use of JPSS data with other data sources to improve key products and services. A number of operational and research applications will be discussed, including the use of CrIS and ATMS for improved weather forecasting, the use of VIIRS for environmental monitoring of sea ice, smoke, fire, floods, droughts, coastal water quality (e.g. harmful algal blooms), and OMPS for monitoring ozone and aerosol and sulfur dioxide. Demonstrations of the new day night band on VIIRS for enhanced nighttime environmental monitoring will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater use in California’s San Joaquin Valley exceeds replenishment of the aquifer, leading to substantial diminution of this resource and rapid subsidence of the valley floor. The volume of groundwater lost over the past century-and-a-half (~160 km3) also represents a substantial reduction in mass and a large-scale unburdening of the lithosphere, with significant but unexplored potential impacts on crustal deformation and seismicity. Here we use vertical GPS measurements to show that a broad zone of rock uplift up to 3 mm yr-1 surrounds the southern San Joaquin Valley. The observed uplift matches well with predicted flexure from a simple elastic model of current rates of water-storage loss constrained by GRACE satellite data, the majority of which is caused by groundwater depletion. Height of the adjacent central Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada is strongly seasonal and peaks during the dry late summer and fall, out of phase with inflation of the valley floor during wetter months. Our modeling suggests that long-term and late-summer flexural uplift of the Coast Ranges also affects stresses on faults paralleling the San Joaquin Valley. Estimated Coulomb stress evolution on the San Andreas Fault totals 1-2 kPa per decade, with seasonal variations of ~1 kPa at seismogenic depths. The seasonal stress change provides a viable mechanism for observed seasonality in microseismicity at Parkfield, and the trend potentially affects long-term seismicity rates for fault systems adjacent to the valley. We also infer that observed contemporary uplift of the southern Sierra Nevada previously attributed to tectonic and/or mantle derived forces is partly a consequence of human-caused groundwater depletion. We are currently exploring constraints from seasonal and interannual vertical motion and a more realistic viscoelastic Earth model to estimate spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater unloading, as well as potential impacts on apparent fault slip rates estimated with horizontal GPS",

            "abstract": "Foreshock activity has been reported for large earthquakes. The generation mechanism of these foreshocks is one of the most important keys to understand the initiation of large earthquakes. To simulate earthquakes in laboratory, Fukuyama et al. (2014) developed a meter-scale biaxial friction apparatus, using a large shaking table at NIED. Two rectangular parallelepiped gabbro samples were prepared. The upper one fixed to the outside floor of the shaking table was 1.5 m long, 0.5 m high and 0.5 m wide, and the lower one that moved with the shaking table was 0.5 m longer. The original loading apparatus had a long arm between outside floor and the loading frame with two hinges. We renovated the apparatus to have a shorter arm without hinges in order to make the apparatus stiffer. Stick-slip events were observed during the friction tests with both apparatuses. In this study, we analyzed acoustic emission events using continuously recorded elastic waves during the tests with these two apparatus. The foreshock activity was quite high for the less stiff apparatus, and occurrence rate of foreshocks increased toward a main stick-slip event. In contrast, the activity for the stiffer apparatus was much lower. We consider that the difference in stiffness in the lab should correspond to the tectonic setting in nature. For inter-plate earthquakes, foreshocks were reported to be active. Some foreshocks were migrating, and occurrence rate of foreshocks increased toward the main shocks (e.g., Bouchon et al., 2011; Kato et al., 2012; Ruiz et al., 2014). On the other hand, foreshock activities of inland earthquakes were low, and quiescence prior to main shocks was observed. Further, they occurred at the close vicinity of the hypocenter of main shock (e.g., Doi and Kawakata, 2012; 2013). Considering that the loading systems for inter-plate earthquakes are less stiff than those for inland earthquakes, the stiffness of the loading system should control the foreshock activity.",

Second, we present several lines of evidence that indicates that the principal way in which hydraulic fracturing stimulates production from shale gas reservoirs is by inducing slow slip on pre-existing fractures and faults, which are not detected by conventional microseismic monitoring, Finally, we discuss how hydraulic fracturing can be optimized in response to variations of rock properties.",

            "abstract": "The United States strong motion program began in 1932 when the Coast and Geodetic Survey (C&GS) installed eight strong motion accelerographs in California. During the March 1933 Long Beach earthquake, three of these produced the first strong motion records. With this success the C&GS expanded the number of accelerographs to 71 by 1964. With development of less expensive, mass-produced accelerographs the number of strong motion accelerographs expanded to ~575 by 1972. Responsibilities for operating the network and disseminating data were transferred to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 1970 and then to the U.S. Geological Survey in 1973. In 1972 the California Legislature established the California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (CSMIP). CSMIP operates accelerographs at 812 ground stations, with multi-channel accelerographs in 228 buildings, 125 lifelines and 37 geotechnical arrays, in California. The USGS and the ANSS effort operate accelerographs at 1584 ground stations, 96 buildings, 14 bridges, 70 dams, and 15 multi-channel geotechnical arrays. The USC Los Angeles array has 78 ground stations; UCSB operates 5 geotechnical arrays; other government and private institutions also operate accelerographs. Almost all accelerographs are now digital with a sampling rate of 200 Hz. Most of the strong motion data can be downloaded from the Center for Engineering Strong Motion Data (\nhttp://strongmotioncenter.org\n). As accelerographs have become more sophisticated, the concept of what constitutes strong motion has blurred because small earthquakes (M ~3) are well recorded on accelerometers as well as seismometers. However, when accelerations are over ~10%g and velocities over ~1 cm/s, the accelerometers remain on scale, providing the unclipped data necessary to analyze the ground motion and its consequences. Strong motion data are essential to the development of ground motion prediction equations, understanding structural response, performance based engineering, soil response, and inversions for earthquake rupture parameters. While an important number of stations have been installed, many areas of the US are significantly deficient, e.g., recordings were obtained from only 2 stations within 60 km of the Mineral earthquake that damaged the nation’s capital and other areas.",

This increase has been attributed mostly to a series of relatively small tropical volcanic eruptions. The detection of a region of enhanced aerosol extinction over Asia during the monsoon period (Asian tropopause aerosol layer, or ATAL), however, suggests that convective lifting of tropospheric aerosol can also be an important source of aerosols in the lower stratosphere.\nWe present an assessment of the composition and sources of aerosols in the lower stratosphere from model results by the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry Climate Model (GEOSCCM), coupled to the GOCART aerosol model. To ensure the highest similarity to the observed meteorology, we run GEOSCCM in replay mode, i.e. using the MERRA reanalysis meteorology. Our simulation includes natural and anthropogenic emissions of precursor gases and tropospheric aerosols (sulfate, black carbon, organic carbon, dust, and sea salt), volcanic sulfate emissions, and stratospheric sulfate aerosol resulting from the photolysis and oxidation of carbonyl sulfide (OCS). By tagging aerosol sources, we calculate the partitioning of stratospheric aerosol between anthropogenic and natural sources, and the contribution to the stratospheric sulfate loading of volcanic eruptions, transport of tropospheric sulfate, and OCS chemistry.",

            "abstract": "Coastal hazards related to strong storms are one of the most frequently recurring and wide spread hazards to coastal communities today. In particular storm surge, the rise of the sea surface in response to wind and pressure forcing from these storms, can have a devastating effect on the coastline. Therefore, the ability to predict these events quickly and accurately is critical to the protection and sustainability of these coastal areas.\nComputational approaches to the forecasting of storm surge must be able to represent the inherent multi-scale nature of the surge while remaining computationally tractable and physically relevant. This has commonly been accomplished by solving a depth-averaged set of fluid equations on a non-uniform, unstructured grid. These approaches, however, have often had shortcomings due to computational expense, the need for involved model tuning, and missing physics.\nIn this talk, I will outline some of the approaches being developed to address several of these shortcomings through the use of advanced computational approaches including adaptive mesh refinement, higher levels of parallelism including many-core technologies, and more accurate model equations such as the multilayer shallow water equations. Combining these approaches promises to address some of the pressing issues with current state-of-the-art models while continuing to decrease the computational overhead needed to calculate a forecast.",

The structure in seawater density across the ACC puts strong constraints on the intensity of the eastward flow. Here we investigate the density structure across the ACC during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We explore the relationship between the lateral density contrast across the ACC and the vertical density stratification north of the ACC in General Circulation Models (GCMs). We employ a compilation of paleoceanographic constraints from the literature, including the oxygen isotopic composition of benthic foraminifera and the chlorinity and oxygen isotopic composition of pore waters in order to reconstruct these vertical and lateral density contrasts south of Australia during the LGM. We infer that the density contrast across the ACC is slightly reduced relative today’s. While some model simulations produce a density stratification and ACC much stronger than today’s during the LGM, we find the bulk of the paleoceanographic data do not support such a scenario.",

These models have become important tools for tackling a range of water resources problems through their implementation in the formulation and evaluation of Best Management Practices, Total Maximum Daily Loads, and Basin Management Action Plans. For accurate applications of watershed models they need to be thoroughly evaluated through global uncertainty and sensitivity analyses (UA/SA). However, due to the high dimensionality of these models such evaluation becomes extremely time- and resource-consuming. Parameter screening, the qualitative separation of important parameters, has been suggested as an essential step before applying rigorous evaluation techniques such as the Sobol’ and Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) methods in the UA/SA framework. The method of elementary effects (EE) (Morris, 1991) is one of the most widely used screening methodologies. Some of the common parameter sampling strategies for EE, e.g. Optimized Trajectories [OT] (Campolongo et al., 2007) and Modified Optimized Trajectories [MOT] (Ruano et al., 2012), suffer from inconsistencies in the generated parameter distributions, infeasible sample generation time, etc. In this work, we have formulated a new parameter sampling strategy – Sampling for Uniformity (SU) - for parameter screening which is based on the principles of the uniformity of the generated parameter distributions and the spread of the parameter sample. A rigorous multi-criteria evaluation (time, distribution, spread and screening efficiency) of OT, MOT, and SU indicated that SU is superior to other sampling strategies. Comparison of the EE-based parameter importance rankings with those of Sobol’ helped to quantify the qualitativeness of the EE parameter screening approach, reinforcing the fact that one should use EE only to reduce the resource burden required by FAST/Sobol’ analyses but not to replace it.",

            "abstract": "The salient feature of streamlined cells is their small genome size, but “streamlining” refers more generally to selection that favors minimization of cell size and complexity. The essence of streamlining theory is that selection is most efficient in organisms that have large effective population sizes, and, in nutrient-limited systems, favors cell architecture that minimizes resources required for replication. Regardless of the cause of genome reduction, lost coding potential eventually dictates loss of function, raising the questions, what genome features are expendable, and how do cells become highly successful with a minimal genomic repertoire? One consequence of reductive evolution in streamlined organisms is atypical patterns of prototrophy, for example the recent discovery of a requirement for the thiamin precursor 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine in some plankton taxa. Examples such as this fit within the framework of the Black Queen Hypothesis, which describes genome reduction that results in reliance on community goods and increased community connectivity. Other examples of genome reduction include losses of regulatory functions, or replacement with simpler regulatory systems, and increased metabolic integration. In one such case, in the order Pelagibacterales, the PII system for regulating responses to N limitation has been replaced with a simpler system composed of fewer genes. Both the absence of common regulatory systems and atypical patterns of prototrophy have been linked to difficulty in culturing Pelagibacterales, lending credibility to the idea that streamlining might broadly explain the phenomenon of the uncultured microbial majority. The success of streamlined osmotrophic bacterioplankton suggests that they successfully compete for labile organic matter and capture a large share of this resource, but an alternative theory postulates they are not good resource competitors and instead prosper by avoiding predation. The answers to these complex questions hinge on translating gene frequencies into trait based ecological models that reflect the systems biology of cells.",

            "abstract": "The identification of the physical sources causing spatial and temporal fluctuations of state variables such as river stage levels and aquifer hydraulic heads is challenging. The fluctuations can be caused by variations in natural and anthropogenic sources such as precipitation events, infiltration, groundwater pumping, barometric pressures, etc. The source identification and separation can be crucial for conceptualization of the hydrological conditions and characterization of system properties. If the original signals that cause the observed state-variable transients can be successfully \"unmixed\", decoupled physics models may then be applied to analyze the propagation of each signal independently.\nWe propose a new model-free inverse analysis of transient data based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) method for Blind Source Separation (BSS) coupled with k-means clustering algorithm, which we call NMFk. NMFk is capable of identifying a set of unique sources from a set of experimentally measured mixed signals, without any information about the sources, their transients, and the physical mechanisms and properties controlling the signal propagation through the system. A classical BSS conundrum is the so-called “cocktail-party” problem where several microphones are recording the sounds in a ballroom (music, conversations, noise, etc.). Each of the microphones is recording a mixture of the sounds. The goal of BSS is to “unmix'” and reconstruct the original sounds from the microphone records. Similarly to the “cocktail-party” problem, our model-freee analysis only requires information about state-variable transients at a number of observation points, m, where m > r, and r is the number of unknown unique sources causing the observed fluctuations.\nWe apply the analysis on a dataset from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) site. We identify and estimate the impact and sources are barometric pressure and water-supply pumping effects. We also estimate the location of the water-supply pumping wells based on the available data. The possible applications of the NMFk algorithm are not limited to hydrology problems; NMFk can be applied to any problem where temporal system behavior is observed at multiple locations and an unknown number of physical sources are causing these fluctuations.",

Immerse the continental fragments in seawater until the shelves and interior seaways are thoroughly flooded. Add a pinch of CO2 and heat gently. While the ocean is warming and de-oxygenating, gradually stir in the phosphate that was put aside earlier. Keep stirring and adding CO2 and phosphate until a thick black carbon crust suddenly forms. Remove the crust. Repeat to create as many carbon layers as possible before the cake starts to cool and the ocean re-oxygenates.\nIn this talk I will test this recipe using an Earth system model, discussing the potential role of sedimentary phosphate regeneration feedbacks in triggering carbon burial events, and the role of massive carbon burial in creating the necessary conditions to exit an OAE. I will also illustrate how the dynamics of entering and exiting an OAE depend on boundary conditions such as continental configuration and whether enhanced CO2 out-gassing and weathering (and its attendant higher rate of nutrient supply to the ocean) is a sufficient trigger. Finally, in utilizing an isotope-enabled Earth system model (‘GENIE’ – http://mycgenie.seao2.org) in generating an OAE-like event, the plausibility of the recipe can be tested by analyzing the simulated phasing of climate, d13C, ocean redox, and carbon burial, which I will show contrasted with the geological record.",

Reconstructing how the extent and intensity of oxygen depletion has varied with past changes in climate and global carbon cycle perturbation would enable something of the sensitivity of de-oxyenation (and its attendant impacts) to CO2 release to be quantified. However, even the extent of past de-oxygenation is notoriously difficult to constrain from the scattered and generally ocean margin and interior seaway dominated availability of observations.\nSpatially resolved global biogeochemical models can help, as by placing the distribution of records of any particular proxy into a global, mechanistic framework, one can make a more quantitative assessment of the observations. Moreover, multiple proxies with differing controls and sensitivities to redox state can be assessed simultaneously to help further constrain the interpretation.\nIn this talk I will illustrate this (model-data) approach, taking examples from OAE2 and OAE1a, proxy records of seafloor anoxia and photic zone euxinia, and using the ‘GENIE’ Earth system model (http://mycgenie.seao2.org).

            "abstract": "The swash zone is the most landward region of the nearshore where wave energy is ultimately dissipated or reflected. It is the most accessible region of the nearshore but is the most challenging for obtaining measurements and performing numerical modeling simulations. The challenging aspects are related to the moving shoreline, rapid changes in water depth, bed level fluctuations, swift, turbulent, direction-reversing flows, large suspended, bed and sheet flow sediment loads, large void fraction, and fluid infiltration and exfiltration from the beach. The major hurdle numerical modelers face is predicting sediment transport rates on a swash-by-swash basis as errors rapidly lead to inaccuracies in simulated morphological evolution. Recent advances in measurement capabilities are now helping to fill gaps in understanding of sediment transport processes and, in turn, improve predictive capability.\nNewly developed acoustic Doppler profiling velocimeters have allowed for the measurement of hydrodynamics in the direct vicinity of the bed including boundary layer development, bed shear stresses and turbulence dissipation. Bed shear stresses on natural beaches have been estimated at over 20 N/m2; an order of magnitude larger than in the surf zone. Vertical profiles of turbulence dissipation increase near the bed and near the water surface during uprush (shoreward-directed motion) indicating the simultaneous importance of bottom shear and bore-generated turbulence during this phase of motion. Dissipation during backwash (offshore-directed motion) originates at the bed with little influence from fluid motion near the water surface. Other sensors have enabled, for the first time, the measurement of time dependent sheet flow concentrations. Sheet flow thicknesses have been found to exceed 0.03 m under some natural swash zone conditions and concentrations within the mobile sheet flow layer approach the packed bed limit. Sheet flow sediment concentration profiles for varying sheet flow thicknesses are self-similar when scaled by the layer thickness. Example data from field and large-scale laboratory experiments will be presented to show the fidelity of the new measurements and used to highlight continued difficulties encountered in trying to understand the physical processes occurring in the swash zone.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of river discharge is critically important for water resource management, climate modeling, and improved understanding of the global water cycle, yet discharge is poorly known in much of the world. Remote sensing holds promise to mitigate this gap, yet many current approaches for quantitative retrievals of river discharge require in situ calibration or a priori knowledge of river hydraulics, limiting their utility in unmonitored regions. This talk demonstrates a novel remotely sensed discharge retrieval method that requires no prior knowledge and no ancillary data whatsoever. The approach is enabled by a newly discovered river-specific geomorphic scaling phenomenon, termed at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG), which holds that a river’s paired at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG) parameters (a and b, c and f, k and m) are log-linearly related along a river. An associated AMHG discharge retrieval method uses only remotely sensed cross sectional river top width as an input to an unconstrained optimization of width-AHG via a genetic algorithm. Using the AMHG approach, we demonstrate successful retrieval of river discharge to within 20-30% of in situ gauge observations for the Mississippi, Athabasca, and Yangtze rivers. Expanding the method to 34 rivers globally, we find that the AMHG discharge retrieval method is sensitive to river morphology, cross sectional geometry, the quality of input widths, and genetic algorithm optimization parameters. These results suggest that the AMHG discharge retrieval method can meaningfully address global discharge knowledge gaps solely from repeat satellite imagery.",

South Asia, however, is dominated by international river basins where communications among neighboring countries about reservoir storage and management are extremely limited. A suite of satellite observations were combined to create a high quality reservoir storage product in South Asia from 2000 to 2012. The approach used water surface area estimations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices product and the area-elevation relationship to estimate reservoir storage. The surface elevation measurements were from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on board the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). In order to improve the accuracy of water surface area estimations for relatively small reservoirs, a novel classification algorithm was developed. This remotely sensed product contains time series of reservoir elevation, area, and storage for a total of 21 reservoirs, which represents 28% of the integrated reservoir capacity in South Asia. The remotely sensed results were validated comprehensively over five reservoirs through two steps. First, the MODIS surface water classification images were compared with Landsat high resolution (30 m) classifications. Second, the reservoir elevation and storage dataset from remote sensing was evaluated using gauge observations. . The storage estimates were highly correlated with observed values (i.e., the correlation coefficients were all larger than 0.9), with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) ranging from 9.51% to 25.20%. Uncertainty analysis was also conducted for the remotely sensed storage estimations. For the parameterization uncertainty associated with surface area retrieval, the storage mean relative uncertainty was 3.90%. With regard to the uncertainty introduced by ICESat/GLAS elevation measurements, the storage mean absolute uncertainty was 0.67%.",

            "abstract": "In many scientific disciplines, scientists and data managers are bracing for an upcoming deluge of big data volumes, which will increase the size of current data archives by a factor of 10-100 times. For example, the next Climate Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6) will generate a global archive of model output of approximately 10-20 Peta-bytes, while the upcoming next generation of NASA decadal Earth Observing instruments are expected to collect tens of Giga-bytes/day. In radio-astronomy, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will collect data in the Exa-bytes/day range, of which (after reduction and processing) around 1.5 Exa-bytes/year will be stored. The effective and timely processing of these enormous data streams will require the design of new data reduction and processing algorithms, new system architectures, and new techniques for evaluating computation uncertainty. Yet at present no general software tool or framework exists that will allow system architects to model their expected data processing workflow, and determine the network, computational and storage resources needed to prepare their data for scientific analysis.\nIn order to fill this gap, at NASA/JPL we have been developing a preliminary model named DAWN (Distributed Analytics, Workflows and Numerics) for simulating arbitrary complex workflows composed of any number of data processing and movement tasks. The model can be configured with a representation of the problem at hand (the data volumes, the processing algorithms, the available computing and network resources), and is able to evaluate tradeoffs between different possible workflows based on several estimators: overall elapsed time, separate computation and transfer times, resulting uncertainty, and others. So far, we have been applying DAWN to analyze architectural solutions for 4 different use cases from distinct science disciplines: climate science, astronomy, hydrology and a generic cloud computing use case. This talk will present preliminary results and discuss how DAWN can be evolved into a powerful tool for designing system architectures for data intensive science.",

            "abstract": "Generating continuous, accurate and quantitative Holocene temperature estimates from the Arctic is an ongoing challenge. In many Arctic regions, tree ring-based approaches cannot be used and lake sediments provide the most valuable repositories for extracting paleotemperature information. Advances in lacustrine alkenone paleothermometry now allow for quantitative reconstruction of lake-water temperature based on the UK37 values of sedimentary alkenones. In addition, a recent study demonstrated the efficacy of non-destructive scanning reflectance spectroscopy in the visible range (VIS-RS) for high-resolution quantitative temperature reconstruction from arctic lake sediments1. In this presentation, I will report a new UK37-based temperature reconstruction and a scanning VIS-RS record (using the RABD660;670 index as a measure of sedimentary chlorin content) from Kulusuk Lake in southeastern Greenland (65.6°N, 37.1°W). The UK37 record reveals a ~3°C increase in summer lake water temperatures between ~10ka and ~7ka followed by sustained warmth until ~4ka and a gradual (~3°C) cooling until ~400 yr BP. The strong correlation between UK37 and RABD660;670 measured in the same sediment core provides further evidence that in arctic lakes where temperature regulates primary productivity, and thereby sedimentary chlorin content, these proxies can be combined to develop high-resolution quantitative temperature records. The Holocene temperature history of Kulusuk Lake determined using this approach corresponds to changes in the size of the glaciers adjacent to the lake, as inferred from sediment minerogenic properties measured with scanning XRF. Glaciers retreated during early Holocene warming, likely disappeared during the period of mid-Holocene warmth, and advanced after 4ka. I will also discuss new UK37 and RABD660;670 reconstructions from northwestern Svalbard and the central Brooks Range of Alaska within the framework of published regional temperature reconstructions and model simulations of Holocene temperature around the Arctic.\n1. von Gunten, L., D'Andrea, W.J., Bradley, R.S. and Huang, Y., 2012, Proxy-to-proxy calibration: Increasing the temporal resolution of quantitative climate reconstructions.

Keck Center for Active Visualization in Earth Sciences (KeckCAVES), a group of geoscientists and computer scientists collaborate to develop and use of interactive, immersive, 3D visualization technology to view, manipulate, and interpret data for scientific research. The visual impact of immersion in a CAVE environment can be extremely compelling, and from the outset KeckCAVES scientists have collaborated with artists to bring this technology to creative works, including theater and dance performance, installations, and gamification. The first full-fledged collaboration designed and produced a performance called “Collapse: Suddenly falling down”, choreographed by Della Davidson, which investigated the human and cultural response to natural and man-made disasters. Scientific data (lidar scans of disaster sites, such as landslides and mine collapses) were fully integrated into the performance by the Sideshow Physical Theatre. This presentation will discuss both the technological and creative characteristics of, and lessons learned from the collaboration. Many parallels between the artistic and scientific process emerged. We observed that both artists and scientists set out to investigate a topic, solve a problem, or answer a question. Refining that question or problem is an essential part of both the creative and scientific workflow. Both artists and scientists seek understanding (in this case understanding of natural disasters). Differences also emerged; the group noted that the scientists sought clarity (including but not limited to quantitative measurements) as a means to understanding, while the artists embraced ambiguity, also as a means to understanding. Subsequent art-science-technology collaborations have responded to evolving technology for visualization and include gamification as a means to explore data, and use of augmented reality for informal learning in museum settings.",

            "abstract": "Scientific research on quantification of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions at national and sub-national scales within the US has advanced considerably in the last decade. Large investment has been made in building systems capable of observing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at multiple scales, measuring direct anthropogenic fluxes near sources and modeling the linkages between fluxes and observed concentrations. Much of this research has been focused at improving the “verification” component of “monitoring, reporting, and verification” and indeed, has achieved successes in recent years. However, there are opportunities for ongoing scientific research to contribute critical new information to policymakers. In order to realize this contribution, additional but complementary, research foci must be emphasized. Examples include more focus on anthropogenic emission drivers, quantification at scales relevant to human decision-making, and exploration of cost versus uncertainty in observing/modeling systems. I will review what I think are the opportunities to better align scientific research with current and emerging US climate change policymaking. I will then explore a few examples of where expansion or alteration of greenhouse gas flux quantification research focus could better align with current and emerging US climate change policymaking such as embodied in the proposed EPA rule aimed at reducing emissions from US power plants, California’s ongoing emissions reduction policymaking and aspirational emission reduction efforts in multiple US cities.",

            "abstract": "The oceanic carbon isotope gradient between surface and deep waters, as observed in δ13C in surface and deep ocean calcifiers, disappeared or reversed in the aftermath of the Cretaceous/Paleogene asteroid impact and associated mass extinction. This lack in vertical gradient has been interpreted as indicating a near-complete collapse of marine productivity for several hundred thousand to millions of years (a ‘Strangelove’ Ocean), or a decline in functioning of the biological pump, ranging from minor to catastrophic (‘Living Ocean’ model). A long-term cessation or catastrophic decline in the transfer of organic matter to the deep sea does not agree with the observed absence of significant extinction of benthic foraminifera. We investigated by how much the biological pump may have weakened sufficiently to interpret the carbon isotopic data using an Earth system model, and taking into account the role of the oceanic solubility pump, imprinting a gradient opposite in sign to that generated by the biological pump. We find that a weakening, which is considerably less than a complete collapse in organic matter export to the deep sea, can explain the carbon isotope record, in agreement with the lack of benthic extinction. The oceanic carbon isotope record can account for much of the magnitude of observed atmospheric excursion. In addition, we obtain new insight in the mechanistic workings of the ocean carbon cycle: significant organic carbon rain to depth continued even when carbonate mineral ballast production was effectively shut down due to the mass extinction of pelagic calcifiers. Oceanic ecosystems, thus the composition of the exported material and mode of export may have changed profoundly, but the strength of the biological pump was not dramatically disrupted for geologically long periods.",

            "abstract": "Soil carbon stocks have the potential to be a strong source or sink for carbon dioxide over the next century, playing a critical role in climate change. These stocks are the result of small differences between much larger primary carbon fluxes: gross primary production, litter fall, autotrophic respiration and heterotrophic respiration. There was little agreement on predicted soil carbon stocks between Earth system models (ESMs) in the most recent Climate Model Intercomparison Project. Predicted present-day stocks ranged from roughly 500 Pg to over 3000 Pg and predicted changes over the 21st century ranged from -70 Pg to +250 Pg). The primary goal of this study was to understand why such large differences exist.\nWe constructed four reduced complexity models to describe the primary carbon fluxes, making different assumptions about how soil carbon fluxes are modelled in ESMs. For each of these reduced complexity models we statistically inferred the most likely model parameters given the gridded ESM simulation outputs. Gross primary production was best explained by incoming short wave radiation, CO2 concentration, and leaf area index (global GPP comparison of simulation vs reduced complexity model of R2>0.9 (p < 1e-4) with slopes between 0.65 and 1.2 and intercepts between -13 and 67 Pg C yr-1). Autotrophic respiration was best explained as a proportion of GPP (R2 > 0.9 (p < 1e-4) with slopes between 0.78 and 1.1 and intercepts between -15 and 14 Pg C yr-1). Flux between the vegetation and soil pools were best explained as a proportion of the vegetation carbon stock (R2 > 0.9 (p < 1e-4) with slopes between 0.9 and 2.1 and intercepts between -65 and 25 Pg C yr-1). Finally heterotrophic respiration was best explained as a function of soil carbon stocks and soil temperature (R2 > 0.9 (p < 1e-4) with slopes between 0.7 and 1.5 and intercepts between -40 and 15 Pg C yr-1).\nThis research suggests three main lines of decomposition model improvement: 1) improve connecting sub-models, 2) data integration to improve parameterization, 3) modification of model structure. The implied variation in RCM parameterization suggests that data integration could constrain model simulation results. However, the similarity in model structure may lead to systematic biases in the simulations without the introduction of new model structures.",

This region experiences an incredible diversity of weather phenomena, yet ironically is one of the more data-sparse areas in the world. Polar orbiting satellite-borne sensors offer one of the most cost effective means of gaining repetitive information over this data-sparse region to provide insight on Alaskan weather and the environment on scales ranging from synoptic to mesoscale in a systematic manner. Because of Alaska’s high latitude location, polar orbiting satellites can provide coverage about every two hours at high resolution.\nThe Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) Satellite, equipped with a new generation of satellite sensors to better monitor, detect, and track weather and the environment was launched October 2011. Through partnership through the with NESDIS JPSS, the University of Alaska - Geographical Information Network of Alaska (GINA), the NWS Alaska Region was able to gain timely access to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) imagery from S-NPP. The imagery was quickly integrated into forecast operations across the spectrum of NWS Alaska areas of responsibility.\nThe VIIRS has provided a number of new or improved capabilities for detecting low cloud/fog, snow cover, volcanic ash, fire hotspots/smoke, flooding due to river ice break up, and sea ice and ice-free passages. In addition the Alaska Region has successfully exploited the 750 m spatial resolution of the VIIRS/Near Constant Contrast (NCC) low-light visible measurements. Forecasters have also begun the integration of NOAA Unique Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS)/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) Processing System (NUCAPS) Soundings in AWIPS-II operations at WFO Fairbanks and Anchorage, the Alaska Aviation Weather Unit (AAWU) and the Alaska Region, Regional Operations Center (ROC).

            "abstract": "The direct effects of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations on tropical forests have been the focus of a large body of research including manipulative experiments, observational studies and model estimation. The work presented here seeks to evaluate the processes involved in modelling forest dynamics under changes in atmospheric CO2, and ascertain the strengths and deficiencies of these representations. To do this, the Ecosystem Demography Model 2 (ED2) and the Community Land Model (CLM 4.5-BGC) are used to simulate the vegetation dynamics of an old-growth Central Amazonian forest through the next century, and are compared with flux and inventory data. Using default calibrations (regional specificity), both models were found to overestimate mortality rate and biomass increment (by 1.4 and 0.8 Mg ha-1 yr-1 in ED2 and CLM respectively). This comparison has lead to a closer examination of mortality, the allocation of assimilated carbon and the phasing of plant competition. An analysis of model output and literature review corroborate that tree mortality in old growth tropical forests is complex and is driven by a variety of mechanisms. We find that mortality parameterizations used in earth system models may benefit from simplicity until a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of mortality and its drivers becomes available. An analysis of field data also showed that a significant fraction of mature trees in the upper canopy were exhibiting no increment in growth. It is not immediately clear if these trees are exhibiting decreased net primary production, or alternatively, how these trees have shifted their resource usage strategy. Demographic ecosystem models such as ED2 provide a means to represent and test these alternative hypotheses as they emerge.",

            "abstract": "Applying isostasy and erosion to sequentially deformed balanced cross sections links the growth of hinterland structures to the developing foreland basins (FB) adjacent to fold-thrust belts (FTB), adding geologic constraints to modeled exhumation pathways. We sequentially deform the Rio Beni cross section in northern Bolivia (McQuarrie et al., 2008) with kinematic modeling software Move. In our model, topography evolves and basins develop for each model step as deformation, erosion, and isostasy are applied; and are a direct function of the geometry and kinematics of the cross section. The model is constrained by the depth of the foreland and hinterland basins, geology present at the surface, the depth and angle of the decollement, and the shape of the modern observed topography. Topography develops as thrusting occurs and loads the crust, producing a flexural wave and creating accommodation space in adjacent basins. Erosion of material above a newly generated topographic profile unloads the section while basin space is filled. Once the model sufficiently duplicates geologic constraints, a 0.5 km X 0.5 km grid of unique points is deformed with the model and used to determine displacement vectors for each 10 km shortening step. These displacement vectors, in conjunction with a prescribed time interval for each step, determine a velocity field that can be used in a modified version of the advection diffusion modeling software Pecube. Cooling ages predicted using this method are based on deformation rates, geometry, topography, and thermal parameters, and offer insight into possible rates of deformation, erosion, and deposition throughout FTB and FB development. Incorporating erosion, deposition, and isostasy in sequentially deformed balanced cross sections highlights the spatiotemporal aspects of sedimentary wedge propagation, identifies necessary external negative buoyancy affects, and provides additional geologic constraints to modeled exhumation pathways.",

The HSS event occurred from 29 April to 5 May, 2011. The HSS (and not the associated co-rotating interaction region) caused a moderate geomagnetic storm with peak SYM-H = -55 nT and prolonged auroral activity. We analyze TIMED/SABER measurements of nitric oxide (NO) cooling emission during the interval as a measure of thermospheric response to auroral heating. We identify several local cooling emission (LCE) events in high- to sub-auroral latitudes that are presumed to be in response to external driving. Individual cooling emission profiles during these LCE events are enhanced at ~100 to 150 km altitude (ionospheric E layer). For the first time, we present electron density profiles in the vicinity of the LCE events using COSMIC radio-occultation measurements. Measurements at local nighttime show the formation of an enhanced E-layer (about 2.5 times increase over the undisturbed value) at the same approximate altitudes as the LCE peaks. Daytime electron density profiles show relatively smaller enhancements in the E-layer. We suggest that the IT response is due to additional ionization caused by medium energy electron (>20 keV) precipitation into the sub-auroral to high-latitude atmosphere during the HSS event. POES/MEPED electron precipitation data are presented to support this hypothesis. Consequences for space weather forecasting are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Space weather operations presents unique challenges for data systems and providers. Space weather events evolve more quickly than terrestrial weather events. While terrestrial weather occurs on timescales of minutes to hours, space weather storms evolve on timescales of seconds to minutes. For example, the degradation of the High Frequency Radio communications between the ground and commercial airlines is nearly instantaneous when a solar flare occurs. Thus the customer is observing impacts at the same time that the operational forecast center is seeing the event unfold. The diversity and spatial scale of the space weather system is such that no single observation can capture the salient features. The vast space that encompasses space weather and the scarcity of observations further exacerbates the situation and make each observation even more valuable. The physics of interplanetary space, through which many major storms propagate, is very different from the physics of the ionosphere where most of the impacts are felt. And while some observations can be made from ground-based observatories, many of the most critical data comes from satellites, often in unique orbits far from Earth. In this presentation, I will describe some of the more important sources and types of data that feed into the operational alerts, watches, and warnings of space weather storms. Included will be a discussion of some of the new space weather forecast models and the data challenges that they bring forward.",

We developed empirical models predicting base-flow water chemistry from watershed geology, soils, and climate for 1975 individual stream sites across the conterminous USA. We then predicted future solute concentrations (2065 and 2099) by applying down-scaled global climate model predictions to these models. The electrical conductivity model (EC, model R2 = 0.78) predicted mean increases in EC of 19 µS/cm by 2065 and 40 µS/cm by 2099. However predicted responses for individual streams ranged from a 43% decrease to a 4x increase. Streams with the greatest predicted decreases occurred in the southern Rocky Mountains and Mid-West, whereas southern California and Sierra Nevada streams showed the greatest increases. Generally, streams in dry areas underlain by non-calcareous rocks were predicted to be the most vulnerable to increases in EC associated with climate change. Predicted changes in other water chemistry parameters (e.g., Acid Neutralization Capacity (ANC), SO4, and Ca) were similar to EC, although the magnitude of ANC and SO4 change was greater. Predicted changes in ANC and SO4 are in general agreement with those changes already observed in seven locations with long term records.",

            "abstract": "Hawaiian hotspot motion of >40 mm/yr is best documented by paleomagnetic investigations of basalt cores recovered by ocean drilling of the Emperor seamounts during ODP Leg 197 (Tarduno et al., 2003). These data indicate that the trend of the Emperor Seamounts dominantly records motion of the hotspot in the mantle, further suggesting that the great Hawaiian-Emperor bend (HEB) reflects mainly a change in hotspot motion. Data used for Pacific “absolute plate motion models” for times before the age of the HEB are also internally inconsistent with a fixed hotspot assumption; at present the best way to estimate Pacific absolute plate motion prior to the HEB bend is through use of predictions derived from plate circuits (e.g. Doubrovine and Tarduno, 2008). These analyses predict much less motion for the hotspot responsible for the Louisville Seamount chain, as has been observed by paleomagnetic analyses of cores recovered by IODP Expedition 330 (Koppers et al., 2012). Together, the ocean drilling data sets favor hotspot-specific processes to explain high drift rates, such as the model whereby the Hawaiian mantle plume was captured by a ridge in the Late Cretaceous, and subsequent changes in sub-Pacific mantle flow resulted in the trend of the Emperor Seamounts (Tarduno et al., 2009). However, the question of whether there is a smaller signal of motion between groups of hotspots remains. Plate circuit analyses yield a small discrepancy between predicted and actual hotspot locations for times between ca. 47 Ma and 10 Ma that could be a signal of continued southward migration of the Hawaiian hotspot. Alternatively, this could reflect the motion of the group of Indo-Atlantic hotspots relative to Hawaii. New paleomagnetic data from Midway Atoll (ca. 27 Ma) suggests little difference with the present-day latitude of the plume, indicating that the rate of motion of either the Hawaiian hotspot, or the Indo-Atlantic hotspot group, was about 15 mm/yr between 47 and 27 Ma. This compares with a value of 31 +/- 20 mm/yr observed for motion between Atlantic and Pacific hotspots during the mid-Cretaceous (Tarduno and Gee, 1995). As the mid-Cretaceous hotspots have been associated with the paleo-African and Pacific Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces, the latter rate of motion represents one bound on the fixity of these provinces over time.",

Subsequently, this model was extended and applied to 3756 wells in the Fayetteville shale, 2199 wells in the Haynesville shale, and 2764 wells in the Marcellus shale. Out of these, 2057, 703, 1515, and 1063 wells in the Barnett, Fayetteville, Haynesville, and Marcellus, respectively, show evidence of pressure interference between consecutive hydrofractures. For the interfering wells, we calculate their EURs and the distributions of effective gas permeability in the reservoir volumes influenced by these wells. For the non-interfering wells we calculate the lower and upper bounds on their EURs. We show that given the available data, a better field-wide prediction of EUR is impossible. The expected EURs vary between 0.4 and 4.3 Bscf in the Barnett, depending on the well quality. In the other shales the expected well EURs are 0.5 – 3.4 Bcf in the Fayetteville, 1.4 – 7.9 Bcf in the Haynesville, and 1 - 9 Bcf in the Marcellus. The respective mean effective gas permeabilities are 400, 1000, 230, and 800 nanodarcy for the same shales, much high than the core values. Work on the Eagle Ford shale is in progress and will be presented in December.\nIn a shale- horizontal well system, we model rectilinear flow of natural gas as dimensionless nonlinear pseudo-pressure diffusion IVBP with gas sorption on the rock and the multiple planar hydrofractures acting as internal sorbing boundaries. After the initial choked flow, wells must decline as the inverse of the square root of time on production, until the gas pressure starts declining at the midplane of a reservoir cell between two consecutive hydrofractures. At this point of time production decline is exponential. The transition between the square-root-of-time and exponential decline is governed by the characteristic pressure diffusion time, τ, and gas mass in place, M. The dimensionless solution of this IVBP problem reduces the cumulative gas production in all wells to a single universal curve for each play. The ultimate recovery is about 15% of gas-in-place and less so for oil.",

The pattern of temperature change with altitude depends, not just on the rate of emission of GHG, but also on changes in ozone brought about by decreases in the halogen burden of the atmosphere and by the changing temperature itself. We use the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) to investigate secular trends in temperature over the last 30 years and to project these changes into the rest of the 21st century. We compare model results against observations and show that WACCM reproduces many details of the observed trends, including the region of small or insignificant temperature trends near the mesopause; these changes may be understood in terms of the interplay among GHG, ozone, temperature, and the global circulation. The vertical profile of the temperature trend changes substantially in the course of the 21st century compared to the last 30 years as ozone responds to the curtailment of halogen emissions and as changing temperatures modify its photochemical equilibrium concentration.",

            "abstract": "Mare Crisium partially fills a Nectarian basin 556×455 km in diameter on the lunar nearside, one of several such basins associated with a mass concentration or “mascon.” The basin's interior topography is dominated by an elevated, circumferential bench that extends inward from the perimeter by ~20% of the basin's radius. A set of wrinkle ridges, landforms that are interpreted as folds over reverse faults that may be blind or surface breaking, lies along the inner edge of this bench. With the elastic dislocation program COULOMB we matched model solutions for surface displacements to topographic profiles across five of these wrinkle ridges. We find that the faults underlying the ridges each accumulated substantial along-slip displacement (c. 0.5–1.5 km) and, despite differences in geometry (some faults are planar whereas others are listric), they all penetrate the lunar lithosphere to depths of 18–20 km. Notably, the wrinkle ridges that follow the inner edge of the elevated bench are spatially coincident with the outer boundary of the highest free-air gravity anomaly values for the Crisium mascon returned by the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission. Further, a GRAIL-derived crustal thickness model of the basin indicates that the subsurface geometry of the deep-seated faults bears a strong resemblance to the shape of the crust–mantle boundary beneath Crisium. The basin's mascon, therefore, appears to be structurally bound by a set of individual features that together define a shallowly and outward-dipping reverse ring-fault system. TEKTON finite-element models of lithospheric loading within the basin suggest that the combined action of a subsiding superisostatic mantle plug and a rising subisostatic collar of thickened crust produce a stress state consistent with the orientation of, and sense of displacement along, these ring faults. Importantly, Crisium is not the only lunar mare-filled basin that hosts both a mascon and a topographic bench. Humorum, Imbrium, Nectaris, Orientale, and Serenitatis also feature wrinkle-ridge-bounded, arcuate portions of elevated topography within their perimeters—and so they, too, may be underlain by deep-seated reverse faults.",

Using statistical methods and historic data, we make inferences about the effects of temperature and precipitation variations on low flow metrics. Path analysis essentially normalizes the center of timing to remove the annual stream flow amount effects on timing. Annual weekly minimums are generally more sensitive to total annual runoff than to the center of timing of the annual hydrograph. When normalized, the effect of center of timing is lower. The relative sensitivity of low flows to precipitation and temperature has important implications for projections of hydrologic drought in the Pacific Northwest because global circulation models produce robust estimates of temperature changes but disagree on projected precipitation amounts. Trends in low flow metrics, including 7q10 summer, are largely negative. Trends in the 25th percentile of annual flow show declines and center of stream flow timing is occurring earlier.",

            "abstract": "The present change from oceanic subduction beneath the Sunda Arc to arc-continent collision east of Sumba is merely the latest stage in a complex collision history that began more than 20 million years ago. Understanding present-day tectonics requires restoring the pre-collisional margins and unravelling the history of the entire Sunda-Banda Arc, not just a segment centred on Sumba.\nSeismic tomography displays a single folded slab beneath the Banda Arc around which mantle has flowed. Above this is a wide actively deforming zone of complex geology. Australian crust was first added to the Sunda margin in the Cretaceous. Early Miocene closure of the oceanic gap north of Australia led to further additions of continental crust during collision of the Sula Spur. Few microcontinental fragments were sliced from New Guinea as commonly interpreted. Most are parts of the Sula Spur fragmented by extension and strike-slip faulting during development of subduction zones and rollback into the Banda embayment.\nMany metamorphic ‘basement’ rocks are significantly younger than expected. They were metamorphosed during multiple episodes of extension which also exhumed the sub-lithospheric mantle, melted the deep continental crust, created new ocean basins, and dispersed continental crust throughout the inner and outer arc, and forearc, so that in places Australian crust is colliding with Australian crust. Thus, many of the arc volcanoes are built on continental not oceanic crust, and sediment eroded from recently emergent islands is compositionally different to subducted sediment that contributed to arc magmas.\nThe published literature is inadequate. New fieldwork and data are required, particularly in remote areas, with integration of information from a variety of sources (e.g. industry seismic and multibeam bathymetry, remotely acquired imagery) and sub-disciplines (e.g. geochronology, geochemistry, seismology, modelling). No single methodology can provide a complete solution.",

            "abstract": "Ocean anoxic event 2 (OAE2) represents the largest perturbation of the carbon cycle of the past 250 million years. At many localities OAE2 is marked by large geochemical excursions and coincides with a change from bioturbated, organic-poor deposits to laminated, organic-rich deposits. The adage that correlation does not demonstrate causation is often and appropriately invoked in discussing geologic records such as these. On the other hand, cause and effect relationships do lead to correlation, and such observations are robust, objective, and potentially insightful.\nSamples from Demerara Rise provide an excellent opportunity to examine details of correlation among OAE2 geochemical records. The Demerara Rise record is largely complete across 10 million years, and deposits are comprised of > 100 m of finely laminated, carbonaceous silty claystones at each of 5 sites that together represent a 1 km thick paleodepth transect. Preservation of microfossils and organic matter is excellent, and a number of geochemical trends have been well characterized at these sites. We will focus on the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neodymium, molybdenum, and osmium records from two sites. Oxygen isotopes suggest the water column had a relatively cool mid-water zone and warmer surface and bottom waters throughout the interval studied. Demerara Rise samples also consistently exhibit low to very low δ15Ntotal values (-1 to -3.5‰), but during OAE2 only very low δ15Ntotal values (< -2.5‰) are present. The initiation of the δ15Ntotal shift coincides with the initiation of the OAE2 δ13Corg excursion, but the δ15Ntotal shift lasts longer. Os isotopic ratios and concentrations both change dramatically at the initiation of the δ13Corg excursion and correlate closely with similarly dramatic changes in Mo and Nd records at the deeper site. At the shallower site, though, the Nd change lags the Os and δ13Corg shifts, and the Mo shifts during the OAE2 interval are modest and of similar magnitude to variations outside the OAE2 interval. Integrating these data sets seems to defy a simple, single-cause explanation. Instead they suggest explaining the OAE2 record may require a complicated but resolvable sequence of events that includes conducive starting conditions, novel inputs, and circulation changes.",

In particular, sunspot numbers are available before, during, and immediately after the Maunder Minimum (1645-1715). The instruments and methods used to count sunspots have changed over the last 400+ years. This leads to systematic changes in the sunspot number that can mask, or artificially introduce, characteristics of the sunspot cycle. The most widely used sunspot number is the International (Wolf/Zurich) sunspot number which is now calculated at the Solar Influences Data Center in Brussels, Belgium. These numbers extend back to 1749. The Group sunspot number extends back to the first telescopic observations of the Sun in 1610. There are well-known and significant differences between these two numbers where they overlap. Recent work has helped us to understand the sources of these differences and has led to proposed revisions in the sunspot numbers. Independent studies now support many of these revisions. These revised sunspot numbers suggest changes to our understanding of the sunspot cycle itself and to our understanding of its connection to climate change.",

These large programs provide a unique set of challenges when compared to more traditional programs.

I’ll chat about the importance of managerial and management skills, which most of us scientists prefer to avoid. I’ll also chat about making decisions about what long-term measurements to make and when to stop. Data management is still the weakest part of environmental networks; what needs to be done.

            "abstract": "NASA GPM Ground Validation (GV) activities have transitioned from the pre to post-launch era. Prior to launch direct validation networks and associated partner institutions were identified world-wide, covering a plethora of precipitation regimes. In the U.S. direct GV efforts focused on use of new operational products such as the NOAA Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor suite (MRMS) for TRMM validation and GPM radiometer algorithm database development. In the post-launch, MRMS products including precipitation rate, types and data quality are being routinely generated to facilitate statistical GV of instantaneous and merged GPM products. To assess precipitation column impacts on product uncertainties, range-gate to pixel-level validation of both Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and GPM microwave imager data are performed using GPM Validation Network (VN) ground radar and satellite data processing software. VN software ingests quality-controlled volumetric radar datasets and geo-matches those data to coincident DPR and radiometer level-II data. When combined MRMS and VN datasets enable more comprehensive interpretation of ground-satellite estimation uncertainties.\nTo support physical validation efforts eight (one) field campaigns have been conducted in the pre (post) launch era. The campaigns span regimes from northern latitude cold-season snow to warm tropical rain. Most recently the Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology Experiment (IPHEx) took place in the mountains of North Carolina and involved combined airborne and ground-based measurements of orographic precipitation and hydrologic processes underneath the GPM Core satellite. One more U.S. GV field campaign (OLYMPEX) is planned for late 2015 and will address cold-season precipitation estimation, process and hydrology in the orographic and oceanic domains of western Washington State. Finally, continuous direct and physical validation measurements are also being conducted at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility multi-radar, gauge and disdrometer facility located in coastal Virginia.\nThis presentation will summarize the evolution of the NASA GPM GV program from pre to post-launch eras and highlight early evaluations of GPM satellite datasets.",

The origins of these dust particles include asteroid collisions, cometary activity, and geothermal activity of the planetary moons, for example, the water dust cloud ejected from Saturn’s moon Enceladus. Radio and plasma wave instruments have been used to detect such dust particles via voltage pulses induced by impacts on the spacecraft body and antennas. The first detection of such dust impacts occurred when Voyager 1 passed through Saturn's ring plane. Since then, dust impacts have been detected by radio and plasma wave instruments on many spacecraft, including ISEE-3, Cassini, and STEREO. In this presentation, we review the detection of dust particles in the solar system using radio and plasma wave instruments aboard various spacecraft since the Voyager era. We also show characteristics of the dust particles derived from recent observations by Cassini RPWS in Saturn's magnetosphere. The dust size distribution and density are consistent with those measured by the conventional dust detectors. A new method of measuring the electron density inside the Enceladus plume based on plasma oscillations observed after dust impacts will also be discussed. The dust measurement by radio and plasma wave instruments complements that by conventional dust detectors and provide important information about the spatial distribution of dust particles due to less pointing constraints and the larger detection area.",

            "abstract": "The presence of the Hawaiian plume is manifested by the Hawaiian swell [1] and voluminous eruption of Ni-rich lavas [2] with enriched isotopic compositions [3]. Here we estimate the conditions of melt generation needed to reproduce both features.\nWe used thermodynamic treatment for fractional melting [4] and melting parameterizations for pyroxenites [5] and peridotite [6] to determine pyroxenite contribution in magmas Xpx as functions of potential temperature TP, pyroxenite abundance in the source P, radius of the melting zone R and distance to the plume axis. The final pressure of melting is set to correspond with the base of the lithosphere (3 GPa) at the plume axis and increases with the distance from the axis [7]. The Hawaiian plume axis is thought to be currently between Loihi (L), Kilauea (K) and Mauna Loa (ML), which are 25 km, 32 km and 44 km radially away from the plume axis, respectively [3]. To determine Xpx, we assumed that magmas are accumulated melts produced on a circular sampling zone of 50 km diameter centered beneath each volcano [8].\nPreliminary calculations show that for TP = 1525°C, P = 0.07 and R = 55 km, XpxML = 0.59, XpxK = 0.49 and XpxL = 0.45. XpxML and XpxK are similar to values suggested by [2]. Computed liquidus temperatures at 3 GPa are consistent with those of Hawaiian parental melts (1500-1520°C; [9]). XpxL is higher than suggested by [2] (XpxL = 0.09) but their estimate is based on only one glass analysis. Our model is also consistent with isotopic compositions: K and L have similar εNd, while ML is more enriched [3]. Finally, we can compute the density deficit using parameterization of [1] and relate it to the volume flux volume flux [10]: we obtain 3.2 km3/Yr, a value similar to the estimations based on the Hawaiian swell model [1].\n1-Ribe & Christensen EPSL 1999; 2-Sobolev et al.

            "abstract": "Throughout the eastern United States, forests are experiencing regrowth, and the sequestration of carbon (C) associated with this regrowth makes these forests a key component of greenhouse gas mitigation strategies (Albani et al., 2006). Through production and decomposition of plant biomass, the C and nitrogen (N) cycles are closely coupled, suggesting that N has a major impact on the cycling of C in N-limited Mid-Atlantic forest systems. The majority of C and N in a temperate forest system is located in the soil organic matter (Templer et al., 2012), so understanding soil N is important for estimating the potential for C sequestration in soils as Mid-Atlantic forests mature (Knicker, 2010). Due to the scarcity of old growth forest stands in the region, previous empirical studies of Mid-Atlantic forests in the old growth stage of succession are limited. I sampled soil C and N in twenty-five remnant old growth forests and matched secondary stands in the Mid-Atlantic to identify differences in soil organic C and N mass and concentrations of nitrate and ammonium. No significant differences were observed between the old growth and secondary growth concentrations of inorganic N species, N fraction, and C:N ratio. Rather, secondary growth values for these variables were found to have significant, positive linear relationships with old growth values, indicating that biotic and abiotic factors varying on a regional scale are driving variability seen in these N characteristics. Further, this suggests that as forest stands reach approximately 75 years in age, these N characteristics are largely established and not likely to change significantly as stands enter the old growth successional stage. Both N fraction and O-horizon depth were shown to have significant negative correlations with old growth stand age. These results indicate that old growth forest stands have a more efficient microbial decomposer community, which could have significant implications for both soil N and C pools. This study highlights the importance of analyses conducted at the regional-scale for understanding ecosystem-level processes, and further analysis of mature and old growth forests conducted at the regional-scale is needed to better understand the dynamics of forest N cycling through succession.",

            "abstract": "Transit time distributions (TTDs) play a key role in the transport processes, the interpretation of atmospheric tracer data and the predictions made on groundwater resources. However TTDs are not accessible from field measurements. Only hints on these TTDs can be obtained from anthropogenic tracer concentrations, also commonly called \"groundwater ages\". We evaluate the predictive capabilities of the information contained in anthropogenic tracer concentrations on groundwater renewal times through the use of Lumped Parameter Models (LPMs) instead of fully developed aquifer models. Towards this end, we develop an assessment methodology in three steps. First, a synthetic crystalline aquifer model representing the site of Plœmeur (Brittany, France) is used to give, at any point, references for observables quantities (anthropogenic tracer concentrations of CFC-11, 85Kr and SF6), for non-observables quantities (the TTDs), and for the prediction objective (groundwater renewal times). Second, several LPMs are considered with one, two or three parameters, and are parameterized by fitting the reference anthropogenic concentrations. Third, the reference renewal times obtained from the synthetic model are compared to the renewal times obtained independently from the LPMs. Statistical analyses over the aquifer show that a good fit of the anthropogenic tracer concentrations is a necessary but not sufficient condition for acceptable predictions. The use of only one anthropogenic tracer gives poor predictions differing by 7 to 12 years to the references. The use of two sufficiently different anthropogenic tracers not only reduce the errors but surprisingly yield to very accurate predictions with errors smaller than 3 years. The additional use of a third anthropogenic tracer does not improve the predictive capabilities. Careful a posteriori analyses reveal that reference TTDs have widely varying shapes from well peaked in recharge zones where flows are diverging to broadly distributed in more converging zones. Nonetheless, the same LPM whether it is an inverse Gaussian or a shifted exponential, gives excellent predictions everywhere. In such circulation patterns where dispersive and mixing processes prevail at different scales, broad distributions seem to be more suited than multi-modal or shape-free models.",

            "abstract": "Kinetic energy variance as a function of spatial scale for wind fields is commonly estimated either using second-order structure functions (in the spatial domain) or by spectral analysis (in the frequency domain). It will be demonstrated that neither spectra nor second-order structure functions offer a good representation of the variance as a function of scale. These difficulties can be circumvented by using a statistical quantity called spatial variance. It combines the advantages of spectral analysis and spatial statistics. In particular, when applied to observations, spatial variances have a clear interpretation and are tolerant for missing data. They can be related to second-order structure functions, both for discrete and continuous data. For data sets without missing points the relation is statistically exact. Spatial variances can also be Fourier transformed to yield a relation with spectra. The flexibility of spatial variances is used to study various sampling strategies, and to compare them with second-order structure functions and spectral variances. It is shown that the spectral sampling strategy is not seriously biased to calm conditions for scatterometer ocean surface vector winds, and that one-fifth of the second-order structure function value is a good proxy for the cumulative variance.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater systems are often characterized by long travel times relative to human timeframes, and most established techniques for dating groundwater work at the decadal to millennial scale. Viruses are attractive tracers of short (<3 yr) travel times in aquifers because they have unique genetic signatures, are detectable in trace quantities, and are mobile in groundwater. Virus “snaphots” result from infection and disappearance in a human or animal population over time; therefore, the virus snapshot shed in the fecal wastes of an infected population at a specific point in time can serve as a marker for tracking virus and groundwater movement. Examples of virus tracing demonstrate their ability to characterize travel times in high groundwater velocity settings, but are less applicable to low velocity settings due to virus degradation. Because they can trace very short travel times and identify the presence of preferential flowpaths, virus approaches provide new insights about aquifers unavailable from standard hydrogeologic approaches.",

            "abstract": "Salt marshes are coastal ecosystems which play a large role in the bio-geomorphological evolution of intertidal areas. The dense stands of halophytic plants which populate salt-marsh systems largely contribute to govern their dynamics, influencing marsh hydrodynamics and sediment transport through enhanced flow resistance and settling, and direct particle capture by plant stems. In addition, plants are known to increase vertical accretion through direct organic accretion. Looking across the salt-marsh landscape can one see the signatures of feedbacks between landscape and biota? Field evidence and the results of biomorphodynamic models indeed show that the interplay between physical and biological processes generates some striking biological and morphological patterns at different scales. One such pattern, vegetation zonation, consists in a mosaic of vegetation patches, of approximately uniform composition, displaying sharp transitions in the presence of extremely small topographic gradients. Here we extend the model proposed by Marani et al. (2013) to a two-dimensional framework, furthermore including the effect of direct capture of sediment particles by plant stems. This allows us to account for the effect of the drainage density of tidal networks on the observed biogeomorphic patterns and to model the coupled evolution of marsh platforms and channel networks cutting through them. A number of different scenarios have been modelled to analyze the changes induced in bio-geomorphic patterns by plants with different characteristics, within marshes characterized by different drainage densities, or subjected to changing environmental forcing such as rates of relative sea level rise and sediment supply. Model results emphasize that zonation patterns are a signature of bio-geomorphic feedbacks with vegetation acting as a landscape constructor which feeds back on, directly alters, and contributes to shape tidal environments. In addition, model results show that biogeomorphic feedbacks critically affect the response and the resilience of salt-marsh landscapes to changes in the environmental forcing.",

            "abstract": "Increasing temperatures and other changes continued in the Arctic over the last decade, even though the rate of global warming has decreased in part due to a cool Pacific Ocean. Thus Arctic temperatures have increased at least 3 times the rate of mid-latitude temperatures. Credibility for persistent Arctic change comes from multiple indicators which are now available for multiple decades. Further, the spatial pattern of Arctic Amplification differs from patterns of natural variability. The role of the Arctic in the global climate system is based on multiple interacting feedbacks represented by these indicators as a causal basis for Arctic Amplification driven by modest global change. Many of these processes act on a regional basis and their non-linear interactions are not well captured by climate models. For example, future loss of sea ice due to increases in CO2 are demonstrated by these models but the rates of loss appear slow. It is reasonable to suspect that Arctic change which can produce the largest temperature anomalies on the planet and demonstrate recent extremes in the polar vortex could be linked to mid-latitude weather, especially as Arctic change will continue over the next decades. The meteorological community remains skeptical, however, in the sense of “not proven.” Natural variability in chaotic atmospheric flow remains the main dynamic process, and it is difficult to determine whether Arctic forcing of a north-south linkage is emerging from the most recent period of Arctic change since 2007. Nonetheless, such a hypothesis is worthy of investigation, given the need to further understand Arctic dynamic atmospheric processes, and the potential for improving mid-latitude seasonal forecasts base on high-latitude forcing. Several AGU sessions and other forums over the next year (WWRP, IASC,CliC) address this issue, but the topic is not ready for a firm answer. The very level of controversy indicates the state of the science.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates drivers of changing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export in the UK’s River Thames basin between 1881 and 2011. Specifically, we consider how impacts of land-use change drive increases in DOC concentrations and fluxes at the basin outlet. First, we estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in the Thames basin for the period. Second, SOC losses due to land-use change are partitioned into DOC lost to surface waters through runoff, DOC leached into deeper soils and groundwater, and losses to the atmosphere as CO2.\nSOC stocks for each year are calculated from a large database of typical SOC levels for land-uses present in the Thames basin and are combined with literature values of transition times for SOC to adjust to a new level following land-use change. We also account for climate change effects on SOC stock due to temperature increases, which reduces SOC stocks as soil organic matter turnover rates increase. Soil carbon fluxes are calculated as the inter-annual change in SOC. We use a 130 year record of DOC concentration in the Thames, and parameters from previous long-term nitrate modeling, to constrain estimates of fluvial DOC rises caused by SOC losses.\nWe developed a sewage model to evaluate the relative contribution of point and diffuse sources to the total DOC flux. The results show that sewage effluent point sources do not contribute to DOC concentration at the monitoring point, except for isolated periods of exceptionally low flow.\nOur work shows for the majority of years, diffuse sources are the main contributor to annual DOC loads. Moreover even though there are many small inter-annual variations in DOC concentration, the major change in both estimated SOC storage and fluvial DOC export occurred during WWII due to substantial changes in land-use, the legacy of which continues to date.",

The May-June-July-August (MJJA) seasonal mean state of EASM is generally reproduced well in the model, including the precipitation, monsoon trough in the South China Sea (SCS), cross-equatorial airflow and the large-scale monsoon airflow. The northward propagation of the monsoonal precipitation is also well simulated in the model. The development of the 30-60-day oscillation related to EASM is investigated using lagged regression and composite analysis. The model captures the mechanisms associated with the Northward Propagation of the Intraseasonal Oscillation (NPISO). A warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly, cyclonic vorticity and the moisture convergence lead the convection, favoring the northward propagation of the convection. Additionally the easterly windshear contributes to the NPISO. Compared to the observation, in the model the onset of the Mei-yu season takes place 5 days earlier and the duration of the Mei-yu’s rainy episode is shorter. The onset of the Mei-yu sea son is influenced by the phase relationship of convective activity between the tropical West Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) and SCS. The results indicate that dry conditions over the tropical WPWP concurrent with maximum convection over SCS favor a faster northward propagation of the ISO, which yields to the early onset of the Mei-yu season. The onset of the Mei-yu season is also influenced by the seasonal mean conditions. During events with an earlier onset, the MJJA mean precipitation is enhanced. The increased precipitation is caused by a stronger moisture transport and the westward extension of the western North Pacific Subtropical High (WNPSH).",

Launched in 1999, ASTER has been acquiring data for 15 years. ASTER is a joint project between Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry; and US NASA. Data processing and distribution are done by both organizations; a joint science team helps to define mission priorities. ASTER acquires ~550 images per day, with a 60 km swath width. A daytime acquisition is three visible bands and a backward-looking stereo band with 15 m resolution, six SWIR bands with 30 m resolution, and 5 TIR bands with 90 m resolution. Nighttime TIR-only data are routinely collected. The stereo capability has allowed the ASTER project to produce a global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) data set, covering the earth’s land surfaces from 83 degrees north to 83 degrees south, with 30 m data postings. This is the only (near-) global DEM available to all users at no charge; to date, over 28 million 1-by-1 degree DEM tiles have been distributed. As a general-purpose imaging instrument, ASTER-acquired data are used in numerous scientific disciplines, including: land use/land cover, urban monitoring, urban heat island studies, wetlands studies, agriculture monitoring, forestry, etc. Of particular emphasis has been the acquisition and analysis of data for natural hazard and disaster applications. We have been systematically acquiring images for 15,000 valley glaciers through the USGS Global Land Ice Monitoring from Space Project. The recently published Randolph Glacier Inventory, and the GLIMS book, both relied heavily on ASTER data as the basis for glaciological and climatological studies. The ASTER Volcano Archive is a unique on-line archive of thousands of daytime and nighttime ASTER images of ~1500 active glaciers, along with a growing archive of Landsat images. ASTER was scheduled to target active volcanoes at least 4 times per year, and more frequently for select volcanoes (like Mt. Etna and Hawaii). A separate processing and distribution system is operational in the US to allow rapid scheduling, acquisition, and distribution of ASTER data for natural hazards and disasters, such as forest fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, earthquakes, and floods. We work closely with other government agencies to provide this service.",

            "abstract": "The chemical evolution of magmas and the great compositional diversity observed in igneous rocks is ultimately driven by physical process including multiphase convection in magmatic systems and melt-crystal separation (e.g. Marsh and Maxey, 1985). Key to quantitative description of these systems is to accurately calculate the rate and timing of crystal-melt separation. This calculation requires accurately computing four separate, but closely linked, quantities: heat transfer, phase equilibria, crustal stresses and multiphase dynamics, all of which can play an important role in determining the compositional and melt fraction histories of magmatic bodies. Both heat transfer and crustal stresses influence the state variables of temperature and pressure controlling phase equilibria, and melt dynamics governs the distribution of chemical species and motion of physically distinct phases.\nWe use a coupled computational approach to examine the interaction of these processes in shaping measurable geochemical and geophysical processes. Previous work using this technique showed that one mechanism for the production of compositional (Daly) gaps was controlled by the joint probability of melt extraction efficiency (driven by melt-crystal dynamics) and the probability in time of the occurrence of distinct melt fractions (primarily driven by thermal processes). In the present work we expand this analysis to examine the temporal evolution of these probability distributions and consider dynamics in active reservoirs during recharge events, their relation to melt chemistry, zircon saturation, and introduce over-pressure within a framework of eruption probability. We analyse systems that span a range of sizes from oceanic rhyolites to the Fish Canyon Tuff, and examine the mixing of magmatic parcels leaving the reservoir from a crystal or crystal cluster perspective. We also examine the heterogeneity of accumulated stresses and chemistry of the residual material in the putative plutonic residue that is corollary to extracted material. In most instances the last stage of melt evolution for silicic systems requires melt extraction in a relatively narrow window of crystallinity between 50-70%.",

            "abstract": "The recent development of global Earth-system models, which include dynamic representations of both physical climate and carbon cycle processes, has led to new insights about how the climate responds to human carbon dioxide emissions. Notably, several model analyses have now shown that global temperature responds linearly to cumulative CO2 emissions across a wide range of emissions scenarios. This implies that the timing of CO2 emissions does not affect the overall climate response, and allows a finite global carbon carbon budget to be defined for a given global temperature target. This linear climate response, however, emerges from the interaction of several non-linear processes and feedbacks involving how carbon sinks respond to changes in atmospheric CO2 and climate. In this presentation, I will give an overview of how carbon sinks and carbon cycle feedbacks contribute to the overall linearity of the climate response to cumulative emissions, and will assess how robust this relationship is to a range of possible changes in the carbon cycle, including (a) potential positive carbon cycle feedbacks that are not well represented in the current generation of Earth-system models and (b) negative emission scenarios resulting from possible technological strategies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.",

We use an observed positive correlation between |δE| and |jo| to extrapolate the results to currently inaccessible regions of space (e.g., the solar corona). Magnitudes of energy dissipation per unit volume in the solar corona due to current-driven instabilities can be estimated using electric and magnetic fields values extrapolated to coronal values. The energy dissipation values estimated this way represent an upper bound on the true energy dissipation in these regions. For instance, previous studies have estimated current densities in the solar corona to range from 104 to 107 μA m-2, which correspond to extrapolated δE magnitudes in excess of 12,000 mV/m and thus, energy dissipation rates in excess of 108 μW m-3. These rates are six orders of magnitude higher than is necessary to explain the temperature of the corona. Similar extrapolations can be made for astrophysical phenomena such as the surface of a neutron star. The results are of particular importance for future missions like Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter.",

We deliberately selected charcoals from organic soil horizons, to investigate the inherent biological and chemical stability of charcoal C without the protective influence of soil minerals. We use 14C radiocarbon dating to determine the age of the charcoals, differential scanning calorimetry to assess thermal stability, and solid-state 13C NMR to assess the chemical structure. Specifically, we employ C-H dipolar-dephasing NMR experiments to estimate the relative abundance and molecular dimensions of condensed aromatic domains and aliphatic structures (see figure). We tested the hypothesis that the stability, quantified as 14C age and thermal stability, is related to the dimension of condensed aromatic ring structures in the charcoal. Our results suggest that the dimension of the condensed aromatic ring clusters may be an important molecular parameter to include in algorithms used to model/predict the residence time of charcoal C in soil. Our findings also have implications for the design of “biochars” for soil C sequestration.",

            "abstract": "Substantial evidence points to the existence of hydrated sulfate phases on the Martian surface1-3. In addition, the discovery of recurring slope lineae could point to an active brine hydrologic cycle on the surface4,5. The rapid dehydration of both hydrated sulfates and sulfate-rich brines can lead to the formation of amorphous sulfates. Evidence suggests that the Rocknest soil target and the Sheepbed mudstone interrogated by the Mars Science Laboratory at Gale crater contain ~30 wt.% XRD amorphous material that is rich in both sulfur and iron6. These factors have led us to consider hydrated amorphous iron sulfates as possible components in Martian surface materials. Amorphous iron sulfates were created through multiple synthesis routes, and then characterized with total x-ray scattering, TGA, SEM, visible/near-infrared (VNIR), thermal infrared (TIR), and Mössbauer techniques. We synthesized amorphous ferric sulfates (Fe(III)2(SO4)3•~5-8H2O) from sulfate-saturated fluids via two pathways: vacuum dehydration and exposure to low relative humidity (<11%) using a LiCl buffer. Amorphous ferrous sulfate (Fe(II)SO4•~1H2O) was synthesized via vacuum dehydration of melanterite (Fe(II) SO4•7H2O). We find that both the ferric and ferrous sulfates synthesized from these methods lack long-range (>10Å) order, and thus are truly amorphous. VNIR and TIR spectral data for the amorphous sulfates display broad, muted features consistent with structural disorder and are spectrally distinct from all crystalline sulfates considered for comparison. Mössbauer spectra are also distinct from all crystalline phase spectra available for comparison. The amorphous sulfates should be distinguishable based on the position of their Fe-related absorptions in the visible range and their spectral characteristics in the TIR. In the NIR, which is the spectral range that has primarily been used to detect sulfates on Mars, the bands associated with hydration at ~1.4 and 1.9 µm are significantly weakened, which greatly reduces their detectability in soil mixtures.\n",

We are a Calgary based startup founded in 2009 with 10 employees, and we are considered a global leader in the direct air capture (DAC) field.\nWe will review CE's DAC technology, based on a wet-scrubbing “air contactor” which absorbs CO2 into aqueous solution, and a chemical looping “regeneration” component, which liberates pure CO2 from this aqueous solution while re-making the original absorption chemical. CE's DAC tecnology exports purified atmospheric CO2, combined with the combustion CO2 from plant energy usage, as the end product.\nWe will also discuss CE's 2014-2015 end-to-end Pilot Demonstration Unit. This is a $7M technology demonstration plant that CE is building with the help of key industrial partners and equipment vendors. Vendor design and engineering requirements have been used to specify the pilot air contactor, pellet reactor, calciner, and slaker modules, as well as auxiliary systems. These modules will be run for several months to obtain the engineering and performance data needed for subsequent commercial plant design, as well as to test the residual integration risks associated with CE's process.

            "abstract": "This study explores the relationships between lava tube morphology, lava effusion rate estimates, and the mechanism of lava tube formation. Effusion rate estimates for extinct lava tubes were calculated using a combination of three-dimensional mapping of lava tube caves, and viscosity models utilizing whole-rock compositions (Giordano et al., 2008, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett.), and petrographic data (Harris and Allen, 2008, J. Geophys. Res.). The mechanism of lava tube formation was evaluated using measured tube lengths and effusion rate estimates and comparing these data with observations from Hawaiian channel- and tube-fed flows (Pinkerton and Wilson, 1994, J. Volcanol. Geoth. Res.).\nThree-dimensional map data for lava tube caves were collected using a laser rangefinder to measure the cross-sectional shape and down-tube distance, and a tandem compass/inclinometer to measure the azimuth and inclination between survey stations in the tube. Total tube length consists of the mapped tube length plus the distance between collapse pits and trenches along the trend of the tube.\nEffusion rates were estimated using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, measured mean cross-sectional radii and slope of lava tubes, and estimated effective viscosities of rock samples collected from mapped tubes at temperatures between 1080-1160 °C and water contents of 0-1 wt.%. A lava density of 1560 g/cm3was used for 0.40 vesicle fraction basalt.\nThere is a positive correlation between measured tube lengths and cross-sectional radii (Fig. 1). We propose that this relationship reflects the positive correlation between flow lengths and effusion rates in active Hawaiian channel-fed flows. Measured tube lengths vs. effusion rate estimates were compared with data for Hawaiian channel-fed flows (Fig. 2). The two data sets overlap and have parallel trends. These results suggest that the lava tube caves studied formed by the roofing-over of channel-fed flows or had segments of channel-fed flow.\nWe propose that the lengths and mean cross-sectional radii of lava tubes can be used to evaluate whether or not extinct lava tubes formed by the roofing-over of channel-fed flows. Length and radius measurements of extra-terrestrial lava tubes could provide insight into their formation mechanism independent of in situ observation and rock sampling.",

            "abstract": "Both the Sierra Nevada (CA) and Idaho batholiths display clear evidence for magmatism simultaneous with dextral strike-slip movement during the Cretaceous. There is, however, a significant difference between both the style and the timing of the deformation and magmatism in these two magmatic arcs. The Sierra Nevada displays dextral strike-slip tectonism active from 92-80 Ma, as evidenced by a series of dextral shear zones associated with the axis of active magmatism. The concept of the plutons intruding en echelon pull-apart structures in a dextral system has been supported by the recognition of widespread, syn-tectonic shear zones along the axis of the arc. Further, a modern analog can be found in El Salvador, where dextral translation of the forearc has resulted in en echelon dextral shearing in a magmatic arc dominated by arc-perpendicular normal faulting. In contrast, dextral tectonism in Idaho both starts (~103 Ma) and ceases earlier (~90 Ma) than strike-slip motion in the Sierra Nevada batholith. Further, the deformation is better developed, as recorded by the ~5 km thick, dextral transpressional western Idaho shear zone (WISZ). The WISZ deformation affects I-type magmas that are not typically considered part of the Idaho batholith. The main phase of the 85-70 Ma, peraluminous Idaho batholith (Atlanta lobe) only contains local evidence for dextral shearing, such as the NS-oriented Johnson Creek-Profile Gap shear zone. The reasons for this along-strike variation in deformation for Cretaceous magmatic arcs in North America may relate to the collisional and translation histories of offshore terranes.",

To provide a social context for discussion of environmental issues, students first gave presentations on the demographics, economics, and methods of land use of the people that used the park over the last 400 years. At locations along Quantico Creek, students presented topics that covered geologic processes at work on the landscape, progressive farming methods promoted by some early Virginians, and agricultural methods to stabilize soil and its nutrients. Finally, at the Cabin Branch Pyrite Mine (active 1889–1920) we discussed laborer work conditions and the environmental impact of tailings, as well as the process and effects of remediation. Students tested pH levels in the creek upstream and downstream of the mine as one concrete way to personally observe the results of recent remediation (since 1994), with neutral pH in both locations indicating success. Students wrapped up the course with written reflections, from their own perspectives with respect to socially and environmentally responsible land use, on the geologic processes and human impacts that shaped the park. Social justice and environmental stewardship are two lenses that allow students to find personal meaning and social relevance in geology coursework, as emphasized in this field course. Many students, in this and other courses, have provided feedback indicating that activities I have developed and used along these lines are some of the most engaging and inspiring in their geology coursework.",

The ionospheric slab thickness is a measure of the shape of the ionospheric profile and can be obtained from the ratio of total electron content (TEC) to the F-region peak electron density (NmF2). In this study the ionospheric slab thickness was obtained during one year of extremely low solar activity (March 2009 to February 2010). The period analyzed were separated in three seasonal groups: equinoxes, June solstice (winter) and December solstice (summer) months. The ionospheric slab thickness was studied at two stations located around the southern crest of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA). One station located in the inner edge of the anomaly region, named Palmas (10.12º S, 48.21º O, 7.73º S dip lat), and another station located under the crest of the anomaly, situated at São José dos Campos (23.07º S, 45.52º O, 19.61º S dip lat). The TEC data have been obtained from dual-frequency GPS receivers and the NmF2 data were calculated from the f0F2 parameter scaled from ionograms recorded by simultaneous measurements of digital ionosondes. The diurnal, seasonal and latitudinal variations of the ionospheric slab thickness were then analyzed. The minimum values of TEC and NmF2 were observed in both stations during the early morning, and the maximum values during afternoon hours. During the summer and equinoctial periods the slab thickness reached the higher values compared to those observed during the winter solstice months. The nearly equatorial site of Palmas showed values of daytime slab thickness larger than those observed at the low latitude station of São José dos Campos, except during the June solstice months. At São José dos Campos, a pronounced pre-dusk increase in the equivalent slab thickness was observed during the winter solstice months. From the calculated slab thickness we also inferred the atmospheric neutral temperature (Tn) over both the stations.

However, these models have been criticized for lacking a strong empirical basis for their damage functions, which do little to alter assumptions of sustained GDP growth, even under extreme temperature scenarios. We implement empirical estimates of temperature effects on GDP growth-rates in the Dynamic Integrated Climate and Economy (DICE) model via two pathways, total factor productivity (TFP) growth and capital depreciation. Even under optimistic adaptation assumptions, this damage specification implies that optimal climate policy involves the elimination of emissions in the near future, the stabilization of global temperature change below 2°C, and a social cost of carbon (SCC) an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates. A sensitivity analysis shows that the magnitude of growth effects, the rate of adaptation, and the dynamic interaction between damages from warming and GDP are three critical uncertainties and an important focus for future research.",

            "abstract": "The amount of carbon being taken up by the biosphere is clearly increasing; however, the variance in the global carbon cycle also appears to be increasing. This increasing variance may be indicative of C sink instability, or it may simply be noise in the global C cycle. Therefore identifying the mechanisms driving this variance is critical for predicting future behavior of the global C cycle. Here we combine satellite observations of terrestrial productivity and atmospheric observations of CO2 and its isotopic composition as diagnostics to gain new insight into the changing behavior of the global C cycle. We use these observations to partition net C uptake into photosynthetic gains and respiratory losses. Based on this approach, we conclude that much of the observed variance in the global C cycle appears to be due to the respiratory response of the terrestrial tropics and that much of the recently observed increase in net C uptake is due to diminished respiratory losses during the well documented warming hiatus. Lastly, we use isotopic analyses of CO2 in this respiratory flux to infer the biosphere’s response to changing climate. From these analyses we conclude that water vapor feedbacks present a first-order control on the biosphere’s capacity to continue taking up atmospheric CO2 as Earth’s atmosphere continues to warm.",

            "abstract": "Cloud cover is the most important factor affecting the amount of solar irradiance at any given time of the day at the ground level. Predicting accurately the extent, motion, formation, dissipation, and transmittance of ever-changing clouds is a complex and somewhat unrealistic task for solar forecast applications, even for small temporal (few minutes ahead) and spatial scales (few kilometers). Nevertheless, motivated by the the increasing interest on solar energy, much effort has been put into predicting solar irradiance based on sky-images. These models often involve many free parameters, and as a result, their accuracy is penalized when the they are not robust to the uncertainty in the many parameters involved.\nIn this work we address some of these issues by implementing several robust solar irradiance forecast models based on cloud cover information retrieved form sky-images. These can be either local, high-resolution images captured from sky-imagers or low resolution, regional-wide satellite images. We employ several algorithms to process the images and incorporate that information into forecast algorithms for global and direct irradiance for horizons ranging from 15 minutes out to several hours into the future. One of the algorithms is a sector method that detects the direction of motion of potentially sun-blocking clouds and propagates them into the future. Another model is a k-nearest-neighbor algorithm that uses features extracted from sky-images to identify past instances that can be used to predict the future. A second tier machine learning model is applied to incorporate the extracted information from sky-images with other meteorological and irradiance measurements to produce the final forecast output. The forecast performance is compared against other models that do not use cloud cover information. The performance analysis focuses on the periods of high cloud variability that result in large and sudden ramps in the solar irradiance.",

            "abstract": "The role of interactions between components of the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy balance in determining regional surface temperature changes is examined in diffusive energy balance model (EBM) simulations. These interactions have implications for the interpretation of local feedback analyses when they are applied to regional surface temperature change. In the EBM, local feedback analysis succeeds at accounting for the EBM-simulated temperature change given the changes in the radiative forcing, atmospheric energy transport, and radiative feedbacks. However, the inferences about the effect of individual components of the TOA energy balance on regional temperature changes do not account for EBM simulations in which individual components are prescribed or \"locked\". As changes in one component of the TOA energy balance affect others, unambiguous attribution statements relating changes in regional temperature or its intermodel spread to individual terms in the TOA energy balance cannot be made because these interactions between changing components are important. Interactions between change components of the TOA energy balance are also important in general circulation model simulations of climate change.",

            "abstract": "Boulder ozone profile measurements tend to feature structures with multiple layers in the troposphere, so called laminae. These have been shown to be related to several phenomena, including stratospheric air intrusions that are transported to the location of measurements and local gravity wave perturbations (Boulder is located near the Rocky Mountain range where gravity waves are prevalent). In addition, observations indicate that air from the tropical tropopause layer can be transported into regions with multiple tropopauses over the middle latitudes in the vicinity of the subtropical jets. We use GMAO's GEOS-5 data assimilation system products, including Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), interpolated to Boulder, Colorado, USA (40N, 105W) to assess incidence of upper tropospheric jets that influence UTLS ozone distribution. The proximity of the subtropical jet to Boulder results in frequent observations of multiple tropopauses. We analyze ozonesonde data launched in June-July 2014 to determine the origins of laminae observed in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS). Our tools include back trajectory analysis coupled with 4D satellite ozone profile data, including those from NASA's Aura Microwave Limb Sounder instrument. Filaments causing laminae in ozone profiles observed at Boulder will be tracked to origins in either stratospheric or tropospheric intrusions using reverse domain-filling (RDF) trajectory methods. Detailed studies of several ozone profiles collected over Boulder in June/July 2014 will help determine techniques for future analysis of a larger dataset that goes back to 1978. Ozone variability in the UTLS over Boulder is of importance for studies of local climatological ozone conditions, their causes/attribution, and with regard to EPA ozone regulations at the mountain sites across the USA.",

Limited studies are in place that demonstrates the state-of-the-art in deriving very high resolution (VHR) land cover products. In addition, most methods heavily rely on commercial softwares that are difficult to scale given the region of study (e.g. continents to globe). Complexities in present approaches relate to (a) scalability of the algorithm, (b) large image data processing (compute and memory intensive), (c) computational cost, (d) massively parallel architecture, and (e) machine learning automation. In addition, VHR satellite datasets are of the order of terabytes and features extracted from these datasets are of the order of petabytes. In our present study, we have acquired the National Agricultural Imaging Program (NAIP) dataset for the Continental United States at a spatial resolution of 1-m. This data comes as image tiles (a total of quarter million image scenes with ~60 million pixels) and has a total size of ~100 terabytes for a single acquisition. Features extracted from the entire dataset would amount to ~8-10 petabytes. In our proposed approach, we have implemented a novel semi-automated machine learning algorithm rooted on the principles of \"deep learning\" to delineate the percentage of tree cover. In order to perform image analytics in such a granular system, it is mandatory to devise an intelligent archiving and query system for image retrieval, file structuring, metadata processing and filtering of all available image scenes. Using the Open NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) initiative, which is a partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), we have developed an end-to-end architecture for designing the database and the deep belief network (following the distbelief computing model) to solve a grand challenge of scaling this process across quarter million NAIP tiles that cover the entire Continental United States. The AWS core components that we use to solve this problem are DynamoDB along with S3 for database query and storage, ElastiCache shared memory architecture for image segmentation, Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) for image feature extraction, and the memory optimized Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) for the learning algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Megathrust rupture is mostly offshore. Using land-based GPS data only, it is difficult to tell whether viscoelastic relaxation, when compared to afterslip, is important in driving post-seismic deformation immediately after the earthquake. GPS/acoustic observations, which measure the displacements of seafloor precision transponder arrays using sea surface platforms equipped with GPS antennas and acoustic transducers, were made by Japan Coast Guard and Tohoku University during and after the 2011 M 9 Tohoku earthquake. Five seafloor sites near the main rupture were reoccupied 4-10 times over the first two years after the earthquake and provide a unique opportunity to study the importance of viscoelastic relaxation. After the large coseismic seaward motion (up to ~ 31 m), the near-trench sites immediately reversed their direction to move landward, opposing the continuing seaward motion of all land sites. This landward motion (~ 30-50 cm over the first year) is faster than the plate convergence rate (8.3 cm/year) and therefore cannot be explained by the relocking of the subduction fault. Using numerical models with transient mantle rheology, we demonstrate that the fast landward motion is caused by viscoelastic relaxation of stresses induced by the asymmetric rupture of the thrust earthquake. For shallow megathrust events, the hanging wall has a lower stiffness and hence always exhibits larger coseismic seaward motion than the landward motion of the footwall. Greater tension is thus induced landward of the rupture area. As the mantle wedge undergoes viscoelastic relaxation, this tension in the upper plate drives the observed landward motion of the trench area. Tests on the effects of mantle rheology, coseismic slip distribution, and plate thickness suggest the wide presence of viscoelastic landward trench motion following large subduction earthquakes. This work indicates that afterslip models assuming a purely elastic Earth substantially overestimated or underestimated afterslip downdip or updip of the rupture zone, respectively. Post-seismic fault behavior has to be studied in the context of a viscoelastic Earth even immediately after the earthquake.",

The TWINS mission has two spacecraft flown in Molniya orbits (inclination of 63.4, apogees of ~ 7.2 Re). Instruments aboard each spacecraft measure ENAs in the energy range from 1 to 100 keV / amu, and provide composition measurements for energies <~ 32 keV. The phasing of the two TWINS spacecraft allows for near continuous observations of the inner magnetosphere with high temporal (~ 1 min) and spatial (~0.1 Re) resolution. The IBEX mission is equipped with two sensitive ENA cameras designed to observe the interactions between our heliosphere and the interstellar medium. However, its vantage point from outside the magnetosphere (apogee ~ 40 Re in the ecliptic plane) also provides a unique 'outside in' view of the magnetosphere. IBEX images ENAs in the energy range of ~0.4 - 6 keV along a broad cut of the magnetosphere along the GSE-Z direction. The complementary ENA observations from TWINS and IBEX provide a global perspective of the dynamics of the magnetosphere. We present these observations of the global magnetospheric ENA response to shock-associated storms and substorms.",

            "abstract": "Methane is a very important greenhouse gas that traps more radiation per molecule than CO2 and is a driver of tropospheric chemistry. Over the anthropocene methane has increased dramatically, but the role of changes in wetland emissions is not well constrained. The Community Land Model (CLM) of the Community Earth System Models is able to estimate methane emissions from wetlands and rice paddies. Our comparison of CH4 emission observations at 16 sites around the planet reveals, however, that there are large discrepancies between the CLM predictions and the observations. The goal of our study is to use optimization methods to adjust sensitive model parameters in order to minimize the root mean squared error (RMSE) between model predictions and observations. These parameters have been selected based on a sensitivity analysis. We run CLM4.0 on the Yellowstone supercomputer and a single CLM simulation for obtaining the CH4 emission predictions at the 16 locations takes on average between 15 and 30 minutes. Thus, only few simulations can be allowed in order to find a near optimal solution within an acceptable time. To achieve this goal, we use a recent computationally efficient global optimization algorithm that uses a radial basis function (RBF) surrogate model to approximate the objective function in a computationally cheap way. We use the information from the RBF to select new sample points in the variable domain that are most promising with respect to improving the objective function value. In every iteration of the algorithm, we update the RBF to improve its fit and predictions. We show with pseudo data (generated by using the default model parameters) that our optimization algorithm is able to make excellent progress with respect to decreasing the RMSE. Using the true CH4 emission observations, we show that by optimizing the parameters we are able to significantly reduce the RMSE between observations and model predictions.",

            "abstract": "The global mass circulation links the tropics to the extratropics and the stratosphere to the troposphere. Such a global mass circulation consists of three distinct but inter-connected thermally direct circulation cells: the tropical Hadley cell, the stratospheric cell, and the extratropical Hadley cell. Collectively, these circulation systems move warm air poleward aloft and cold air equatorward near the surface, forming a broad thermally direct circulation in each hemisphere. In the extratropics, the mass circulation is carried out mainly by baroclinically amplifying (or westward tilting) Rossby waves. The westward tilting waves are responsible for a net poleward mass transport aloft and equatorward mass transport below. The stratosphere is the integral part of the warm air branch of the global mass circulation. Based on the mass circulation theory, we will show that as long as the westward tilting of planetary waves in the stratosphere and their overall amplitude can be captured, the CFSv2 forecasts would still be very skillful in predicting zonal mean anomalies even though it cannot do so for the exact locations of planetary waves and their spatial scales.\nThe temporal and spatial variation of the warm air branch in the stratosphere is synchronized with the cold air branch in the troposphere below. Because the pole is the destination point of the warm air branch and the beginning point of the cold air branch, the synchronized poleward warm air advancement and equatorward cold air movement would lead to a strong stratosphere-troposphere coupling over the polar region. Such stratosphere-troposphere coupling via mass circulation is a new source of the prediction skill for intra-seasonal to interannual climate variability.",

Satellite-based passive microwave sensors and hydrological modeling are utilized to establish ‘remote-sensing based discharge stations’, and observed time series cover 1998 to the present. The advantages over in-situ gauged discharges are: a) easy access to remote or due to political reasons isolated locations, b) relatively low maintenance costs to maintain a continuous observational record, and c) the capability to obtain measurements during floods, hazardous conditions that often impair or destroy in-situ stations. Two MODIS instruments aboard the NASA Terra and Aqua satellites provide global flood extent coverage at a spatial resolution of 250m. Cloud cover hampers flood extent detection; therefore we ingest 6 images (the Terra and Aqua images of each day, for three days), in combination with a cloud shadow filter, to provide daily global flood extent updates.\nThe Flood Observatory has always made it a high priority to visualize and share its data and products through its website. Recent collaborative efforts with e.g. GeoSUR have enhanced accessibility of DFO data. A web map service has been implemented to automatically disseminate geo-referenced flood extent products into client-side GIS software. For example, for Latin America and the Caribbean region, the GeoSUR portal now displays current flood extent maps, which can be integrated and visualized with other relevant geographical data. Furthermore, the flood state of satellite-observed river discharge sites are displayed through the portal as well. Additional efforts include implementing Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards to incorporate Water Markup Language (WaterML) data exchange mechanisms to further facilitate the distribution of the satellite gauged river discharge time series.",

            "abstract": "Deformation mechanism switches caused by grain-size reduction are a likely principal cause of strain localization, assisted by development of crystallographic preferred orientation, interconnected weak-phase layering, phase changes, and on longer time-scales, shear heating. Grain-size reduction results in a marked increase in the rate of grain-size sensitive creep mechanisms, which include grain-boundary diffusion creep, pressure solution, diffusion- or dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding, and dislocation creep in which grain-boundary migration is the main recovery mechanism (DRX creep). In polyphase systems, grain-boundary sliding plus grain-boundary diffusion may allow the development of a well-mixed fine-grained aggregate, in which the grain size is controlled by the phase showing the greatest degree of grain-size reduction by dynamic recrystallization. The resulting fine-grained mixture resists grain growth, and may be up to three orders of magnitude weaker than the undeformed rock.\nMicrostructural weakening requires a minimum level of stress to produce the required deformation. This buffers the stress, even when there is a velocity boundary condition to the system, along a plate boundary, for example. Shear zones therefore evolve at constant stress, and the cumulative width w of a plate boundary shear zone is a function of the strength of the undeformed rock, the imposed velocity difference, and the rheology of the shear zone material. This allows a first order prediction of w as a function of depth in the lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen is widely cited as the principal growth limiting nutrient for plants in moist, mesic and dry arctic tundra ecosystems. As such, the widespread increases in deciduous shrubs that have been observed across the Arctic as the climate has warmed over the past 30 years, are generally attributed to enhanced nitrogen supply due to temperature-induced increases in soil organic matter decomposition.\nA recent factorial nitrogen-phosphorus (N x P) chronic addition experiment in the Canadian low Arctic demonstrated that birch shrub growth was as limited by the availability of P as by N. How widespread is this N P colimitation of birch growth, and might variation in the extent of N relative to P limitation be a primary determinant of niche space and therefore species coexistence in birch hummock tundra plant communities? In this talk I will address the following specific questions: a) Can birch leaf N:P be used as a reliable indicator of the relative importance of N and P as growth limiting nutrients? b) What is the pattern of birch leaf N:P ratios across the Arctic? c) Do species that grow alongside birch differ in leaf N:P in ways that suggest differing relative limitation?\nWith the assistance of many colleagues, I collected 150 birch leaf and underlying soil samples from 50 different locations across the North American and European Arctic. I used the factorial experiment described above to test the suitability of leaf N:P ratio as an indicator of relative nutrient limitation for all species in birch hummock tundra communities, and then interpreted the patterns of birch leaf N:P across the Arctic to characterise the spatial extent of NP co-limitation.\nThe results strongly suggest that birch shrub growth is colimited by N and P availability across its range. This conclusion is important because the controls on P availability in soils are as much abiotic (e.g. pH) as biotic (e.g. decomposition), implying that the impacts of climate warming on P supply to plants may be quite different to those of N supply. These results will be discussed in terms of plant community responses to greenhouse warming, as well as ongoing change in unmanipulated tundra vegetation, all with a view to better predicting the likely outcomes of climate warming on plant growth and community structure in the low Arctic.",

This talent drain will impact the industry at a critical time: from 2007 to 2012 the oil and gas industry reports an uptick by more than 162,000 jobs, a 40% increase in comparison to total U.S private sector employment growth of 1%. To address the talent shortfall, recruiters at times resort to poaching from competitors for key positions.\nA contrasting high demand-fluctuating talent supply paired with a spiking enrollment number of non-resident students in Texas and Oklahoma higher Ed institutions posed several questions. If the issue of demand was such, then the talent of these individuals regardless their immigration status should be irrelevant. The second question was whether these recent graduates were considered a part of the diversity conversation or whether diversity was still a national concept tied to countries’ borders.\nThis paper will report on some of the outcomes of these conversations and projects, as well as provide an argument that US oil and gas organizations could widen the concept of minorities, realize that nonresident professionals classify as such and view diversity in a global fashion rather than nationally.",

As outlined in the 2012 Solar and Space Physics Decadal Survey, the prospects for new flagship or even large- and medium-cost space science missions in the coming decade are limited. On the other hand, the Survey also points out the many intrinsic and indeed critical values of low cost missions, in which outstanding scientific discovery can be accomplished in targeted and important ways, with a timeliness and capacity for hands-on training of the next generation of space scientists and engineers. In this presentation, we provide examples of such missions that have recently or are currently making new space science discoveries in targeted areas on smaller and less costly platforms (e.g., balloons, CubeSats, etc.) than those from the larger, more costly, community-consensus missions (e.g., LWS missions, STP missions, etc.). We also outline examples of new sensor designs and technologies that lend themselves to such resource-limited platforms, as well as examples of missions that are made possible that could answer long-standing and key space science questions. Finally, we note several exciting enabling technologies with the potential to substantially improve or even transform small, low-cost mission capabilities. While such missions will not likely ever fully replace the larger strategic missions, in the coming decade, they will certainly provide fresh, vibrant opportunities for innovative approaches on PI-led missions; these missions would stand alone scientifically as well as complement, augment, and provide continuity and community engagement between the larger strategic missions.",

The calibration and validation process of these estimates requires the generation of an identically-scaled soil moisture product from existing in-situ networks. This can be achieved via the integration of NLDAS precipitation data to perform calibration of models at each ­in-situ gauge. In turn, these models and the gauges’ volumetric estimations are used to generate soil moisture estimates at a 500m scale throughout a given test watershed by leveraging, at each location, the gauge-calibrated models deemed most appropriate in terms of proximity, calibration efficacy, soil-textural similarity, and topography. Four ARS watersheds, located in Iowa, Oklahoma, Georgia, and Arizona are employed to demonstrate the utility of this approach. The South Fork watershed in Iowa represents the simplest case – the soil textures and topography are relative constants and the variability of soil moisture is simply tied to the spatial variability of precipitation. The Little Washita watershed in Oklahoma adds soil textural variability (but remains topographically simple), while the Little River watershed in Georgia incorporates topographic classification. Finally, the Walnut Gulch watershed in Arizona adds a dense precipitation network to be employed for even finer-scale modeling estimates. Results suggest RMSE values at or below the 4% volumetric standard adopted for the SMAP mission are attainable over the desired spatial scales via this integration of modeling efforts and existing in-situ networks.",

            "abstract": "We have been observing Ionian volcanism from NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) for more than two decades. The frequency of our observations increases dramatically when spacecraft are observing Io in order to complement the data returned by the spacecraft. The Japanese Space Agency’s (JAXA) Hisaki (Sprint-A) mission recently observd the Jupiter system from earth orbit, monitoring the Io Plasma Torus and Jovian aurora. In order to investigate the possible influence of Io volcanism on the torus, we observed Io’s volcanoes from the IRTF in Hawaii between September 2013 and May 2014. We imaged Io at 2.2, 3.5, and 4.8 microns in eclipse and reflected sunlight. We also observed Io during occultation by Jupiter, which allows us to locate and characterize individual volcanic eruptions, with greater spatial accuracy, on the Jupiter-facing hemisphere.\nThe 2013 3.5 micron images of a sunlit Io showed no obvious bright volcanic features. However, further increases in spatial resolution is possible with shift-and-add processing of short exposure images. Preliminary occultation lightcurves from 2013 show moderate levels of activity at Kaneheliki/Janus and Loki, the two volcanic centers most often observed in occultation lightcurves. Loki was much brighter in 2013 than during the New Horizons flyby in 2007, but not as bright as during the Galileo era (see figure).\nFrom February 2014 through May 2014, due to a planned upgrade on the SPEX instrument and an unplanned required repair on the NSFCam2 instrument (both of which we have used previously), we exclusively used the CSHELL instrument as an imager. Unfortunately, CSHELL was not designed for imaging and has limited spatial resolution and photometric precision, complicating image analysis.",

            "abstract": "The Navy’s Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS1) in a two-way coupled mode is used for two-month regional extended-range prediction for the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and Tropical Cyclone 05 (TC05) that occurred during the DYNAMO period from November to December 2011. Verification and statistics from two experiments with 45-km and 27-km horizontal resolutions indicate that 27-km run provides a better representation of the three MJO events that occurred during this 2-month period, including the two convectively-coupled Kelvin waves associated with the second MJO event as observed. The 27-km run also significantly reduces forecast error after 15-days, reaching a maximum bias reduction of 89% in the third 15-day period due to the well represented MJO propagation over the Maritime Continent. Correlations between the model forecasts and observations or ECMWF analyses show that the MJO suppressed period is more difficult to predict than the active period. In addition, correlation coefficients for cloud liquid water path (CLWP) and precipitation are relatively low for both cases compared to other variables. The study suggests that a good simulation of TC05 and a good simulation of the Kelvin waves and westerly wind bursts are linked. Further research is needed to investigate the capability in regional extended-range forecasts when the lateral boundary conditions are provided from a long-term global forecast to allow for an assessment of potential operational forecast skill.\n_____________________________________________________\n1COAMPS is a registered trademark of U.S. Naval Research Laboratory",

            "abstract": "Previous work by Graven et al. (Science, 2013) has shown that the seasonal cycle of CO2 has increased throughout the troposphere by 50% north of 45°N since the 1950s. This suggests large-scale ecological changes centered on the boreal and temperate forests, and a contribution from the Arctic. Graven et al. indicated a comparable 30-50% increase in seasonal net ecosystem exchange (NEE) fluxes is required to explain the observed change in CO2 amplitude. We examine changes in NEE fluxes in boreal and Arctic regions for the period 1986-2012 using two time-varying atmospheric inversions, RIGC and Jena. The inversions show that, over the last few decades, the largest percent increases in seasonal NEE occur between 50-70°N. They also provide evidence that larger summertime uptake is the main driver of CO2 amplitude increases.\nOne way that summer uptake may have increased is by changes in plant functional type (PFT), away from evergreen toward more deciduous forest coverage. Eddy covariance NEE measurements are helpful in determining the seasonality of net CO2 exchange for different PFTs. The seasonal amplitude in net CO2 uptake by deciduous boreal forests can easily be twice as large as for evergreen forests. In this presentation we will explore the relative influence of deciduous and evergreen plant functional types on the seasonal cycle of CO2 using FluxNet data and atmospheric transport modeling, and the potential effect of changing forest composition on CO2 amplitude trends. Understanding the processes affecting the seasonal cycle of NEE fluxes will allow better predictions of the net carbon-uptake or release in this climatically sensitive region.",

The oil fires that burned for an estimated 10 months, created a huge smoke plume whose spatial extent went at times beyond the Persian Gulf region, mobilized across the Saharan Desert reaching as far west as the North Atlantic Ocean. The Nimbus-7 TOMS Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer, in operation from October 1978 to May 1993, measured the near UV radiances that in the mid-1990’s became the input in the calculation of the well know Absorbing Aerosol Index that represented a major breakthrough in satellite-based aerosol remote sensing. Thus, unknowingly to the world, the N7-TOMS sensor was collecting in 1991 an unprecedented daily record of what can be considered the worst environmental catastrophe affecting the atmosphere since the beginning of the era of space-based remote sensing in the 1970’s. An overview of the temporal and spatial extent of the synoptic scale 1991 Gulf War smoke plume as seen by the Nimbus-7 TOMS Absorbing Aerosol Index will be presented.",

            "abstract": "During periods of enhanced geomagnetic activity, geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) flow in power systems potentially causing damage to system components or failure of the system. The largest GIC are produced when there are large rates of change of the geomagnetic field (dB/dt). It is well established that the main phase of a geomagnetic storm, particularly the magnetic substorms occurring during that period, are a cause of large GIC and hence a risk factor for power systems. However, some power system disturbances have been associated with the occurrence of a storm sudden commencement (SSC) prior to the main phase. We investigate the magnetic signature observed on the ground and the associated solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions for both SSC and sudden impulse (SI) events which are grouped together as sudden commencements (SC). SCs are primarily attributed to a sudden enhancement of the magnetopause current. For some events, we show there is a high latitude enhancement (HLE) of the SC amplitude and corresponding dB/dt. The limited spatial extent suggests an ionospheric current source. Examination of the polarity of the change in the X-component magnetic field show the HLE is due to a sudden increase of the ionospheric convection electrojets. The occurrence of the HLE is more prevalent for SSC-type SCs, SCs caused by coronal mass ejections as opposed to co-rotating interaction regions, and SCs associated with a solar wind speed vsw > 390 km/s prior to the SC or a Δvsw > 50 km/s at the time of the SC.",

Of central importance to this success has been the development of astrochronologic testing methods for the evaluation of astronomical-climate influence on sedimentation; this can be especially challenging for deep-time strata that lack sufficient independent time control (e.g., radioisotopic data) to unambiguously calibrate observed spatial rhythms to temporal periods. Most deep-time (pre-Pleistocene) astrochronologic testing methods fall into one of two categories: (1) those that test for expected amplitude or frequency modulation imposed by an astronomical signal, or (2) those that test for bedding hierarchies (\"frequency ratios\") that are predicted by the dominant astronomical periods. In this talk, I discuss the historical context of these methods, recent advances that overcome subjective evaluation and circular reasoning, and their implementation in a new “open source” software package for astrochronology (Meyers, 2014, astrochron: An R Package for Astrochronology).",

            "abstract": "Earth System Models (ESMs) are designed to project changes in the climate-carbon cycle system over the coming centuries. However, ES modelling still suffers from a significant timescale problem – we need to find constraints on the huge range of projected changes in the climate-carbon system over the next century, but the contemporary observational data that we have relates to much shorter timescales. One way around this problem is to utilise longer-term palaeoclimate proxies to estimate the response of the ES on the timescales of interest, but here data availability and spatial coverage is often limiting. An alternative is to look for relationships between the more extensive observations of short-term variability and the longer-term sensitivity of the ES to anthropogenic forcing. According to the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT), such relationships should be common in a large-class of systems including the ES (Leith, 1975). In principle it should even be possible to get good estimates of ES sensitivities to external forcing purely by analysing the temporal correlations evident in climate observations - unfortunately this typically requires a prohibitively long time-series of observations.\nAn alternative approach to utilising the constraints embodied in short-term variability relies on “Emergent Constraints”. An Emergent Constraint is a relationship between some ES sensitivity to anthropogenic forcing and an observable feature of the ES. We call it emergent because it emerges from the ensemble of ESMs, and it is described as a constraint because it enables an observation to constrain the estimate of the sensitivity in the real world. As an example, we will describe emergent relationships between the sensitivity of tropical land-carbon storage to warming and the sensitivity of the annual growth-rate in atmospheric CO2 to tropical temperature anomalies, for both the current (CMIP5, Wenzel et al., 2014) and previous generation ESMs (C4MIP, Cox et al., 2013). When combined with contemporary observations of the atmospheric CO2 concentration and the tropical temperature, these relationships provide consistent constraints on the sensitivity of tropical land carbon to warming in the real climate system.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s thermal evolution is controlled by the amount of heat released by the radioactive decay of 40K, 238U, 235U and 232Th. Their crust and upper mantle content is inferred from direct sampling, whereas estimating the lower mantle concentrations requires indirect constraints, such as those brought by primitive chondrites, or by geoneutrinos. Here we follow the framework of “E-Earth” models, based on the isotopic and chemical composition of E-chondrites (EC), to calculate U and Th concentrations in the Earth’s present day mantle, and the corresponding geoneutrinos flux. The model uses a compilation of data of U and Th contents of EC and account for Earth differentiation and crust extraction. We obtain that the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) contains 15.4±1.8 ppb of Uranium and 51.3±4.4 ppb of Thorium, and has an average Th/U mass ratio of 3.4±0.4, with a peak value around 3.15. The prediction of geoneutrinos events originating from the mantle (i.e., without taking into account the local contribution of the crust) is 5.09±0.97 TNU, with 4.30±0.83 TNU coming from Uranium, and 0.79±0.14 TNU from Thorium. These numbers are in close agreement with the most recent KamLAND detector estimate, and compatible with the (higher) Borexino flux. On the other hand, the KamLAND constraints are not consistent with the high content of heat producing elements in the mantle predicted by the simple application of parameterized convection model to the thermal evolution of the Earth's mantle. Because the measurement error in the mantle neutrino flux is currently dominated by the crustal contribution, geo-neutrinos cannot for now discriminate between CI-based and EH-base models of Earth's composition. Further progress is expected if an ocean based geoneutrino detector is deployed.",

The Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling (LAIC) model created to explain the pre-earthquake phenomena in atmosphere and ionosphere demonstrated its universality and ability to explain other natural phenomena involving atmosphere-ionosphere coupling such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorm activity, dust storms, volcano eruptions etc. The model was based on experimental data and within the frame of the ISSI project “Multi-instrument space-borne observations and validation of the physical model of the Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere-Magnetosphere Coupling” is validated using the multi-instrument ground and space-born observations collected all over the world for the variety of natural phenomena. The first results of the project demonstrate that our planet environment could be regarded as an open complex system where interactions between different layers of atmosphere play important role in its thermodynamics and electrodynamics.",

            "abstract": "Designing climate change curricular materials suitable for wide adoption across institutions and academic disciplines (including those outside of the geosciences) requires collaboration among faculty at different types of institutions and consideration of a variety of student populations, learning styles, and course formats. The Interdisciplinary Teaching of Geoscience for a Sustainable Future (InTeGrate) project, an NSF STEP Center program, provides opportunities for faculty to develop 2-3 week teaching modules to engage students in understanding the intersections between geoscience topics and societal issues. From 2012-2014, a team of 3 faculty from a liberal arts college, comprehensive university, and community college developed, implemented, assessed, and revised a 2-3 week module for introductory undergraduates entitled \"Climate of change: interactions and feedbacks between water, air, and ice\". The module uses authentic atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere data from several regions to illustrate how climate impacts human societies and that the climate system has interacting components complicated by feedbacks, uncertainties, and human behavioral decisions. Students also consider past and present human adaptations to climate fluctuations. The module was piloted in introductory geology, meteorology, and oceanography courses during the 2012-2013 academic year, during which time formative and summative assessments were administered and used to modify the curricular materials. We will provide an overview of the module's content, instructional strategies involved in implementing the module, and methods of formative and summative assessment. We will also report on lessons learned during the development, piloting, revision, and publishing process, the importance of fostering partnerships between faculty from different institution types, and design approaches that promote widespread adoption of climate curricular materials.",

The SPCZ label is a binary field indicating presence or absence of the SPCZ at each horizontal grid point (½º lon by ½º lat) as a function of time and is based on output of a Bayesian spatiotemporal statistical model that takes in instantaneous data from geostationary satellites. The statistical model is specifically designed to emulate the way a human observer identifies the SPCZ.\nResults show two distinct parts to the SPCZ, the western tropical part and the eastern subtropical part. For certain time periods, the two parts do not connect. They are oriented quite differently, such that the subtropical part has a steeper meridional slope. The SPCZ is present 50-70% of the time in the tropics from Jan–Mar and is usually anchored to the warm SST distribution of the equatorial west Pacific. The subtropical part of the SPCZ does not have the same sensitivity to the underlying SST distribution and is present more often in Nov–Dec and April than in Jan-Mar when the SST is highest. Diurnal variability in cloud top height within the SPCZ also highlights the two distinct parts of the SPCZ. The tropical part has a diurnal cycle of cloudiness typical of that for the boreal summer ITCZ in the east Pacific whereas that is not the case for the subtropical part.\nInterannual variability in SPCZ location is strongly associated with ENSO, however no change in overall SPCZ area is associated with ENSO. On the intraseasonal timescale, the MJO has a strong and direct signature in SPCZ location.\nPanels in the figure below show composites of SPCZ labels, in units of fraction of time present, during each season after the seasonal cycle has been removed. Red (blue) shading indicates areas where the SPCZ is more (less) frequently present in each season compared to the mean. Bold black lines show the location of the main axis of the mean SPCZ for each season. Panel labels are color coded to indicate ENSO mode: red : El Nino, blue : La Ni–a, and black : ENSO neutral.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) production and transport play an important role in regulating organic matter (OM) distribution through a soil profile and ultimately, OM stabilization or export to aquatic systems. The contributions of varying OM inputs to the quality and amount of DOM as it passes through a soil profile remain relatively unknown. The Detrital Input and Removal Treatment (DIRT) site at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon has undergone 17 years of litter, wood and root input manipulations and allows us to guage shifts in DOM chemistry induced by long-term changes to aboveground and belowground OM additions and exclusions. Using fluorescence and UV spectroscopy to characterize fluorescent properties, extent of decomposition, and sources of DOM in streams and soil solutions collected with lysimeters and soil extractions, we have assessed the importance of fresh OM inputs to DOM chemistry.\nSoil extracts from DIRT plots had a higher fluorescence index (FI) than lysimeter solutions or stream water. A high FI in surface water is generally interpreted as indicative of a high proportion of microbially-derived DOM. However, we suspect that the high FI in soil extracts is due to a higher proportion of non-aromatic DOM from fresh soil that microorganisms consume in transit through the soil profile to lysimeters or to streams. High redox index (RI) values were observed in lysimeters from the April 2014 sampling compared with the November 2013 sampling. These RI values show evidence of more reducing conditions at the end of the rainy season in the spring compared to the onset of the rainy season in the fall. Lysimeter water collected in No Input, No Litter, and No Root treatments contained high proportions of protein, suggesting the absence of carbon inputs changes activities of the microbial community. Observed variations reflect the viability of using fluorescent properties to explore the terrestrial-aquatic interface.",

BVOC emissions are estimated to be approximately an order of magnitude higher than anthropogenic sources of volatile organic compounds. Despite the importance of BVOC emissions on air-quality and climate, considerable uncertainty remains in the parametrization emission algorithms and emission factors from different land uses and vegetation species. We will present three updates to the the BEIS model. (1) The BEIS canopy model has been updated with explicit estimates of leaf temperature coupled to the driving meteorological model’s energy balance implemented in. (2) The Biogenic Emission Landuse Database (BELD) was updated with year specific satellite derrived land use, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop survey data, and U.S. Forest Service forest Forest Inventory Analyssis (FIA) survayed tree speceis to develop a tree species specific land use data set. (3) A survey of published flux measurements were used to update the BEIS BVOC normalized emission factors. Incremental updates to the BEIS model are evaluated against surface and aircraft based field campain measurements and network observations in Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model v5.0.2 simulations.

            "abstract": "Polar cap patches are islands of high F-region plasma density within the polar cap and they are of significant practical importance because of the associated plasma instabilities and scintillations in GPS signals. An automatic algorithm has been developed to identify the polar cap patch using observations from the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar North Face (RISR-N). In addition, a statistical study of the characteristics of patches identified has been carried out, including the occurrence rate distributions by month, UT/MLT, and IMF orientation. A superposed epoch analysis of the ionospheric vertical profiles of patches has also been performed for the Feb. 1-8, 2011 radar run. Comparing with the averaged vertical profiles of all times, it is found that the patch plasma temperatures are higher above ~420 km, the vertical flow velocity are enhanced downward between ~350-550 km and upward above ~550 km. When patches observed within the 2 hours of MLT around noon are selected, i.e. closer to the location where they are generated, the patch electron temperature is lower than average between ~350-420 km and higher above ~420 km. We suggest that this is due to the combined effect of the coming-in cooler SED plume temperature and the heating process at cusp by soft particle precipitation. High-resolution GITM runs are used to model several intervals where patches are observed most comprehensively within the data.",

The eclogites (primarily dated at 30-80 Ma), omphacitites (30 Ma) and some of the (serpentinized) peridotites were derived from the subducted Farallon Plate (and possibly near-trench mantle wedge material accompanying the slab) from the flat slab by the diatremes at 30 Ma, approximately 700 km from the trench. Dehydration reactions in this assemblage (primarily prograde metamorphism of serpentinite yielding peridotite but also breakdown of guyanaite to eskolaite + water) provided water that hydrated overlying mantle materials (garnet and spinel peridotite to antigorite/chlorite serpentinite, garnet pyroxenite to chlorite-bearing eclogite, garnet and spinel pyroxenite to pargasite + chlorite). The accompanying volume expansion contributed to uplift of the Colorado Plateau, as originally suggested by Hess (1955). Phengite and possibly lawsonite remained stable and continued to carry water to greater depths. Guyanaite is stable to over 13.5 GPa and can transport water at least into the transition zone and thus may be a vehicle for hydrating ringwoodite in the transition zone (the present location of the Farallon slab). It is not known to how deep other hydrous minerals in these assemblages are stable (e.g., carmichaelite, redledgeite, tawmawite) but they, too, have potential for carrying water deep into the mantle.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimatic observations are, by nature, imperfect recorders of climate variables. Empirical approaches to their calibration are challenged by the presence of multiple sources of uncertainty, which may confound the interpretation of signals and the identifiability of the noise. In this talk, I will demonstrate the utility of proxy system models (PSMs, Evans et al, 2013, 10.1016/j.quascirev.2013.05.024) to quantify the impact of all known sources of uncertainty. PSMs explicitly encode the mechanistic knowledge of the physical, chemical, biological and geological processes from which paleoclimatic observations arise. PSMs may be divided into sensor, archive and observation components, all of which may conspire to obscure climate signals in actual paleo-observations.\nAs an example, we couple a PSM for the δ18O of speleothem calcite to an isotope-enabled climate model (Dee et al, submitted) to analyze the potential of this measurement as a proxy for precipitation amount. A simple soil/karst model (Partin et al, 2013, 10.1130/G34718.1) is used as sensor model, while a hiatus-permitting chronological model (Haslett & Parnell, 2008, 10.1111/j.1467-9876.2008.00623.x) is used as part of the observation model. This subdivision allows us to explicitly model the transformation from precipitation amount to speleothem calcite δ18O as a multi-stage process via a physical and chemical sensor model, and a stochastic archive model. By illustrating the PSM's behavior within the context of the climate simulations, we show how estimates of climate variability may be affected by each submodel's transformation of the signal. By specifying idealized climate signals(periodic vs. episodic, slow vs. fast) to the PSM, we investigate how frequency and amplitude patterns are modulated by sensor and archive submodels. To the extent that the PSM and the climate models are representative of real world processes, then the results may help us more accurately interpret existing paleodata, characterize their uncertainties, and design sampling strategies that exploit their strengths while mitigating their weaknesses.",

Version 5 includes more Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) occurrence points, uses improved heuristics for occurrence training, and recovers occurrence points that fall in water.\nA multivariate clustering procedure was used to quantitatively delineate 30 thousand environmentally homogeneous ecoregions across present and 8 potential future global locations at once, using global maps of 17 environmental characteristics describing temperature, precipitation, soils, topography and solar insolation. Occurrence of each tree species on FIA plots and in GBIF samples was used to identify a subset of suitable ecoregions from the full set of 30 thousand. This subset of suitable ecoregions was compared to the known current present range of the tree species. Predicted present ranges correspond well with existing ranges for all but a few of the 335 tree species. The subset of suitable ecoregions can then be tracked into the future to determine whether the suitable home range remains the same, moves, grows, shrinks, or disappears under each model/scenario combination.\nA quantitative niche breadth analysis allows sorting of the 17 environmental variables from the narrowest, most important, to the broadest, least restrictive environmental factors limiting each tree species. Potential tree richness maps were produced, along with a quantitative potential tree endemism map for present and future CONUS. Using a new empirical imputation method which associates sparse measurements of dependent variables with particular clustered combinations of the environmental driver variables, and then estimates values for unmeasured clusters, we interpolated FIA measurements of productivity into continuous maps showing productivity across each tree's entire present and future ranges.",

            "abstract": "Utah is one of the top producers of oil and natural gas in the country. Over the past 18 years, more than 4.2 billion gallons of wastewater from the petroleum industry has been injected into the Navajo Sandstone, Kayenta Formation, and Wingate Sandstone in two areas in Carbon and Emery County, Utah. We found that the seismicity rate increased significantly 3 to 5 years following the commencement of wastewater injection. The increased seismicity consists almost entirely of earthquakes with magnitudes of less than 3 and is localized in areas seismically active prior to the injection. We suggest that the marked increase in the seismicity rate was induced by pore pressure increase along pre-existing faults in these areas. We have used simple groundwater models to estimate the change in pore pressure, calculate the pore pressure diffusion rate, and evaluate the observed time gap between the start of injection and the onset of the increased seismicity in the areas surrounding the injection wells.",

            "abstract": "The majority of currently observed exoplanets appear exceeding close to the central star (<0.1 AU) and as such are subject to intense high energy radiation from UV & X-ray photons. We will discuss that in such environments the atmospheres these planets are heated sufficiently that they can escape the planet's gravitational field in a hydrodynamic trans-sonic wind. We will show that this hydrodynamic mass-loss occurs for the majority of exoplanets at short periods, and for low-mass planets (<50 Mearth) is vigorous enough to significantly alter the planet's evolution. In some cases we will argue that an originally gas rich exoplanet can be completely evaporated leaving behind a bare rock core. In addition, we will present new multi-dimensional simulations of evaporation that include realistic treatment of the radiative transfer. These new simulations show that evaporation from 'hot' Jupiters is likely to be magnetically controlled, where mass-loss can only occur along open filed lines, where the interaction between the stellar and planetary magnetic field strongly controls the geometry of the evaporative flow. We will indicate how these new multi-dimensional radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic calculations can be used to study the time-dependence of the outflow and link the small but growing number of observations of exoplanet evaporation to the theoretical models. Finally, we will indicate that asymmetric evaporative flows can lead to orbital evolution of planets at close separations.\nFigure Caption: \"Flow structure from an evaporating Hot Jupiter with a magnetic field strength of 0.3 Gauss.

            "abstract": "Alluvial rivers often exhibit self-similar gravel size distributions and abrupt gravel-sand transitions. Laboratory experiments suggest these sorting patterns are established rapidly, but how - and how fast - this convergence occurs in the field is unknown. Here we examine the establishment of downstream sorting patterns and channel geometry in a km-scale alluvial fan. The sharp transition from a canyon to an unconfined, channelized fan provides a well-defined boundary condition and also a strong discontinuity. The channel changes from deep and entrenched at the fan apex to shallow and depositional over a short distance, exhibiting non-equilibrium behavior. The resulting gravel fining profile is not self-similar; the particle size distribution narrows until approximate equal mobility is achieved. Further downfan, the gravel-sand transition appears to exhibit a self-similar form; field data collapse with laboratory experiments when downstream distance is normalized by the location of the transition. Results suggest a generalized sorting profile for alluvial fans as a consequence of the threshold of motion and non-equilibrium channels.",

There are many different versions of the data life cycle, but they all follow a similar basic pattern: plan, collect, ingest, asses, preserve, discover, and reuse. The process is often interpreted in a fairly linear fashion despite it being a cycle conceptually. More recently at GeoData 2014 and elsewhere, questions have been raised about the utility of the data life cycle as it is currently represented. We are proposing to the community a re-examination of the data life cycle using an agile lens. Our goal is not to deploy agile methods, but to use agile principles as a heuristic to think about how to incorporate data stewardship across the scientific process from proposal stage to research and beyond. We will present alternative conceptualizations of the data life cycle with a goal to solicit feedback and to develop a new model for conceiving and describing the overall data stewardship process. We seek to re-examine past assumptions and shed new light on the challenges and necessity of data stewardship. The ultimate goal is to support new science through enhanced data interoperability, usability, and preservation.",

            "abstract": "Current and future multi-spectral satellite sensors provide numerous means and methods for identifying hazards associated with polluting aerosols and dust. For over a decade, the NASA Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville has focused on developing new applications from near real-time data sources in support of the operational weather forecasting community. The SPoRT Center achieves these goals by matching appropriate analysis tools, modeling outputs, and other products to forecast challenges, along with appropriate training and end-user feedback to ensure a successful transition. As a spinoff of these capabilities, the SPoRT Center has recently focused on developing collaborations to address challenges with the public health community, specifically focused on the identification of hazards associated with dust and pollution aerosols. Using multispectral satellite data from the SEVIRI instrument on the Meteosat series, the SPoRT team has leveraged EUMETSAT techniques for identifying dust through false color (RGB) composites, which have been used by the National Hurricane Center and other meteorological centers to identify, monitor, and predict the movement of dust aloft. Similar products have also been developed from the MODIS and VIIRS instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua, and Suomi-NPP satellites, respectively, and transitioned for operational forecasting use by offices within NOAA’s National Weather Service. In addition, the SPoRT Center incorporates satellite-derived vegetation information and land surface modeling to create high-resolution analyses of soil moisture and other land surface conditions relevant to the lofting of wind-blown dust and identification of other, possible public-health vectors. Examples of land surface modeling and relevant predictions are shown in the context of operational decision making by forecast centers with potential future applications to public health arenas.",

            "abstract": "High altitude, long endurance unmanned aircraft provide a tremendous new capability for monitoring the atmosphere in support of weather research and forecast improvement. The NOAA Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) program is collaborating with NASA on the use of their Global Hawk (GH) aircraft for research into better understanding and forecasting high-impact weather events. NOAA has participated in multiple field campaigns either in partnership with NASA including the Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP, 2010) and the Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3, 2011-2014) experiments, or under NOAA leadership during the Winter Storms and Pacific Atmospheric Rivers (WISPAR, 2011) experiment. This past year, NOAA began a 3-year project, Sensing Hazards with Operational Unmanned Technology (SHOUT), to quantify the influence of UAS data on high-impact weather prediction and assess the operational effectiveness of UAS to help mitigate the risk of potential satellite observing gaps. The NOAA UAS system partnered with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the development of a dropsonde system for the GH which has been flown along with other remote sensing instrumentation.\nThis presentation summarizes our key results to date and describes our planned activities over the next two years. Flights during WISPAR provided measurements of water vapor transport within atmospheric rivers for evaluation of numerical weather prediction forecasts and analyses. A flight sampling the Arctic atmosphere north of Alaska included the first dropsondes released in the Arctic since the 1950’s and extensive measurements of boundary-layer variability over an ocean-ice lead feature. Assimilation of GH dropsonde data collected in the environment around tropical storms during HS3 has demonstrated significant positive forecast improvements. Data are also being employed in the validation of multiple satellite-derived products. In SHOUT, campaigns are planned targeting Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basin tropical cyclones and high-impact weather events affecting Alaska and the continental U.S. Dedicated Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) and Observing System Experiments (OSEs) are underway to evaluate instrumentation and sampling and to demonstrate the impact of the data.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity investigated sedimentary rocks that were deposited in a diversity of fluvio-lacustrine settings. The entire science payload was employed to characterize the mineralogy and chemistry of the Sheepbed mudstone at Yellowknife Bay and the Windjana sandstone at the Kimberley. Data from the CheMin instrument, a transmission X-ray diffractometer, were used to determine the quantitative mineralogy of both samples. The Sheepbed mudstone contains detrital basaltic minerals, calcium sulfates, iron oxides or hydroxides, iron sulfides, trioctahedral smectite, and amorphous material. The mineral assemblage and chemical data from APXS suggest that the trioctahedral smectite and magnetite formed authigenically as a result of alteration of olivine. The apparent lack of higher-grade phyllosilicates (e.g., illite and chlorite) and the presence of anhydrite indicate diagenesis at ~50-80 ºC. The mineralogy of the Windjana sandstone is different than the Sheepbed mudstone. Windjana contains significant abundances of K-feldspar, low- and high-Ca pyroxenes, magnetite, phyllosilicates, and amorphous material. At least two distinct phyllosilicate phases exist: a 10 Å phase and a component that is expanded with a peak at ~11.8 Å. The identity of the expanded phase is currently unknown, but could be a smectite with interlayer H2O, and the 10 Å phase could be illite or collapsed smectite. Further work is necessary to characterize the phyllosilicates, but the presence of illite could suggest that Windjana experienced burial diagenesis. Candidates for the cementing agents include fine-grained phyllosilicates, Fe-oxides, and/or amorphous material. Interpretations of CheMin data from the Windjana sandstone are ongoing at the time of writing, but we will present an estimate of the composition of the amorphous material from mass balance calculations using the APXS bulk chemistry and quantitative mineralogy from CheMin.",

            "abstract": "Huppert & Sparks (2006 Phil Trans Math Phys Eng Sci) wrote It is likely that in the future, we will experience several disasters per year that kill more than 10,000 people. The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake Disaster alone resulted in more than 20,000 casualties. Synolakis & Bernard (2006 Phil Trans Math Phys Eng Sci) concluded that Before the next Sumatra-type tsunami strikes, we must resolve to create a world that can coexist with the tsunami hazard. The 2011 Japan tsunami dramatically showed that we are not there yet.\nDespite substantial advances after the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, substantial challenges remain for improving tsunami hazard mitigation. If the tsunami community appeared at first perplexed in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, it was not due to the failure of recognized hydrodynamic paradigms, much as certain geophysical ones and scaling laws failed, but at the worst surprise, the lack of preparedness and education.\nSynolakis et al. (2008 Pure Appl Geophys) presented standards for tsunami modeling; for both warnings and inundation maps (IMs). Although at least one forecasting methodology has gone through extensive testing, and is now officially in use by the warning centers (WCs), standards need urgently to be formalized for warnings. In Europe, several WCs have been established, but none has yet to issue an operational warning for a hazardous event. If it happens, there might be confusion with possibly contradictory/competing warnings.\nNever again should there be a repeat of the TEPCO analysis for the safety of the Fukushima NPP. This was primarily due to lacks of familiarity with the context of numerical predictions and experience with real tsunami. The accident was the result of a cascade of stupid errors, almost impossible to ignore by anyone in the field (Synolakis, 26.03.2011 The New York Times). Current practices in tsunami studies for US NPPs and for IMs do not provide us with optimism that the Fukushima lessons have been absorbed and that bagatellomania is still rabid.\nWhat saves human lives is ancestral knowledge and community preparedness, as demonstrated repeatedly. Efforts need to be focused in improving education worldwide in the simple steps they can take.\nWe acknowledge the partial supports from the 7th FP (ASTARTE, Grant 603839), TUBITAK, TR (109Y387) and GSRT, GR (10TUR/1-50-1) projects.",

The orbit and instrumental measurement of the GOCE satellite mission offer the highest ever resolution capabilities for mapping Earth’s gravity field from space. GOCE was designed to determine the Earth’s mean gravity field, and it was not anticipated that it could observe temporal gravity field variations. Nevertheless, GOCE may be sensitive to temporal gravity field variations because of its dense track coverage and because its low orbit with a nominal perigee height of 255 km. We will show that GOCE is sensitive to trends in ice mass balance of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and to a certain extent also to those of the Greenland Ice Sheet and glaciers in Alaska. In addition, we show that GOCE is sensitive to the megathrust Tohoku-Oki 2011 earthquake and probably also to the Chile-Maule 2010 earthquake.

            "abstract": "Stable isotopic systems often show an unexpected range in observed fractionation factors associated with biogeochemical systems. In particular, the ranges in such isotopic systems as Cr, Ca, Li, and C have often been attributed to kinetic effects as well as different biogeochemical mechanisms. Reactive transport models developed to capture the sub-micron-scale transport and reaction processes within the macroscale system (e.g., biofilm to cm-scale) have been successful in simulating the biogeochemical processes associated with bacterial growth and the resultant changes in pore-fluid chemistry and redox conditions. Once such multicontinuum reactive transport models are extended to include equilibrium and kinetic isotopic fractionation, diffusive transport, and fluid-gas equilibria, it becomes possible to quantitatively interpret the isotopic changes observed in experimental and natural or engineered biogeochemical systems. We combine a solid-solution approach for isotopic substitution in minerals with the multiple-continuum reactive-transport approach to interpret the effective fractionation factor observed in experimental systems. Although such systems often have poorly constrained inputs (such as the equilibrium fractionation factor and many of the parameters associated with bacterial growth), by combining several independent contraints on reaction rates (such as lactate consumption, 13C/12C and 87Sr/86Sr in calcite), the range of possible interpretations can often be greatly narrowed. Here we present examples of the modeling approaches and their application to experimental systems to examine why the observed fractionation factors are often different from the theoretical values.",

            "abstract": "Large coseismic motion (up to ~ 31 m) of seafloor GPS sites during the 2011 M 9 Tohoku earthquake suggests large rupture at shallow depths of the megathrust. However, compilation of all published rupture models, constrained by the near-field seafloor geodetic observation and also various other datasets, shows large uncertainties in the slip of the most near-trench (within ~ 50 km from the trench) part of the megathrust. Repeated multi-beam bathymetry surveys that cover the trench axis, carried out by Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, for the first time recorded coseismic deformation in a megathrust earthquake at the trench. In previous studies of the differential bathymetry (DB) before and after the earthquake to determine coseismic fault slip, only the rigid-body translation component of the upper plate deformation was considered. In this work, we construct Synthetic Differential Bathymetry (SDB) using an elastic deformation model and make comparisons with the observed DB. We use a 3-D elastic Finite Element model with actual fault geometry of the Japan trench subduction zone and allowing the rupture to breach the trench. The SDB can well predict short-wavelength variations in the observed DB. Our tests using different coseismic slip models show that the internal elastic deformation of the hanging wall plays an important role in generating DB. Comparing the SDB with the observed DB suggests that the largest slip is located within ~ 50 km from the trench. The SDB proves to be the most effective tool to evaluate the performance of different rupture models in predicting near-trench slip. Our SDB work will further explore the updip slip variation. The SDB may help to constrain the slip gradient in the updip direction and may help to determine whether the large shallow slip in the Tohoku earthquake plateaued at the trench or before reaching the trench. Resolving these issues will provide some of the key tests for various competing models that were proposed to explain the large shallow rupture in this event.",

Most of these carbonates are then recycled through subsequent uplift and weathering, but some are metamorphosed or returned to the mantle via subduction. Ca isotopes in sedimentary marine carbonates can provide new insights into the global Ca (and by corollary, C) cycle by constraining the flux and isotopic composition of the recycled and subducted Ca sinks on billion-year timescales.\nPrecambrian applications of Ca isotopes have so far been limited to relatively small datasets which cover unusual, dynamic intervals of the Proterozoic. In order to address questions about long-timescale Ca cycling, Ca isotopes were measured on an extensive suite of Precambrian carbonates (n > 300) which represent environments, textures, and morphologies that are typical for their age, and whose carbon isotope values have been interpreted as reflecting precipitation from seawater. Because marine carbonates constitute the dominant geological sink for Ca, this representative sample set places specific limits on the evolution of the sedimentary and crustal Ca reservoirs and suggests further applications for Ca isotopes in Precambrian time.",

Anvil clouds spread horizontally from the MCS in the upper troposphere and TTL. Cloud-Aersol and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) profiles indicate enhanced cloudiness above 150 hPa out to 15 degrees for MCSs over the Maritime Continent and the equatorial eastern Pacific, while MCSs over land areas such as South America and South Africa have less extensive anvils.\nIce water content (IWC) from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) is maximum near the MCS center and decreases rapidly with distance, particularly in oceanic MCSs. Enhanced IWC above the climatological-mean is observed as high as 120 hPa. MLS water vapor is also enhanced near the MCS center but decreases more gradually with distance, with values above the climatological mean observed up to 120 hPa and outward beyond 15 degrees in most regions. These results suggest that MCSs are a major source of water vapor in the TTL.\nWater vapor concentrations are suppressed at 100 hPa above the MCSs, consistent with weak subsidence above cloud top.\nComposites of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) wind and vertical velocity are consistent with the satellite-based observations, indicating strong upward motion near the MCS centers and outflow from the MCSs in the TTL.",

            "abstract": "Despite great progress in the coverage of ocean observing systems, two regions remain poorly monitored, the Arctic and the deep ocean below 2000 m, which is slightly over half of the ocean’s volume. While significant trends in oceanic bottom water warming in recent decades can be discerned from repeat hydrographic surveys [Purkey and Johnson, 2010], they are too sparse to adequately quantify the deep ocean contribution to the present day sea level and ocean heat content budgets. However, deep ocean warming can be inferred from models or from complementary observations.\nSong and Colbert [2011] suggest that deep ocean warming below 700 m may have contributed 1.1 mm/yr to the global mean sea level rise (SLR), which is one-third of the rate of SLR (3.1 ± 0.6 mm/yr) observed by altimetry over 1993–2008. This estimate is considerably larger than the long-term values from earlier hydrographic studies [e.g. Levitus et al., 2005], which find a trend of 0.07 ± 0.1 mm/yr in the SLR for the depth range 700-3000 m during 1955-2003, and 0.09 ± 0.06 mm/yr below 3000 m since the 1980s. While these estimates may be biased low because of inadequate deep-ocean sampling, recent sea level budget studies also suggest that only a small rate of deep warming is necessary for closure of the budget [e.g. Leuliette and Willis, 2011; Church et al., 2011].\nUsing a decade of altimetry, GRACE, and Argo observations, we present an estimate of the sea level budget and explore the use of the residuals of the budget to infer recent trends in deep ocean warming. With this method we find that during January 2005 to December 2013, warming in the ocean below 2000 m is contained to < 0.2 ± 0.5 mm/yr. Crucial to constraining estimates of deep ocean warming are estimates of any drifts in the observations from the observing systems used. Here we introduce a new system to compare altimetry and tide gauge observations to estimate drifts.",

The hope is that the maritime guidance and associated education program will help save lives and reduce exposure of damage to boats and harbor infrastructure. Findings will be used to develop maps, guidance documents, and consistent policy recommendations for emergency managers and port authorities and provide information critical to real-time decisions required when responding to tsunami alert notifications.\nThe initial goals of the study are to (1) evaluate the effectiveness and sensitivity of existing numerical models for assessing maritime tsunami hazards, (2) find a relationship between current speeds and expected damage levels, (3) evaluate California ports and harbors in terms of tsunami induced hazards by identifying regions that are prone to higher current speeds and damage and to identify regions of relatively lower impact that may be used for evacuation of maritime assets, and (4) determine ‘safe depths’ for evacuation of vessels from ports and harbors during a tsunami event. We will present details of a new initiative to evaluate the future likelihood of failure for different structural components of a harbor, leading to the identification of high priority areas for mitigation. This presentation will focus on the results from California ports and harbors across the State, and will include feedback we have received from discussions with local harbor masters and port authorities. To help promote accurate and consistent products, the authors are also working through the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program to organize a tsunami current model benchmark workshop.",

Large-volume injection has the potential to induce earthquake activity (Zoback and Gorelick, 2012). To assess the seismic hazard posed by one such operation, the USGS has been monitoring seismic activity at a CCS demonstration site in Decatur, IL, where supercritical carbon dioxide is injected at 2.1 km depth into the Mt. Simon Sandstone, a basal brine formation over granitic basement. Injection began in November 2011 at a rate of about 1000 metric tons/day, which, pending permit approval will increase to about 3000 metric tons/day in 2015. Our seismic network, about 8 km in aperture, consists of 12 stations, three equipped with boreholes. The nine surface stations have three-component (3C) broadband seismometers and 3C force-balance accelerometers. The borehole stations have 2 Hz 3C geophones at 150 m depth and accelerometers at the surface. We derived a one-dimensional velocity model from a VSP survey and well logs and have used this model to locate seismic events. We identify phase arrivals using standard waveform inspection, spectral analysis and waveform cross-correlation. We calculated seismic moments by integrating the pulses of P- and S-wave ground displacement, a procedure that yielded moment-magnitudes MW ranging from -0.8 to 1.1. These events locate in two distinct clusters: 0.4 to 1.0 km NE and 1.8 to 2.6 km WNW from the injection well. Double-difference relocations reveal that the cluster closest to the injection well forms a lineament trending N-NE to S-SW. A preliminary strike-slip focal mechanism for an Mw 0.54 event within this cluster is consistent with the orientation of the lineament and regional horizontal principal stress orientations, suggesting reactivation of a pre-existing basement fault. Even with nearly a million tonnes of CO2 injected, no felt events have been detected so far.",

This changes the range of volatile organic compounds that are emitted and act as sources of secondary organic aerosol. A suite of intensive ground and airborne measurements were made over both tropical forest and oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysia as part of the “Oxidant and Particle Photochemical Processes above a South East Asian tropical rainforest (OP3) during 2008.

            "abstract": "Yardangs are streamlined bedforms sculpted by the wind and wind-blown sand. They can form as relatively resistant exposed rocks erode more slowly than surrounding exposed rocks, thus causing the more resistant rocks to stand higher in the landscape and deflect the wind and wind-blown sand into adjacent troughs in a positive feedback. How this feedback gives rise to streamlined forms that locally have a consistent size is not well understood theoretically. In this study we combine field measurements in the yardangs of Ocotillo Wells SVRA with analyses of airborne and terrestrial lidar datasets and numerical modeling to quantify and understand the controls on yardang morphology. The classic model for yardang morphology is that they evolve to an ideal 4:1 length-to-width aspect ratio that minimizes aerodynamic drag. We show using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling that this model is incorrect: the 4:1 aspect ratio is the value corresponding to minimum drag for free bodies, i.e. obstacles around which air flows on all sides. Yardangs, in contrast, are embedded in Earth’s surface. For such rough streamlined half-bodies, the aspect ratio corresponding to minimum drag is larger than 20:1. As an alternative to the minimum-drag model, we propose that the aspect ratio of yardangs not significantly influenced by structural controls is controlled by the angle of dispersion of the aerodynamic jet created as deflected wind and wind-blown sand exits the troughs between incipient yardang noses. Aerodynamic jets have a universal dispersion angle of 11.8 degrees, thus predicting a yardang aspect ratio of ~5:1. We developed a landscape evolution model that combines the physics of boundary layer flow with aeolian saltation and bedrock erosion to form yardangs with a range of sizes and aspect ratios similar to those observed in nature. Yardangs with aspect ratios both larger and smaller than 5:1 occur in the model since the strike and dip of the resistant rock unit also exerts a first-order control. We report on the analysis of a 1 m/pixel airborne-lidar-derived DEM of all of the yardangs in Ocotillo Wells, a map of erosion/deposition obtained from terrestrial-laser-scanning-derived DEMs obtained 1 year apart, 4D data for wind velocities and aeolian sediment fluxes around the yardangs, and the orientations and strengths of rock strata.",

            "abstract": "While on the surface, Europa and the Earth may seem very different worlds, below their respective icy crusts, the two share remarkably similar conditions, temperatures, pressures (within a factor of a few) and potentially salinity. Thus the interface between Earth's thick permanent ice shelves and ocean is an important and little explored analog for the physicochemical, and possibly microbial, characteristics of Europa. Here, processes of melt, freeze, and marine ice accretion are controlled by gradients in ice thickness, currents, and ocean temperatures. The details of this process are not well characterized, even on Earth, in particular for the impact these have on the biological potential of these ices. For Europa, such a process may not only provide a habitable niche at ice-ocean interface, but also potentially within the ice shell. In addition, any material formed at the interface may be subject to transport upward through convection or diapirism, potentially delivering ocean-derived materials to the shallow subsurface, participating in an ice \"conveyor belt\" that will affect the habitability of Europa's ice and ocean alike. In the 2012, 2014 and 2015 austral summer antarctic field seasons, NASA's SIMPLE project (Sub-Ice Marine and PLanetary-analog Ecosystems), has been tasked with characterizing these processes in the McMurdo Ice Shelf, a small ice shelf easily accessible from USAP's McMurdo Station. Using sub-ice vehicles, ice penetrating radar, and other measurements of this unexplored region, the SIMPLE team is building a comprehensive picture of processes at the ice-ocean interface and within the brine-infiltrated ice shelf in order to advance hypotheses for Europa. In addition, the technologies supported by the project are advancing NASA's capabilities to detect processes and properties within ice by ice penetrating radar, and with in situ measurements, that will support Europa Clipper and future landers. The SIMPLE team consists of members from Georgia Tech, Stone Aerospace, University of Illinois, Chicago, University of Texas, Moss Landing Marine Laboratory, and Montana State University. In this presentation, I will describe the project, and results to date, including imaging and preliminary mapping of the conditions within and below the ice shelf from the 2012 and 2014 seasons.",

            "abstract": "Six out of eight solar system planets currently possess global-scale intrinsic magnetic fields. Different symmetry and symmetry breaking with respect to the spin-axis and the equatorial plane of the host planet can be found for different planetary magnetic fields. With respect to the spin-axis, the magnetic fields of Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn are dominated by the axisymmetric part while the magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune show no such alignment. Moreover, non-axisymmetric components have not been determined unambiguously for the magnetic fields of Mercury and Saturn. With respect to the equatorial plane, the magnetic fields of Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn show small but non-negligible asymmetry while the magnetic field of Mercury shows a significant asymmetry. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune likely possess similar strength in the two hemispheres divided by the equatorial plane, but this needs to be confirmed with future measurements.\nHere we present our interpretation of the magnetic fields of Mercury and Saturn, both of which are often referred to as anomalous dipolar dynamos. For Mercury, we will show that volumetrically distributed buoyancy sources in its liquid iron core can naturally lead to equatorial symmetry breaking in the dynamo generated magnetic field as observed by MESSENGER. We will also show that the size of the solid inner core inside Mercury is likely smaller than 1000 km and could be detected indirectly with high-spatial-resolution magnetic field measurements near Mercury’s north pole. In addition, we will show that degree-2 longitudinal variations observed in the magnetic equator positions of Mercury could have an internal origin. For Saturn’s magnetic field, although its extreme axisymmetry could in principle be explained by a stably-stratified electrically-conducting layer on top of the dynamo region, more features such as equator-to-pole field contrasts cannot be explained by this same mechanism simultaneously. Towards this end, we will show the possible link between the features in Saturn’s magnetic field and dynamics in the semi-conducting region of Saturn.",

            "abstract": "The European network of tiltmeters – vertical static pendulums – was established in 2007 (Neumann and Kalenda 2010, Kalenda et al. 2012). Two pendulums were installed in the Prokop gallery in Příbram in the depth of 2 m and 96 m below the surface. Another pendulum was installed in cave No.13C in the Moravian Karst at a depth of 60 m below the surface. In 2014, the whole network consists of 12 pendulums at 9 localities in 6 countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Ukraine, Russia and Armenia). The best pendulums operate deeper than 60m below the surface under special conditions without traffic, wind, temperature changes and visitors.\nEach locality is specific – its reaction to changes of the tectonic stress depends on local tectonic conditions. The pendulums close to the NW-SE active faults are sensitive to “the Indonesian” direction. In the Ida mine we observed changes of the tilt and tilt noise (defined as a variation of the tilt in the 30-minute window) before Chile Feb 2, 2010 (M8.8), Sumatra Apr 11, 2010 (M7.8), Nicobar Isl. June 12, 2010 (M7.5), Sumatra Apr 11, 2012 (M8.4) and Iran-Pakistan border Apr 16, 2013 (M7.8) earthquakes. The pendulum in cave No.13C, which is close to the N-S active fault, is very sensitive especially to deep earthquakes from the Kuril-Kamchatka area. We observed variations of the tilt and especially peeks around noon and a high tilt noise before the earthquakes at the Kuril Islands, Nov 24, 2008 (M7.3), the Okhotsk Sea, Aug 12, 2012 (M7.7) and the Okhotsk Sea, May 24, 2013 (M8.3). The Tohoku earthquake (M9, Mar 11, 2011) was not preceded by any significant tilt anomalies on pendulums in Central Europe, although there were observed anomalies of water level and radon even a month before the mainshock (Kolínský et al. 2013, Briestenský et al. 2014).\nWith the exception of the tilt anomalies before-, co- and after the mainshock, we recognized a high tilt noise after the biggest earthquakes, which correlated well with the secondary microseisms and the deformation rate (Holub et al. 2013). Such “deformation waves” could trigger the volcanic activity on Iceland in 2010 and 2011 after the Chile and Tohoku earthquakes (Kalenda and Neumann 2012).",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial ecosystems play an important role in the climate system, regulating climate through both biogeochemical (greenhouse-gas regulation) and biophysical (regulation of water and energy) mechanisms. However, initiatives aimed at climate protection through land management account only for biogeochemical mechanisms. By ignoring biophysical processes, these initiatives risk promoting suboptimal solutions. Our recently proposed metric for the climate regulation value (CRV) of ecosystems provides one potential approach to quantifying how biogeochemical and biophysical effects combine to determine the climate services of terrestrial ecosystems. In order to provide broadly accessible estimates of CRV for ecosystems worldwide, we have created an online ecosystem climate regulation services calculator with global coverage. The CRV calculator incorporates global maps of climatically significant ecosystem properties (for example, biomass, soil carbon, and evapotranspiration) to provide location-specific CRV estimates. We use this calculator to derive values for forests globally, revealing that CRV commonly differs meaningfully from values derived based purely on carbon storage. In the face of increasing land-use pressures and the increasingly urgent need for climate change mitigation, the CRV calculator has the potential to facilitate improved quantification of ecosystem climate regulation services by scientists, conservationists, policy makers, and the private sector.",

            "abstract": "The incision of bedrock streams largely controls the topographic evolution of mountainous areas, and patterns of incision into bedrock hold information critical to unraveling past climate and tectonic uplift patterns. A popular tool in studying patterns of incision in bedrock streams is the channel steepness index, or channel gradient normalized by drainage area. The three main factors that are thought to affect channel steepness index are uplift rate, climate, and lithology. The Ouachita Mountains of central Arkansas provide a study site with currently uniform uplift (essentially zero) and climate, allowing us to explore how changes in lithology affect local channel steepness values.\nThe Ouachita Mountains are an intensely folded and faulted highland region, structurally related to the Appalachian Mountains to the east. Folding and faulting of this region occurred during the Paleozoic, and is no longer active. The trellised morphology of the stream network is controlled by past folding, as stream channels in the region generally flow along fold hinges. Bedrock in the area consists of Arkansas Novaculite, a massive chert that is highly resistant to erosion, and less resistant shale and sandstone members of the Bigfork and Mississippi Mountain Formation. Sense of bedding of geologic units is generally steep, although local folding causes high variation in bedding orientation.\nWhere bedrock channels transition from novaculite to shale, knickpoints and high channel steepness index values are observed in some streams, while others seem unaffected by this lithologic boundary. We explore 5 bedrock streams that flow over the novaculite/shale boundary to determine what lithologic factors have the largest impact on incision of bedrock channels. Analysis consists of measurements of channel morphology, detailed local geologic mapping of bedding and fold orientation, and measurements of rock strength along stream channels. Understanding how lithologic differences affect local channel steepness can yield information critical to our understanding of the evolution of bedrock streams, and the controls lithology imposes on their longitudinal form.",

            "abstract": "The Spirit rover was sent to Gusev crater because of evidence that it contained an ancient lake. Lacustrine sediments were not identified, but aqueous activity was. Spirit encountered widespread meter-scale eroded outcrops and regolith composed of opaline silica in a setting associated with small-scale explosive volcanism. This combination was interpreted as evidence for a hydrothermal system, with silica produced by either fumarolic acid-sulfate leaching of host rocks or precipitation from silica-rich hot spring or geyser waters [1]. Evidence for the latter is stronger based on stratigraphic and textural arguments [2]. Our ongoing lab and field studies of terrestrial opaline silica occurrences demonstrate that fumarolic alteration leads to greater mineral diversity and less SiO2 enrichment than observed in the Gusev case, pointing to a hot spring or geyser origin. Terrestrial hot springs support microbial communities and can preserve that evidence over geologic timescales [3], making outcrops of opaline silica ideal targets in a search for biosignatures with instruments on the Mars 2020 rover.\nSpirit also discovered outcrops with 16-34 wt% Mg-Fe carbonate. Dubbed Comanche, the carbonate was thought to result from dissolution by hydrothermal fluids of pre-existing carbonates elsewhere in Gusev followed by transport and re-precipitation [4]. A reanalysis found evidence that the alteration is consistent with evaporative precipitation of low-temperature, near-surface solutions derived from limited water-rock interaction in rocks equivalent to nearby “Algonquin” outcrops [5]. Water-limited leaching of formerly widespread Algonquin-like tephra deposits by ephemeral waters, followed by transport and evaporative precipitation of the fluids into the Comanche outcrops, can explain their chemical, mineralogical, and textural characteristics. The habitability potential of this setting is unclear, but detrital materials carried by floodwaters and preserved in carbonate cements may be of astrobiological interest.\n[1] Squyres, S. W., et al.

More than 15 years of substantive science concerning hydrology, hydraulics, sediment transport, geomorphology, aquatic and fish ecology, riparian ecology, and socio-economics has yielded significant insights that guide experimental river management initiatives, such as a new protocol to annually release sediment-triggered controlled floods; administratively called the High Flow Experimental Protocol (HFEP). Implementation of the HFEP requires nearly real-time monitoring of sediment delivery from key sand producing tributaries, transport in and calculation of sand mass balance in segments of the Colorado River, and defined uncertainty of those processes and conditions (see: http://www.gcmrc.gov/). The HFEP aims to rebuild sandbars within the active channel, but many stakeholders remain focused on other aquatic ecosystem, riparian ecosystem, archaeological resources, or cultural values that are linked in complex ways to active channel conditions. Tension exists within the GCDAMP about how funding is allocated for innovative data collection, analysis, and publication strategies that allow implementation of the HFEP, and to also measure derivative resource conditions about which some stakeholders have concern. Monitoring and research initiatives that attempt to incorporate traditional cultural values also have high uncertainty when resource condition is linked with the simple implementation paradigm of the HFEP. Thus, the GCDAMP is faced with the complex challenge of allocating sufficient resources to monitor active channel processes and characteristics, resolve remaining scientific uncertainties, and develop new strategies for incorporating science insights into engineering and policy decisions, while also monitoring terrestrial resources supported by stakeholders but only indirectly linked with dam operations. The challenge of balancing these scientific and adaptive management objectives is substantial.",

In each case, the GPS antenna has been placed on a pole that is set in the firn layer above the ice. Traditionally these kinds of GPS installations are used as base stations or to estimate the local horizontal speed and direction of the ice sheet. However, these data are also sensitive to the vertical displacement of the pole as it moves through the firn layer. A new method developed to measure snow depth variations with reflected GPS signals is applied to these GPS data from Greenland. This method provides a constraint on the vertical distance between the GPS antenna and the surface snow layer. The vertical positions and snow surface heights are then used to assess output from surface accumulation and firn densification models, showing agreement better than 10% at the sites with the longest records. Comparisons between the GPS reflection method and in situ snow sensors at the Dye 2 site show excellent agreement, capturing the dramatic changes observed in Greenland during the 2012 summer melt season. The GPS vertical measurements and snow surface layer estimates can help validate surface elevation results obtained using satellite altimetry.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in reanalysis methods yield new tools for climatological application. Here we use applications in Germany to discuss methodological issues at regional scale. Especially in the field of renewable energy planning and production there is a need for climatological information across all spatial scales, i.e., from climatology at a certain site to the spatial scale of national renewable energy production. Also, there is the need for the temporal resolution between the scales of a few minutes up to decadal changes.\nWe explore the spatio-temporal scales where reanalyses can be used with benefit together with the traditional approaches which are based on station measurements only. Reanalyses can provide valuable additional information on larger scale variability, e.g. multi-annual variation over Germany. However, the change in the observing system, model errors and biases have to be carefully considered. On the other hand, the ground-based observation networks suffer from change of the station distribution, changes in instrumentation, measurements procedures and quality control as well as local changes which might modify their spatial representativity. All these effects might often been unknown or hard to characterize, although plenty of the meta-data information has been recorded for the German stations.\nEuropean research activities on global and regional reanalysis are supported by the Framework Program 7 (FP7) of the European Commission as a preparation activity for the European COPERNICUS climate change service.\nHere we start from the user requirements for reanalyses as they were collected in the FP7 project CORE-CLIMAX. Second, we give an overview over the methods to determine whether a specific reanalysis is fit for a certain purpose (discussed in FP7 projects CORE-CLIMAX and UERRA) . Thirdly, we compare for an example application the feedback statistics from global (ERA-Interim) and regional (HErZ – COSMO) reanalyses and show which conclusion can be drawn. Finally, the wind climatologies derived from the different reanalyses (ERA-Interim, ERA-20C, HErZ-COSMO) are compared with point measurements and gridded field climatologies derived from ground-based stations, illustrating the added value of the reanalysis fields.",

            "abstract": "A regional nuclear war between India and Pakistan, using 100 15-kt atomic bombs, could inject 5 Tg of soot into the upper troposphere from fires started in urban and industrial areas. Simulations by three different general circulation models, GISS ModelE, WACCM, and SOCOL, all agree that global surface temperature would decrease by 1 to 2°C for 5 to 10 years, and have major impacts on precipitation and solar radiation reaching Earth’s surface. Local summer climate changes over land would be larger. Using the DSSAT crop simulation model forced by these three global climate model simulations, we investigate the impacts on agricultural production in China, the largest grain producer in the world. In the first year after the regional nuclear war, a cooler, drier, and darker environment would reduce annual rice production by 23 Mt (24%), maize production by 41 Mt (23%), and wheat production by 23 Mt (50%). This reduction of food availability would continue, with gradually decreasing amplitude, for more than a decade. Results from simulations in other major grain producing regions produce similar results. Thus a nuclear war using much less than 1% of the current global arsenal could produce a global food crisis and put a billion people at risk of famine.",

Success in your career depends not only upon the rigor of your research, but also hinges on your ability to communicate with your peers and with the public.\nAccording to many somewhat dubious internet polls, public speaking is the number one human fear. And yet public speaking is defined as speaking to more than four people at any given time. Hence, you are a public speaker more than you may realize. Given this seemingly natural fear, it is not surprising that delivering a presentation at large, or even small, science gatherings can be frightening, overwhelming, and intimidating, but it can also be extremely gratifying. On very few occasions do we, as scientists and engineers, reach out to dozens or hundreds of our colleagues in a single event. Make the most of your moment on stage, wherever that stage may be.\nIf you would like to improve your public speaking skills, please join me for a session on making your presentation interesting and effective, while also reducing your stress and actually enjoying the experience. Participants will leave the workshop with a greater skill set to develop and deliver presentations. The workshop is interactive and builds on the collective experience of the audience and the instructor.\n“The problem with most bad presentations I see is not the speaking, the slides, the visuals, or any of the other things people obsess about. Instead, it’s the lack of thinking.”  Scott Berkun, 2010",

The observed distributions of snow frequency show that snow-rain transition zones are mainly zonally distributed since they are determined by temperature, with a slight shift to the south over the Appalachian Mountain region. The snow-rain transition zone is located around 40ºN for winter months (DJF), 43ºN for March, and 45ºN for November. These observed patterns can be reproduced by the historical multi-GCM ensemble average. The future projection shows that the snow-rain transition zone will shift to the north under the background of warming at magnitudes of 2-6ºC over this region, indicating that large areas will have reduced snow occurrence in the future. The northward shifts are about 2º latitude under the RCP4.5 scenario and 4º latitude under the RCP8.5 scenario. The percentage area losing snow occurrence is also assessed.",

            "abstract": "The University of Kansas Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets developed two Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) to support polar research. We developed a mid-range UAS, called the Meridian, for operating a radar depth sounder/imager at 195 MHz with an eight-element antenna array. The Meridian weighs 1,100 lbs, has a 26-foot wingspan, and a range of 950 nm at its full payload capacity of 120 lbs. Ice-penetrating radar performance drove the configuration design, though additional payloads and sensors were considered to ensure adaptation to multi-mission science payloads. We also developed a short range UAS called the G1X for operating a low-frequency radar sounder that operates at 14 and 35 MHz. The G1X weighs 85 lbs, has a 17-foot wingspan, and a range of about 60 nm per gallon of fuel. The dual-frequency HF/VHF radar depth sounder transmits at 100 W peak power at a pulse repetition frequency of 10 KHz and weighs approximately 4.5 lbs. We conducted flight tests of the G1X integrated with the radar at the Sub-glacial Lake Whillans ice stream and the WISSARD drill site. The tests included pilot-controlled and fully autonomous flights to collect data over closely-spaced lines to synthesize a 2-D aperture. We obtained clear bed echoes with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of more than 50 dB at this location. These are the first-ever successful soundings of glacial ice with a UAS-based radar. Although ice attenuation losses in this location are low in comparison to more challenging targets, in-field performance improvements to the UAS and HF/VHF radar system enabled significant gains in the signal-to-noise ratio, such that the system can now be demonstrated on more challenging outlet glaciers. We are upgrading the G1X UAS and radar system for further tests and data collection in Greenland. We are reducing the weight and volume of the radar, which, when coupled with further reductions in airframe and avionics weight and a larger fuel bladder, will offer extended range. Finally, we are increasing the radar transmit peak power to about 250-500 W using high-efficiency power amplifiers and hardening the aircraft actuators for potential electromagnetic interference. The main focus of the Spring 2015 deployment is to collect fine-resolution data near the outlet and grounding lines of Kangiata Nunaata Sermia (KNS) glacier in Greenland.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles are formed in the atmosphere via gas-to-particle conversion of low and semi volatile organic compounds. They are abundant in the atmosphere and can directly contribute to climate change by scattering solar radiation or indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei. There is also a health concern associated with SOA particles because they can make up a large fraction of suspended submicron particulate mass. In addition, a reduction in visibility in both polluted and rural areas can be due to SOA particles. Knowledge of diffusion coefficients of organic species within SOA particles is needed to predict the atmospheric behaviour and environmental impacts of these particles. Here we introduce a new method to determine diffusion coefficients of organic probes in particles made up of organic species as a function of relative humidity (RH). Our method involves using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to measure the diffusion coefficients of organic fluorescent dyes in organic particles with dimensions of approximately 25 µm. We validated this method by measuring diffusion coefficients of organic dyes of varied size in sucrose-water solutions as a function of RH and comparing these results with data from the literature. In the future this method will be applied to SOA particles.",

            "abstract": "Radio wave’s differential phase delay variation through the troposphere is the largest error sources in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements, and water vapor variability in the troposphere is known to be the dominant factor. We use the precipitable water vapor (PWV) products from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors mounted on Terra and Aqua satellites to produce tropospheric noise maps of InSAR. We estimate the slope and y-intercept of power spectral density curve of MODIS PWV and calculate the structure function to estimate the expected tropospheric noise level as a function of distance. The results serve two purposes: 1) to provide guidance on the expected covariance matrix for geophysical modeling, 2) to provide quantitative basis for the science Level-1 requirements of the planned NASA-ISRO L-band SAR mission (NISAR mission). We populate lookup tables of such power spectrum parameters derived from each 1-by-1 degree tile of global coverage. The MODIS data were retrieved from OSCAR (Online Services for Correcting Atmosphere in Radar) server. Users will be able to use the lookup tables and calculate expected tropospheric noise level of any date of MODIS data at any distance scale. Such calculation results can be used for constructing covariance matrix for geophysical modeling, or building statistics to support InSAR missions’ requirements. For example, about 74% of the world had InSAR tropospheric noise level (along a radar line-of-sight for an incidence angle of 40 degrees) of 2 cm or less at 50 km distance scale during the time period of 2010/01/01 – 2010/01/09.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric dust records in ice cores and marine sediment provide important information regarding global climate, tectonics, and ocean-atmospheric interactions over many different timescales. In particular, marine records from the northwest Pacific are of critical importance to our understanding of the development of the Asian Monsoon, the onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation, and other important climatic features. Changes in dust sources have been documented over short timescales related to monsoonal dynamics; however, studies over much longer timescales commonly consider canonical “Chinese Loess” as the sole source of Asian dust. Here we present a new marine record from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1149 that indicates the clear presence of at least two different sources of Asian dust over the past 60 Ma.\nUsing a multi-elemental geochemical and statistical approach we have resolved two disparate eolian dust inputs to Site 1149, in addition to two different ash sources. The first dust source appears to be Chinese Loess (CL); whereas, the second dust source is compositionally distinct from CL and is similar in composition to general Upper Continental Crust. These two sources show contrasting accumulation patterns through the Cenozoic. Our results confirm previous studies that show the CL source increasing in importance over the past 8 Ma. Further, our data show that the second eolian input from Asia decreases in importance from 60 Ma to ~22 Ma. This second dust source shows variability throughout the Cenozoic that can be related to major climatic events and terrestrial climate records from China, yet ceases to be important younger than ~22 Ma. The time period from ~25-20 Ma, therefore, appears to represent a fundamental transition in the hydrologic behavior of the Asian interior. That there are two important dust sources through the Cenozoic, rather than just the single “Chinese Loess”, offers new opportunities for inferring the climate and tectonic evolution of Asia and the northern hemisphere.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of surface elevation change must be properly partitioned between thickness changes from firn versus ice processes to determine the actual mass change because of the density difference between firn and ice. While ice dynamics controls changes in the ice column, fluctuations in both the snow accumulation and firn compaction rates result in variations in the firn column thickness. Several recent studies using both ground-based and airborne radar have greatly improved our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations in the accumulation rate. On the other hand, because of the difficulty in measuring firn compaction rates, the number of measurements remains quite low and the coverage is very sparse.\nHere, we present measurements of the firn compaction rate using the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets snow radar data from NASA’s Operation IceBridge repeat-track surveys. To measure firn compaction rates from the aerial survey we first measure the depths to various horizons in the firn column. In the subsequent survey, we measure the depths to the same firn horizons but must remove the additional thickness from accumulated snow. To account for the additional accumulation, we measure the thickness to the buried horizon that represents the surface from the first survey. The change in thickness between the initial surface and the radar horizons provides total compaction and when divided by the time interval between surveys, provides the compaction rate.\nSpecifically, we measure the spatiotemporal variations in the firn compaction rate in the Thwaites Glacier catchment area between 2009 and 2011. In addition, we present newly derived compaction rates from the dry-snow zone of Greenland. We also discuss the limitations of the method resulting from (1) the vertical resolution of the radar system, (2) colocation errors, (3) the dependence of radar wave speed on firn density, which varies in both space and time, and (4) measuring to a horizon of constant age rather than depth.",

Beginning in late January, 2002 and continuing to the present day, SABER has been measuring limb radiance profiles used to retrieve vertical profiles of temperature, volume mixing ratios (VMRs) of O3, CO2, H2O, [O], and [H], and volume emission rates of NO, OH(2.1µm), OH(1.6µm) and O2(singlet delta). The measurements extend from the tropopause to the lower thermosphere, and span from 54S to 84N or 54N to 84S daily with alternating latitude coverage every ~ 60 days. Currently more than six million profiles of each parameter have been retrieved. The CO2 VMR is a new SABER data product that just became available this year. The temperature and CO2 VMRs are simultaneously retrieved in the ~65 km to 110 km range using limb radiances measured at 4.3 and 15 micrometers. Results will be presented of CO2 validation studies done using comparisons with coincident ACE-FTS CO2 data and SD-WACCM model simulations. The CO2 VMRs agree with ACE-FTS observations to within reported measurement uncertainties and they are in good agreement with SD-WACCM seasonal and global distributions. The SABER observed CO2 VMR departure from uniform mixing tends to start above ~80 km which is generally higher than what the model calculates. Variations of CO2 VMR with latitude and season are substantial. Seasonal zonal mean cross sections and CO2 time series for selected latitudes and altitudes over the 12.5-year time period, will also be shown. The CO2 VMR increase rate at 100 km is in close agreement with in situ results measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory.",

Applications of MOPITT products include (1) analyzing CO regional and global trends, (2) chemical weather forecasting, (3) evaluating chemical transport models, (4) validating CO products for other satellite instruments, (5) supporting field campaigns, (6) constraining concentrations of chemically-related species and (7) determining CO sources (i.e., surface fluxes) through inverse modeling. This presentation will describe the ongoing process of MOPITT retrieval algorithm development and highlight recent scientific advances enabled by MOPITT products.",

            "abstract": "Subsequent to the release of the 2007 Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Province of British Columbia in Canada became an international leader in the development and implementation of innovative climate change mitigation policies. These include, but are not limited to, the 2008 Greenhouse Gas Reductions Target Act, the 2008 Carbon Tax Act and the 2010 Clean Energy Act. British Columbia’s Cleantech sector quickly responded to, and thrived as a result of, the signal sent by government to the market. But with a change in Premier in 2011 came a change in priorities. A number of the previous initiatives have either been weakened or no longer followed through with as the Province sets its vision of being a major exporter of Liquified Natural Gas.\nAs a member of the British Columbia Climate Action Team set up by Premier Gordon Campbell in 2007 to provide advice to government on a variety of policy-related matters, I was fortunate to be able to watch first hand as the Province aggressively moved towards reducing its Greenhouse gas emissions. Rather than stand on the sidelines as the government lost its direction on the climate file I chose to run with the BC Green Party in the 2013 provincial election. I was subsequently elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly representing the constituents of Oak Bay Gordon Head.\nWhile science can and should inform policy deliberations, in and of itself, science cannot and should not prescribe policy outcomes. Whether or not we deal with today’s challenge of climate change boils down to a question of intergeneration equity. Does the present generation owe anything to future generations in terms of the quality of the environment that they inherit? Many of today’s elected decision-makers are focused on short-term decision-making. Yet those who will be affected by the consequences of these decisions are not part of the decision making process — hence the political conundrum.\nIn this presentation I detail some of the political opportunities and challenges associated with efforts to ensure political decision-makers consider the long term consequences of their climate and energy policy while balancing a myriad other immediately-pressing issues.",

            "abstract": "Fungi comprise a significant portion of total soil biomass, the turnover of which must represent a dominant flux within the soil carbon cycle. Fungal OC can turn over on time scales of days to months, but this process is poorly understood. Here, we examined temporal changes in the chemical and microbial community composition of fungal necromass during a 2 month decomposition experiment in which Fusarium avenaceum (a common saprophyte) was exposed to a natural soil microbial community. Over the course of the experiment, residual fungal necromass was harvested and analyzed using FTIR and thermochemolysis-GCMS to examine chemical changes in the tissue. Additionally, genomic DNA was extracted from tissues, amplified with barcoded ITS primers, and sequenced using the high-throughput Illumina platform to examine changes in microbial community composition. Up to 80% of the fungal necromass turned over in the first week. This rapid degradation phase corresponded to colonization of the necromass by known chitinolytic soil fungi including Mortierella species. Zygomycetes and Ascomycetes were among the dominant fungal species involved in degradation with very small contributions from Basidiomycetes. At the end of the 2 month degradation, only 15% of the original necromass remained. The residual material was rich in amide and C-O moieties which is consistent with previous work predicting that peptidoglycans are the main residual product from microbial tissue degradation. Straight-chain fatty acids exhibit varying degradation profiles, with some fatty acids (e.g. C16 and C18:1) degrading more rapidly than bulk tissue, others maintaining steady concentrations relative to bulk OC (e.g. C18), and some increasing in concentration throughout the degradation (e.g. C24). These results indicate that the turnover of fungal necromass has the potential to significantly influence a variety of soil OC properties, including C/N ratios, lipid biomarker distributions, and OC turnover times.",

            "abstract": "The suggestion of injecting sulfur into the stratosphere to cool the climate is motivated by the response of the climate system to large volcanic eruptions. But can we expect that the effects observed after eruptions accurately describe the effects of sulfate climate engineering? Here we discuss the response of stratospheric dynamics to both types of forcing as simulated in state-of-the-art climate models.\nThe cooling observed after volcanic eruptions is not homogeneous in space and time. An anomalous warming has been observed after several big tropical eruptions during boreal winter in northern Europe and Asia. In general, this warming is attributed to a strengthening of the stratospheric polar night jet, related to the stratospheric effects of volcanic aerosol, and a subsequent downward propagation of this dynamical signal. Here we use the Geoengineering Intercomparison Model Project (GeoMIP) G3 and G4 simulations where sulfur is injected to reduce warming during the 21st century to study the potential response of stratospheric dynamics to this type of climate engineering and compare it with the response to volcanic eruptions simulated by the same models in the CMIP5 historical simulations. Unfortunately, in general the CMIP5 models do not reproduce the strengthening of the polar night jet well. Potential reasons for this will be discussed. Furthermore we show that due to the different time scales involved in volcanic eruptions in comparison to assumed climate engineering the dynamical responses may differ.",

            "abstract": "Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) is a NASA airborne field campaign aimed at better understanding the physical processes that control hurricane intensity change. HS3 will help answer questions related to the roles of environmental conditions and internal storm structures to storm intensification. Due to the nature of the questions that HS3 mission is addressing, it involves a variety of in-situ, satellite observations, airborne data, meteorological analyses, and simulation data. This variety of datasets presents numerous data management challenges for HS3. The methods used for airborne data management differ greatly from the methods used for space-borne data. In particular, metadata extraction, spatial and temporal indexing, and the large number of instruments and subsequent variables are a few of the data management challenges unique to airborne missions. A robust data system is required to successfully help HS3 scientist achieve their mission goals. Furthermore, the data system also needs to provide for data management that assists in broader use of HS3 data to enable future research activities. The Global Hydrology Resource Center (GHRC) is considering all these needs and designing a data system for HS3. Experience with past airborne field campaign puts GHRC in a good position to address HS3 needs. However, the scale of this mission along with science requirements separates HS3 from previous field campaigns. The HS3 data system will include automated services for geo-location, metadata extraction, discovery, and distribution for all HS3 data. To answer the science questions, the data system will include a visual data exploration tool that is fully integrated into the data catalog. The tool will allow visually augmenting airborne data with analyses and simulations. Satellite data will provide contextual information during such data explorations. All HS3 tools will be supported by an enterprise service architecture that will allow scaling, easy integration of new tools and existing services, and integration of new ESDIS metadata and security guidelines.",

            "abstract": "Rangitoto is a small basaltic shield volcano representing the most recent and most voluminous episode of volcanism in the Auckland Volcanic Field, New Zealand. Auckland City is built on the field, and hence, Rangitoto’s importance in hazard-risk modelling. The symmetrical edifice, ~6 km wide and 260 m high, has volume of 1.78 km3. It comprises summit scoria cones and a lava field. However, the lack of deep erosion dissection has prevented the development of an eruptive stratigraphy. Previous studies suggested construction in a relatively short interval at 550–500 yrs BP. However, microscopic tephra have been interpreted as evidence of intermittent activity from 1498 +/- 140 to 504 +/- 6 yrs BP, a longevity of 1000 years. A 150-m-deep hole was drilled through the edifice in February 2014 to obtain a continuous core record. The result is an unparalleled stratigraphy of the evolution of a small shield volcano. The upper 128 m of core comprises at least 27 lava flows with thicknesses in the range 0.3-15 m, representing the main shield-building phase. Underlying marine sediments are interbedded with 8 m of pyroclastic lapilli, and a thin lava flow, representing the explosive phreatomagmatic birth of the volcano. Preliminary geochemical analyses reveal suite of relatively uniform transitional basalts (MgO = 8.1 to 9.7 wt %). However, 4 compositional groups are distinguished that were erupted in sequential order. High-MgO magmas were erupted first, followed by a two more heterogeneous groups displaying differentiation trends with time. Finally, distinct low-MgO basalts were erupted. Each magma type appears to represent a new magma batch. The core places the magma types in a time series, which can be correlated to the surface lava field. Hence, allowing a geometrical reconstruction of the shield growth. Additional petrologic investigations are providing insight to magmatic ascent processes, while radiocarbon and paleomagnetic secular variation studies will reveal the duration of activity.",

            "abstract": "Launched aboard NASA’s Terra satellite in December 1999, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument has opened new vistas in remote sensing of our home planet. Its 9 pushbroom cameras provide as many view angles ranging from 70 degrees forward to 70 degrees backward along Terra’s flight track, in four visible and near-infrared spectral bands. MISR’s well-calibrated, accurately co-registered, and moderately high spatial resolution radiance images have been coupled with novel data processing algorithms to mine the information content of angular reflectance anisotropy and multi-camera stereophotogrammetry, enabling new perspectives on the 3-D structure and dynamics of Earth’s atmosphere and surface in support of climate and environmental research. Beginning with “first light” in February 2000, the nearly 15-year (and counting) MISR observational record provides an unprecedented data set with applications to multiple disciplines, documenting regional, global, short-term, and long-term changes in aerosol optical depths, aerosol type, near-surface particulate pollution, spectral top-of-atmosphere and surface albedos, aerosol plume-top and cloud-top heights, height-resolved cloud fractions, atmospheric motion vectors, and the structure of vegetated and ice-covered terrains. Recent computational advances include aerosol retrievals at finer spatial resolution than previously possible, and production of near-real time tropospheric winds with a latency of less than 3 hours, making possible for the first time the assimilation of MISR data into weather forecast models. In addition, recent algorithmic and technological developments provide the means of using and acquiring multi-angular data in new ways, such as the application of optical tomography to map 3-D atmospheric structure; building smaller multi-angle instruments in the future; and extending the multi-angular imaging methodology to the ultraviolet, shortwave infrared, and polarimetric realms. Such advances promise further enhancements to the observational power of the remote sensing approaches that MISR has pioneered.",

            "abstract": "A groundwater flow cycling process between a submarine spring and an inland fresh water spring has been simulated using the latest research version of MODFLOW-CFP (Conduit Flow Process). Spring Creek Springs and Wakulla Spring, which are located in a marine estuary and 18 km inland, respectively, are two major groundwater discharge spots of Woodville Karst Plain (WKP), North Florida, USA. The two springs are found to be connected with karst conduits networks. Rising sea level may put seawater into the Spring Creek Springs and block groundwater discharge, which, in turn, increases freshwater discharge at Wakulla Spring. Three repeating phases in a karst spring flow cycle were proposed from low rainfall period to heavy rainfall period, and back to low rainfall period. During low rainfall periods, seawater flowed back into the conduits at Spring Creek Spring and freshwater was diverted to Wakulla Spring. After heavy rainfall, seawater was pushed back from Spring Creek Spring conduits. \nA MODFLOW model for WKP was modified to numerically study the groundwater flow cycling and seawater intrusion for three years. Conduit network distribution, high speed groundwater flow and exchange between conduits and matrix domain were simulated through the MODFLOW-CFP model. Rainfall, springs and creeks discharge data were used to calibrate the model. Simulation results catch very well with measurements, and numerically presented the three-phase groundwater cycling. In additional, simulation results were also supported by temperature data measured in conduits, which reflect precipitation recharge to groundwater, and indicate conduit flow direction.\nKey Words: Karst, Seawater Instrusion, MODFLOW-CFP, Groundwater Cycling",

The analysis of these data, together with the development of sophisticated inversion techniques to infer properties of the magnetic field, have largely improved our understanding of many aspects of solar physics which include the nature and properties of small scale magnetic elements, the fine structuring of sunspots, the properties of granulation and its interaction with the magnetic field, the propagation of waves from the photosphere to the chromosphere, the highly dynamics and fine structuring of the chromosphere. Still several issues, like the origin and nature of the photospheric magnetism, especially in the quiet Sun, the properties of the chromospheric magnetic field, the chromospheric energy budget, and the properties of the photospheric and chromospheric plasma and magnetic field during eruptive events, remain open. Moreover, state-of-the-art magneto hydrodynamic simulations produce structures down to the spatial resolution of the simulations themselves (generally, few kilometers per pixel), which are unresolved in current observations. The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), with its four meter aperture and state-of-the-art adaptive optics, will allow the acquisition of hundredths of arcsecond spatial resolution data. In this contribution I review the main open questions that the analysis of DKIST observations will allow to address.",

            "abstract": "Aftershock sequences, which follow large earthquakes, last hundreds of days and are characterized by well defined frequency-magnitude and spatio-temporal distributions. The largest aftershocks in a sequence constitute significant hazard and can inflict additional damage to infrastructure. Therefore, the estimation of the magnitude of possible largest aftershocks in a sequence is of high importance. In this work, we propose a statistical model based on Bayesian analysis and extreme value statistics to describe the distribution of magnitudes of the largest aftershocks in a sequence. We derive an analytical expression for a Bayesian predictive distribution function for the magnitude of the largest expected aftershock and compute the corresponding confidence intervals. We assume that the occurrence of aftershocks can be modeled, to a good approximation, by a non-homogeneous Poisson process with a temporal event rate given by the modified Omori law. We also assume that the frequency-magnitude statistics of aftershocks can be approximated by Gutenberg-Richter scaling. We apply our analysis to 19 prominent aftershock sequences, which occurred in the last 30 years, in order to compute the Bayesian predictive distributions and the corresponding confidence intervals. In the analysis, we use the information of the early aftershocks in the sequences (in the first 1, 10, and 30 days after the main shock) to estimate retrospectively the confidence intervals for the magnitude of the expected largest aftershocks. We demonstrate by analysing 19 past sequences that in many cases we are able to constrain the magnitudes of the largest aftershocks. For example, this includes the analysis of the Darfield (Christchurch) aftershock sequence. The proposed analysis can be used for the earthquake hazard assessment and forecasting associated with the occurrence of large aftershocks. The improvement in instrumental data associated with early aftershocks can greatly enhance the analysis and facilitate better forecasting and hazard mitigation. Aftershocks occur in other relaxation phenomena, for example, in fracture experiments on porous materials and acoustic emissions, in solar flares, after stock market crashes to mention a few, therefore, the results of this study can also be applicable to those problems.",

            "abstract": "Correct simulation of carbon dynamics in Earth System Models is required to accurately predict both short and long-term land carbon-cycle climate and concentration feedbacks. As new model structures and parameterizations of increasing complexity are introduced there is an ever present need for data to inform these developments, either indirectly through benchmarking activities, or directly through model-data fusion techniques.\nHere we briefly describe a very rich source of data that will come from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a continental-scale facility that will collect freely available biogeochemical and biophysical data from 60 sites representative of a full range of ecosystems across the USA over 30 years. Relevant data at each site include a full suite of micrometeorology measurements, profiles of CO2 and H2O vapor isotopes, soil temperature, moisture and CO2 flux, fine root images, and plot-based NPP, leaf area and litterfall estimates. This is accompanied by Lidar and hyperspectral derived biomass, leaf area and canopy chemistry at < 1m resolution of 100s km2. Critically, these observations are well calibrated and highly standardized across sites allowing comparisons, whilst plot and site selection has been designed to optimize representativeness and spatial scaling opportunities.\nTo illustrate the potential utility of these data in constraining models, we show the range of Community Land Model (CLM) output at NEON site locations, and in model-space look at a number of different functional responses that characterize the model in space and time and could be tested with data.\nThese observations can be used most directly through a data assimilation (DA) system and we demonstrate how we have developed support for CLM within the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) that uses ensemble techniques for state estimation. Using an observing system experiment, we investigate how infrequent observations of carbon stocks constrain model dynamics and how these observations types can be used with more frequently available flux and leaf area index observations. We demonstrate the use of the latter with real Ameriflux and MODIS data.",

            "abstract": "Physical models for landslide forecasting rely on the combination of hydrologic models for water infiltration and stability criteria based on infinite slope mechanics. Such concepts can be used to derive safety factors for shallow landsliding, in which the mobilization of the soil cover is associated with the attainment of critical values of pore water pressures expressed as a function of the frictional strength. While such models capture the role of important geomorphic features and geotechnical properties, their performance depends on the validity of the postulate of frictional failure. As a result, the safety factors do not to consider a broader range of solid-fluid interactions promoting different slope failure mechanisms, such as flow slides. This work combines principles of soil stability, unsaturated soil mechanics and plasticity theory to derive an alternative set of safety factors. While frictional slips are included in the study as a particular case, the proposed analytical methodology can also be applied to cases in which an increase in degree of saturation promotes liquefaction instabilities, i.e. possible transitions from solid- to fluid-like response. The study shows that the incorporation of principles of unsaturated soil mechanics into slope stability analyses generates suction-dependent coefficients that alter the value of the safety factors. As a result, while the proposed approach can still be combined with standard hydrologic models simulating the evolution of pore pressures in the near-surface, it can also provide a spatially distributed assessment of evolving safety conditions in landscapes susceptible to landslides of the flow type.",

            "abstract": "The calculation of grid-scale fluxes becomes a real problem whenever the dependent variable, e.g. evapotranspiration, is non-linearly dependent on a spatially-varying dependent variable, eg, soil moisture. A dynamic binning technique was previously developed that captured the spatial variablity of soil moisture using a small number of \"bins\" which are used to support a single grid-averaged calculation of evapotranspiration. This grid-averaged flux is then deconvolved to update the bin contents and thereby realistically model the resulting changes in the soil moisture distribution. This idea was previously demonstrated in a simple \"toy\" soil moisture-evaporation model ( Sellers et al , 2007). The approach has recently been implemented in a 1-d version of the Simple Biosphere (SiB-3) model and its performance is being evaluated. The approach is expected to provide more realistic grid-averaged calculations of enrgy, water and carbon fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Conditions that lead to extreme water levels and coastal flooding are examined for atolls in the Republic of the Marshall Islands based on a recent field study of wave transformations over fringing reefs, tide gauge observations, and wave model hindcasts. Wave-driven water level extremes pose the largest threat to atoll shorelines, with coastal levels scaling as approximately one-third of the incident breaking wave height. The wave-driven coastal water level is partitioned into a mean setup, low frequency oscillations associated with cross-reef quasi-standing modes, and wind waves that reach the shore after undergoing high dissipation due to breaking and bottom friction. All three components depend on the water level over the reef; however, the sum of the components is independent of water level due to cancelling effects. Wave hindcasts suggest that wave-driven water level extremes capable of coastal flooding are infrequent events that require a peak wave event to coincide with mid- to high-tide conditions. Interannual and decadal variations in sea level do not change the frequency of these events appreciably. Future sea-level rise scenarios significantly increase the flooding threat associated with wave events, with a nearly exponential increase in flooding days per year as sea level exceeds 0.3 to 1.0 m above current levels.",

Recent initiatives feature computational technologies to improve information extracted from data streams or model outputs and researchers’ tools for Big Data analytics. Data-centric technologies enable research communities to facilitate collaboration and increase the speed with which results are produced and published. In the future NASA anticipates more small satellites (e.g., CubeSats), mobile drones and ground-based in-situ sensors will advance the state-of-the-art regarding how scientific observations are performed, given the flexibility, cost and deployment advantages of new operations technologies. This paper reviews the success of the program and the lessons learned. Infusion of these technologies is challenging and the paper discusses the obstacles and strategies to adoption by the earth science research and application efforts.

The Total Electron Content (TEC) was collected from the International Global Positioning System (IGS) and from the Brazilian Network of Continuous Monitoring (RBMC) stations. Daytime E´B vertical drift were derived from the magnetometers located at the equatorial station Alta Floresta (9.9ºS, 55.9ºW, dip lat: 1.96º) and an off equatorial station Cuiaba (15.3ºS, 56.0ºW, dip lat: 7.10º), both in the Brazilian sector, while the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) meridional and zonal wind components were measured by the Meteor Radar located at the southern mid-latitude Santa Maria (29.4ºS, 53.3ºW, dip lat: 17.8º) station. During the SSW events the GPS-TEC data exhibit a distinctive daytime and nighttime anomaly pattern with a suppression of Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) in the afternoon and enhancement of EIA during the morning hours. TEC was also characterized by semidiurnal and large amplitude, which lasted for several days mainly in 2008 and 2009 events. For 2013 event, we identify the anomalous variation in E´B drift based on later local time migration of peak value with SSW days. A novel feature of this study is the identification of the similar migration pattern in the TEC anomaly, in spite that the simultaneous solar-flux increases during the SSW event of 2013. Other novel features are the amplification of the 13-16 day periods in the TEC anomaly during the SSW days, and simultaneous amplification of these periods in the meridional and zonal wind components in the MLT region, as far as 30o S. These aspects reveal the presence of coupled atmosphere-ionosphere dynamics during the SSW event and the amplification of the lunar and/or solar tidal component, a characteristic which is recently reported from the electrojet current measurements.",

Large ensembles are needed to best evaluate model capabilities against paleoclimate records, as well as assess uncertainties in the attribution of a regional response to a particular forcing in the presence of intrinsic variability. The CESM Last Millennium Ensemble (CESM-LME) will be used to investigate interannual to multi-centennial scale climate variations in response to natural and anthropogenic forcing.\nThe CESM-LME is performed with the Community Earth System Model (CESM with CAM5) at ~2o horizontal resolution in the atmosphere and land components and ~1oresolution in the ocean and sea-ice components. The CESM-LME is nearly completed, and consists of more than 28 simulations over the period from 850 to 2005CE. Ten members use a full-set of CMIP5/PMIP3 forcings (volcanic aerosols, solar variability, orbital variations, greenhouse gases, and land use changes). The remaining runs consist of smaller sets with single transient forcings. Two pre-industrial controls with constant forcings at 850CE and 1850CE values enable a characterization of unforced variability. Upon release on the Earth System Grid, the CESM-LME will serve as a tremendous community resource, enabling investigations into the relative roles of external forcing and intrinsic climate variability and the impact of recent anthropogenic climate forcing over natural background variability of the Common Era.\nResults presented will focus on the tropical response to the largest tropical volcanic eruptions of the last millennium: Samalas in 1257-1258, Kuwae in ~1452 and Tambora in 1815. The CESM-LME fully-forced and volcanic-only ensembles demonstrate the impact of these large volcanic eruptions on decadal scale regional climate variations, and help assess the likelihood to trigger an ENSO in the immediate aftermath of the eruption.",

Algae-based biofuels are attractive for their large oil yield potential despite decreased land use and natural-resource requirements compared to terrestrial energy crops. Important factors controlling algal-lipid productivity include temperature, nutrient availability, salinity, pH, and the light-to-biomass conversion rate. Computational approaches allow for inexpensive predictions of algae-growth kinetics for various bioreactor sizes and geometries without multiple, expensive measurement systems.\nIn this work, we parameterize our physics-based computational algae growth model for the marine Nannochloropsis oceanica and freshwater Chlorella species. We then compare modelling results with experiments conducted in identical raceway ponds at six geographical locations in the United States (Hawaii, California, Arizona, Ohio, Georgia, and Florida) and three seasons through the Algae Testbed Public Private Partnership – Unified Field Studies. Results show that the computational model effectively predicts algae growth in systems across varying environments and identifies the causes for reductions in algal productivities. The model is then used to identify improvements to the cultivation system to produce higher biomass yields.\nThis model could be used to study the effects of scale-up including the effects of predation, depth-decay of light (light extinction), and optimized nutrient and CO2 delivery. As more multifactorial data are accumulated for a variety of algal strains, the model could be used to select appropriate algal species for various geographic and climatic locations and seasons. Applying the model facilitates optimization of pond designs based on location and season.",

Here we present a compilation of 614 Δδ13C measurements on bulk terrestrial organic matter (TOM) and fossil leaves from 23 distinct records within 19 published studies that span the last 30,000 years up to the industrial revolution. To this dataset we add 2735 Δδ13C measurements made on tree ring tissue from 51 records that extend from 1950 to 2010. These records together span the ~80 ppm rise in pCO2 from the Late Glacial to through the Holocene (190-270 ppm; fossil leaves and TOM), and the ~70 ppm rise observed across the last 60 years (310-380 ppm; tree-ring tissue). We find a 2.0‰ relative increase in Δδ13C value across Termination 1 (18,000-11,500 years BP) and a 1.0‰ increase in Δδ13C value recorded in tree rings between 1950 and 2010. We use our recently developed relationship between pCO2 and Δδ13C to show that both increases in Δδ13C value exactly match, in trend and absolute magnitude, the increase in Δδ13C value we predict from our equations in response to rising pCO2 levels. These results have significance for the interpretation of terrestrial organic isotope records spanning both natural and anthropogenic pCO2 changes; we contend that environmental reconstructions based on long-term terrestrial Δδ13C records cannot be accurately interpreted until the isotope data are adjusted for known changes in pCO2 concentration.",

By off-pointing the antennas to use one of the lower power side lobes instead of the main lobe, the feed horn temperatures can be kept at a safe level while still allowing reliable communication with the spacecraft. However, the amount of telemetry that can be brought down will be highly reduced. Even so, significant science will still be possible from STEREO's unique position on the solar far side. We will discuss the science and space weather products that will be available from each STEREO instrument, when those products will be available, and how they will be used. Some data, including the regular space weather beacon products, will be brought down for an average of a few hours each day during the daily real-time passes, while the in situ and radio beacon data will be stored on the onboard recorder to provide a continuous 24-hour coverage for eventual downlink once the spacecraft is back to normal operations.",

            "abstract": "Collaborative research is growing rapidly. Many tools including IDEs are now beginning to incorporate new collaborative features. Software engineering research has shown the effectiveness of collaborative programming and analysis. In particular, drastic reduction in software development time resulting in reduced cost has been highlighted. Recently, we have witnessed the rise of applications that allow users to share their content. Most of these applications scale such collaboration using cloud technologies. Earth science research needs to adopt collaboration technologies to reduce redundancy, cut cost, expand knowledgebase, and scale research experiments. To address these needs, we developed the Earth science collaboration workbench (CWB). CWB provides researchers with various collaboration features by augmenting their existing analysis tools to minimize learning curve. During the development of the CWB, we understood that Earth science collaboration tasks are varied and we concluded that it is not possible to design a tool that serves all collaboration purposes. We adopted a mix of synchronous and asynchronous sharing methods that can be used to perform collaboration across time and location dimensions. We have used cloud technology for scaling the collaboration. Cloud has been highly utilized and valuable tool for Earth science researchers. Among other usages, cloud is used for sharing research results, Earth science data, and virtual machine images; allowing CWB to create and maintain research environments and networks to enhance collaboration between researchers. Furthermore, collaborative versioning tool, Git, is integrated into CWB for versioning of science artifacts. In this paper, we present our experience in designing and implementing the CWB. We will also discuss the integration of collaborative code development use cases for data search and discovery using NASA DAAC and simulation of satellite observations using NASA Earth Observing System Simulation Suite (NEOS3).",

Given the recent popularity of record-breaking statistics, it is important to study such correlations. To that end we employ a simple diagnostic reminiscent of a pair-correlation function to examine Historical Climatology Network monthly temperature means. Analysis of the continental United States reveals that while during the hottest years record-breaking temperatures arrive in \"heat waves\" throughout almost the entire region, this is not so for all years, not even recently. We find that record-breaking temperatures generally exhibit spatial patterns and variability quite different from those of the mean temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Economic losses due to natural hazards are estimated to be around $6-$10 billion dollars annually for the U.S. and this number keeps increasing every year. This increase has been attributed to population growth and migration to more hazard prone locations. As this trend continues, in concert with shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change, it is anticipated that losses associated with natural disasters will keep growing substantially. One of challenges disaster response and recovery analysts face is to quickly find, access and utilize a vast variety of relevant geospatial data collected by different federal agencies. More often analysts may be familiar with limited, but specific datasets and are often unaware of or unfamiliar with a large quantity of other useful resources. Finding airborne or satellite data useful to a natural disaster event often requires a time consuming search through web pages and data archives. The search process for the analyst could be made much more efficient and productive if a tool could go beyond a typical search engine and provide not just links to web sites but actual links to specific data relevant to the natural disaster, parse unstructured reports for useful information nuggets, as well as gather other related reports, summaries, news stories, and images. This presentation will describe a semantic aggregation tool developed to address similar problem for Earth Science researchers. This tool provides automated curation, and creates “Data Albums” to support case studies. The generated “Data Albums” are compiled collections of information related to a specific science topic or event, containing links to relevant data files (granules) from different instruments; tools and services for visualization and analysis; information about the event contained in news reports, and images or videos to supplement research analysis. An ontology-based relevancy-ranking algorithm drives the curation of relevant data sets for a given event. This tool is now being used to generate a catalog of case studies focusing on hurricanes and severe storms.",

            "abstract": "The Colorado Plateau is an exceptional region of high elevation, extensive canyonlands, and minor crustal deformation in the North American Cordillera. Numerous low-temperature thermochronology studies have attempted to constrain the timing and rate(s) at which this enigmatic Cenozoic landscape developed. However, such studies have struggled to robustly interpret the thermal histories of the Plateau’s rocks because most contain detrital crystals with diverse time-temperature histories that are partially reset, which confounds efforts to see clear thermochronologic signals of Cenozoic erosion. To overcome this challenge, we targeted sample collection from places on the Plateau where rock thermal histories were reset by Oligocene magmatism: the thermal aureoles of laccolith-cored Henry, La Sal, and Abajo mountains. There, shallow plutons (i.e., laccoliths) heated the late Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks ca. 26 Ma, locally resetting apatite fission track and (U-Th)/He ages so they record subsequent Miocene-Quaternary cooling. Sandstone samples from each mountain range yield single-crystal apatite He ages that vary with effective U concentration (eU). In these key samples, minimum He ages are ~5 Ma with eU <10 ppm, and maximum ages are ~25-20 Ma with eU >60 ppm. We model and interpret these age-eU patterns together with (1) stratigraphic constraints, (2) the timing of magmatic heating constrained by zircon U/Pb laccolith geochronology, and (3) the extent of resetting temperatures >100 ˚C by apatite fission track analysis. Results require prolonged sample residence in the apatite He partial retention zone (40-60 ˚C) from 25 to <10 Ma; best fit time-temperature solutions show onset of rapid cooling to surface temperatures in the Plio-Pleistocene. We interpret this as an erosional event that removed ~1.5 km at time-averaged erosion rates between 0.3 and >1 km/Myr in parts of the Henry and Abajo mountains. The Plio-Pleistocene was a time of change both regionally and globally, as Colorado River base level dropped with its final integration through the Grand Canyon ca. 5.3 Ma and global climate cooling possibly enhanced erosion rates on the Plateau’s high-relief mountain ranges. Ongoing work evaluates the relationship between the erosion of the laccolith-cored ranges and regional denudation.",

            "abstract": "The atmosphere evolved through time upon escape to space and exchange of volatile elements with the Earth's solid reservoirs (mantle, crust). We are currently investigating the composition of the ancient atmosphere by analyzing gases trapped in Archean chemical sedimentary rocks, including fluid inclusions in Archean hydrothermal quartz. The rationale of the study is that trapped noble gases, as well as nitrogen for some of the samples, represent ancient atmospheric gases that were dissolved in surface fluids (seawater, freshwater), so that their isotope compositions and elemental ratios reflect those of the Archean atmosphere at the time of trapping. Particular care was given to select samples for which fluids did not exchange significantly since the epoch of trapping. Data show that: (i) the felsic continental crust grew up mostly during the time interval 3.5-2.7 Ga ago [1]; (ii) the atmospheric nitrogen isotope composition and density were comparable to the modern one, implying the existence of a significant terrestrial magnetic field at that time [2]; (iii) Archean neon and krypton isotopic ratios were similar to their modern ones; but (iv) the xenon isotopic composition was isotopically fractionated and intermediate between those of potential cosmochemical (chondritic, solar) end-members and of the present-day atmosphere[3,4]. These differences are attributed to different ionization efficiencies for atmospheric species, and subsequent escape to space for Xe [3-5]. Together with the constant Ne, Kr and N isotope compositions, they shed strong constraints on the nature of the solar UV flux 1Ga after Earth's formation. [1] Pujol. M. et al.

            "abstract": "The dynamic processes operating within crustal magma reservoirs control many aspects of the chemical composition of erupted magmas, and crystals in volcanic rocks can provide a temporally-constrained archive of these changing environments. A new compilation of 238U-230Th ages of accessory phases and 238U-230Th-226Ra ages of bulk mineral separates of major phases documents that crystals in individual samples often have ages spanning most of the history of a volcanic center. Somewhat surprisingly, this observation holds for surface analyses as well as interior analyses, indicating that the latest stages of growth took place at different times for different grains. Nevertheless, average ages of surfaces are younger than interiors (as expected), and the dominant surface age population is often within error of eruption age. In contrast to accessory phase ages, less than half of the bulk separate 238U-230Th-226Ra ages for major phases are more than 10 kyr older than eruption. This suggests that major phases may in general reflect a later stage of development of an eruptible magma body than do accessory phases, or that the extent of discordance between ages of major and accessory phases reflects the extent to which a crystal mush was remobilized during processes leading to eruption. Crystal ages are most useful for illuminating magmatic processes when combined with crystal-scale trace-element or isotopic data, and I will present several case studies where such combined data sets exist. For example, at Yellowstone and at Okataina Caldera Complex, New Zealand, the combination zircon surface and interior analyses (of age, Hf isotopic, and trace-element data) with bulk dating and in-situ trace-element and isotopic compositions of feldspar allows a comparison of the early history of storage in a crystal mush with the later history of melt extraction and further crystallization prior to eruption, thus tracking development of erupted magma bodies from storage through eruption.",

Many physical processes of varying spatial and temporal scales are contained within these hybrid systems models. The need to aggregate and simplify system components has been recognised for reasons of parsimony and comprehensibility; and the use of probabilistic methods for modelling water-related risks also prompts the need to seek computationally efficient up-scaled conceptualisations. How to manage the up-scaling errors in such hybrid systems models has not been well-explored, compared to research in the hydrological process domain. Particular challenges include the non-linearity introduced by decision thresholds and non-linear relations between water use, water quality, and discharge strategies. Using a case study of a mining region, we explore the nature of up-scaling errors in water use, water quality and discharge, and we illustrate an approach to identification of a scale-adjusted model including an error model. Ways forward for efficient modelling of such complex, hybrid systems are discussed, including interactions with human, energy and carbon systems models.",

Using newly available Van Allen Probes wave data, which provide extensive coverage in the entire inner magnetosphere, we evaluate the global distribution of hiss wave frequency spectrum and wave intensity categorized by various levels of geomagnetic activity. Our statistical results show that observed hiss peak wave frequencies are generally significantly lower than the previously adopted value (~550 Hz) and hiss wave intensity frequently extends below 100 Hz, which is the previously adopted lower-cutoff frequency, particularly at larger L-shells (> 4) on the dayside. We also evaluate the electron lifetime caused by hiss-driven pitch angle scattering based on the new hiss frequency spectrum observed by Van Allen Probes and the previously adopted hiss wave model, and find that the difference in electron lifetime is energy dependent and could be up to a factor of ~5. Finally, we discuss the importance of incorporating a realistic hiss wave spectrum into quantification of hiss-driven electron precipitation loss.",

This presentation examines how such holistic community approaches, reflected in design and practice, can be applied to contemporary issues of energy and housing in a rapidly changing climate.\nThe Indigenous Peoples of the Great Plains seek to utilize the latest scientific climate modeling to support the development of large, utility scale distributed renewable energy projects and to re-invigorate an indigenous housing concept of straw bale construction, originating in this region.\nIn the energy context, we explore the potential for the development of an intertribal wind energy dynamo on the Great Plains, utilizing elements of existing federal policies for Indian energy development and existing federal infrastructure initially created to serve hydropower resources, which may be significantly altered under current and prospective drought scenarios. For housing, we consider the opportunity to address the built environment in Indian Country, where Tribes have greater control as it consists largely of residences needed for their growing populations. Straw bale construction allows for greater use of local natural and renewable materials in a strategy for preparedness for the weather extremes and insurance perils already common to the region, provides solutions to chronic unemployment and increasing energy costs, while offering greater affordable comfort in both low and high temperature extremes.\nThe development of large utility scale distributed wind gives greater systemwide flexibility to incorporate renewables and the communal construction techniques associated with straw bale housing puts high-performance shelter back into the hands of the community. Creative and distributed experimentation can result in more graceful failures forward.",
